<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The potter's characterization is deeply embodied and consistent, with micro-choices (kneeling, measured breath, open hands) revealing a hierarchy of values. Her final stance of "not insisting" is earned by prior causality, and the cost of her renunciation is felt in the quiet endurance of the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through a decisive cadence shift from observation to action ("So she gave small lights"). Closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final image of the "shawl of times" reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining every choice and charging the final image. The oasis, troughs, and hives are rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail filtered through the POV. The lantern glass and clay are micro-settings that actively shape the narrative's outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, meaningful intensification from passive observation to active, costly intervention ("the last of her water"). The dominant stake (understanding/restoring place) is tested and reweighted through this deliberate choice, with the cost of her expended resources legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges flawlessly from concrete action and image, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question through the final realization about "steady tenderness," which reweights all prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic prose that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (the nature of the timelines) is taught and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for a potential overwriting risk in the peak beat describing the three threads, though the imagery remains coherent and does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of zen philosophy, phototropism, and fractured timelines is original, specific, and feels inevitable in hindsight. The conceptual risk-taking heightens stakes and coherence, fully committing to its premise without gimmickry.</comment>
