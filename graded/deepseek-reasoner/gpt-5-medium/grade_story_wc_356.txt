<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("inhaled until my eyes watered"). Micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values, and the final stewardship shift is earned by prior causality. The olfactory sensitivity trait is fully integrated, not a label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost ("shoulders dropping," "nervous hymns" replaced). The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through sensory density and pattern breaks. The persistent constraint of village unrest shapes tactics and the final image of equilibrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The treetop village is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices and constrains action ("bridges had begun trembling"). The corpse flower and journal are recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the herbalist's professional POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a single meaningful deepening as the flower's growth reweights the dominant stake of village serenity. The cost is legible on the page in the villagers' flinch and subsequent steadying.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of finding serenity in motion through the image of "equilibrium." Theme emerges from events and images (rot as a road to balance) without moralizing. The final reconfiguration reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with olfactory-driven narration. POV is stable and voice-motivated non-standard grammar ("olfactorily sensitive") is consistent and legible. Purposeful compression in lyric mode is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Some risk of overwriting in peak beats ("feral and cavernous," "truths had teeth"), but figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Rhythm controls pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>A specific, non-obvious synthesis of concepts (serenity within motion, wisdom in rot) feels inevitable. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, particular detail rather than template plotting.</comment>
