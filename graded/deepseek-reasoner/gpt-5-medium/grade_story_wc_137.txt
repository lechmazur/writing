<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's skepticism and kindness are embodied through micro-choices (offering tea, aligning tile) that intensify under pressure. Final stance shift from disbelief to belief is earned through concrete interaction with Lio, with visible cost in shared grief. Internal contradiction ("sympathetic skeptic") acts simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterns (whale spirals, ink drawings, numbers) deepen toward resonant reconfiguration (the room with two chairs). Closure lands on-page with felt cost ("our griefs exchanged coats"). Orientation is clear within 120 words; tile's mechanics are taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Tower and tile function as micro-settings that constrain choices (aligning corners to whale road) and charge the final image (table with two chairs). Sensory details (sea breath, tiny salts, spume) are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV's professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's agency under accumulative lens: decision to use tile with Lio tightens options and deepens stakes. Cost is legible in emotional exchange and shared vulnerability. One meaningful deepening suffices for length; persistent constraint of skepticism shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of entangled memories emerges through particulars (shell's whorl mirroring constellation, ink like ship's wake) without moralizing. Ending offers non-literal answer through the image of the room, reweighting prior material. Avoids diagnostic label-speak; subtext operates in silence and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with lyrical yet precise diction ("stargazer's open tower, a stone rib cage"). POV stable; elision (how tile works) is taught and paid off. Dialogue natural and goal-driven (Lio's question); internal voice coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Zero loops or scaffold; high information density with prose doing multiple jobs ("silence poured; yet in that silence, the pages stoutly rustled"). Figurative language consistent and purposeful; rhythm varies naturally. No artifacts in peak beats; closure image clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of magic square, whale migration, and archival work feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical abstraction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transforms tropes (skeptic's journey) through specific grounded choices. No derivative echoes; singular artistic stance.</comment>
