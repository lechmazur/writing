<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Negotiator's interiority is concrete and embodied ("operative gentleness" as a trained skill). Micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values, particularly when addressing the children. Final renunciation ("heavier than steel") earned through prior causality. Contradictory impulses (gentleness/weight) act simultaneously in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the bowl of casings becoming "witness rather than prophecy." Orientation is immediate and functional. Persistent constraint of ritual shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The terrace setting actively pressures choices and supplies resources (bowl, casings, herbs). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through POV. The ebony clipboard and bowl of casings are recurring objects that constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, using ritual to deepen stakes. Cost is legible in the general's admission of being "tired of victories that returned as funerals." A single meaningful tightening occurs through the shared drafting of "breathing."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central conflict and imagery (ritual, work, use). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: redemption is priced by "how we feed tomorrow." Avoids moralizing; the final image of the child tracing cracks forward embodies the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("ritual gives nerves a corridor"). POV is stable and consistent. Purposeful elision (the specific terms of the agreement) is taught and pays off, focusing on the process over the product. No head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity ("agreements clipped like folded wings"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Rhythm modulates effectively with the scene's pressure, particularly in the final paragraphs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of ritual and political negotiation feels fresh and inevitable. The concept is fully committed to and followed through its implications. The perspective is memorable and specific, avoiding stock metaphors or template plots. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure heightens stakes.</comment>
