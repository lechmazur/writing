<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with strong micro-choices like the violinist explaining her purpose to Lark. Motivation is clear and deepens, though the initial drive to "unbind the silence" feels slightly abstract until grounded by the later exchange. The final choice to "practice magnificent simplicity" is an Earned Stasis with a visible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final image of footprints as "a song that refuses to be done," which reconfigures the central concept of the unfinished with undeniable conceptual cost. The pattern of gathering, playing, and storytelling coheres into a single, meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse is an indispensable, micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("brackish light," "rusted flanks like hedges"). The environment is fully integrated into action and consistently evolves, pressuring the characters' gathering and shaping the story's tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification: the gathering and storytelling reweight the dominant stake of finding beauty in the unfinished. The cost is legible in the final commitment to "tend them with music and names," which forecloses the path of passive mourning. Agency is demonstrated through the violinist's renunciation and the community's collective endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The theme of finding beauty in the unfinished emerges entirely through events, images, and implication, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image and the group's decision, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The core concept is integrated with profound specificity and emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature ("fruit deciding whether to be sweet again"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught and paid off at closure. The dialogue with Lark is natural, goal-driven, and carries significant subtext that advances the thematic core.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. There is a minor tendency toward dense figurative language in some beats (e.g., "barnacles hold their breath"), but it remains coherent and serves the accumulative mode. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure cause/effect or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-ecological, melancholic world with a lyric narrative voice feels fresh and organic. The core concept of a "chronic hush" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and setting. The piece commits fully to its premise, resulting in a singular and memorable artistic stance.</comment>
