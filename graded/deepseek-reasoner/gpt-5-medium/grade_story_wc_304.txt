<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in the mortician's trained hands and listening heart. The final choice to capture a spark is earned by prior causality—her mentor's teachings and their shared history—with visible cost in the chip's dimming and the narrator feeling "unshaken and remade." Micro-choices under pressure, like speaking names and tuning the radio, reveal a hierarchy of values centered on care and legacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the final image of the captured spark reconfiguring the meaning of loss and legacy. Cost is legible on the page in the chip dimming "as if exhausted" and the narrator's feeling of being "remade." The lens holds: pressure accumulates through sensory density and emotional intensity, culminating in a cadence shift at the vision of shared memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are indispensable, constraining choice by isolating the ritual and charging the final image with transformative light. The emerald chip functions as a micro-setting, its use and state directly affecting the outcome. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV's professional and emotional priorities (e.g., "stone holds a pulse").</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens, through the deliberate ritual acts that deepen emotional and sensory pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the chip's expenditure and the narrator's altered state. The dominant stake—capturing a final essence of the mentor—is signaled early and tightens through the radio tuning and vision, foreclosing other paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to hold grace in grief, reweighting prior material through the image of the captured spark and the shared vision. Theme emerges organically from events and images, resisting moralizing. The core concept of "a threshold of stillness" is integrated through specific, earned insights.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the mortician's profession and grief. Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, modulating with emotional intensity without losing coherence. Lyric compression is taught early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle or artifact. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "the air itself seemed to kneel in a radiant hush"). No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>The fusion of mortuary science with auroral mysticism is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emerald chip and its mechanics are uniquely specific and irreplaceable. Emotional truth and human complexity are paramount.</comment>
