<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear, rooted in maternal guilt, and intensifies compellingly. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("throat closed again around that peculiar beauty"). The final choice (atonement) is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with undeniable cost ("I would unfasten every future knot with both hands"). Orientation is immediate; the pattern of loss and atonement is taught early and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The glade setting actively pressures choices and supplies resources (lantern insects, frost-petaled grasses). The saucer and tablecloth function as micro-settings that constrain choice and decisively charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens; the ritual of confession is a decisive intensification. Cost is legible and felt throughout, particularly in the chamber of stalled seconds and the final image of the "cloudbound repentance."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The theme of lost time and atonement emerges organically from events and images. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. The final image of carrying repentance home "like milk" is profoundly effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet grounded in the character's specific worldview. Any elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("time ran like milk down the clockface"). A minor register drift in "choking beauty" prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of cartomancy and motherhood feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices and bold risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
