<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply rooted, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure (e.g., unopened telegram, setting clock to Mara's dawn). Final choice to witness is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the shared weight of sorrow. Contradictory impulses act in scene, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where shared witnessing reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost ("they carried some weight from it together"). Orientation is immediate; pattern of variable stars and temple decoding is taught early and pays off. No causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constrains choice (observatory tools shape tactics), charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (e.g., "domes clicked as gears corrected drift"). The daylily and telegram function as micro-settings that evolve meaning. No generic or static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible on the page (shared burden of sorrow). Dominant stake (decoding/understanding) tightens through the collaborative reading, narrowing options and deepening knowledge. No coincidence or undeveloped pressures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars (mirror-story, shared burdens) and offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in implication (e.g., "healing travels fastest by ordinary words"). Final image reweights prior material with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature. Diction and syntax reflect the chronicler's voice ("ink-stained and awake"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven (Mara's fierce urgency). Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite but slightly dense in peak beats (e.g., "flux became syllable, magnitude a verb" risks minor abstraction). Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with high information density. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful. Minor deduction for density in high-pressure moment.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of celestial mapping and emotional witness. Tropes are transformed through specific grounded choices (variable stars as grammar). Risk-taking in lyric-prose heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Feels inevitable in hindsight, with high irreplaceability.</comment>
