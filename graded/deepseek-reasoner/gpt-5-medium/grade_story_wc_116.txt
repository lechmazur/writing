<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is profound and embodied, with the keeper's vow of non-judgment tested by the flood and the regenerative silence. The final micro-choice to "grip the pen lightly" is earned by prior causality, showing a visible cost in his loosened judgments. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously, as seen when he records the mushroom-altered alphabet without protest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>An accumulative/textural lens holds, building pressure through density and cadence shifts. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as the keeper's stance crystallizes, his judgments loosening "like old laces" with a felt cost. The final image of the silence as a "thin, durable thread" reweights the premise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is indispensable, constraining choices and charging the final image. The obsidian refuge and origami swan are not just described but actively used for navigation and survival. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through the keeper's unique perception, as with "ink ferments" and "silence is not absence but compost."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by the river's growl and flood, forcing the keeper to use the swan and retreat to the obsidian refuge. This meaningful tightening narrows his options and tests his oath, with the cost legible as he presses his shoulder to mortar and waits for the flood to pass. Agency is demonstrated through his endured attention and renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges impeccably from image and event, particularly the concept of "regenerative silence" which is dramatized, not stated. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of witnessing change, reweighting prior material through the final image of the silence as a thread. Avoids moralizing completely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature rooted in the keeper's worldview. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, from the dense, mossy opening to the spare, resonant final lines. Purposeful elision (e.g., the swan's exact mechanics) is taught and paid off, enhancing the mystical tone without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is masterful with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor figurative strain occurs with "patient jaw of time," but it does not harm closure. There is no scaffold or loop; every sentence advances atmosphere or story. Read-aloud rhythm is superb, varying naturally with the scene's needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of concepts (library, silence, origami navigation) feels inevitable and wholly organic. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on witnessing change. Risk-taking in the lyrical, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence, with the closure effect remaining perfectly legible.</comment>
