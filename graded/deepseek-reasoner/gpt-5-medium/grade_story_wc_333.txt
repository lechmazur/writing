<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion in the hair memory scene. The locksmith's enigmatic presence applies catalytic pressure without over-explanation. Final choice to sing feels earned by prior causality with visible cost in the warmed tongue image. Minor deduction for "stodgy sentinel" phrasing bordering on diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strong with pattern breaks (mirror alignment) and cadence shift (song) reweighting the stake. Closure is resonant reconfiguration: the idea of return walks free with conceptual cost in the ribbon's lightening. Orientation anchors early; courtyard sequence teaches its pattern and pays off at closure with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Broken mirror courtyard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image through alignment mechanics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mirrors showed me not my face but the rooms where I had hid my wanting"). Spatial choreography coherent; environment evolves causally with the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: speaking the promise as feeling, holding the hair, and finally singing. Cost is legible in the tongue warming and the ribbon lightening. Single meaningful deepening (song breaking fear's guard) sufficient for length; tight causal linkage to prior beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars (hair, mirrors, song) without moralizing. Ending offers resonant non-literal answer: freed idea of return warms the tongue rather than stating resolution. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures (locksmith bowing to ribbon) and imagery (fog in jar).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent lyrical compression ("walking across the hush of cosmic possibility like river stones"). POV stable; elision taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue minimal but functional; locksmith's speech carries weight through omission. Minor register elevation in "cosmic possibility" but voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught. One minor phrasing issue ("stodgy sentinel" feels slightly diagnostic) but doesn't obscure closure. Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings avoid template patterns. Read-aloud test passes with musicality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis of metaphysical concept with concrete ritual. Risk-taking in accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation of locksmith trope into ideological keymaster feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity anchors universals; no template plot echoes.</comment>
