<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion and micro-choices under pressure. The narrator's contradictory impulses—to confess yet hold the truth—are dramatized in scene, not summarized. The final choice to speak the truth aloud is earned by the oracle's guidance and the escalating pressure of the storm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure building through image density and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the final image of the folded gentian reweights the premise with conceptual cost. The cost is legible in the final line: "a compass of auroral sorrow." Orientation is clear by ~120 words.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The weather station functions as a micro-setting that pressures choice and charges the final image. The barometer, anemometer, and scale are integrated into action and constrain tactics. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully reflects the narrator's urgency and the oracle's professional priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the storm's arrival and the oracle's tests forcing a stance crystallization. The dominant stake (weighing the truth) tightens through a meaningful cadence shift during the confession. The cost is felt in the release of tension at the scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly from events and images, resisting tidy morals. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of carrying truth, reweighting prior material without stating a moral. The gentian's smudge becomes a map, a conceptual repricing with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The oracle's dialogue carries subtext and advances the plot ("a fault-tolerant oracle"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is highly lyrical with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction (-0.2) for figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "auroral sorrow," "small stone star") which, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediacy. No loops, scaffold, or coherence issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of oracle, weather station, and swallowed truth feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept ("swaying certainties") is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A specific, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>
