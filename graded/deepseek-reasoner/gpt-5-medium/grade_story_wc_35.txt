<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with micro-choices revealing values hierarchy. The final decision to cook the coral is earned through prior causality, and the keeper's memory revelation provides embodied cost. Minor deduction for slightly diagnostic language in "emotionally contagious" exposition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strong with pattern-based escalation through puddle reading and coral interaction. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost in keeper's transformed posture. Coral filament touch serves as decisive turning point that reconfigures options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choices throughout and charges the final image. The desert fortress, puddles, and coral pavilion all pressure tactics and decisions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with weather affecting action. The coral itself functions as micro-setting that alters the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with coral contact serving as meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in the keeper's memory revelation and transformed bearing. The emotional contagion trait creates genuine constraints that narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through transformation of memory rather than erasure. The ending offers resonant non-literal answer through cooking metaphor. Subtext operates powerfully in images like "sandpaper rough memories" and the coral's archival function.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with consistent POV filtering. Lyric compression is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Syntax reflects the chef's professional perception without register drift. Dialogue is minimal but serves action when present.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language. Minor deduction for occasional dense metaphors that slightly slow momentum ("mouth full of borrowed thunder"). Otherwise excellent rhythmic control and sentence-level propulsion toward closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional synthesis of magical realism and emotional transformation. The coral pavilion concept is both original and indispensable. Risk-taking with poetic compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
