<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nessa's dual allegiance and orderly intuition are embodied in her micro-choices, like stamping the pact with her chip. Her final stance—teaching the consortium their grammar—is an earned endurance that forecloses simple victory with a visible cost of ongoing negotiation. The brother's internal conflict is a sharp, secondary pressure. A slight diagnostic tone in "prosperity without memory was just a new accounting of hunger" prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); the realigned rafts and brother's touch create a ceasefire that reconfigures options without resolving the central conflict, with cost felt in the "bought us only a season" concession. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building pressure through layered imagery of flow and control. The final image of dancing between shores is a perfect, cost-weighted crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The raft city is a character that constrains and enables every choice. The setting pressures tactics (graffiti codes, realigning rafts) and charges the final image with the "salt and scales" mingling. Sensory detail is purposefully selective and filtered through Nessa's professional perception, from the "tents breathed like lungs" to the "diplomatic gray" fences.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: Nessa's offer to the liaison and subsequent realignment of the rafts is a decisive, costly tightening that narrows options to a temporary truce. The dominant stake of cultural survival is tested and deepened, not solved, with the cost of a mere season's reprieve legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "navigating gentrification," resisting tidy resolution for a complex, earned harmony. The final image of a future that "would not sell the past without buying our consent" is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire narrative. Subtext operates powerfully in the color-coded messages and the brother's torn silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a percussive, analytical rhythm ("I think in loops and ledgers") that modulates under pressure without losing its texture. The first-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Nessa's specific worldview. The single line of dialogue is sharp, goal-driven, and perfectly in character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high momentum, though occasional moments of high figurative density ("a bright ribbon knotted over dark water") slightly slow readability. There is no scaffolding or looping. The closure beat is crystal clear. A minor register drift in "orderly intuitive" feels slightly label-like, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a perpetual carnival on a raft city with the conflict of encoded resistance is brilliantly original and feels inevitable. The core concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded choices in character and world. The solution—reorganizing currents rather than fighting—is a fresh, non-obvious angle on a familiar conflict.</comment>
