<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation ("fold grief into origami cranes") is clear, rooted in specific loss, and intensifies under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character-particular, shown through gem polishing and steam-bent cranes. The final choice to release the lanterns is earned by prior causality, with visible cost ("the ache no longer drags"). Minor deduction for a slight abstraction in "luminous torment" which feels more diagnostic than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through layered imagery and a single meaningful cadence shift at the climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the shadow's touch reconfigures the relationship to grief without full return. Cost is legible on-page: "It does not return to him, but it loosens." Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden and glass basilica are indispensable, actively constraining choice (the "descends while ascending" stairs) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action ("the sun rings are tuned by passing clouds"). The environment functions as a crucible, pressuring the protagonist's craft and ultimate release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the deepening process of gem polishing and crane-making. The dominant stake (reconciling with his shadow) tightens meaningfully with the lantern release. Cost is unmistakable: the messages transform "into change" and the ache loosens. A single, potent intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme of grief transformed through craft emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: reconciliation is partial ("It does not return to him") but transformative. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, like the shadow's touch being made of "shade and tea mist." Avoids moralizing entirely.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control are maintained throughout. The poetic, dense syntax is voice-motivated and pattern-taught, reflecting the lantern maker's meticulous craft. POV is stable and deeply filtered through his professional lens. Minor deduction for a few densely metaphorical sentences that slightly challenge immediacy under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and purposeful variation in rhythm. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat: "seeding his lungs with color" slightly strains the physical logic established elsewhere. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure but prevents a 9+ score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of grief, craft, and magic. The core premise—using dream-recording lanterns to fold grief into origami cranes—is wholly unique and fully committed to. The combination feels organic and inevitable, not a checklist. Risk-taking in the poetic, accumulative structure heightens stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
