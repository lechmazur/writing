<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final confrontation shows credible endurance with visible cost. Interiority is character-particular without diagnostic speech.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the protagonist leaves the label as "verdict," reconfiguring power dynamics with undeniable cost. Orientation is immediate and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting actively constrains choices and charges the final image. The shipping container labyrinth and poison label are tactile, purpose-driven elements that shape tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation driven by protagonist's accumulation of fragments under Accumulative lens. The confrontation tightens options and forces a trade-off with visible cost. Pressure coheres through the gathering of evidence and final stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of erased histories emerges through concrete particulars without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the charged image of the label-as-verdict. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with exceptional rhythmic control. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with purposeful compression and patterned diction that pays off at closure. POV stability and psychic distance are masterfully handled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clear propulsion. Minor figurative strain in "fingertips taste bitter" slightly muddles peak beat, but overall syntax and rhythm serve scene needs effectively. No loops or scaffold issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of familiar elements feels inevitable. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity anchors universal themes through unique perspective and setting.</comment>
