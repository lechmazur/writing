<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("the donor heart answer in triple time"). Micro-choices under pressure (adjusting the wing, brewing indigo steam) reveal a hierarchy of values. The final renunciation—choosing a posture of holding stories without bruising them—is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds, building density through pattern and cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the narrator's understanding crystallizes into a new stance. Cost is legible on the page in the image of the widow attracting "borrowed tales that can burn." Orientation is immediate and functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The floating tea house and blue morpho wing are micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful ("the house bobbed as if curtsying"). The environment is fully integrated into action and thought, shaping the protagonist's tactics and the story's closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from observation to active intervention with the wing and steam. A single meaningful deepening occurs as the narrator tests their understanding, forcing a trade-off that protects the widow. The cost of this choice—and the risk of borrowed tales—is unmistakable on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</comment><comment>Theme emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: "magnetism was not greed but posture." The core concept of "iridescent caution" is fully integrated, shaping stakes and tactics. The ending offers a profound reweighting of prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. The voice is consistently poetic yet precise, modulating with emotional intensity. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is exquisite, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle. Minor overwriting risk in peak beats ("valley-mist wonder") is mitigated by pattern-teaching and payoff. No loops, scaffold, or artifactual issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a donor heart, dye mastery, and story magnetism is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on familiar material. Risk-taking in structure and voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. A fully integrated, singular artistic stance.</comment>
