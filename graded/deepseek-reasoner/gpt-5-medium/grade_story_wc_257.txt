<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("the metal would not take a polish"). The final choice to become a "tutor of endings" is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the quiet, enduring image of waiting. Contradictory impulses of grief and purpose act simultaneously throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through layered images and a cadence shift into ritual. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final image of the faintly glowing lily, with cost legible in the narrator's enduring watch. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The observatory functions as a micro-setting that profoundly constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and fully integrated into action ("the planetarium mechanism woke with a tremor"). The projector and stencil are key objects that shape the entire narrative arc.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is a decisive intensification, moving from personal grief to communal ritual. The dominant stake (learning to carry grief) is reweighted with visible cost as the narrator helps others, their agency crystallizing in the act of teaching "withering to bloom again."</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from event and image, not statement. The final lines offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of grief, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The concept of "intention" is explored with profound complexity and ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and impeccable rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistent, lyrical, and deeply characterized, with purposeful elision and compression that pays off at closure. POV is stable and apt, filtering the world through a jeweler's precise eye.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Exceptional line-level craft with high information density and zero artifacts. Prose is lucid, propulsive, and poetic without ever obscuring clarity. Figurative language is consistent, coherent, and deeply integrated ("Light found dust like a river finds silt"). Sentence-level rhythm is flawless.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A singularly original synthesis of grief, astronomy, and craft that feels inevitable in hindsight. The core premise is fresh and fully committed to, with bold risk-taking in its lyrical, accumulative structure that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No echoes of tired templates.</comment>
