<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Characterization is deeply embodied and specific, with micro-choices (arranging fruit, knotting the rope) revealing a hierarchy of values. The motivation—coherence over reunion—is clear and intensifies under pressure, culminating in a credible Earned Stasis. The sister's memory is a concrete, character-particular anchor that avoids diagnostic label-speak. A hairline deduction for a minor abstraction ("ambiguous loss") in backstory, but it tilts the present stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the theorem realization, with cost legible in the final image ("a theorem he cannot solve but can carry"). Orientation is slightly delayed but functional, serving the disorienting, mythic tone. One minor causality question: the rope's physical logistics are lightly sketched, but this does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is indispensable, constraining choice (stalactite as anchor, mineral fruit as tool) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV (e.g., "fruit glistening like cooled tears"). Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves with the emotional arc. No artifacts.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful deepening via the mosaic's "shifting proof." Cost is felt in the final renunciation ("hinges stop squealing"). A minor deduction: the rope-tying beat, while inventive, slightly softens the pressure by introducing a new tactile action late, though it pays off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and actions (e.g., the glass eyes as "ledger"). The final theorem offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext is rich in implication ("doorways shaped like soft refusals"). No thematic echo or summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive signature ("mathematics of emotion"). Diction is consistently poetic yet character-bound. Elision (e.g., the sister's fate) is taught and paid off. A single filter verb ("he feels") in a peak beat causes a hairline deduction, but immediacy is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences ("He remembers his sister... The laugh survives") but does not obscure closure. One mixed metaphor ("moon lowered a rope of light") is voice-motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>A fresh, non-obvious synthesis of grief and mathematics feels inevitable. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The core premise is transformed through grounded, specific detail (e.g., the mosaic's "chipped geometry"). No derivative or template elements.</comment>
