<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure; "analytically artistic" trait is embodied in choices like tracing pavement cracks and folding maps to lose borders. Final renunciation is earned through prior causality, with visible cost in confronting disappointed faces. Embodied emotion avoids diagnostic speak, though some interiority borders on abstract ("trembling certainty").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as protagonist transforms by hanging unsaid words as lanterns and promising kinder routes. Cost is legible in bowing to disappointed faces. Pattern-based escalation through arrows, punch clicks, and constellation dots coheres without causality breaks. Orientation is clear by line 2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting functions as micro-setting: pavement cracks form arrows guiding choice, starlit vault charges the final image, and depot/train constrain tactics. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("smelled of chalk, rain, and something like thunder"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: tracing arrows, using punch, and folding maps progressively tighten options. Cost is felt in confronting omissions and avoided conversations. Dominant stake (finding fortress) is signaled early and tested through pattern-based pressure. One meaningful deepening (constellations resolving into ramparts) suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through patterns, maps, and unsaid words; ending offers resonant non-literal answer via lantern-hanging and promised kinder routes. Subtext operates in images (punch clipping silence, maps losing borders). Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in braided invitations and unresolved faces.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control ("clicks gathered like rails, and rails gathered like promises"). POV is stable and voice-consistent; elision (e.g., train motion) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but functional (conductor's question). Syntax reflects focalizer's analytical artistry under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense and poetic but purposeful; figurative language supports pattern-building. Minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("I pressed... I stepped") causes slight momentum drag. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Read-aloud rhythm varies effectively; closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Original synthesis of cartography and surreal journey feels inevitable; risk-taking in accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity (phantom punch, pavement arrows) avoids tropes. Transformation test passed: emotional arc is inseparable from setting and voice.</comment>
