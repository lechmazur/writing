<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent, with embodied interiority ("my hands trembled with the weight of tiny vows"). The final realization about houses living on "almosts" feels earned through the three tests, with visible cost in the stove's "absolution" and the returned beetle tin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pattern through three house visits toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The final insight reweights the premise with cost. Minor deduction as the lens isn't explicitly taught until the pattern is established, though closure lands perfectly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Setting is active and constraining: the bay "slurred pebbles," houses have "shutters stiff as bitten lips." The orris root and displaced objects function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through three tests of the method, each deepening the inquiry. The third house provides the decisive tightening where agency (returning the tin) forces the revelation. Cost is legible in the trembling hands and the house's inhalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the investigation, culminating in the profound final insight about "almosts" and "inadvertent ritual." No moralizing; the answer is earned through concrete particulars and reweights all prior material without statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Exceptional voice control with distinct perceptual signature ("a creeping normality noticer"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure while maintaining consistency. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic variation. Minor deduction for occasional dense figurative clusters ("like a child explaining why the sky needs somewhere to sleep") that briefly slow momentum, though they remain coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Highly original concept executed with full commitment. The synthesis of domestic magic realism, forensic attention, and emotional archaeology feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
