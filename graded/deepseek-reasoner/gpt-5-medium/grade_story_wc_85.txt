<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's guilt is embodied and specific, driving micro-choices like kneeling to search the shore. Contradictory impulses (protection vs. cowardice) act simultaneously. Final renunciation of the lies is earned by the causal revelation of the fifth plank, with visible cost in the breath breaking and the offer to burn archives. Mara's tempered regret is a credible, non-stock reaction that deepens the protagonist's flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Causal drive lens holds: the search for planks is a therefore linkage from the terrace confrontation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as they agree to "seed the city with memory that does not bruise," foreclosing the path of forgery with the cost of the burned archives and the kept page. The fifth plank is the decisive change, reconfiguring knowledge and relationship. Orientation is slightly delayed but functional, teaching the pattern of poetic disorientation that pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and Parliament of Wood shore are micro-settings that pressure choices and charge the final image. The terrace's "sieved hush" and the shore's "archive" of driftwood constrain the search and revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("gulls stitched small commas," "tide leaves minutes"). The watch hand, a key object, is "alight with wet dusk" and decisively charges the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weight of withheld truth) escalates causally through the plank discoveries, each narrowing options and changing knowledge. The fourth and fifth planks force the protagonist's confession, a decisive tightening. Cost is legible in the breath breaking and the burning of archives. Agency is active in the search and unmaking, driven by the protagonist's compelled need for origins.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory's cost and authenticity emerges through concrete particulars (forged planks, watch hand) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Belief, like time, can lose a hand and still point to what remains." Subtext operates in gesture and silence ("traded breath the way misers trade pennies"). The core concept of manufactured lineage integrates fully with the thematic exploration of guilt and truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled lyrical compression ("sea breathing like a tired archivist"). POV is stable and deeply embodied, filtering the world through the genealogist's professional lens ("trade salts every hour"). Dialogue is sparse but potent ("You invented me" lands with subtext and weight). Purposeful elision (the exact scandal) is taught and paid off by the plank revelations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>High information density with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("padded silence with needles inside"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the search and breathing at the end. Syntax supports emotional pressure ("My breath broke; I had been deep in the story all along"). No artifacts obscure causality or closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of black market genealogy with coastal archive mythos. The watch hand and driftwood ledger are highly specific and irreplaceable. Emotional truth avoids generic templates, grounded in the particular cost of "therapeutic suggestion." Risk-taking in lyrical compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
