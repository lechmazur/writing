<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear, rooted in a consistent trait ("calmly inventive") and a maternal legacy. Micro-choices under pressure, like using the quill holder to quiet the locks, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final stance ("guarding consent instead of fear") is an Earned Stasis with a visible cost, though the transition with Captain Rhun feels slightly swift, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the fort's purpose is reconfigured from "spectacle to hearth." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pressure escalating through the blackout and Rhun's arrival. Cost is legible in the final image of the town discovering its shadows. The sundial's coded mechanics are a minor causality soft spot, but they do not break the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is a masterclass in micro-specificity that constrains choice and charges the final image. The "cradle of sparks," the corridors tasting of "iron and rain," and the fort itself are tactile, purpose-driven details woven into action. The environment is the central crucible of the conflict, directly shaping tactics and the story's resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates cleanly through the blackout, the meeting with Fara, and Rhun's confrontation. The dominant stake (shifting the fort's nature) is tested and paid for on the page. The cost is felt in the final, softer darkness and the protagonist's altered post. A single, meaningful tightening is achieved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from potent, recurring images ("consent of doors," "cradle of sparks") rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of control vs. consent. The final lines ("speech will travel by hearthglow and patient angles") avoid moralizing, achieving earned thematic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistently maintained, with a poetic, precise perceptual signature ("hinges breathe a winking hush"). POV is stable and deeply filtered through the sentinel's consciousness. Occasional moments of high figurative density ("Fara laughs, and it sounds like a key discovering a pocket it likes") slightly strain the voice's grounded texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a pattern of dense figurative language clusters in high-pressure beats ("lanterns pretend to sleep," "heavy as a whisper kept too long") creates minor momentum drag. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure but prevents a top-tier score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The core concept of a "silent revolution" enacted through the manipulation of light and machinery is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The combination of a lock sentinel, a bronze quill holder, and a "cradle of sparks" feels organic and indispensable to the narrative's logic and emotional truth. The story commits fully to its unique premise.</comment>
