<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and deeply embodied through professional precision and emotional vulnerability. The final choice to witness rather than repair is earned by prior micro-choices like handling the program with "custody and care." Contradictory impulses of stoicism and sensitivity act simultaneously throughout, culminating in a credible endurance with visible cost ("I wait for the moment when what is gone accepts my witness without shame").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through layered imagery and reflective depth rather than causal turns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final paragraph, where the protagonist's stance crystallizes into acceptance, reweighting the work's purpose with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate and purposeful; the pattern of "measuring, mending, and Placing notes" tightens meaningfully toward the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion functions as a crucible that constrains every choice, from navigating its spaces to documenting its decay. Sensory details are filtered through the surveyor's professional bias ("every shift of silt, every sigh the pilings release"). Key objects like the inkwell and rusted latch charge the final image and shape tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent and tactile throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the protagonist's agency in deepening engagement with the space, moving from measurement to emotional witness. The stakes transform from professional duty to existential validation, with cost legible in lines like "restraint is a flame that marks without consuming." A single meaningful tightening occurs as the act of placing notes becomes increasingly charged with personal significance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete actions and images rather than statement. The central idea of "mapping living gaps" is answered non-literally through the final image of the city breathing "through its missing teeth." Subtext operates powerfully in gestures like wrestling the latch "for custody and care." Earned wisdom arises from specific struggle, avoiding moralizing or abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and deeply characterized through a distinct perceptual signature ("boots remembering former thresholds"). Lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure. Diction remains within the surveyor's lexicon even under pressure, though occasional density near "hushed blaze" slightly risks register drift. No head-hopping or voice convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("Its lid snaps like a small lighthouse shutting its eye"). Minor figurative stacking in high-pressure beats ("A hush that burns, a hushed blaze") causes slight muddle without harming closure clarity. No loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere or character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Original synthesis of surveyor precision with archeological metaphor feels inevitable and fresh. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without gimmickry. The core premise of "interlaced absence" is transformed through specific lived detail rather than template plotting. Final image recharges prior material with undeniable conceptual weight.</comment>
