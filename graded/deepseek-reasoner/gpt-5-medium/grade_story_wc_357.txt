<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to plant the fused heart is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in the soil's transformation. The arrow tip and grandmother's memory provide a consistent, intensifying motive that compels higher-stakes choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with cost: the soil drinks the echoes and the trees exhale. The inferred accumulative/textural lens holds, with a pattern break (the spindle's release) reweighting the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by ~120 words, and causality remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The floating arch environment constrains choice by requiring water-flow navigation and charges the final image through the spindle and its echoes. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully woven through action, reflecting the POV's professional priorities. The orchard planet and rock arches are integral to the story's logic and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift at the spindle's release that reweights the stake. The cost is legible in the whirling silence and the soil's transformation. Pressure coheres and grows, narrowing options through the water-flow method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of resilience through the image of music that gathers, bends, and carries us home. Theme emerges organically from events and images, avoiding moralizing. The spindle as a "practice made solid" deepens the thematic resonance without abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control under pressure. The voice is consistent and character-specific, with purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "whirling silence") that pays off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "Images arrive without pictures, only textures") slightly obscures clarity but does not harm closure. No loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>The core premise offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis of gravity inversion and ecological resilience. Specific, grounded choices in character and world make the combination feel organic and inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
