<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and intensifies under pressure, with embodied emotion ("fingertip and feel a burr of use") and micro-choices that reveal values. Final renunciation of stones is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in leaving them behind. Contradictory impulses of action vs. stillness are dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where stillness becomes travel, with felt cost in the relinquishment of tools. Orientation is immediate and precise. The pulse's discovery and the map's internalization provide a decisive change in knowledge that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the canyon.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The canyon's bone towers and black mirror are rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail filtered through the POV. The environment actively guides the protagonist's method and is the source of the central conflict and its resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, through attentive stillness and tuning of breath. The cost of this renunciation of active skimming is legible in the final relinquishment of the remaining stones. The dominant stake of learning to navigate without moving is tested and fulfilled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept, character, and image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of navigation through stillness, reweighting the prior action of skimming without moralizing. The final image of the empty cord is a profound conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.7</grade><comment>Voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic prose that modulates with pressure. The lyric compression is purposeful and taught, paid off at closure. POV is stable and deeply embodied in the protagonist's specific way of seeing and hearing the world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Prose is masterful, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and coherent, serving character and atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion is flawless, varying rhythm to match the contemplative and climactic beats. The read-aloud test would reveal a compelling, musical cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story is strikingly original, synthesizing its elements into a singular, inevitable, and unforgettable whole. The core concept of navigating by listening is transformed through specific, grounded detail and a committed lyrical stance. The risk-taking in style and structure heightens stakes and coherence perfectly.</comment>
