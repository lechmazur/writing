<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") is a powerful, concrete contradiction that drives every choice, culminating in the difficult renaming of the men. The final micro-choice to place the tessera back down is a perfect, embodied expression of earned stasis, foreclosing a path of vengeance with a visible cost ("feel the past loosen inside me"). The boy's request provides a crucible that forces the character's philosophy into action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a masterful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final act of placing the tessera back is a decisive change that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to the past, with cost felt in the line "feel the past loosen inside me." The pattern of mending (tessera, names) accumulates pressure beautifully to this quiet, potent ending. The drive lens is clear and held throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is a character that actively pressures choices and charges the final image. The plaza "drifts in close, like a teacher," and the mosaic stepping stone is the method by which the plot advances. The shattered sky and great fire are not just backdrop but the genesis of the central conflict. The minaret tessera is a micro-setting object that constrains and enables the protagonist's key actions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. The boy's request introduces a personal stake, which the protagonist's methodology then escalates into a communal, transformative confrontation with the arsonists. The cost is legible in the "warm coat of frost" silence and the men's bowed heads, a price paid for a difficult peace. A single, powerful deepening from personal to communal repair.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of "renaming not to erase, but to bind the hand to the task" is answered non-literally through the potent final image and the men's new, action-oriented names. The concept of "aberrant mercy" is fully integrated into the plot's turning point, resisting a tidy moral for a complex, earned resolution. The ending resonates without stating a thesis, offering a profound meditation on justice and repair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent, poetic perceptual signature ("the wind moved like a careful surgeon"). The voice—a blend of steel and empathy—perfectly mirrors the core concept. Elision is purposeful, and the lyrical style is taught from the first line and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; the singular perspective is maintained with deep control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Most sentences serve multiple functions of character, setting, and theme. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "warm coldness" is repeated, though this feels intentional as a tonal anchor. Otherwise, the language is pristine, purposeful, and propulsive, with no loops or scaffolding to obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a post-apocalyptic mender using mosaic divination to practice restorative justice is highly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The core concept of "aberrant mercy" is a fresh, non-obvious angle on redemption narratives. The story commits fully to its singular vision without safety-hedging, and the unique premise heightens the stakes and thematic resonance.</comment>
