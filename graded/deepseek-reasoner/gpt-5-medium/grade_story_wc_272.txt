<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in her artistic crisis. Her internal conflict is embodied in micro-choices, particularly the decision to map the shelves and braid the threads, which reveals a hierarchy of values. A slight over-articulation of her state ("fragmented reality, a mosaic missing its grout") nudges toward summary in one beat, but the final renunciation to "keep the light tonight" is earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with escalation through density of pattern and a cadence shift at the lighting of the wick. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mara's stance crystallizes; the final image of her "stitched to the weather" reconfigures her relationship to the light and her art with a felt cost of enduring responsibility. Causality is tight, with the keeper's ledger entry directly motivating her final action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The setting is an active, constraining character. The library, the gearhouse, and the cards themselves pressure choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and purposefully filtered through Mara's perception ("stones sweating brine," "smelled of oil, linen, and letters no hand would ever finish"). The environment evolves causally with her actions, and the lighthouse's structure is indispensable to the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through the thickening weather and the decaying state of the lighthouse, culminating in a single, decisive intensification: the act of lighting the wick. The dominant stake (saving her eye from its habitual dimming/saving the light) is tested, and the cost is legible in the final commitment to keep the light and the faces. Agency is clear, though the external pressure is more atmospheric than actively antagonistic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges masterfully from image and action—the interplay of fragmentation and connection, light and darkness, threading and untangling. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to reassemble a fragmented life. The keeper's concept of untangling threads to direct light is transformed into a profound thematic statement through Mara's specific, earned experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and perfectly calibrated to the Accumulative mode and Mara's perspective. Perception is character-specific ("gulls rode the wind like commas in a long unspoken sentence"). POV is stable and deeply embedded. The prose's rhythmic control is exceptional, though a few densely figurative lines in high-pressure beats ("the luminescent ache that happens after a bruise") momentarily risk clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush, precise, and highly evocative with strong rhythmic control. Information density is excellent. A minor artifact exists: a slight over-reliance on complex figurative language in a few consecutive lines early on ("pages rustle like tide-wrack," "shelves leaned... remembering storms") creates a brief pattern that feels slightly taught before the voice fully settles. This does not harm closure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a portrait artist, a forgotten library, and a threaded tarot deck to redesign a lighthouse beam is strikingly original and feels inevitable in hindsight. The concept is fully committed to and explored through specific, grounded particulars. The risk of a highly lyrical, accumulative structure pays off, heightening stakes and coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
