<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ilen and Noor demonstrate credible, embodied micro-choices under pressure, particularly when Ilen steadies Noor's rhythm by "counting orchard seasons." Their internal contradictions—Ilen's self-identification as a "worker of surfaces" versus his mystical action, Noor's whispered numbers as story—are dramatized in scene. The final renunciation of trapping for teaching holding is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory density and cadence shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the dream settles, the orchard exhales, and the final image of a "seam bright as glass mountains" reconfigures the stakes with felt cost. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fog are not just atmospheric but actively constrain choice and charge the final image. The mirrors and broken sextant function as micro-settings that dictate tactics. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the POV's professional bias, as seen in "Ilen kept his gaze steady, his mind a carpenter's plan."</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, through the synchronized breathing and mirror corridor. The cost is legible when the corridor wobbles and Noor's breath shakes, forcing Ilen's stabilizing choice. The dominant stake (re-anchoring the district) tightens meaningfully through a cadence shift that reweights the dream from feral to willing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Theme of erasing boundaries between capture and care emerges organically from the core action and final image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the conceptual repricing of "brokenness as instruction, not shame." Subtext operates powerfully in image and gesture, avoiding moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature ("the frost lay like quiet ash"). The voice is highly controlled and lyrical yet remains grounded in the character's perspective. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating and breathing appropriately. Minor deduction for a slight paraphrase loop in "frost shimmered" / "frost brightened," but it does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror-making, dream-catching, and astronomy feels fresh and inevitable. The core concept of "erasing boundaries" is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image is singular and memorable.</comment>
