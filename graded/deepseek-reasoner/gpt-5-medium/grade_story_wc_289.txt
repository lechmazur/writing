<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Protagonist's motivation is clear and rooted in their role as a "keeper of secrets." Interiority is concrete and character-particular, embodied in actions like laying threads and placing the nest. The final choice to write a new letter is a credible endurance, though the lovers' on-page presence is minimal, limiting relationship-as-crucible pressure. Emotional progression is realistic, avoiding diagnostic label-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through patterns of threads, sentences, and letters. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (lovers reuniting) with visible cost in the "trembled" nest and the protagonist's bound breath. The structure is a single scene with a meaningful deepening that reweights the stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lotus temple and lily pond are vividly described and integral to the action, constraining choices (threads from steps to waterline) and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("raindrops beading along lotus petals"). Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnecting lovers) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the crowd's hush and softened eyes. The installation design narrows options meaningfully, though the lovers' separate arrivals lack immediate tactical pressure. Resolution is earned through the protagonist's orchestration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of connection and secrecy emerge organically through events and images (threads, spiral, letters). Subtext operates in gesture and silence ("bearing stormlight"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "reeds remembering how to stand together," reweighting prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a lyrical, perceptive voice ("prismatic quiet"). Diction is consistent and character-specific, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression (e.g., "stormlight as if it were a shy animal") is taught and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent ("like a patient lantern"). No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, though some sentences are densely poetic, slightly risking clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept of a love letter ghostwriter using public art to reconnect lovers is fresh and specific. The thrush's nest spiral as a blueprint for desire is a non-obvious synthesis. Risks in lyrical prose pay off without gimmickry, and emotional truth avoids clichés. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
