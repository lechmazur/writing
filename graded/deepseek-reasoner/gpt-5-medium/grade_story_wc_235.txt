<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Character's interiority is concrete and particular, with embodied emotion ("feral nostalgia paced the room, baring its teeth"). Micro-choices under pressure, like trading envy for continuity, reveal a hierarchy of values. The final endurance—packing the scroll to "patrol the day after my own funeral"—is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the narrator accepts chronological confusion, with cost felt in the final image of the grave "balancing the ledger." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with pattern breaks (dates realigning) reweighting the stake. A persistent constraint (the grave) shapes the final tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("snow rasped the windows," "logbook smelled like wet wool and ghosts"). The cabin and scroll are well-integrated into action, but while the setting charges the final image, it does not materially constrain a key choice, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the desire to distill chaos intensifying into the dream flight and bargaining. The cost is unmistakable in the final acceptance of the grave's presence and the "bitter as spruce pitch" flavor of jaded wonder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The theme of finding narrative in chaos emerges through image and event, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: giving "endings a place to meet my beginnings for coffee." The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, embracing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a strong perceptual signature ("dreams know my name because I autograph them for a living"). Purposeful compression and lyrical diction are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the Accumulative drive lens ("like calendars in a landslide"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a dream chronicler, a grave, and feral nostalgia feels organic and inevitable. The premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in voice and setting. Risk-taking in the non-linear structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
