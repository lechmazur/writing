<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rafi's characterization is deeply embodied, with somatic trauma responses ("freeze," "ribs in wire") and micro-choices under pressure (following Leda's voice, noting shoulder loosening) that reveal his hierarchy of values. The final earned stasis—folding the photograph with new steadiness—is motivated by prior causality and carries visible cost. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "pearl of stillness" metaphor at a peak moment, which leans toward diagnostic labeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building pressure through sensory density and pattern breaks (gull scene, helicopter drone). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Rafi achieves stillness, with cost legible in the scarred photograph and the hum of the pumps. The final image reweights prior material—optimism as doors, not denial—with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Setting is indispensable, constraining choices (glass roofs, cliff path) and charging the final image (lighthouse blinking, ocean settling). Sensory detail is purposefully selective (salt and sap, diesel and kelp) and filtered through Rafi's professional priorities. The arboretum and lighthouse function as micro-settings that directly shape tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by agency under the accumulative lens: the gull scene forces a somatic choice that narrows options and deepens Rafi's internal stake. Cost is unmistakable ("ribs in wire," "loading like an old program"), and the tightening leads directly to the closure's pearl of stillness. One meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: optimism anchored in realism ("doors, not denial") is dramatized through grafts, seeds, and the logbook exhibit. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to healing without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gestures (folding the photograph, Leda's pruning patience).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends horticultural precision and trauma-heightened sensation ("shy sun," "air snarling"). Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity, and elision (e.g., the strike's details) is taught and paid off at closure. Dialogue, when present, is natural and goal-driven (Leda's task list).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("ragged kite," "sleeping fern"). One minor rhythm stumble in "a switch thrown, a salary gone" slightly disrupts momentum, but no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of trauma recovery and ecological stewardship feels inevitable and fresh. The lighthouse keeper's absence and the somatic healing method are transformed through specific, grounded choices. Risk-taking in quiet structure heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor deduction for the slightly familiar drone-strike backstory trope, though it's richly particularized.</comment>
