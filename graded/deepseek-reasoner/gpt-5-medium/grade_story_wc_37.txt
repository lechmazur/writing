<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion ("courage fluttered like burlap"). The final choice to weave across both sides is earned by prior causality, with visible cost in sharing scars. Contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the grafting process ("bound release: the wrap holds, the sap frees").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with cost legible in "we drink, and the mirror answers." The lens holds through pattern density and cadence shifts. Orientation is slightly delayed but functional, serving the disoriented mirror-world premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The mica window and greenhouse environment constrain choice and charge the final image as a loom. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("wet with patient stars"). Spatial choreography is coherent, with the window actively shaping tactics. The setting is indispensable to the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, braiding voices to weave the dawn. Cost is unmistakable in the shared scars and negotiated boundaries. Pressure coheres through increasing density of community contributions, narrowing options to a single decisive act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars like the "bound release" motif, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to rekindling through acceptance rather than conquest. Subtext operates in image and implication, particularly in the mirror twin's actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythmic variation under pressure. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. POV remains stable and apt, with voice modulation that supports emotional intensity without convergence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with mostly clear propulsion, though some figurative language approaches overload in high-pressure beats ("light spills like warm tea"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting scene needs without becoming sluggish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of memory-keeping, community-weaving, and dawn-creation concepts. Risk-taking in lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The mirror-world premise is transformed through specific, grounded choices in character and world logic.</comment>
