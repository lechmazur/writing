<question>1</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Protagonist's contradictory role as counterfeit dealer with genuine care is embodied throughout. Rhea's internal conflict between data and empathy is dramatized via specific migratory metaphors. Final choice to subsume the product is earned by prior causality with visible cost in the static spark and transformed gaze.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of static electricity and half-truths deepens toward Charged Poise closure. Cost is legible in Rhea's "steady eyes" and the grotto's fossil reveal. One meaningful cadence shift occurs when the fragrance triggers her herd memory, reweighting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Amber grotto constrains choices through static electricity and resin breath, charging the final image with "fossils like almonds in glass." Sensory details are purposefully filtered through professional perception (e.g., "blotter petal knifed from thick paper"). Micro-setting of the petal actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Escalation under accumulative lens: density of sensory and conceptual patterns tightens around the fragrance application, forcing Rhea's stance crystallization. Cost is felt in her "nervous weather clearing" and the dealer's reduced fee. Protagonist's agency in sharing the petal drives the decisive change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of half-truths as necessary bridges emerges organically through the herd's migration metaphor and the dealer's craft. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing: "truth as motion, gathering small mercies." Subtext operates powerfully in the static electricity motif and curled petal imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature with controlled lyrical compression ("honeyed hush pressed between stones"). POV stability maintained through professional lexicon and sensory filtering. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven, carrying subtext in Rhea's cartographer metaphor. Minor syntactic density in peak beats but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is pattern-taught and payoff-rich (e.g., "tiny bees" of static). One minor paraphrase loop in "truth as motion, gathering small mercies" slightly dulls closure impact. Rhythm accelerates appropriately during fragrance application.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis of emotion alchemy, migratory science, and sensory metaphysics. Premise fully committed with conceptual integrity. Static electricity mechanic is uniquely irreplaceable. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
