<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>POV's motivation is clear and deepens credibly; "boldly sympathetic" trait actively constrains choices (e.g., listening until "tenderized"). Final choice to dedicate practice, not a statue, is earned by prior causality and shows visible cost in altered identity ("grafted, not healed").</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) via the "leaning together" posture, with cost legible in the "ache" that now "glowed like a lantern meant for many hands." Orientation is slightly delayed but functional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard and crater are indispensable, constraining choices (e.g., searching for tag) and charging the final image ("orchard's panes went dusk-blue, the crater sang"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; the shared search deepens stakes and narrows options, culminating in the discovery of the posture. Cost is felt in the communal effort and the reconfiguration of the ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of community and kinship emerges organically from particulars (e.g., the obsidian arbor's history, the search for the tag). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the "leaning together" posture without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; voice is consistent and lyrical. Elision (e.g., "webs of kinship") is taught and paid off. Dialogue, though minimal, is natural and goal-driven (Farrin's pact).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear, with high information density and purposeful figurative language ("void-sun," "mineral sigh"). No loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Fresh, non-obvious synthesis of community-building, street art, and crystalline setting feels inevitable. Risk-taking in lyrical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Premise is fully committed to and transformed through specific detail.</comment>
