<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Coherent interiority with a clear motive (“rediscover the wild frontier”) and a live contradiction (“I did not want to repair it” yet choosing to). Embodied perception is specific and character‑particular, turning engineering metaphors into feelings. The repair choice feels earned by the ache in the hum and the practiced method. Slight remove from visceral emotion keeps it shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant: perception density and patterned images tighten until the gear’s insertion creates a decisive change. Because/therefore chain holds: hum→search via wind method→tree with missing seconds→repair→calibration→library discovery. Closure lands with cost (relinquishing the lesson of ruin) and a reweighted premise (frontier as interior distance). Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is vivid and functional, not a postcard: serial‑stamped bark, mercury beads, and the axle‑tree constrain options and enable the repair. The small gear as object‑setting charges the final image and shapes the decision. World rules are consistent and learned through action. Tone and atmosphere align with the engineered sublime.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—relieving the hum’s ache to regain inner frontier—tightens through the missing‑second clock. The key turn is the choice to repair despite resistance; the price is relinquishing the lesson of ruin for calibration. Escalation is internal but coherent: ache→warning vowels→paused branches→risk and repair→corridor and library. Slight softness in overt external jeopardy keeps it just under top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: practice as prayer, repair vs. ruin, and learning one’s mind through the wind’s grammar. The final repricing (“frontier” as interior distance; miracles ticking true) reweights every prior image without sermonizing. Recurring motifs (gear, wind‑method, hum) shift meaning credibly. No moralizing intrudes, and resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, assured lyric voice with a precise mechanomorphic lexicon; psychic distance is stable and apt. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure. No head‑hopping or register drift; certainty matches what the focalizer can infer. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially around the repair.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs without sludge. Figurative language is consistent to the world’s logic; no mixed metaphors muddy peak beats. Syntax variety supports momentum, and the final line recharges earlier motifs. Minor lushness never stalls clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: a philosophical quest rendered through an industrial rainforest with a clock‑tree and a learning wind. Turns feel inevitable once seen; the repair redefines rules without gimmickry. Risks in diction and premise heighten stakes and land cleanly. Memorable and specific beyond template.</comment>
