<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and consistent: a former contract broker turned witness preserving “unspoken words.” His agency intensifies under pressure with the queen’s arrival; accepting culpability and marking the sigil read as an earned renunciation with cost (stings, heat, moral reckoning). Interiority stays concrete via tactile images (comb lectern, warmth), not labels. Minor note: contradictory impulses (guilt vs. caretaking serenity) are present but could surface with one sharper moment of hesitation before the sigil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual is established, the queen’s entrance tightens pattern, then the kiln/custodian shift reweights the stake. Closure lands on page with cost: he opens the lid fully, integrates heat, accepts pain, and inscribes a sigil, reconfiguring his role. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens ambiguity. The covenant’s re-seating within color functions as a resonant reconfiguration with a persistent price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The apiary, noon light, comb lectern, and stained glass box are not decorative; they channel action (ritual timing, mapping paths) and charge the final image (stripe of blue, softened wind). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (“permanent bruise,” “burnt sugar and rain”). World rules (ghost visibility, ritual) stay consistent and integrated through use. Environment constrains choices subtly yet decisively (noon obedience, lectern placement) meeting the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he accept stewardship with culpable heat—tightens when the queen arrives and asks if the archive can “hold heat.” He chooses to open fully, endure stings, and mark the sigil, foreclosing denial; cost is both embodied and moral. Pressure coheres under the chosen lens without needing multiple reversals. A single added beat of resistance could have heightened the trade-off, but the price is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: witness versus complicity, language’s gentleness as earned future, archives that “teach the world to listen.” Recurring images (bees, glass, covenant) shift meaning at the end from preservation to kiln—an elegant conceptual repricing. No moralizing; the final blue road offers a charged, non-literal answer about approach without words. Emotional aftereffect lingers through particulars (tolerable stings, stripe of blue).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focal distance; diction and rhythm match the recluse’s “tranquilly perceptive” mind. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure (contextual clues, mute eloquence). No head-hopping or register drift. Prose modulation at peak beats (queen’s arrival, sigil mark) is precise without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with varied rhythm; images do double duty (atmosphere and action). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful; minimal scaffolding or loops. A few stacked metaphors risk lushness, yet clarity and propulsion remain intact, including at closure. Copy and syntax are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghosts, bees, and a stained-glass archive synthesized into a fresh, inevitable-feeling covenant of listening. The queen as the “other party” to survival is an ingenious, earned turn. Risks (lyric mode, symbolic economy) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration (kiln/custodian) is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
