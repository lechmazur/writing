<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and embodied choices: she builds, sets out, places the censer foot, accepts a route with rather than to Mara. Contradictory impulses (search vs. acknowledgment of irrevocable loss) act simultaneously, especially when the needle settles “in the loss itself.” Motivations are consistent and escalate credibly from repair to ritual. The endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis with palpable cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern of calls/building → beacon points → journey → ritual → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “not return but recognition… leads me with her,” with cost evident in the station’s dimming and the renunciation of reunion. Orientation is clean within the first lines and used to charge the ending. Setups (moon phases, censer foot, beacon) pay off without teleports or unkept promises.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The starlit signal station, the inland flats, and the drowned chapel relics are vivid and functionally constrain choices. The beacon’s single finger and the censer foot as pivot charge the final image; the environment isn’t postcard but a live system that answers and pressures. Sensory selection fits the narrator’s priorities (tools, cables, tides). World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigating grief) tightens: the beacon stops sweeping and points; the narrator must decide to leave, retrieve, and enact the ritual. The price is the relinquishment of a search for return in favor of a path within loss; the station’s “pulse famished” underscores cost. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in the needle’s settling. No antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and interior, yet concrete.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—tools, tides, voice—rather than sermonizing, culminating in the reframed “reverse migration.” The final image offers a resonant answer: route over recovery, companionship within absence. A single explanatory line risks on‑the‑nose (“not return but recognition”), but it’s earned by prior beats and deepens rather than flattens. Subtext operates in the censer/compass ritual and the counting/singing memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a stable close POV; diction and rhythm suit the narrator’s mind and trade. Patterned elision (calls, tides) is taught early and pays off. No head‑hopping, no register slips; the salt‑and‑wire idiom remains coherent under pressure. The modulation from mechanical to ritual registers feels intentional and character‑bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs; the imagery is fresh and largely precise (“match lit underwater,” “single bone finger”). A touch of metaphor saturation risks purple but never obscures causality or the closure image. Rhythm varies well; no scaffold loops or syntactic monotony. The prose maintains propulsion through selection rather than ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Signal station + censer‑compass + “reverse migration” synthesizes into a singular vision. The ritualized build and reweighted compass outcome feel both surprising and inevitable. Risks in lyric compression and world texture heighten stakes without confusion. Emotional truth is particular, not templated; the piece would not function with generic swaps.</comment>
