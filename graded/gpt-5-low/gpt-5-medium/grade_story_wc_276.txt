<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fisher’s motive—listening to recover a coastline rather than trophy-taking—is clear and consistent, and micro-choices (casting silence, planting the spike, relinquishing the map) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is specific (“calm is a net you mend every hour”) and embodied through tactile rail‑spike handling. The internal tension between seeking and surrendering culminates credibly in the final give‑back. Slight distance from sharper flaw exposure keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density rises from the initial casting to the elders’ test and the charged hush, culminating in a clear closure beat. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: the protagonist returns the traced coastline—foregoing possession—in “let the map spill back into the tide.” Orientation (who/where/when) is taught early; the world rules are learned through action (iron as tuning fork, voicing silence). The price and before/after are legible without mechanical over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid and rule‑driven (“not water but braided music”), and the rail spike functions as a micro‑setting that constrains tactics. Environmental logic shapes choices (voicing silence, planting iron), and returns to charge the final image. Sensory detail spans sound, touch, and taste with purposeful selection filtered through the fisher’s expertise. The world remains internally consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering and restoring the coastline’s song—tightens through the bargain and the elders’ examination, then crystallizes in the renunciation. Escalation reads as density/pressure increase (garden shudders, hush descends) leading to a single consequential choice. The cost is the surrender of possession for stewardship. Slight softening of concrete jeopardy keeps it from a higher band, but the internal price is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Listening versus owning, stewardship versus extraction, and the ethics of translation cohere through recurring images (silence as cast; tracks as music that “carry weight”). The ending’s “Give it back” reframes the quest as custodial—an earned, non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext hums in the rail spike’s history and the goddess as “promise before thunder,” avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a tactile, professional bias (fisher’s idiom) sustains across turns. Rhythm modulates with pressure—lush but legible, with purposeful elisions that the piece teaches and pays off. Dialogue lines are sparse yet charged, carrying subtext and advancing stakes. POV distance stays stable and believable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: most lines do double duty (world rule + emotional state), with few redundancies. Metaphors are fresh and coherent to the story’s logic (“tracks are what music would be if it had to carry weight”), avoiding mixed vehicles. Momentum breathes where needed; syntax varies and supports escalation. The lushness flirts with saturation but remains controlled and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound as sea, iron as translator, sleepwalking constellations—feels singular and necessary, not ornamental. Turns emerge from prior logic (casting silence enables access; planting iron triggers the hush), and the final repricing is both surprising and inevitable. Risks in diction and premise heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template solutions and reads as an authentic vision.</comment>
