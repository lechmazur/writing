<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal: to share light without fire, rooted in the brother/fire backstory and a village’s trauma. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft (“I set the oval on my tongue...”), not labels. The internal contradiction—longing for a star vs. choosing patient earthbound methods—is present but gentle rather than pressurized. Final endurance/renunciation reads earned, with cost in labor and refusal of blaze.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the craft pattern accrues to a closure where the garland transforms dusk into a “layered hush.” Orientation is clean from the opening (grotto, mist, sea glass, village above). The ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (renouncing fire; investing time/patience), and the persistent constraint (no flames) shapes tactics. The brother’s possible return reframes stakes without undermining on‑page closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto, mist, and cliff stairs are tactile and purposive; the environment literally supplies resources (sea glass, mist “breath”) and activates the final illumination. Sensory detail is lush yet character‑filtered, with salt, leather, cuff, and kelp fiber anchoring. The setting charges the last image as mist folds into glass and the village drinks itself calm. World rules remain consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safe light vs. village’s fear of fire) is clear and escalates via the patient making, communal stringing, and the tide‑driven activation. Pressure is quiet but coherent; the meaningful tightening is the shift from solitary polishing to communal display, risking failure without matches. The price is patience, labor, and a refusal of spectacle, reweighted against the brother’s “quick” star. Some readers may want a sharper on‑page risk, but the lyric deepening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of patience vs. quickness, gentleness vs. blaze, and listening as a form of light emerge organically from craft and ritual. “A pearl of stillness” reframes motion settling into depth; the village’s calm is felt, not told, avoiding moralizing. The brother’s offstage arc adds a counterpoint that enriches the final invitation to anchor. The closing image answers the central question with resonant humility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, sustained lyric voice with controlled metaphor and sensory precision; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. Diction and rhythm modulate with purpose, from intimate craft verbs to expansive communal hush. Purposeful elision works (e.g., the sea’s “breath”) without breaking plausibility inside the chosen mode. The perceptual signature—tide as heartbeat, mist as handwriting—feels singular and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and mostly lean for its density; images do more than one job. A few metaphors verge on abundance, but they remain coherent and character‑anchored. Momentum persists through the polishing sequence into the communal reveal without paraphrase loops. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sea glass as patient, mist‑fed lanterns is a fresh synthesis; “light as listening” feels non‑obvious and inevitable by the end. The sibling contrast (quick fire vs. patient glow) is handled with nuance, not trope. The method and setting integrate into a distinctive, memorable premise. Risk‑taking in tone and concept pays off without muddling clarity.</comment>
