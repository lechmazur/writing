<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich interiority and a credible, contradictory drive (pretending to map forward while atoning) guide concrete micro-choices: consulting the recorder, inking the client, then tattooing themself. Embodied costs show in images like “crossed my pulse like a bridge.” The relationship with the sleepless mother is brief but applies focused pressure. Slight abstraction in places keeps the body at a half‑step remove, but the arc lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens taught early holds: letters → recorder → amber → client tattoo → self‑tattoo culminate in Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is clear from the outset (tattooist, lab, clients, silence as instrument). Closure carries on‑page cost and a legible before/after: the narrator chooses to “stay” and binds the guilt inward. Setups (letters, amber, glyph) pay off without stray threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds, the salvaged boards, cabinet, recorder, and amber are sensorially vivid and purpose‑driven. Objects constrain and enable choices (amber modulates the cry; the lab’s tools translate and compel action). The final image is charged by place and object, satisfying the 9+ gate. World rules stay consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement/hushing guilt) escalates coherently: the spectral letters and recorder deepen pressure, the client’s need crystallizes it, and the self‑tattoo forecloses avoidance. The baby’s translated “stay” forces the protagonist to pay a personal price. No antagonists needed; agency drives the turns. The tightening is unmistakable and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of staying versus fleeing, and how we translate harm into repair, accrues through images (tether, amber, firmware, hush). The ending reweights everything: the map points inward; forgiveness is deferred, not declared. Subtext works via object choices and translations without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around miracle versus craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature; metaphors are coherent to vocation and setting. POV remains stable and modest; elisions are purposeful and paid off. Minimal dialogue functions as action via translations, carrying subtext. Rhythm modulates under pressure without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density; lines do multiple jobs without scaffold. Figurative language is inventive yet coherent (amber choosing; meteor hush) and avoids muddle. Cadence varies, propelling turns and breathing at charged beats. No noticeable loops or template stems dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Bold, specific synthesis: constellation tattooing as cartography for grief, haunted firmware, and amber as chosen hold. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight through seeded objects. Risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, yielding a memorable, singular stance. Emotional truth grounds the originality.</comment>
