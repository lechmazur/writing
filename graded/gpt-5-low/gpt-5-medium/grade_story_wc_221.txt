<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied: the “blessed pariah” carries visible contradiction that informs choices on the deck. Micro‑choices (adjusting the circle, redefining the compass, writing the vow) reveal values under pressure. The cost—accepting a stigmatized identity and a mutable north—feels earned. Slight remove from any second character limits crucible dynamics, but the solo arc holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and sustained: the patterned returns (compass, stars, silence) reweight the dominant stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when “true north” is redefined and a new custom is chosen with visible cost. Orientation is clear from the outset; no causality breaks. Quiet, but the ending image tightens the frame decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observation deck’s time dilation actively shapes options (moving constellations, layered sketches) and charges the final field. The compass functions as micro‑setting/tool, constraining tactic and meaning. Sensory and spatial specifics are filtered through the narrator’s trained gaze. Rules of the world are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (convert confusion into exploration) is signaled early and pressures tactics as stars refuse to hold still. The key tightening arrives when true north migrates and the “glimpse” of last year forces a shift in method. Resolution is an earned stance: adopt a devotion‑axis and accept the darkness, foreclosing the need for a fixed pole. The escalation is measured rather than sharp, but the cost is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through object and act: navigation, memory’s unreliability, and chosen ground evolve into a non‑literal answer at the end. The applique’s redefinition and the vow line reweight prior material without sermonizing. The “we will not fear the dark we carry” edges toward thesis, but remains character‑grounded as a written ritual. Resonance lingers via the layered‑sky field.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization and disciplined imagery. Rhythm modulates with pressure—measured syntax during observation, crisp turns at realizations. No head‑hopping, no register drift despite elevated diction. The perceptual signature (compass/astral lexicon) stays character‑plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; most lines do more than one job. Figurative language is lush but coherent to the premise; images don’t blur sense. Minor repetition (“After the shutdown”) functions as motif rather than loop. Momentum holds through the quiet pressure of the deck’s time.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a time‑dilation deck as a chapel of navigation, and a compass recast as temporal axes. The “blessed pariah” angle avoids cliché through specific social cost and ritualized response. The turn to layering anniversaries is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Bold, integrated risk without gimmickry.</comment>
