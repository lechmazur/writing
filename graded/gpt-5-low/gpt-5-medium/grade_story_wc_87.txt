<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, embodied interiority—guilt, avoidance, and need for repair—drives micro‑choices, especially the pivot to help the boy despite shame. Contradictory impulses act in scene (avoid open ocean vs. answering the call). Actions align with motive and culminate in a credible Earned Stasis (“broken but working”). A hair shy of perfect only because the self‑awareness is impeccably articulated, verging on curated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an Accumulative dominant ending: lyric pressure accrues through motifs (fog, poles, compass) and culminates in a charged final image that reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate and clean; the external situation (grounded boat) coheres causally with the internal stake. Closure lands on the page with cost (“carrying sorrow…open and used”). The because/therefore linkage holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and constraining: utility poles as a lived coastline heuristic shape tactics and the rescue. Weather and water are active pressures, not wallpaper, and the compass functions as micro‑setting charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true (rope taste, gulls off‑key). Spatial logic stays clear through the channel retrieval.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (align heart and action) tightens when the boy appears, forcing a choice that forecloses retreat. The rescue sequence provides a concrete test with coherent stakes and a visible emotional price. Escalation is modest but sufficient at this length; the eelgrass grounding and channel threading deepen pressure credibly. Cost is felt more internally than externally, but it clearly charges the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme is earned through action: service as a countercurrent to regret reconfigures the narrator’s self‑regard without sermonizing. Recurring images (compass, poles, gulls) shift meaning by the last paragraph to answer the central question. The final admission (“sorrow…like a chart, open and used”) resists tidy moral and lingers. Subtext hums beneath sparse dialogue and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent psychic distance and lived lexicon (maritime idiom) sustains pressure. Dialogue is minimal yet natural and status‑true; the boy’s solemnity lands. Rhythm modulates well from foggy contemplative to purposeful guidance without head‑hopping. Very slight risk of over‑ornament, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is high: images do multiple jobs, cadence varies, and there’s little scaffolding or loop. Figurative density is rich but coherent; metaphors align with water, weather, and navigation without muddle. Information moves forward each sentence, maintaining propulsion. A few stacked images flirt with excess, but they don’t blur action or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: navigating by utility poles as moral and literal method, and an astronomical compass as a talisman of reweighted faith. The boy/father rescue reframes redemption without cliché, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and structure heighten rather than obscure stakes. Memorable perspective that resists template arcs.</comment>
