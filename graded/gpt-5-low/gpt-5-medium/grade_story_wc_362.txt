<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mystic’s motive (“to prove that objects absorb emotions”) drives concrete choices—choosing the frost method, aligning the prism, staging a witness. Interiority is specific and embodied (“attention is a candle in windy places”), and the relationship with Mara evolves under pressure. The visible cost lands on Mara’s side (saying the name), with the narrator accepting a disciplined, non‑hedging stance. Minor hedge: the narrator’s internal contradiction (skeptic‑friendly rigor vs mystic poise) is elegantly held but never risks true loss for the narrator.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: arbor → car frost communion → return to arbor for amplification → handprint/name → reweighted final stance. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing (“Objects do not forgive or accuse; they witness”), with on‑page cost as Mara confronts old grief. Orientation is clean from the opening and the lattice metaphor coheres causally through to the prism’s answer. No loose setups; each introduced element pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and the frost‑webbed car are not postcard backdrops; they constrain tactics (need frost to read, arbor as amplifier/tuning fork). Objects-as-setting are integrated through touch (prism warmth, hoarfrost thickening) and charge the ending. World rules (listening arranged into geometry) stay consistent and learned via action. The setting’s mist and hush modulate tone and escalate stakes without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—winning a credible witness and extracting proof—tightens when the frost forms faces, then escalates with the prism’s green‑to‑blue flare and the handprint that forces Mara’s choice. The cost is legible in real time: her tremble, the name she wouldn’t say, the draining skepticism. Agency belongs to the narrator throughout, with Mara’s charged assent at peak. The pressure is quiet but coherent and accumulative; one decisive deepening is enough at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, witnessing, and “truthful lies” emerge from scene action (reading frost, prayer as practice) rather than assertion. Recurring images (hush, prism, frost) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing; the closing sentence offers a durable, non‑tidy answer. Slight explicitness in aphoristic lines (“Because prayers are practical”) keeps it shy of perfect subtlety, but the subtext between belief and grief is strong. The conceptual repricing of objects’ moral stance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, assured lyric voice with a controlled perceptual signature (“listening arranged into geometry”). Dialogue is spare and purpose‑driven; Mara’s skepticism and the narrator’s patient register create clean tonal contrast. No head‑hopping; psychic distance modulates for pressure without leakage. Rhythm tightens at turns (“Mara leaned in, and I felt the moment tilt...”) with precise, character‑true diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (frost mandala as memory map and plot device). Figurative work is frequent but clean and consistent; minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops dulling propulsion. A few aphoristic lines flirt with over‑lyricism but remain earned by action. Syntax varies and supports escalation; copy is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Frost divination plus a mineral “arbor” that amplifies emotional residue is fresh and unified by the ethic of attention. The truthful‑lie/prayer reframing is non‑obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight given the discipline motif. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric density) pay off with clarity and a charged final image. The synthesis is memorable and specific; swapping setting or props would break the logic.</comment>
