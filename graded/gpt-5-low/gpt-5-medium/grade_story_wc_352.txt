<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—an archivist driven to locate “forgotten combinations”—and choices under pressure (refusing pompous crowns, privileging vigilance) reveal character. Interiority is specific and embodied through unique perception rather than label-speak. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (hunger for discovery vs. deliberate restraint), keeping the emotional price quiet. The felt cost is chiefly opportunity/time, not deeply personal harm, which keeps the arc just shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-teaching, density, and cadence shifts drive a resonant closure. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when via “prism-minded archivist” and “serpentine grotto” during the tilt hour). The closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: leaving with “safes reopened in my ribs” as time expires, accepting limits with conceptual cost. The hour constraint and the choice to exit through a final corridor make the before/after legible without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto, inversion window, luminous pollen, crowns, and breathless safes are integrated and pressure choices (timed access, tool selection, sensory filtering). Environment rules are learned through action (threshold effects, gravity inversion) and charge the ending (pollen dimming, crowns tiring). Details are POV-filtered with high specificity and consistency. The setting tangibly constrains tactics and the final cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (accessing and opening the “forgotten combinations”) tightens via the iron band’s selection, the safe’s attentional method, and the hour’s ticking limit. The refusal of ostentatious crowns in favor of the plain iron band is a credible narrowing with cost (time lost, seductive options declined). The decisive deepening is internal-agency driven: attention as currency to unlock dilemmas. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual rather than perilous, but pressure coheres and rises.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres through action: patience and vigilance as architecture countering spectacle or force. Recurring images (crowns vs. the plain band; seeds of vigilance; safes as dilemmas) reweight meaning at the end as the city subtly shifts. One line edges toward thesis-stating (“I am not gathering loot; I am composing the patience the city needs”), slightly blunt amid otherwise implicit work. The final quiet image earns reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a singular perceptual signature; syntax and image-making match the mind on the page. POV is stable and confident; patterned elision is taught and honored. Rhythm modulates with pressure (thermocline/threshold beats compress into sharper lines). No dialogue needed; the cadence carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density prose sustains clarity under metaphor; images are inventive and largely coherent (“air becomes syrup,” “sound narrows to a wick”). Minimal redundancy and clean propulsion; each line does multiple jobs. The figurative saturation skirts excess but remains purposeful and legible, including at closure. No notable mechanical or cadence artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: archivist-as-prism, attention as currency, gravity inversion as temporal lock, and locks requiring “arrangements of gaze.” Turns feel earned by pattern rather than cleverness for its own sake. The risk (dense lyric system, conceptual conflict) heightens stakes and lands cleanly. The final repricing of vigilance versus spectacle is memorable and specific.</comment>
