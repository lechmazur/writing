<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (trembling assignment sheet; breath synced to the tunnel), with credible contradictory impulses: empiricism vs. the lantern’s pressure and supervisor demands. Micro-choices under stress (turning the radios off, turning the lantern’s key, refusing to surrender the lantern) reveal values. The professional stance is consistent yet challenged, and the final renunciation carries plausible cost. A single on-the-nose aphorism (“risk becomes safety only when communities share it”) slightly flattens the otherwise organic interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: observation layers (salt-locked drains, wick as lung) culminate in a stance shift and concrete acts (reporting preventable; refusing evidence surrender). Orientation is clear early; pressure coheres via supervisor pings and the algorithm’s preference. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend with legible conceptual/professional cost. The lantern’s relight → vision → report forms a clean because/therefore chain inside the lyric weave.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tunnel is tactile and constraining: dead third rail, salt-crusted drains, low air shaft—all shaping options and the final image. The lantern functions as micro‑setting, charging the closing gesture. Sensory detail is selective and purpose‑driven, aligned to a professional eye. Weather (“after the drought,” rain ticking) meaningfully interacts with infrastructure and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truthful attribution vs. institutional closure—tightens via supervisor messages and the algorithm’s bias. A clear escalation occurs when the narrator turns off radios and recommits to a noncompliant report and to retaining the lantern. Cost is felt (career/institutional pressure) and interwoven with the external (preventable deaths) and internal (family memory). Stakes stay coherent and focused without needless spread.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of communal safety, authority pressure, and memory-as-infrastructure arise from objects and acts rather than lecture. The lantern’s historical freight reweights the present, and the final image reframes evidence vs. use. A few direct statements edge toward thesis (“Breaking free… is not rebellion”), slightly reducing the subtext’s quiet power. Overall resonance lingers and feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a professional’s perceptual bias; cadence modulates with pressure (from empirical to incantatory without losing clarity). Psychic distance remains steady; no head‑hopping or illegible elision. Diction is consistent and purposeful, avoiding register drift. The voice carries subtext without explanatory drag.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with crisp propulsion; images recur with precision (breath, rails, salt, wick) without loop or bloat. Figurative language is fresh and coherent to the physical logic (wick as lung; city exhaling). No scaffolding clutter or template cadence; the final lines recharge early motifs. A hairline hint of aphorism is the only minor static.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—preventable‑death inquiry refracted through an Underground Railroad lantern and drought‑memory infrastructure—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in hybrid lyric/procedural mode pay off cleanly. Turns and reweightings arise from prior particulars rather than late rule changes. The final refusal (use over storage) feels singular, not generic.</comment>
