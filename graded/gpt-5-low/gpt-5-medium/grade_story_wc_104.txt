<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (“to plant resilience in dry soil”) is embodied through tactical choices (decoding, jamming, bundling seeds with her chain). The “chained liberator” paradox gives her depth, though inner contradiction is more thematic than dramatized conflict. Secondary pressure from enforcers is clear but not relationship‑driven. The endurance/cost—remaining bound to a vow amid danger—reads credibly at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: breach noise → infiltration → decoding → vault retrieval → evasive tactics → distribution. Orientation is crisp early; the hybrid lens (causal with lyric accumulation) holds through a resonant ending. Closure lands: seeds move from rumor to circulation with the vow/chain cost intact. If anything, the price paid is more implied than punctured by a singular sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: the prize center’s piano, conveyor, and plush directly constrain tactics and enable turns. Sensory specificity (dust “the color of old tickets,” seed‑vault air “like rain held in jars”) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. The environment charges the final image (keys, chain, seed dust) and the breach crowd shapes escape. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure and seed a future) is signaled early and tightens when enforcers arrive. Escalation is protagonist‑driven: she jams gears, solves the key pattern, chooses to carry weight visibly (chain as sling). Costs are present (risk, encumbrance, time pressure), though no single irrevocable loss occurs on the page. The cadence shift at the end reweights options toward public planting under ongoing peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich thematic weave—liberation as service, resilience as common miracle, walls versus soil—that arises from concrete acts. Image systems (keys/notes, chain/vow, seeds/rumor) deepen subtext without heavy gloss. A few declaratives verge on thesis (“What she carries will impede famine”) but the closing images do the work. The final reconfiguration honors cost and communal handoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and image recurrence (“staggering grace,” demolition as surf). Psychic distance is steady and apt; no head‑hopping; compression under pressure is legible. Diction stays coherent with the chosen register. Patterned elisions pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is tight, with high information density and purposeful metaphors tethered to action. Minor lushness is balanced by momentum; no material loops or scaffold. The final third remains clear and propulsive. Variations in syntax and paragraphing track pressure well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a seed vault beneath a carnival, a piano‑key code, an arrow as both tool and promise, a liberator bound by chosen chain. Risks in imagery and structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established particulars and voice, not gimmicks. The ending’s conceptual repricing (“common miracle”) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
