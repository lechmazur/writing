<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (to find the garden) and the internal contradiction—discoverer vs. person—acts in scene. Embodied texture (“trapped freedom thrummed in my ribs,” the cold jar) grounds the abstraction. The decisive renunciation (“unclasped… one hand letting go of the ledger”) credibly forecloses a path. Slight remove from concrete bodily beats in midsection keeps it shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern and cadence concentrate toward a real cost: the price of remembering equals losing the twin-discoverer self. Orientation is taught early (abandoned carnival ship in fog) and the motif-pattern (“As memories alter”) coheres rather than confuses. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: planting the empty jar, swatch over heart, compass toward a changed self. The cost is legible on the page in the relinquishment of the ledger and the acceptance of forgetting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ship and fog are exquisitely specific and functionally constraining: the vessel cannot dock; fog muffles, reorients; carousel horses indicate the hatch. Objects-as-setting (swatch card, jar) charge navigation and the final image. Environmental rules evolve consistently (corridors “adjust,” echoes age). Sensory detail is varied and purposeful without sliding into postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the garden without losing self) tightens when the not‑mine voice names the price and the jar appears with a smeared name. The protagonist escalates by choosing to breathe life into the “unkindled solace,” then renounces the ledger identity. The external pressure (ship can’t dock; garden approaches) entwines with the internal bargain. Cost and foreclosed path read clearly at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, permission versus pigment, and identity’s price emerge through recurring images that reweight at the end. The “leaves… spelt nothing, which was everything” offers a non‑literal, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext in the chimera twin/voice dynamic deepens the question of selfhood. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged rather than vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with patterned diction (“As memories alter”) that is taught early and paid off at closure. POV stays tight and consistent; the not‑mine voice is integrated as pressure rather than a leak. Rhythm modulates aptly, building to a poised final image. Dialogue is minimal yet purposeful, carrying subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty for plot and theme; minimal scaffolding. Lyricism is lush but largely coherent; repetitions work as pattern rather than filler. A few metaphors crowd the midsection, but clarity and momentum hold, especially through the descent to the hatch and jar sequence. Final image is crisp and unfussed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship/garden of forgotten names synthesis feels singular and deeply imagined. The swatch‑as‑permission and the chimera twin within the tongue are inventive turns that pay off thematically. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure feels inevitable in hindsight yet surprising in its exact phrasing and images.</comment>
