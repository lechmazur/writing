<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Two vivid figures emerge: the tactile, curious apprentice and the precise, ethically rigorous cartomancer. Motivation aligns with action (accepting any currency; using tools to “multiply paths”), and small choices reveal values under pressure (reframing the last client’s ask). Interiority is specific but not deeply contradictory; the narrator’s inner conflict remains understated. Still, the relationship dynamic and embodied craft give the piece lived stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: a sequence of consultations builds to a conceptual turn. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final client’s desire is repriced from “find people” to “find the chorus that lets her sing alone,” with a felt renunciation. Orientation is clear early (loft, rain, tools, post‑crash city), and the tape returns to charge the ending. Cost is subtle but legible in the reframing and acceptance of alternative value.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and functional: rain‑beaded skylight, butcher paper, alley basil, and the loft-to-street walk with hissing tape. Tools-as-setting constrain choices (measuring diagonals, walking the tape to the hidden mural) and reappear to charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered, never postcardy. The environment is integral to tactics and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure mounts by pattern accretion: clients shift from coins to tides; broken screens become bones; historians’ search demands a literal walk; the last client forces a values test. The decisive tightening is the reframing of the final stake away from reunion to a sustaining solo chorus. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral, but the trade‑off is unmistakable and earned by the method established. No antagonist, yet coherent pressure persists.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars—value, mapping, inheritance, and community as crossing‑maps rather than prophecy. Recurring objects (tape, cards, butcher paper) embody a humane ethics: measure, don’t mystify; accept payment to reject false scarcity. The last line reweights the whole with a charged, non‑literal answer. No sermonizing; resonance comes via image and method.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—lyric, tactile, and professionally biased toward tools and routes. POV is steady, confident, and plausibly bounded; elisions are purposeful. Rhythm modulates well between aphoristic lines and concrete action (“the tape hissing along the floorboards”). No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, varied syntax, and purposeful figurative work with no muddle. Refrains (“multiplying paths,” tools triad) are pattern‑taught and pay off. No paraphrase loops or purple churn; images advance character and method. Opening and closing lines are charged and exact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Bracingly original synthesis: cartomancy as urban systems analysis post‑crypto, with measurement tools replacing prophecy. Specifics (spidered phone screens overlay, elbows choosing cards, ribboned wrist) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The method-driven closure seals the ingenuity.</comment>
