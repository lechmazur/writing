<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and ethically fraught; the narrator’s self‑indictment (“ethics I had not yet earned”) and micro‑choices (setting down the stick, stopping mid‑drawing) reveal a real conflict. The arrival of the woman forces a status reconfiguration and an immediate on‑page adjustment of the plan. The final renunciation (inviting subjects to cut scenes; no applause) reads earned and carries cost. A slight blur around Sorin versus the narrating calligrapher keeps the secondary relationship underused.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural held cleanly through closure. The decisive shift—offering the stick, adopting a rule that those who speak must hazard themselves—lands on the page with conceptual cost (ceding authorship, exposing glibness). Orientation is clear from the dome opening onward; the pressure coheres through to the charged, no‑applause ending. The woman’s entry is a precise tightening beat that converts intention into practice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dome is vivid and functional: acoustics (“meteor hush”), ribs/scaffolding, and doors/lights directly shape choice and tone (“silence generous”). The setting charges the final image and constrains tactics (stick passed in the hush; low lights, open doors redefine the show). Object‑as‑setting interplay (vellum, stick) is filtered through the calligrapher’s eye, preventing postcard description. Specificity is economical and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical storytelling without theft) is signaled early and tightens when the woman takes the stick and redirects the punchline. The troupe commits to costs: exposing rehearsal mistakes, yielding editorial control, forgoing applause. Escalation is internal‑external, coherent under the accumulative lens, with one meaningful tightening rather than multiple reversals. Minor softness: the initial “heated argument” remains offstage, slightly dampening early pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (“who bears cost in our art?”) emerges via concrete acts: reversed strings, stick rule, punchlines re‑aimed at power. Recurring images (hush, ribs, vellum, stick) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing; the no‑applause close is resonant and unsentimental. A few direct statements (“if we meant to explore ethical storytelling…”) skate close to thesis but are earned by proximate action. The conceptual repricing is clear and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with a controlled rhythmic weave; metaphors stay within a coherent perceptual palette (ink, ribs, hush). POV holds steady; modulation at stress points (offering the stick in silence) is precise. Dialogue is minimal but effective in subtext (“keep the joke, but turn the punchline”). A slight early ambiguity around Sorin versus the “I” nudges clarity but does not fracture focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high‑information sentences pull double duty, and images recur purposefully. Figurative density is rich but mostly disciplined; a couple stacked vehicles (“smoke that forgot its fire,” “puddle of moon,” “fish moving upstream”) flirt with excess without blurring causality. No noticeable loops or scaffold; rhythm varies and supports momentum. Final image is clean and undulled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—ethical recalibration of subversive puppetry via a literalized “story stick” inside a radar dome’s hush—feels non‑obvious and inevitable in hindsight. The reversal motif (strings, current, punchline) integrates across plot, image, and theme. Risk‑taking in voice and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The no‑applause, listening‑as‑resolution ending is fresh and earned.</comment>
