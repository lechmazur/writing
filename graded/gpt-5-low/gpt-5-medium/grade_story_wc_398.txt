<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear motives and embodied micro-choices (inviting the traveler, producing knife and twine) reveal the sentinel under pressure, while the traveler’s conflicted love vs. self-mapping is credible. The burned letter reveal sharpens characterization with a tangible wound. A slight ease in the traveler’s shift trims complexity, but the cost of the compromise is felt. Distinct voices largely hold, with only mild lyric convergence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: encounter pressure coheres from approach → confession → tool-offer → rewritten letter. Closure lands on-page as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid (meeting “where rivers kiss the rows” with the burned edge sealed in), with conceptual cost clearly legible. Orientation is anchored early and maintained. Causal throughlines are clean without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The pavilion, lantern, vines, gravel, and map are vivid, purposeful, and filtered through the sentinel’s bias. Setting constrains choices (shelter under lantern, bench for writing, tools at hand) and charges the final image (scar sealed into map amid autumn vines). Sensory detail is textured across smell, sound, and touch. The environment’s calm tension mirrors the internal stakes without overstatement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-truth vs. relationship demand) tightens through the burned-edge reveal and the rootstock/heartstock frame, culminating in a negotiated boundary. The knife-and-twine offering is a concrete, narrowing choice that forces a trade-off. The price is conceptual but felt: she cannot apologize for loving rivers more; their meeting is conditional and costly. Escalation is quiet yet discernible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of compatibility, ritual, and truthful boundaries arise through concrete acts and images (grafting parallels, sealing the scar into the future). Subtext operates in the tools and the map’s re-inscription rather than moral. One line edges toward thesis (“We will not judge love tonight”), but overall the final cadence reweights prior motifs with resonance. The story sustains complexity without tidy absolutes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric first-person with precise, character-shaped noticing. Dialogue carries subtext and advances action; the traveler’s lines feel weary yet believing. Minor tonal convergence in diction between characters is intentional and charged by the setting. Rhythm modulates well across turns without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; metaphor chains (vines, moths, rivers) stay coherent and earned. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax variety sustains momentum. A rich figurative load risks purple but remains controlled and clear, including at closure. Line-level precision supports rather than smothers pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sentinel-vineyard counselor frame and the burned-edge-as-scar device feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The grafting/heartstock method is a non-obvious yet organic engine for the turn. Risks in lyric density and quiet stakes pay off with a distinctive synthesis. The final reconfiguration (“rivers kiss the rows”) is memorable and specific.</comment>
