<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority (“measure days by the weight of names”) and a consistent motive (to give rest an address) drive concrete micro-choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses surface credibly—fear versus duty—without therapy-speak, and the manual’s warning tests resolve. Actions align with traits; “inadvertently stubborn” is dramatized by continuing despite miscall risk. The closing endurance (keeping to “arranging shards”) feels like earned stasis with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres through recurring signals, tools, and cadence toward a reconfigured beacon (“SOS” to “SOR”). Orientation is strong from the package to the library; one clean scene shift. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (choosing staying over rescue, accepting miscall risk). A slightly abstract external cost (the storm risk never bites) keeps it shy of 9.2+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater library and the broken lens constrain tactics and charge the final image; vents, domes, tethers, and bioluminescent breath shape choices. Details are selective and character-filtered (“books…cataloging distress signals”). World rules stay consistent and are learned through action (angling light, mirrors, tapping code). Environment actively participates in the solution and closure, exceeding mere mood-setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (secure rest/address) is signaled early; escalation arrives via manual warning, the mantled pressure at the dome, and the urgent assembly of a counter-signal. The protagonist’s agency drives the tightening (aligning shards, inventing SOR, assigning coordinates). The visible cost is principally conceptual/endurance rather than a tangible loss, which slightly softens edge. Still, pressure coheres and deepens to the beacon’s shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (“rest is not surrender but location”) emerges organically from objects and acts—lens, catalog, code—without sermonizing. The ending reweights distress into staying, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext hums through the mantled stillness as sea-grief and institutional memory as salvation. No tidy moral; ambiguity remains in the accepted fracture and future storms.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature (“chased stillness,” “names feel waterlogged”) sustains through stress. Distance and tense remain stable; elision is taught and legible. No head-hopping or register drift; rhythmic control heightens turns. Compression never confuses what the POV can know.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs; imagery is fresh and coherent with minimal redundancy. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains purposeful and legible under pressure. Syntax varies and propulsion matches beats; the closure image is clean. No significant scaffolding or loops dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—undertaker as beacon-keeper, underwater library as address registry, SOS→SOR—is striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, invented method) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Objects and tactics integrate in non-obvious ways that feel character-driven. The vision is singular and memorable.</comment>
