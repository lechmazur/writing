<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and sustained: the narrator’s drive to decode night-blooming translates into concrete tactics (scaffold study, waiting for twilight drafts, season-long labor). Interiority is specific and embodied through scent, glass, and labor rhythms. Internal tension is quiet but present (reverence versus inquiry; patience versus urgency). The closing acceptance—“my murals were doors”—reads earned by months of costed endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned observation → experiment via glass layers → seasonal build → amber pavilion repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the final postcard reframes night as “the gentlest daylight,” and the narrator’s work becomes “doors.” Causality is coherent (cathedral method leads to mural design which culminates at the pavilion). The cost is subtle but legible in time, stamina, and disciplined waiting woven through the seasons.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is exceptionally vivid and functional: etched glass layers constrain the method and twilight draft; the cathedral garden and incense guide tactics; the amber pavilion charges the final image. Sensory selection (scent, temperature, hush) feels POV-true. World rules are consistent and learned through action. The environment’s unique properties actively shape choices and the ending tableau.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but coherent: to wrest meaning from night-blooming and translate it into art that “speaks after dusk.” Escalation occurs through density and commitment—cathedral experiment to multi-panel mural to public unveiling. Price is primarily time and devotion; no antagonist, but endurance narrows options and culminates in a single charged unveiling. Slight softness in on-page jeopardy keeps this just below the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes—night as revelation, courtship with the unseen, translation of sense into meaning—emerge from particulars (glass layers, moths, scent channels). Subtext accrues without over-explaining, and the ending reweights the premise with the “doors” image. Minor ding: the grandmother’s line edges toward explicit thesis in the final beat, flirting with thematic echo. Even so, the resonance lingers and feels earned by action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature governs diction and rhythm, consistent with an artist attuned to hush, scent, and light. Compression and patterned phrasing read purposeful and legible, with no POV leakage. Cadence modulates well across observation, labor, and unveiling. Voice carries authority without strain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: images are precise, mixed-metaphor risk is well-managed, and sentences do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding drag; momentum holds through seasonal compression. Figurative density remains coherent in peak beats. Final lines tighten cleanly around reweighted motifs without purple spill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Originality is high: the method of “listening through layers” of etched glass to read night-blooming by scent is fresh and integrated. The amber pavilion reprise and postcard correspondence create a distinctive synthesis. Risk—quiet, accumulative pressure with concept-led closure—pays off with clarity. The imagery and tactic feel singular rather than template-derived.</comment>
