<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, embodied interiority ties fear to tactility (scale, skylight, beam), and contradictory impulses (guardedness vs. release) operate simultaneously. Micro‑choices under pressure—the thin slips, the recalibration with the chip, the decision to risk the choir—feel inevitable from prior wounds. The relationship with the violinist exerts real pressure though kept at a distance. The final loosening hinge is earned and paid for with risk rather than tidy self‑explanation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterning of dust mapping, chip/scale, and slips thickens to a cadence shift when the attic must be cleared and a gust forces action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she commits to trust, sends the choir, secures the latch, and hears the music return, with felt cost on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening line and never wobbles. The meteorite’s persistent constraint shapes tactics at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The attic, skylight, scale, and beam are not décor; they constrain choices (wind corridors, latch failure, weight balance) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and professional—dust motes as navigational data; glue and cedar as emotional anchors. Recurring objects (chip, slips, skylight) evolve with the action. Atmosphere and setting fuse seamlessly with motive and tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking trust to preserve and deliver song—tightens credibly with the clearance notice and the skylight gust. The choice to send one‑note slips, balance the flock with the meteorite, and physically climb to latch the window forecloses safety. Internal and external pressures interweave without melodrama; the price is the exposure of authorship to possible theft. The escalation is modest but unmistakable under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus vulnerability accrues through action (paper trails, feathered couriering) rather than thesis. The meteorite chip’s reweighting—calibrating doubt, then becoming the choir’s “night piece”—elegantly reframes trust. One line edges toward stating the theme (“Trust returns across learning to trust again”), but the surrounding images keep it earned. The final charge holds complexity: blooming/withering coexisting, mercy without amnesia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice—precise, idiosyncratic, and controlled—maintains stable POV and modulates pressure cleanly. Diction is consistently the narrator’s, with patterned elision taught early and legible at closure. No head‑hopping, no expository crutch; images carry subtext. Rhythm tightens around high‑pressure beats (gust, latch, release) without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; syntax varies and momentum holds. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and disciplined; metaphors align with the physical logic (dust as wind map, chip as weight). Minimal repetition feels purposeful rather than looped. No artifacts or muddle in the closing third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Pigeon‑guided dust‑mapping, a mars chip as doubt‑calibrator, and ledger‑song preservation synthesize into a fresh, inevitable system. Risks are aesthetic and structural yet coherent; the closure reinterprets every motif without gimmickry. The violinist exchange via slips avoids cliché romance while deepening stakes. This is a memorable, specific vision that would not survive a change of frame.</comment>
