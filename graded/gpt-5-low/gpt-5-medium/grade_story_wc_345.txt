<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The collective “we” voice carries concrete motive—survival through cohesion—rendered in embodied detail (wind in our teeth, raw hands on cords). Internal contradiction (“hope here is brambled”) lives alongside action, revealing distrust that yields to earned trust. Micro‑choices under pressure (who pairs with whom, when to pull, agreeing to launch) feel motivated by prior beats. The arc is credible endurance toward a communal renunciation of isolation with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: ritual patterns (bell, chalk) accrete until a crisis (the unmoored arch) forces a coordinated response and then a collective launch. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: a community reconstitutes itself into one body and earns sight of the “nebula of respite,” with cost in risk, fatigue, and relinquished quarrels. Orientation is clear early—orchard planet, arches, bell—and the taught pattern (signals → action) governs all turns. The final oath‑ring reweights everything without mechanical over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating arches, moss paths, and river of air are not decorative; they constrain tactics (rescue rigging, breath‑timed rowing) and generate peril (stranded hammocks). The butterfly watering bell functions as micro‑setting/tool that governs time and choice and then charges the ending image. Specifics like waxed pouches, mothweed and thyme, and breath counting sharpen the world through POV bias. Rules stay consistent and are learned through use rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a brambled group act as one?—tightens at the arch disaster and again with the decision to launch into the air‑river. Prices are visible: risk to twelve families, raw exertion, and the surrender of old quarrels, with agency distributed but legible in the narrator’s team choices. Escalation coheres under the signal system without coincidence resolving anything. A single decisive deepening—the unprecedented braided alarm—credibly narrows options and compels change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: community as technology against fear, rituals as scaffolds for trust, grief metabolized into coordination. Recurring images (bell, chalk, arches) shift meaning from survival signals to communal oath, avoiding moralizing. The line “tired together rather than tired alone” reframes the premise without preaching. The final misted oath enacts the answer rather than stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, confident plural voice with lyrical cadence stays consistent and modulates under pressure (shorter, tactile lines during rescue). Perceptual signature is specific and character‑bound, never omniscient beyond lived inference. Purposeful elision teaches its pattern early (ritual→response) and pays it off at closure. No head‑hopping or register drift; the diction is uniquely theirs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (the bell as weather, timekeeper, and vow). Figurative language is fresh and coherent; no mixed metaphors or choked piling in peak beats. Rhythm varies, and there’s no paraphrase scaffolding; sentences propel rather than loop. The closing line precisely recharges prior motifs without purple overreach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—orchard planet, ghostly mutual aid, chalk logistics, butterfly bell—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric plural POV, ritual‑driven structure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established systems rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth (apologies traded like seeds) grounds the novelty.</comment>
