<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and particular (“mouth full of borrowed thunder”), with a credible contradiction—wanting to transform pain while resisting saviorhood. Micro-choices under pressure (allowing the filament to touch, deciding to cook, recipe choices) reveal values and cost. The relationship with the keeper is spare but forceful, his grief concretized in his handling of the box. The ending’s change (“stood taller…not erased but subsumed”) is earned by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: rain → discovery → warning → contact → decision to cook → meal → reconfigured bearing. Closure lands on-page with cost (the chef’s scoured throat, “borrowed thunder”) and a visible before/after for the keeper. Two‑shard structure (site then kitchen) is clean, with a single dominant stake. The final image (puddles vanish; saved coral) locks an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: puddles as maps constrain the path, touch‑contagion shapes conduct, ice that “does not melt” defines tactics. Sensory texture is balanced across smell, taste, and touch, filtered through a chef’s sensibility. The fortress’s “unspoken dream” and desert‑after‑rain tone charge the ending image of evaporating puddles/salt rings. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether the protagonist will risk contamination to transform stored remorse. The tightening arrives when the coral touches the wrist, forcing a choice that narrows options and imposes cost. The decision to cook and feed the keeper pays off with a visible reconfiguration. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but the cost is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming—not erasing—pain is fully integrated through cooking as praxis; “sandpaper” vs. “erase” recurs in action, not moralizing. The archive of remorse and porous coral/ice metaphor reframes memory as something to be borne communally. The ending’s quiet Earned Stasis—keeper steadier, residue of salt rings—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity remains: the chef keeps coral “not hoarding,” acknowledging ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and controlled, with culinary and tidal lexicons fused into a coherent perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable; the few dialogue lines are lean and subtextual. Patterned diction (“scallops,” “salt,” “brittle”) is taught early and pays off at closure without opacity. No head‑hopping or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (culinary verbs enact emotional work). Figurative language is rich but coherent to the established sea/desert/coral palette; no mixed metaphors dull the climax. Rhythm varies; no scaffold or paraphrase loops. Final lines land cleanly without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The fusion of memory‑tasting cuisine, tidal‑pool cartography in desert puddles, and a coral‑ice archive is striking and integrated. The moral calculus—tempering remorse without saviorhood—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity makes the premise irreplaceable.</comment>
