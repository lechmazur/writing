<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivations are clear and embodied: the operator’s vocation (“teach silence how to comfort”) drives precise micro-choices (dimming light, opening windows, slowing drift). The mathematician’s “fluidly logical” nature shows in her questions and habitual computing, with a credible soft reversal when she stops calculating. Interiority is specific and textured without therapy‑speak; the singer memory injects cost and prevents tidy uplift. Slightly limited by the relative gentleness of conflict, but the earned relaxation reads as a meaningful reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring pulses (train whistle → hush) pattern and then deepen toward a Charged Poise closure. Closure lands on the page when her shoulders loosen and “motion now is kin to rest,” reweighting transit with cost implied by grief and the singer anecdote. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene coherence never wavers. Cost is subtle but legible in the relinquishing of control and the operator’s vigilant labor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terrace, cables, pylons with velvet, and storm glass are vivid and tool‑like, constraining tactics (route tuning, baffles, opening windows) and charging the final image (“terrace has learned a new angle for its light”). Sensory spread is excellent (iron smell, felt‑wrapped notes), filtered by a professional ear. World rules are taught through use, not exposition. High integration without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can comfort be catalyzed, not measured—tightens via pattern intensification (freight calls → hush checks; crystals freckle → clear). The operator’s agency escalates tactically (adjusting environment) and the mathematician’s choice to stop computing narrows an internal option. The felt price is quiet—relinquishment rather than rupture—but coherent for the lens. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as shaped presence rather than absence, grief as something to be held by air. Recurring images (storm glass, whistle’s echo, transit) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The stairwell pause image elegantly reframes the goal of “making a room of the gap.” Resonance lingers without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature (“soundfall,” “library seam”) remains stable and apt. Dialogue is sparse yet purposeful, carrying subtext (measure vs catalyze). No head‑hopping; distance modulates cleanly with pressure. Diction is elevated but convincingly occupational and character‑bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut: high information density, varied rhythm, and images that cohere to the sonic/atmospheric logic. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined and pattern‑taught; no mixed metaphors or loops dull momentum. The final image “cable were a cradle” pays off sound motifs. Minor risk of lushness never blurs clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a gondola sound‑tender reading a storm glass to “catalyze” comfort is fresh, and the math/comfort dialectic avoids cliché. Risks (lyric density, quiet stakes) heighten coherence and land. The closure reimagines transit as rest in a non‑obvious, inevitable way. Distinct vision without gimmickry.</comment>
