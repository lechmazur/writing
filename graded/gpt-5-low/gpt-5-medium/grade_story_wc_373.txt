<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lark’s motive is precise and embodied in micro‑choices (near‑purchases, gain adjustment, the fob chain loop), with a credible mix of calculation and instinct. Her curiously steadfast patience carries cost in social risk and moral complicity, not just aesthetics. Kettle and the smuggler exert real pressure that crystallizes into the brittle inhale. The only ceiling is that her internal conflict stays coolly managed; a hair more fray under peak stress might deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens is taught early and held: hush → false starts → cutpurse trigger → lime spill → silent accusation → captured “brittle inhale.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she engineers a break and pays coin/moral price), and the sunrise clock cleanly releases the tension. Orientation is clear from the first lines; no causal gaps or resets. The final image reweights the premise without explaining it away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rotting pier and hush are not wallpaper; they constrain speech, pace, and tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is specific and varied (limes’ “wet gasp,” timbers “remembered storms,” tick as metronome) filtered through Lark’s priorities. The environment causes the pivotal choreography (spill, reach, recoil) and shapes the silence-bound accusation. Setting evolves with the gray seam of dawn to release the truce.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>One major tightening lands when Lark’s thwart of the cutpurse triggers the lime spill, forcing the Kettle–smuggler stare‑down under hush. Stakes are legible and coherent: risk of theft/exposure against the goal of capturing a rare sonic fracture. Cost is present but quiet (ethical and social rather than bodily), fitting the lens; a slightly sharper on‑page consequence could heighten the price. Agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Trust, silence, and the ethics of witnessing are woven through objects and acts rather than stated, with the watch fob’s “careful conscience” and the hush’s enforced patience reframing justice as a kind of break. The final repricing—“even justice sounded like something breaking”—rides earned particulars instead of a moral. Subtext thrives in gestures (reach, recoil) and the gagged accusation. A hair more resistance to her own method’s coldness could push into 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, tidal, and disciplined; diction and rhythm match Lark’s attentional bias and the market’s hush without slippage. No head‑hopping; free indirect distance is steady and compresses tension well at the peak. Patterned lyricism is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue is absent by design; silence is convincingly rendered as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and purposeful; images do double duty (limes as moons and warning, tick as conscience and clock). Figurative density is high but coherent and maritime‑grounded, with minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. A few parallel constructions echo (“comforting unease”) but serve motif rather than loop. Syntax varies to match pressure and breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—recording the sound of trust breaking under a market’s truce—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight, with the fob and hush integrating form and idea. The cutpurse‑triggered fracture is an elegant, non‑obvious turn grown from seeded particulars. Risks (lyric hush, non‑dialogue scene, moral ambiguity) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads as an authentic stance, not a stitched prompt.</comment>
