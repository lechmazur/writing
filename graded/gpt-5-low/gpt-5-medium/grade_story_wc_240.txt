<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (teaching the farm to “listen without fear” while testing grief) are vivid and drive specific micro-choices: not rushing the cat’s classification, tracing steam back to a strut, and re‑tuning shelves. Interiority is distinct and embodied through spatial/music metaphors that reveal worldview under pressure. The internal conflict—control vs. letting go—operates in‑scene and culminates in a credible renunciation. Slight limitation: external pressure is gentle, so the cost registers more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a sequence of calibrations builds to a reconfigured stance on security and grief. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the final image delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—when she turns off the rig knowing “edges” anew. Cost is legible as a relinquishment of clench/control and acceptance of permeable vigilance. The beat structure is quiet but coherent, with no causality slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The domes, mesh, ruptured seal, and bioluminescent caps are tactile and purpose‑driven, shaping choices (cat pathing, pressure tracing, polite alarms). The handheld rig/laser functions as micro‑setting and charges the ending when it rests “light as a falling permission.” Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true, with professional attention guiding what matters. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on redefining detection and negotiating grief; pressure deepens via the feral cat and the ruptured seal, prompting tactical patience and repair. The meaningful tightening is the steam rupture that forces embodied intervention and confirms her non‑clenching method. Agency resolves the throughline (hosting anomalies, rerouting alarms, bracing the strut) with a felt renunciation at close. The escalation is deliberately muted; cost is more reflective than perilous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—vigilance as hospitality, walls vs. membranes, familiar strangers—emerges through specific events and images rather than lecture. Recurring motifs (mesh gaps, polite alarms, breath/lungs) reweight the ending without a tidy moral. One aphoristic line (“What begins as vigilance can become hospitality”) risks overt statement but is earned by scene work. The Kian thread infuses subtext without commandeering the present action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with a controlled perceptual signature (“perimeters as melodies,” “practical embroidery”) remains stable and precise. Modulation under pressure is deft: syntax lengthens for reflection, tightens for action (steam, bracing). No head‑hopping or register drift; inference stays plausible to the POV. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; minimal scaffolding and no loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent to character and rarely overmixed. Rhythm varies with paragraphing and action, preserving momentum through a quiet design. Minor risk of lushness, but clarity at closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: intrusion detection reframed as hospitality in a bioluminescent farm, executed through tactile tech and grief work. The “permeable barriers” method is conceptually fresh and grounded in choices that alter outcomes (polite alarms, cat pathing). The final “quiet wildfire” reconfigures meaning without cliché because it’s earned by particulars. Bold but legible, with integrity to its premise.</comment>
