<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to redirect panic through “useful kindness” and listening—drives all choices, and her embarrassment about prophecy adds credible inner friction. She adapts tactics (lantern arc, rib-listening, safe ridge) under pressure. Secondary figures apply relevant, specific pressure (tide, tremor tempo) without stealing focus. The final renunciation—releasing the bugs and refusing mythic credit—lands as earned endurance with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Situational lens holds: pressure coheres around orchestrating hush and safe positioning as the mountain “practices restraint.” Closure is on-page and paid: a gentle lateral exhale, calm evacuation, and the reweighted release of the jars (CR/RR blend). Orientation is clean by the opening lines; setup pays off via the fisherman/volcanologist/child beats converging. No causality breaks; the coincidence engine is dramatized as her method, not a patch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The black sand, basalt shelves, lazy current, and ash plume shape tactics (where people stand, where boats move, how light guides). Sensory economy is high across sound (“hush”), touch (grit, calf-deep tide), and sight (dim/glow sky). The environment constrains choice at key beats (safe ridge, firm sand) and charges the final image (bugs as “revised stars” against curtained skies). World rules stay consistent and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defusing communal panic—tightens through pattern: arranging light, listening to tremor tempo, gathering townsfolk into safe positions. The escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in the mountain’s gentle exhale and coordinated, practiced actions. Cost is more conceptual/emotional than visceral, but it’s legible in the relinquishing of the collection and refusal of myth. A slightly soft middle jeopardy keeps it just below the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes through particulars: coincidence as kindness, safety as worship, and transformation’s “texture” over spectacle. The prophecy thread complicates altruism without sermonizing, and the ending reprices myth and agency via the release of light. Subtext moves in images (ribs listening; jars as breadcrumb choir) rather than declarations. The final image reweights the central question with durable ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature keyed to “hush” and tactility. Dialogue is minimal but natural and pressure-bearing (“practicing restraint,” prophecy line, tide measure). Psychic distance remains stable; lyric compression is taught early and sustained. Rhythm modulates well through the calm alert and the plume’s arrival.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; images often do double duty (light as guide and choir). Figurative language is rich but coherent and pattern-driven, avoiding mixed metaphors even under peak beats. Minor lushness remains purposeful and does not slow momentum. Opening/closing images lock cleanly without scaffold chatter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—destitute philanthropy turned into curated coincidence, a hush-led evacuation, jars fulfilling and resisting prophecy—feels singular. Risks (quiet crisis, lyric accumulation, non-spectacular volcano) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from prior particulars rather than late rule-changes. The final reconfiguration reads both inevitable and fresh.</comment>
