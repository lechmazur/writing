<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The negotiator’s motives and method are consistent and embodied (“operatively gentle,” letting the wind ride the argument, inviting children) with credible micro‑choices under pressure. Dialogue stages moral calculus (“redemption without penalty… penalty without horizon…”) that the narrator reframes into actionable work. Internal contradiction is mild (resolve versus doubt) but present as weariness and patience-as-armor. Secondary figures (old soldier, general) apply live pressure and reveal character through response.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clear anchors (terrace, delegations, dusk to moonrise) and an accumulative/situational drive toward a Charged Poise closure. Ritual steps causally accrue (names, breathing, bowl of casings, facing the sea) to reweight options; cost lands in the provisional, ongoing nature of the agreements. The ending’s pledge and annual return make before/after legible without false finality. No orientation debt; lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful details (cracked stones with fennel/thyme, coastal wind, lemons tinting water) filter through a negotiator’s eye and guide action. The terrace, sea, lanterns, and bowl of casings charge the final image and constrain choices (ritualized offerings, facing the sea, setting the bowl). Recurring objects (clipboard, casings) function as micro‑setting and tool. Atmosphere sustains tone and pressure without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—shifting from slogans/violence to workable, costly co‑labor—is signaled early and deepens through a ritual path that forecloses spectacle and threats. A concrete tightening arrives with the casings ritual and the general’s refusal/redraft, showing price and adaptation. The closure’s stance (“judged by how well our enemies sleep”) crystallizes the trade‑off: endurance over victory. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through enacted rituals and images, not mere assertion: work as redemption, memory made portable, violence made less proud. The final pledge reframes justice as shared future maintenance, avoiding neat absolutes while carrying cost. A few aphoristic lines risk overstatement, but they are earned by scene pressure and imagery (“bitter bouquet,” “patience was our armor”). Subtext in offerings (olive branches and lockpicks) enriches moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with stable first‑person focalization and tactical confidence. Diction and rhythm modulate with the ritual’s tempo; dialogue carries subtext and purpose. No head‑hopping or register slips; aphorisms grow from the speaker’s professional idiom. Refrains (breathing, stones, casings) are patterned and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut, image‑rich, and varied; sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum. Figurative language is consistent (stone, breath, tide, celestial motion) without mixed metaphors. Minor aphoristic density approaches saturation but does not blur clarity or dull the closing image. No evident scaffolding or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Negotiation via ritual as “operative gentleness” feels fresh, grounded in tactile objects and lived gestures rather than abstract debate. The bowl of casings as witness, the children’s inventory, and the ledger/harvest reweight the premise with specificity. Risk‑taking in quiet stakes and non‑grandstanding closure reads confident, not evasive. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
