<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline from the first line and borne out by micro-choices (giving the boy the narrator’s name; planting what cannot be kept). Interiority is specific and embodied, avoiding abstract labels. The “reckless idealist” contradiction animates action, though internal push‑pull under peak pressure could tighten further. Visible cost lands in giving up the grandmother’s last stories.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative finish; causal spine is clear: seek Weaver → fetch “a destiny that refuses” → trade → pay debt by planting. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (seeding the last stories). Orientation is immediate and stable. One clean tightening (Weaver’s condition) carries through to the bone‑hand pit and the final planting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the catacomb orchard’s bone‑hand pit dictates the quest path and the act of payment. Sensory specificity (“bones chimed,” “brass light pooled”) is purposeful and filtered through POV. World rules are learned through use (ash map; fern stamp). The environment charges the final image by requiring planting at the bone‑hand locus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (re-route a doomed fate) is present early, and pressure coheres via the Weaver’s condition and the boy’s refusal fate. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens, with a visible trade‑off at the end. Tension is more hushed than taut; the cost is felt but not razor‑edged. Still, the barter and debt sequence narrows options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of repair vs. erasure, kindness as blade, and “listening” accrue through images and choices rather than thesis. The final act reframes growth as borrowed, not owned, offering a resonant answer to the initial desire to patch holes. The hush‑of‑a‑scholar turn complicates heroism without sermonizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and ongoing duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV distance; diction suits the fable‑like world. Dialogue is sparse but charged, advancing stakes with subtext (Weaver’s “teeth… wants a tongue”). Rhythm modulates well, with pattern taught and reprised (“inlaying meaning”). No leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do double work. Figurative language stays coherent and sensorial, rarely tipping into purple. Sentence rhythm varies to suit beats, maintaining propulsion. Minimal redundancy; the closure image is crisp and unmarred by scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The market for destinies, the bone‑orchard economy, and the “hush of a scholar” are fresh and integrated, not ornamental. Risks in diction and conceit pay off, synthesizing premise and theme. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under this logic. Only slight safety lies in the low-conflict register, otherwise boldly realized.</comment>
