<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and particular: an oath-bound musician preventing a prophecy’s completion. Interiority is embodied through breath, embouchure, and the sax as “amulet against remembering,” with the teacher-memory adding contradiction (duty vs. grief). Micro‑choices under pressure—register shifts, feathered breath, whisper placement—reveal values. The cost is endurance and isolation, felt in the final “absence I have made” and the oath that “holds.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pressure coheres as condensation forms sentences and hungers “with more hunger than patience,” answered by adaptive musical tactics; the “second line” naming a loved city is the clear tightening. Closure lands in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: a visible ring of absence where the sentence would close, the oath sustained at cost. Stakes and constraint (fog window, listeners outside) remain active through the last image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism atrium, fog, and grotto are not postcard backdrop; they are the instrument’s necessary medium and the script’s surface. Dew, glass facets, and mist actively shape tactics and timing; the light’s “quietly vivid” quality modulates the work. The final image—the ring held open on glass—charges the setting with consequence. World rules (condensation as code, sound carried by fog) are taught through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and constant: prevent the prophecy from being read. Escalation arrives via denser lines and the colder second sentence that names a beloved city, prompting a lower-register counter—an on‑page deepening consistent with the lens. Cost remains conceptual but legible: if the hush slips, “they will come smiling,” and the protagonist bears ongoing vigilance. A single clear tightening rather than multiple reversals, apt for the form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Art as defense, secrecy as garment, and law’s threadbare sanction interweave without sermonizing. The “vested hush” evolves from concept to ethic, reframed at the end by the ring of absence—protection as sustained erasure. The teacher’s ash‑scented memory and the sax as amulet deepen the moral ambiguity (preservation vs. occlusion). The final cadence invites reflection without stating a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a strong perceptual signature (“shape the gaps,” “hush you can wear”). Psychic distance stays steady; elision is purposeful and taught early. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially during tactical shifts (embouchure, register, whisper). No head‑hopping; diction remains character‑plausible within a heightened idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Figurative richness is high but coherent; images stay within the established sensory logic of fog, glass, and sound. Information density is strong—most lines do double duty for world and pressure—without scaffolding or loops. A few lush phrases verge on ornamental, but momentum holds and the closure image remains crisp. Syntax variety supports the scene’s breathing and tightening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—music as negative‑space censorship via fog and condensation—feels startling and inevitable once taught. Recurring objects (sax, prism glass, mist) integrate with oath, law, and threat in a fresh synthesis. Tactical originality (whisper as erasure, register as counter‑grammar) sustains the risk. The final “absence ring” reconfigures prophecy and art without gimmickry.</comment>
