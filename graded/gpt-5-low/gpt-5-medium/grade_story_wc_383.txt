<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular (“translate isolation into independence”) and drives concrete micro‑choices: tuning to the shell, negotiating one‑way syllables, and accepting the archive. The accept/refuse beat (“To accept was to keep… to refuse was to let the garden keep repeating it.”) cleanly stages an internal conflict. Cost is carried forward as “winter in my chest,” read as responsibility rather than neat catharsis. Slight limit: the flaw set (skepticism vs tenderness) is elegant but narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern teaches (garden, shell, dawn rule) and tightens into the on‑page transfer. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—the narrator becomes the archive with a felt price, ending options reweighted (“the garden would never repeat that weather again”). Orientation is crisp early (garden at twilight to dawn) and the causal thread is coherent within the lyric mode. No soft reset; the cost persists into the final readiness vow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: hedges, fountain, moths, and the dawn rule shape tactics (“letting water speak first”) and deadline. The shell and fountain function as micro‑settings/tools that constrain and enable the ritual. Atmosphere aligns with theme without heavy-handed symbolism. The final image is charged by place-time (“when the last star fades… I will be here”), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and tightens once: the negotiation with the quarantined memory forces a trade (“archive its winter”) that forecloses a path. Escalation is internal but real; the ethical calculus is clear and the one‑way bridge choice shows agency under pressure. The cost is explicit and alters the protagonist’s state going forward. Slight softness: external resistance is minimal, but the lyric lens supports this.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of solitude, stewardship, and carrying sorrow “usefully” emerge through image and action, not mere assertion. Recurring images (weather/sea/library) reweight at the end into an ethic of readiness and clean carriage. A few aphoristic lines (“So much of life is anteroom and afterthought…”) edge toward told wisdom, but the scene earns them. Subtext (ritual, consent, debt to the singer and garden) resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric POV with consistent diction and patterned cadence; perceptual bias is cohesive (“registration of past storms,” “library of frost”). Psychic distance modulates cleanly at pressure points without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off in the transfer beat. No register slips or expository scaffolds intrude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet controlled; most sentences do at least two jobs (image plus action or theme). Figurative networks (sea/weather/archives/bridges) stay coherent—no mixed vehicles at the climax. Minor risk of density in a few aphoristic statements, but momentum holds and closure is crisp. Syntax and paragraphing vary to suit pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—archiving a quarantined memory via resonance in a dawn‑governed garden—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The seashell’s transformation from rumor to tool to quiet object is elegant. Risks (lyric ritual, minimal external conflict) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth underwrites the novelty.</comment>
