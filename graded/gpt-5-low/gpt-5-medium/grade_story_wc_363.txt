<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—send a message to her brother—and actions align with cost-bearing tactics (hair, patience, puzzle edges). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“to send herself she must thin herself”), with embodied doubt answered by “she would recommence.” The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned: the loom empties, and she buries the borders. Slight constraint: internal contradiction is present but subtle rather than sharply contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pattern density rises (edges/amber/hush) until the fabric “takes its own breath” and carries the message. Closure lands on the page with cost (loom emptied; self‑thinning; borders buried) as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is early and steady (orchard, loom, Kio), and the sequence from weave → lift → arrival reads coherent without causal breaks. The persistent constraint (distance/river) shapes the chosen method and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the orchard’s hush and bamboo fibers inform material and method, and the dead river forces the wind‑borne solution. Micro‑objects (amber, puzzle edges) act as setting-tools, constraining choices and charging the ending with burial. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, with environment modulating tone (“cloth thinking,” cicadas’ refusal). World rules stay consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates via a density increase and cadence shift: from gathering tools to the fabric animating and crossing the river. Cost is legible (self‑thinning; loom empties; borders surrendered), and the burial act forecloses a path. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens; the key tightening is the fabric’s breath/launch. Slight limitation: the conflict is almost entirely internal/ritual rather than opposed by a counter‑force on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of connection across ruin, borders vs. openness, and sacrificial communication emerge organically through objects and acts (edges to frame, then bury; amber as witness). The final image reweights the premise: after passage, borders are laid to rest beneath the witness. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (apricots, gate creak, lantern handle). Thematic complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction and metaphoric system are unified to Kio’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to click to breath), sustaining legibility. No head‑hopping or register drift; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. The perceptual signature (“cloth thinking,” “raveling silence”) feels singular and earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double duty (amber as map/witness/charge). Figurative saturation is heavy but coherent, with few mixed metaphors; cadence variety supports momentum. Minor risk of purple accumulation is kept in check by clear beats and concrete actions (threading, tapping, launch). Copy is clean and sequences are lucid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: loomcraft fused with puzzle edges and an amber “witness” to transmit memory‑fabric across a dead river. The border/burial turn is fresh and inevitable in hindsight, reinterpreting earlier motifs. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth (thinning oneself to send oneself) lands with specificity.</comment>
