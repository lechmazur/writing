<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—to rekindle a dying realm despite being “scattered”—is clear and steadily pressures choices (asking the trees, swaddling grafts, repurposing the window, inviting communities). Contradiction is embodied: a “keeper” whose own seams don’t hold chooses to let others hold. Emotional texture is concrete (“courage fluttered like burlap”) and actions align with an ethic of bound release. Cost lands as relinquishment and shared scars at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Held under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via pattern-deepening: ledger constraint (no intact mornings) forces a tactic shift to voices, then the cross‑mirror weaving tightens options. Orientation is clear early (greenhouse, mirror world, role) and the window-loom turn coheres. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: dawn woven from communities across both sides, with cost in shared scars and a negotiated light/dark. No causality breaks; the pattern taught is paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse and mica window are not backdrop; the window’s material properties (flaws, stripes) physically constrain the weaving tactic and charge the final image. Environmental logic is consistent (trees distill regrets; night as pressure). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the keeper’s craft. The setting evolves with action (window becomes loom; light changes the room’s posture).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling) is present from the start, and pressure tightens through the ledger’s requirement, the pivot to voice‑threads, and the revealed necessity to weave across the mirror. Agency drives turns (repurposing the window, recruiting communities, accepting shared scars). The price is not catastrophic but felt—control ceded, night not banished but bargained with. Tension operates at image and beat scale without soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around communal repair and the ethics of binding/letting‑go; recurring images (swaddling, loom, debts to harmonies) reweight meaning at the end. The line “We rekindle a dying realm by letting it swaddle itself...” edges toward stating the thesis, but it’s earned by prior particulars. The final image (light that negotiates with night; shared scars) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent—lyric without drift, with a precise lexicon (“mica,” “shuttle,” “ledger of breath”). POV remains stable and plausibly bounded; elisions are pattern‑taught and functional. Rhythm modulates with pressure (lists that build density; shorter, decisive pulls at closure). No dialogue needed; the prose carries subtext and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density with images doing multiple jobs (window as boundary, memory, loom). Figurative texture stays coherent to the material (textiles, grafting, breath); minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops. Lists are purposeful escalations rather than padding. The diction avoids purple bloat despite lushness, keeping momentum clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemical orchard, mica window‑loom, woven dawns from communal debts—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (mirror‑twin co‑weaving; night that learns a new posture) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The conceptual turn honors implications (cost in coexistence, not conquest). Specificity lifts it above template lyricism.</comment>
