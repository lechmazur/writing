<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied (rouse a stalled canvas/doubting heart; prove strangers remember kindness), with tactile micro-choices (moonlit brush, gold dot). Interiority is specific to Lina’s insomnia and craft, not generic. The contradiction—restless wakefulness vs methodical hope—registers, though it rarely sharpens into a live dilemma under pressure. The neighbor’s arrival adds relational charge without destabilizing her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: offerings, moon-brush ritual, and the neighbor’s map build toward a Charged Poise closure. The final dot and shared tea reconfigure the premise into a “small republic” with social cost implied by years of endurance. Cost is felt but soft; no single decisive trade-off narrows options on-page beyond earned stasis. Orientation is clean from line one; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse and moon-tipped brush are integrated as lived setting-tools: moonlight “feeds” the brush; the greenhouse functions as shrine and resource (mint for tea). Environment drives tactics (night work, moonlit water) and charges the last image. Sensory texture is rich yet purposeful across smell, heat, smog, and plant attentiveness. The setting’s logic is consistent and evolves with events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (will kindness translate?) and tightens when the neighbor arrives with the map, validating and enlarging her project. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, culminating in the ritual final dot and a communal tea—earned stasis more than a high-cost pivot. Prices (fatigue, vigil, anonymity) are present but understated. Coherent pressure, modest cost legibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of remembered kindness and “lost languages” emerge through images and action (gold seed dots, alley faces speaking, city learning to read gestures). The “Not a miracle… old grammar of decency” line risks thesis-stating but remains in-voice and not the final word. The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing, offering a resonant, communal answer. Subtext operates in offerings and silence with the neighbor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature sustains across the scene. Diction and rhythm suit an artist’s sensibility without register drift, and brief dialogue is paraphrased with effective indirection. Psychic distance is stable; elisions are taught and paid off through pattern. The voice flexes with pressure (humming brush, saffron quiet deepening) without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and dense with mostly coherent metaphors; sentences do multiple jobs and propel momentum. A high figurative load edges toward excess in places but remains legible and pattern-consistent. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies with a confident ear. The final cadence cleanly recharges earlier images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—moon-fed calligraphy as conduit for social memory in a smog-city greenhouse—is fresh and organically executed. The neighbor’s map and offerings reframe street art as a participatory language, not a gimmick. Risks in lyric density and mythic register pay off in a singular vision. The closure’s “small republic” feels earned rather than declared.</comment>
