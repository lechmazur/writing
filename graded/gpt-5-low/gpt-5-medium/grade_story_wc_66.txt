<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The copyist’s motive—teaching dust to speak—drives each concrete micro‑choice (tuning, cloaking the glow, tapping time, promising). Interiority is specific and embodied through occupational habits (barlines, rests, onionskin, spider‑thread slurs). Contradiction is quiet but present: hunger to animate dust versus caution and pace (“give the dust its tempo”). The earned renunciation is ongoing stewardship and secrecy, with a felt cost of vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from tuning to instructions to payment, culminating in a charged promise and hidden instrument. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the vow to “carry tempo forward,” the cloaked glow, and the cadence marker “within my ribs” establish a before/after with cost. Orientation is clear early (ember alcove, mist, copyist, shortwave). The persistent constraint of secrecy shapes the final image and future options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: ember alcove, brick bones, ash, onionskin, and the radio glow aren’t decor—they constrain tactics (cloaking light, raking cinders into vowels). Environmental rules are learned through action (ash sifting into letters; needle‑snow from rafters). The radio dial’s glow and dust as medium charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered by a musician’s eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—reviving story—tightening when the broadcast asks “payment in kind.” The protagonist’s agency (promise, concealment, disciplined pacing) resolves the tension with a visible cost: secrecy and ongoing duty. Escalation is quiet but decisive; the “payment” beat reweights all prior listening. Stakes remain intimate and artistic, not life‑threatening, which caps intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—listening as craft and responsibility after cultural collapse—emerges organically through tasks and images (naming silences, breath as hinge). The coda materially reweights the premise: art requires secrecy, patience, and stewardship, not revelation. Subtext hums in metaphors of notation and kiln‑breath without moralizing. The final cadence (keeping time in sleep) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice integrates musical and particulate lexicons without drift. Psychic distance stays steady; compressions and patterned elisions are taught early and remain legible. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to the “payment” beat to the whispering denouement). No head‑hopping; Cinder’s presence is mediated through the same textual music.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and musical; images do multiple jobs (moths as annotations; cough becoming character). Metaphoric density is high but coherent to the established field; no mixed vehicles or sludge. Sentences vary in length and propulsion, sustaining momentum in a lyric mode. The final lines land cleanly without scaffold or synonym loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—orchestra copyist scoring dust via pirate broadcast lyrics—is striking and organic, not ornamental. Risks (lyric accretion, quasi‑mythic broadcast) heighten stakes and cohere through the copyist’s craft. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (payment, concealment, ribs‑cadence). The piece avoids templated apocalypse tropes by reframing survival as custodial musicianship.</comment>
