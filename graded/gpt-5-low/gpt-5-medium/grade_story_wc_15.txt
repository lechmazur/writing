<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and tactile choices (“sew a long tether… dot every seventh knot with ink”) reveal a stubborn, ritual‑minded optimist. Motivation is consistent and embodied in action rather than label. The chief limitation is low visible struggle; she meets little internal contradiction under pressure once inside the labyrinth. Leaving the plate reads as a credible cost aligned with her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with accumulative dominance: a ritual quest whose steps causally open sluices (“I press the plate… a chamber opens,” culminating in “hidden sluices open”). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the object/route/payoff chain is kept. Closure lands on the page with a communal before/after and a price (relinquishing the forbidden plate). Slight softness: obstacles resolve smoothly, so tightening is more textural than adversarial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The canyon labyrinth, tide pools, and tools (plate, tether) are sensorially vivid and constrain choices at every turn (“socket shaped like a beak,” “wind plays ribcage songs”). Timing, sockets, basins, and altar all function as interactive architecture charging the final image. The environment’s rules are taught through use, not told. Minor note: a few metaphor stacks flirt with ornament, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen a living waterway with ceremony) is clear and tightens through ritual commitments: mapping ghost routes, inserting plate, sewing names, renaming the altar. The cost is emotionally legible (forfeiting the plate; taking responsibility by inscribing names). However, resistance is gentle; no turn seriously threatens failure, so tension leans on reverent cadence rather than jeopardy. Still, agency drives each step to outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of remaking precedent through communal attention and ceremony surface through concrete acts (tether of names along the pier, shared sleep‑routes). The final image reweights the premise toward care rather than conquest (“not to take, but to tend”). One line edges into thesis‑speak (“shared precedent remade us brave”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, salt‑braided lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction matches a wharf weaver’s sensibility and work. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, and elision patterns are taught and paid off. Aphoristic moments approach over‑statement but do not crack POV integrity. No dialogue needed; the interior voice carries action and meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (“metal sings against hemp” advances character, tool, and tone). Minimal scaffolding and clean sequencing; figurative language stays coherent to the maritime palette. A few near‑back‑to‑back metaphors could be pruned for maximum thrust. The final cadence is precise and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: sleepwalking routes as cartography, a banned illustration plate as ritual key, and sewing as communal re‑consecration. The transformation of “salvage vs surrender” into ceremony feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in diction and structure heightens meaning without obscuring closure. Slight familiarity in a couple of slogans prevents a higher tier.</comment>
