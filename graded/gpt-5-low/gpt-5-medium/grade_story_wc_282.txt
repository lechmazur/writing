<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation (becoming a voice without ownership) is clear and consistently tested by choices of restraint: listening, negotiating, and finally leaving the fossil. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“factually mystical,” counting drops like syllables), with embodied actions under pressure. The storm forces a credible trade‑off between safety and stewardship, revealing values. A mild lack of contradiction (the narrator is very composed) keeps this shy of the top band but it reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: pattern builds via sensors/grammar → vein → throat chamber → contract → storm test → amber trust. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fossil becomes “resident,” the contract holds, and the narrator’s role shifts from claimant to partner, with cost (yielding the object, promise as material). Orientation is clean early; the escalation reads coherent with storm pressure. Ending reweights options for the future (“first page of return”) without feeling tidy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cave network’s tides, throat tunnel, and mineral curtain tactically constrain choices and drive the leaf’s placement and the narrator’s wedging under surge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt film, pheromones, limestone exhalations) and filtered through the professional’s priorities. The environment shapes the final image (amber trust, resident leaf) and the contract’s plausibility. World rules feel consistent within the poetic frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (earning trust to speak for the unknown) tightens when the storm surges, forcing an on‑page decision: take the fossil or entrust it to the cave. The narrator adapts tactics—grabs the fossil for safety, then deliberately returns to place it deeper, paying a visible price by surrendering control. Pressure remains coherent and grows; resolution stems from chosen renunciation rather than coincidence. The cost is felt and charges the final plateau.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: consent, translation, and non‑ownership are embodied in negotiation, pattern‑listening, and the contractual leaf. The “factually mystical” premise integrates with ethical stakes; “promises are materials here” refigures responsibility without sermonizing. A few declaratives (“The unknown wants a breathable story”) risk stating the thesis, but they’re earned by scene pressure. The ending reweights voice as restraint rather than appropriation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined first‑person voice with controlled lyricism and a scientific lexicon (“thermal grammar,” “microcurrents”) remains stable under stress. Rhythm modulates well from hush to surge and back to poised closure. No head‑hopping or stance drift; uncertainty is voiced as inference rather than omniscience. The perceptual signature is memorable and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid, non‑muddled imagery; repetition patterns (“inhale, exhale”) are purposeful rather than scaffold. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the storm turn into the quiet amber resolve. A touch of abstraction appears at times, but clarity and propulsion remain intact. No loops or register slips that dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑hibernation humanity, cave consent, thermal emotion maps, and a fossil as transitional contract—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric‑scientific blend, non‑anthropocentric “voice”) heighten stakes and cohere without gimmickry. Turns and tools are specific to this world; swapping them would collapse the logic. The final reconfiguration honors the premise’s ethical edge.</comment>
