<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motivation (duty vs. memory) drives precise micro‑choices—naming foundations, pocketing the label only with cause, convening people despite orders. Contradictory impulses coexist credibly (bureau neutrality vs. humane stewardship). The choice to gather residents reads as an earned renunciation with implied professional cost. Minor softness: his personal ache around the blue label could cut deeper in-body once under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Situational: the breadcrumb trail (photos) coheres pressure toward a stance crystallization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he will file reports but refuses to expunge the town’s story, enacted via the ridge gathering. Cost is legible conceptually (defying bureau directive) and emotionally; a touch more on-the-page consequence would push higher. Orientation is clean early and pattern-teaching steady.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: drought revealing bones, rusted street corners, the drowned bell tower, and the ridgeway all shape options and enable the photographs’ discovery and the gathering. Recurring objects (wind chime, blue label) charge the final image. Environmental specificity is POV-filtered through the warden’s professional eye. The closing mirrored hush fuses place and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve communal memory vs. neutralize hazards/story) is clear and tightens as the trail leads to the grove. The meaningful turn is the radio call that forecloses procedural neutrality. Stakes interweave internal and civic ethics; tension hums rather than spikes, befitting the mode. Cost is mostly implied rather than bitten into on the page, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of custodial memory—stories as levees—emerges through action and image, not just assertion, with the mentor’s lesson grounded in scene particulars (condensation letters, smashed blue bottle). The final communal braid of voices functions as an answer to the bureau’s erasure. A couple direct formulations risk slight overstatement but feel earned. The last hush reweights earlier images without a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (professional attentiveness, humane restraint). Distance is stable; no head‑hopping; patterned elision is taught and consistent. Rhythm modulates to carry pressure into the radio call and the gathering without breaking tone. Diction stays plausible for the focalizer’s cast of mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do double duty (setting + theme, object + memory). Syntax varies; no scaffold or paraphrase loops; figurative language is coherent and restrained. Closing image is crisp and earned. No artifacts or register drift under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The resurfacing-town premise is freshly realized via the trail-of-photos mechanic and a civic‑ritual climax rather than a discovery twist. The blue label/mentor flourish inflects memory with specificity. Risk-taking in a quiet, accumulative structure pays off with a communal action beat. The synthesis feels both inevitable and non‑obvious.</comment>
