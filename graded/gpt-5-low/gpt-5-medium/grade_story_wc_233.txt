<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and persistent—she leaves the crown to pursue the dream’s riddle—while contradictory impulses (“I do not want the throne to end” vs. refusal to be a “ghost of unasked questions”) sharpen at the grotto. Interiority is embodied through tactile images (salted crown, wind combing braids) rather than labels. The relationship with the wanderer functions as a crucible that tests resolve without stealing agency. The wake/merge choice is earned and carries a credible cost flagged on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (starlight wound, moth/flame, thread) densify until the waking/merging reconfigures the premise. Orientation is clear early (queen, palace, mountains; then ridge → grotto), and the path compresses into the decisive grotto beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with stated cost (“choose who rules… who you will not be able to forgive”) and a final image that reweights the omen (bleeding stops). No causality breaks; each beat logically deepens or narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: salt dish, ridge spine, ember grotto, pool of bleeding starlight, cobalt grotto above clouds. The environment constrains tactics (must climb before dawn; cave’s pool and stone-self enable the key act) and charges the ending (pool ceases bleeding). Sensory detail is economical yet lush, across touch, taste, sound, and sight. World rules are learned in action (names as doors; starlight as key) without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self-sovereignty vs. throne and omen—tightens coherently toward the on-page choice to wake. The “must climb before dawn” clock and the pool-crescent key sharpen pressure. The price is legible and non-trivial (foreclosing certain forgiveness; reentering rule on altered terms). Escalation is a single decisive intensification consistent with the lens rather than multi-reversal plotting, which fits the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: power vs. self, flame vs. moth, omen vs. road, names and silences as thresholds. The moth/flame confession reframes her dreams and the sovereign’s gaze in a way that deepens the final choice without moralizing. The ending’s repricing (wearing dreams “like a ring”) answers the initial hunger with complexity, not closure-by-slogan. Subtext breathes through images and restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close is stable and controlled, with distinct, minimally florid dialogue that carries subtext (“You are late” as thread; “names are doors”). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and perception remains anchored in the queen’s sensibility. No head-hopping or register drift; patterned diction is taught early and sustained. The wanderer’s voice contrasts without breaking idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with few to no scaffolds; lines often do double duty. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and voice-justified; only a couple of verge-purple moments (“nicked bone,” “wet veil”) flirt with excess without blurring sense. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the climb and grotto. Final image is crisp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>While the quest-to-grotto frame is familiar, the specific synthesis (bleeding starlight as wound/omen, stone self, moth/flame repricing) feels fresh and inevitable. Risks in diction and imagistic logic cohere and heighten stakes rather than decorate. The cradle/coronation moth anecdote deftly personalizes the archetype. Emotional truth edges sentiment without tipping into it.</comment>
