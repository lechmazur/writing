<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and sustained—salvage the box to expose the city’s self‑mythology—and actions align (the retrieval, reading, and meeting). Interiority is textured and embodied (“lantern glass polished by rain”), with a credible tension between radical correction and disciplined calm. Personal cost arrives via family complicity (“my father had worked the locks”) that reweights the discovery. The final stance—serene upheaval rather than roar—reads as an earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: approach → hook/box → maps/ledger revelations → appointment implied in the ledger → confrontation with engineer → joint departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: truth reframes the city and the narrator’s path, with a visible social and personal cost. The cost is quiet but legible (family ties, collusion, risk in proceeding during the “radio silence” window). The single‑scene scope is respected and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and utilitarian: the canal, lock steps, radio‑quiet dawn, and Guild mark constrain timing and access. The environment shapes tactics (nightly interlude, currents, steps) and charges the ending (“the canal unfolded a truer city”). Object‑as‑setting (sundial/compass) dovetails with orientation and thematic north. Details are selective, tactile, and POV‑filtered without tourist listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—retrieve evidence to counter institutional lies—and the tightening arrives with the on‑page haul and the ledger’s implication of the engineer. Escalation remains quiet but accumulates pressure: find → read → implicate self/family → confront. The price is primarily conceptual and relational; physical danger is implied rather than dramatized, keeping intensity a notch below peak. Resolution is earned by stance and alliance rather than victory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: tools of truth must “ride with the hour,” institutions script floods, radio silence abets erasure. The engineer’s line (“the water does not speak and the pay came steady”) carries subtext about complicity and silence. The ending reframes the premise without moralizing, offering a non‑literal answer—truth as tidal correction—rooted in action. No sermonizing; ambiguity is purposeful and humane.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with controlled metaphor and consistent focalization; no head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm fit the character’s disciplined calm, modulating subtly at discoveries. Dialogue is spare and weighted with subtext, advancing plot and moral texture. The perceptual signature (tools, water, radio, guild) remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: high information density, varied syntax, and purposeful imagery. Lyrical turns rarely overrun clarity; figurative language coheres to water, tools, and craft. Minimal redundancy; no scaffold loops dull momentum. The final image reprises motifs cleanly without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Salvaging a civic myth via canal noir and “radio silence” is a fresh synthesis, avoiding genre boilerplate. The sundial/compass and Lockmaster Guild give singular texture, and the quiet confrontation subverts thriller beats. The conceptual turn—truth as tidal repricing—feels both inevitable and non‑obvious. Risk lies in its serene register under pressure, which it sustains with integrity.</comment>
