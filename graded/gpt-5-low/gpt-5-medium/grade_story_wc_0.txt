<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—renouncing spectacle for patient repair—is clear and continuously embodied in micro-choices (sweeping slowly, pinning plastic, tracing dust spirals). Her scientific reflex shapes tactics and interiority without therapy‑speak. The former penchant for “flamboyant fireworks” vs. present humility gives credible internal tension. The cost is modest but felt: she forecloses dramatic shortcuts for a laborious, unglamorous method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (after the flood, in a broken greenhouse, with Mara), and the accumulative/textural lens is taught and held. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she commits to a modest, ongoing practice and a new algorithmic ethic, accepting continuing mess (“gutters would clog again”). Cost is the renunciation of drama and acceptance of ongoing labor and limitation. The throughline coheres without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is tactile and active—algae, shattered panes, silt—constraining choices and enabling specific actions (pinning plastic, sweeping, mapping waterlines). Recurring objects (broom, slide, lens, dust) charge the final image. Weather and damage shape tactics and tone rather than sitting as backdrop. The space functions like a laboratory, binding setting to meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens as observation becomes method, then community action, then a formalized plan; the notable tightening is the ethical choice to train code toward “gentleness.” Stakes stay modest and local, but the refusal of spectacle is a real trade‑off. The ongoing constraint (continuing damage, slow astrophysical change) keeps cost live at the end. No sharp reversal, but a clear deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resonance grows organically from parallel systems (greenhouse and pulsar), with dust and timing sheets reweighted at the end. A few lines edge toward thesis (“recovery is not a rescue but a rehearsal”), slightly over‑stating what the images already earn. Still, the final image (blown dust resettling) enacts the theme without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on pace and care beyond its frame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinctive, disciplined lyric voice suits a scientist recalibrating her gaze; diction marries technical calm to sensuous concretes. POV holds steady with controlled distance and purposeful compression. Rhythm modulates well from observation to quiet resolve. No head‑hopping or artificial dialogue intrusions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied syntax and few redundancies; images are coherent and precise. Figurative language is frequent but controlled by motif rather than purple excess. The prose sustains momentum through action‑tethered detail (sweeping, pinning, chalking). Minor aphoristic moments slightly blunt edge but do not dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics and flood recovery via dust‑pattern methodology feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The choice to prioritize gentleness as a computational parameter is a non‑obvious, specific risk that redefines stakes. Recurring objects and parallel systems are integrated without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration honors the premise without retreat.</comment>
