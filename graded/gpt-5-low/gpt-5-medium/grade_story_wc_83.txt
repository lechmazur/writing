<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A singular, embodied interiority drives the piece: the survivor’s technical acuity braided with trauma (“a purple cathedral under skin”) yields clear motive and micro‑choices (drift 3 meters, run the sequence, send the dare). Contradictory impulses—grief vs. “bleak exhilaration,” secrecy vs. reporting—coexist in scene rather than as summary. The vow to “remain awake” reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (pain, vigilance, ethical hush). Relationship pressure is minimal (the commander is off‑stage), but the absence suits the solitary crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cooling breakers → anomaly/basin → perturbation → charged final poise. Orientation is clear early (floating observatory over drone‑scarred valley), and closure lands with cost: the hush required for pooling, the ongoing ache, and the chosen vigilance. The basin discovery and transmission mark the tightening; the final image reweights the premise (“a grip forming in the dark”). No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: fans, glass, breakers, and drift shape tactics (hovering over the basin, “perturb the current by a breath”). The geode as micro‑setting/body‑tool hybrid charges the final image and constrains perception through pain. Atmospheric specificity (“moth colored light,” “cold machine choir”) consistently filters through the POV’s professional/trauma bias. World rules read consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (locate and read unused potential without collapsing the hush) are signaled early and deepen as the sky “bruises green” and the basin forms. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn (running the perturbation, sending coordinates “like a dare”), and the cost is ethically and bodily legible. Escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than multiple reversals, appropriate to the lens. The commander pressure is implied rather than on‑page, slightly softening the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around harvesting slack/unused will, survivorship, and the ethics of listening; images reprise with reweighted meaning (cathedral, fans, hush). Insights feel earned through specific, technical ritual rather than abstraction, and the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (charged vigilance over mastery). A few lines flirt with statement (“what I gather is the unspent will of the world”) but remain supported by scene texture. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice—scientific lexicon braided with feral image—holds steady and modulates under pressure. POV confidence stays within what the focalizer can plausibly infer; no leakage or head‑hopping. Patterned diction is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue to test, but internal cadence carries subtext and intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; sentences often do multiple jobs (world, psyche, action). Figurative stacking is frequent but coherent to the voice; momentum is maintained through micro‑actions and sensory turns. Minimal scaffold or loops; no mixed metaphors that blur the closure image. A hair’s breadth from excess in a few lines, but control holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Perturbation theory as lantern, a geode shrapnel‑oracle, and “unused potential” as harvestable slack synthesize into a fresh, inevitable system. The floating observatory under a “machine choir” reframes familiar war and weather motifs with precision. Risk‑taking in diction and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final “grip forming in the dark” reconfigures the premise memorably.</comment>
