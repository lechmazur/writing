<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—find the sound of trust breaking—rooted in a specific wound (“a partner signed my patents away”). Interiority is particular and embodied through tools (coil, bowl) and methods (collecting absences). The shift from chasing rupture to imprinting the prelude reads as an earned renunciation with cost. Slight remove in moments of lyric abstraction keeps us from seeing sharper contradictory impulses under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density rises from greenhouse calibration to diver test to personal crucible at the forge. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: imprinting the prelude instead of the break, then sealing it into devices. Cost is legible in confronting the past betrayal and turning from spectacle to preservation. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what), and the progression keeps a single dominant stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard, shipwrecks, aurora, ashen forge, and coil are vividly particular and constantly filtered through the designer’s professional bias. Setting isn’t postcard; it constrains method (underwater acoustics, ghost trees as calibration) and charges the ending. Recurring objects (forge, bowl, compass) reshape choice and the final image. Sensory range and rule-consistency remain tight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through a deepening rather than reversals: from general research to a field test (diver) to the self-risking act of imprinting the narrator’s own pre-fracture. The “compass to bowl to plate” sequence is a meaningful tightening that narrows options toward acceptance over pursuit of rupture. The price—reframing the goal and facing personal history—lands. Stakes are internal but not static; cadence shift at the forge clarifies them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Memory’s “impact” becomes operative, not decorative: saving the prelude reweights what shattering can erase. Motifs (absence, edges singing, aurora as battered marvel) accrue and then invert at the end without moralizing. The diver beat keeps complexity: grief’s architecture remains. The final charge—teaching others to hear the prelude—extends theme beyond self without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is singular, confident, and textural, with a credible technical-poetic lexicon (“anneal voids,” “imprint,” “calibration”). POV stays stable and knowledge claims remain character-bound. Rhythm modulates well at key beats (forge, bowl lift). Lyrical compression is taught early and remains legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; figurative language is lush but coherent to the established world-logic. Occasional intensifiers risk saturation, yet momentum holds and syntax varies. No template cadence or synonym churn undermining clarity at the end. Final images are crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: hearing aids + synesthesia + sunken orchard + forging absence creates a fresh, inevitable system by the end. Risks (lyric science, conceptual mechanics) pay off with clarity and emotional truth. Turns arise from prior particulars (compass → bowl → plate). The vision feels singular and memorable.</comment>
