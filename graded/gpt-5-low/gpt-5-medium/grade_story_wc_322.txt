<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Desire is explicit (“discover the texture of connection”) and enacted through concrete micro-choices: anchoring the thread, inviting a visitor, soliciting the curator’s doubt. Interiority arrives in precise, character-particular terms (“buildings exploited trust, and he owed a debt”), giving him moral tension. The curator’s skepticism provides counterpressure without caricature. The visible cost is quiet—renouncing artifacts for habits—but credible at this scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each room’s rule adds pressure toward the triangle-and-bridge moment. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—connection is “ethically provable through repeated steadiness,” with the bridge holding because they commit time and attention. Orientation is anchored early (pre-opening gallery; curator; unlisted chambers). Cost is the ongoing obligation to maintain weak gravity and to leave only habits, not objects.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery meaningfully constrains tactics and outcomes: rooms “study visitors,” walls “inhale,” tiles respond to approach/retreat. The sinew thread interacts with architecture (nail shaped like an eye; dust seam) to alter perception and enable the bridge. World rules are learned by doing, not told. The final unhooking lets the rooms “keep their changes,” charging the last image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can attention create a trustworthy bridge—tightens through the introduction of a third point (the visitor) and the curator’s written doubt. The triangle requires steadiness, narrowing options to sustained, intentionless holding; the “bridge” holds only if they endure. Stakes remain intimate but legible; the “debt” confession deepens cost but doesn’t escalate jeopardy beyond a charged poise. One decisive intensification suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme integrates ethics, trust, and architecture: “rational enchantment” reframes proof as communal steadiness, not spectacle. Recurring images (thread, doors, bridges) reweight at the end—habits as internal artifacts. No sermonizing; the curator’s doubt (“Why trust a bridge that appears only when crossed”) earns the repricing. Resonance lingers as a lived practice rather than a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person is controlled and coherent, modulating cleanly into dialogue that carries subtext (“Not therapy… but structure”). Diction is distinct without register drift, and the architect and curator have differentiated verbal stances (plain naming vs. skeptical inquiry). Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible through closure. No head-hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: images do double work (“nail shaped like an eye”; “anger erupt quietly, a volcano under water”). Figurative density is high but coherent and thematically yoked to perception and pressure. Minimal scaffold, clean rhythm, and purposeful sentence variety keep momentum. No figurative muddle at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—architect as practitioner of “rational enchantment” making weak gravity between strangers in an illusion gallery—is fresh and specific. Risks (concept-led design, quiet stakes) pay off in concrete tactics (thread geometry, dust seam, triangle). The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Slightly limited only by the gentleness of the on-page price.</comment>
