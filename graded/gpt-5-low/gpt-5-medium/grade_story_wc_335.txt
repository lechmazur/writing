<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—guarding memory and mentoring resilience—manifested in concrete choices (unstoppering the dusk, serving tea, inviting the child to read). Interiority carries character-specific contradictions (combative tenderness, walking backward under stress) with embodied cues like trembling. The relationship with the child sharpens stakes and reveals status dynamics without sentimentality. The exposure of “stubborn kindness” in front of the council registers as a felt cost and credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominant: pressure builds via ritualized acts (tea, shadow corridor) toward an on-page reweighting when the council grants a stay. Orientation is stable from line one (forgotten library, archivist, decree) and the pattern is taught early, then paid off. Closure lands with cost—the narrator risks vulnerability, the stay is “reluctant,” and the work must continue. Setups (letters, bottle of dusk, shards) all return functionally at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library and its materials (shards, dust, floorboards, courtyard window) are not decorative; they constrain tactics and power the persuasion. The shadow corridor literally interacts with the stacks and annotations, charging the final image. Sensory specifics are filtered through the archivist’s professional eye, giving lived-in plausibility. World rules stay consistent within a gently uncanny frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (the library’s survival and the ethics of memory) is clear early and tightens when the council arrives with tapes and boots. Escalation proceeds through the protagonist’s tactics (serving tea, orchestrating the reading, moving the shadow to underline records). The price is vulnerability on the record; the win is partial (a stay, not absolution), preserving tension beyond the page. Slight softness: jeopardy feels assuredly containable, though still convincing at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of reversible exile, holding/keeping versus hoarding, and kindness as rigor emerge through image and action (leaves forming “unsolved triangles,” mirrors reconfiguring paths). The child’s line—“Your stubborn kindness that argues without punching”—delivers subtext without flattening ambiguity. A few thematic labels (“combative tenderness,” “keeping is not hoarding”) skirt direct statement but are earned by prior scene work. The ending reweights the premise via the hinge image (stay + corked dusk) rather than a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice with precise diction and rhythmic control; perception remains tightly character-bound. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext and status shifts cleanly. The patterned elision is taught early and remains legible through closure. No head-hopping or register slips; the voice flexes under pressure without fraying.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density prose largely earns its metaphors and avoids muddle; images do multiple jobs (swing, bruise-light corridor). Line-level momentum is strong with varied syntax and clean sequencing. Occasional abstraction edges in (“the grammar of staying and leaving”), but clarity and propulsion hold, especially at the peak. No evident scaffolding loops or mixed metaphors in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist, bottled dusk, and tea-geometry method synthesize into a fresh, coherent system of action and meaning. The central turn (council’s stay via ritualized reading and reflective re-seeing) feels inevitable in hindsight given the established logic. Risks in tone and conceit pay off without gimmickry; the world’s gentle uncanny is disciplined by character need. The final hinge image recharges earlier motifs memorably.</comment>
