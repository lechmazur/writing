<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (unravel the ghost’s code) meets embodied fear/curiosity, with micro‑choices that reveal values (following reflection maps; stepping only on glints). The internal contradiction—reverence for silence vs. the need to act—animates the baton‑raising moment. The acceptance of the “conductor of silence” role reads as earned and specific. Slight limit: the musician’s prior flaw set is implied more than tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative dominant lens: pattern recognition (ink, light, reflection) escalates into a concrete ritual that alters the world state. Orientation is crisp from the start (flooded opera house, pit) and causality holds through lantern alignment → score of rests → stepping on reflections → baton. Closure lands on‑page with cost: obeying the “rests” choreography under threat of drowning, culminating in reconfigured house. No stray rule changes; each mechanic is seeded and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment isn’t decorative: water, swollen wood, lantern angles, curtain fringe and beads constrain moves and enable the ritual; the lantern’s alignment is a literal key. Sensory specificity (mildew‑kissed varnish, sandbags like lungs) is filtered through a musician’s eye and evolves with action. The final settling of water and steadying lanterns charge the last image. Spatial logic is coherent even in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break the drowning loop without becoming its next victim—is active early and narrows into the “rests” crossing and baton choice. Pressure coheres: reading stains → under‑stage pocket → portrait map → score of silence with explicit consequences. The reversal is credible: silence becomes choreography rather than absence, with obedience carrying risk and reward. A minor limit: internal moral calculus could sharpen once more, but the physical cost stands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of silence as music, liminal spaces, and art as a means of release are earned through particulars (negative script, rests as choreography, stepping on reflections). The ending reweights the motif—“in between spaces” become “bridge”—without moralizing. Subtext of complicity (conductor beating time through drowning) lingers, reinterpreted by the narrator’s choice to “keep time for silence.” Resonance is deep and unsummarized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a musician’s perceptual bias; rhythm modulates with pressure and remains legible. Diction (“negative script,” “score of rests”) is consistent with POV expertise and never slips into explanatory register. No head‑hopping; focalization stays tight even in numinous beats. The voice carries subtext without declaring thesis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language anchored to water/music/seam motifs; lines do more than one job. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies and momentum holds through discovery. A touch lush, but images remain coherent and don’t blur causality, including at the climax. Final images are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a flooded opera as instrument, water stains as negative notation, a choreography of rests, stepping on reflections, conducting silence to break a loop. Risks taken in concept and diction pay off with functional mechanics and emotional truth. Turns feel inevitable in retrospect because each method is pre‑seeded. The piece resists template beats and reaches a singular stance.</comment>
