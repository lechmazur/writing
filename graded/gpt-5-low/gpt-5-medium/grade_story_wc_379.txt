<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (“prove that listening heals”) and a coherent worldview guide choices (cups, locket, waving the crew in). Interiority is vivid and embodied without therapy‑speak. The “lead through following” tension reads as a principled restraint rather than deep contradiction, so the internal cost is subtle. Still, actions align under pressure and reveal a credible hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught and held: stories accrue until the chorus opens the lock. Closure lands on the page with cost—neighbors risk pain by voicing wounds; the narrator wagers authority on listening over spectacle. Orientation is crisp from line one (courtyard at dawn; Harbor House curator). The final unlocked letters reweight the premise without mechanical tidy‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard, mailbox, and thrift‑shop drawer operate as lived space and constraint; the locket/hairpin functions as a tool that charges the final image. Sensory texture is purposeful across sound, breath, and touch (“sandstorm calm,” “paper whisper”). Environment and objects guide tactics (circle, hush, tapping) rather than sit as décor. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (listening as cure; mailbox mystery) and tighten with developer intrusion and the crew’s arrival. The choice to maintain hush and enlist the interlopers raises the price of the method, then the hairpin act consummates the build. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens rather than via reversals. The cost remains primarily emotional/communal but is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: attention as medicine, community countering commodification; the unlocked letters provide a resonant, non‑literal answer. Recurrences (listening, breath, thread/hairpin) reprice meaning at the end. A few thesis‑like lines (“Leadership happens here by listening,” “we heal in the hearing”) flirt with didacticism. Overall, the piece earns its insight through scene rather than summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature; diction and cadence suit the narrator’s sensibility. Psychic distance and stance are stable; purposeful compression reads confidently. Dialogue is implied through reported speech rhythms, which suits the form. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, with images doing multiple jobs (“metronome of ache,” “hinges remembering the argument for kindness”). Figurative density is high but coherent; momentum never stalls. No scaffold loops or template cadences; syntax varies with pressure. A few stacked metaphors approach purple without tipping into muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The communal unlocking by chorus and a curator who leads by following feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in structure and method pays off without obscuring clarity. Objects and tone integrate conceptually rather than as ornaments. The blend of civic pressure and gentle magic reads original and confident.</comment>
