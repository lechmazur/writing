<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit and embodied: the narrator chooses silence, the parapet, the tea ritual, and the gift of the whisk to compel attention to hidden labor. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“demure audacity,” net‑mender philosopher), with gestures that reveal value hierarchy. Mild internal tension between humility and showmanship runs under the demonstration without breaking plausibility. The final relinquishment of the whisk lands as a credible, felt cost consistent with prior choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of images and actions (whistle, whisk, communal wiping) coheres toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (parapet after rain; crowd) and the throughline—teaching effort’s invisibility—tightens to communal action. Closure lands on the page with cost (giving the whisk; collective service replacing fireworks). The cadence shift from watching/listening to acting (drying stones) seals the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The parapet after rain, lichen, runoff, and fireflies are not backdrop; they shape tactics (echo to find wet spots, drying stones) and charge the ending image. The bamboo whisk functions as a micro‑setting tool whose properties matter and culminates in transfer to the child. Sensory specificity is rich across senses without tourist cataloging. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure is quiet but coherent: crowd skepticism and the councilor’s push for fireworks oppose the narrator’s aim. Escalation arrives via demonstration beats (whistle → foam patterns → naming unseen labor → collective mending), narrowing the option of spectacle in favor of service. The visible price (relinquishing the whisk; social risk of a silent event) is legible. The piece favors deepening over reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—valuing hidden effort and tenderness under strain—emerges organically from concrete acts (knot‑mending, froth‑reading, drying stones). Recurring images (nets, whisk, fireflies) reweight at the end without didactic summary; “We do not clap, because clapping breaks things” is a potent subtextual refusal. The final gift reframes power and attention as practices, not pronouncements. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is singular, controlled, and plausibly embodied; lyric diction feels native to this mind. Dialogue is sparse but functional and carries subtext (councilor’s near‑smile; narrator’s whistle as reply). POV distance and knowledge remain consistent, with patterned elision taught by the opening and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates well from lush observation to actionable beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid with high information density; metaphors are fresh and largely coherent (“lantern throats,” “pocket lighthouse”). The prose risks ornament but avoids purple excess by tying imagery to action and choice. No noticeable loops or scaffolding; sentences vary in structure and propulsion. Minor flourish density in a few lines skirts overload but does not obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—net‑mending philosophy, tea‑foam divination, communal service in lieu of spectacle—is distinctive and feels inevitable by the end. Risks in tone and structure pay off through precise, grounded particulars. Turns arise from established motifs rather than late conveniences (the whistle and whisk both evolve). The final reconfiguration (gift of the whisk; town’s hands-on mending) is fresh and memorable.</comment>
