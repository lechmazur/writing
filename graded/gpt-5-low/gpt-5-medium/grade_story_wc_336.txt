<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Miren’s motive—to preserve the orchard’s “color of wonder”—is specific and consistently enacted, culminating in surrendering the heirloom seed. Interiority is embodied through sensory craft (sap, scent “like bread learning to rise”). The brief relationship with the child adds pressure and tests her values through teaching and the choice to plant. Internal contradiction is subtle but present in her insatiable urge to create a “new gesture” versus the cost of giving up the locket’s seed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held from first line through closure. Closure lands when Miren and the child plant the essence‑swollen seed at the seam; the cost is Miren’s relinquishment of the heirloom and binding it to a public threshold via the child’s promise. Orientation is early and clean (Miren, parapet, waterfall). The density builds from pruning to child’s arrival to the charged planting; the final image reweights the stake with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The waterfall parapet is not decorative; it dictates the tactic and site of planting (“the crack between flagstones where the waterfall’s mist left bright beads”). Tools and micro‑setting (shears, locket, seam) constrain choices and charge the ending. Sensory texture is varied and POV‑true. World rules are taught through action (seed hungers for “testimony”) and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure deepens through the seed’s demand for “where to be planted” and the child’s plea about “tired” apples, forcing a consequential choice. The dominant stake narrows to surrendering the heirloom for communal memory, with a visible trade‑off. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; the bell‑like release after pruning functions as a midpoint intensification. Slight softness in overt jeopardy keeps it from the very top.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—careful labor as a conduit for wonder and communal remembrance—emerges through concrete acts (pruning scars, harvesting scents, teaching breath) rather than thesis. The final image (“keeping a path swept where wonder prefers to walk”) reinterprets all prior moves without moralizing. Subtext in the child’s cracked sugar jar and gray‑facing chair elegantly ties domestic erosion to orchard fatigue. The conceptual repricing of “seed” as testimony-holder is resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice sustains a distinct, lyrical yet controlled perception, with imagery arising from Miren’s vocation. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and purposeful (“Please…our apples taste tired”), and it advances pressure. Psychic distance is stable; metaphor and diction are consistent with the fable‑like register. Rhythm modulates to land turns and the ending cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and purposeful; images do multiple jobs (“scent like bread learning to rise” marries pruning, memory, and nourishment). No paraphrase loops or template cadences; density supports momentum. Figurative language remains coherent and legible even in peak beats. The final lines compress stakes into a clean, charged cadence without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard‑as‑memory system and the seed that eats testimony feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The choice to plant in a liminal seam is surprising yet prepared. Risks in diction and mythic texture heighten coherence rather than obscure it. Emotional truth—care as craft, wonder as work—grounds the inventiveness.</comment>
