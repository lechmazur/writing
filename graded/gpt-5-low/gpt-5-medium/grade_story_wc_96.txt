<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich, specific interiority and concrete micro‑choices (opening the tin’s false bottom, reading pennies aloud) reveal a coherent, urgent motive balanced by the flaw/pressure of monthly molting. The relationship with Lio is lived‑in and functional under pressure, with status playing through action rather than talk. Emotional contradiction is present (fervor vs. fear of becoming a stranger). The end’s endurance stance feels earned, though the cost remains more conceptual than bodily.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught immediately and held; the scene coheres around a single night’s rebuild culminating in a charged poise/CR: beauty as practice, the tin’s closing “like a page turning.” Orientation is clear early (vagrant poet, rusted library, Lio). The false‑bottom reveal and map reweight the action mid‑scene; strangers arriving and shelves rising intensify cadence toward closure. Cost is felt via risk (demolition notice, siren) and identity drift; it’s quiet but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted library, fence‑as‑harp, battery/lantern, and copper pennies are integrated, sensorially vivid, and tactically determinative (what they can fix, how they gather light/people). The environment shapes choices (rigging twine lines, scavenged door) and charges the final image (tin closing, morning lid). Detail selection is voice‑filtered and avoids tourist catalog. Consistency of world rules holds without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrect the outlaw library before identity molts and demolition arrives—is clear and tightens through the map reveal, community arrival, and the active rebuild. Pressure escalates by density/cadence rather than adversary; the siren grazes but doesn’t intervene, so opposition is soft. Still, the choice to continue, expose the map, and “practice until dawn” forecloses retreat with risk. The cost is more existential than immediate, which trims peak intensity slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: art as communal resistance and an alternative economy (“pennies inked with phrases”) rather than through sermonizing, with the final exchange crystallizing the ethic. Subtext hums in the prison‑library origin and the re‑shelving of the city’s castoffs; the “index of need” reframes disorder into care. A couple of direct statements (“Beauty is not a treaty…”) skate close to thesis, but they’re earned by the scene’s particulars and cadence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a coherent perceptual signature (copper lexicon, breath/wind motifs) that modulates as pressure accumulates. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext and sealing the charged poise at the end. No head‑hopping; focalization stays tight to the poet’s sensibility. Patterned diction is taught early and pays off without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; sentence rhythms vary and propel. Figurative texture is abundant but disciplined and internally coherent (copper, ribs, breath, wind, light). No paraphrase loops or syntactic drumbeats; mechanics are clean. The lushness slightly risks saturation but never muddies action or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—vagrant penny poet, copper economy, outlaw library, false‑bottom cartography—feels fresh and inevitable within its own logic. Risks in diction and structure heighten stakes and coherence rather than becoming gimmickry. The map of flattened pennies and “reading coins like rosary” are memorable, specific turns. Minor soft stakes are the only brake on a higher score.</comment>
