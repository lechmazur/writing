<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—compulsion to arrange versus a learned practice of listening—are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (tying knots that “sigh loose,” stepping aside at the jasmine–hop “treaty,” keeping a ledger of what she didn’t force). Embodied images anchor emotion (“droplets…like second thoughts,” the linden leaf crisping in her pocket). The external pressure of customers and weather tests her stance and elicits costly restraint. The final vow forecloses her old tactic with a believable price: relinquishing authority and speed for attentional labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm‑driven pressure accrues across days and images toward a reweighted practice of care. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—the vow to “reconstruct only what grows kinder” charges the final image and reframes prior arranging as harm. Costs are on‑page: social pressure to advise, material disorder, and the seduction of fixing “buttoned, polished, persuasive.” Orientation is clean from the opening and remains coherent despite temporal glides.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nursery, storm season, and the “mossy trellis after rain” are tactile, bias‑filtered, and constrain choices (knots loosen, ivy wants the rough post, shelter under the trellis). Recurring objects (trellis, linden leaf) return to charge the final touch and vow. Weather is not décor but an active agent that prunes “the town’s certainties.” Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across smell, sound, and texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to tend under pressure—tightens via storms, customers’ needs, and the public talk, culminating in a renunciation that alters tactics. The decisive deepening is the shift from reconstructing rows to observing drift, with visible costs (loss of control, uneven customer reception). The “old impulse to fix” is confronted, heard out, and declined, a credible endurance choice. Tension operates quietly but persistently, consistent with the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: care as subtraction, listening beyond command, and courage rehearsed in “small bends.” Subtext lives in plant “treaties” and the ledger of non‑interference; the final image reweights the premise without over‑explaining. Slight deduction for explicit thesis lines in the hall speech, which border on moralizing even if grounded by scene. The ending’s vow returns the motifs with felt, unsentimental resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric voice with controlled cadence and selective precision; the perceptual signature (hearing roots “thinking”) feels singular and credible within the piece’s logic. Dialogue is brief, natural, and subtextual (the boy’s question and nod). Psychic distance modulates purposefully without leakage. Diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon and supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (weather as character, knots as agency). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and varied; no scaffold loops or template cadences slow momentum. A few lines flirt with aphorism, yet they’re anchored by concrete beats (ledger, knots, treaties). Rhythm and syntax breathe with the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—nursery craft reframed as ethical listening under storm pressure—feels fresh and necessary; the “care as subtraction” lens is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Recurring motifs (linden leaf, trellis, treaties) are re‑purposed with ingenuity rather than ornament. Risk‑taking in a quiet, accumulative structure pays off with clarity. Emotional truth outpaces trope.</comment>
