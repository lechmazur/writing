<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, compelling professional motive (“cultivate foresight in action”) threads through concrete micro‑choices (tape, chalk, radio). Interiority is specific and embodied via sensory bias and procedural thought rather than labels. Emotional contradiction is subtle (confidence vs. refusal to “promise”), but the calm competence can read a touch friction‑light under peak pressure. The brief dynamic with the child adds human stakes without diluting the POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: survey → diagnose wind trap → mark corridors/offset → radio/upload → pilot lands. Closure lands on the page with cost via an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they refuse the dangerous corridor and “promise nothing” while committing to a revised approach that could still fail. Orientation is crisp from line one; the drive lens stays causal despite lyric texture. The final image (quiet landing, inventorying what almost failed) seals the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is not backdrop; the container maze and silos literally shape wind, tactics, and the final corridor. Purposeful sensory detail (salt, rust, mothball fruit) stays filtered through a professional eye and advances action. Recurring objects (patch, ribbon tape) function as micro‑setting tools that constrain choice and charge the ending. Spatial logic (boulevard alignment, helipad) remains coherent and operative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightens when the child reports the failing generator, converting diagnosis into time‑pressured action. The investigator forecloses a live option (the usual approach) and imposes a cost in restraint and precision (“promise nothing,” “refuse” the corridor). Escalation remains coherent and agency‑driven, though the internal risk calculus stays cool rather than viscerally fraught. The quiet resolution feels earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (“foresight in action,” “singular convergence,” “hazy precision”) emerges through repeated, reweighted particulars, not lecture. The patch’s reprise and the refusal to cheer enact a disciplined ethic over heroics. A few explicit lines risk thesis‑scent (“Hazy precision is an ethic”), but they harmonize with the character’s occupational idiom. The ending offers a resonant non‑moral answer: attention and refusal as salvation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice blends technical acuity with lyric compression, maintaining consistent distance and knowledge. Diction and syntax feel like this investigator’s mind; dialogue is spare, functional, and subtextual. Rhythm modulates with pressure without breaking legibility. No head‑hopping or register spills.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lines carry multi‑function density—image, action, and concept—with clean momentum. Figurative language is fresh and controlled (e.g., “dust devil…grow teeth and timing”) without muddle or excess. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports the scene’s breathing and tightening. The final cadence recharges earlier motifs without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A rare synthesis of procedural investigation and lyric weather‑craft; “singular convergence” reframed as a practical ethic is fresh. The container‑city microclimate as antagonist feels original and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, quiet climax) heighten rather than blur stakes. The final image is distinctive and memorable without gimmickry.</comment>
