<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific—protect the roses and resolve “inner static”—and it tightens under pressure as the pumps flip and the roses overdrink. The contradiction between system‑obedience (“Systems will not allow it”) and the chosen gesture (the illicit mini‑burn) acts in scene. Embodied perception and micro‑choices (“I miniaturize the burn,” “seed it with the moth wing”) reveal values with a modest felt cost. The change at the end reads as earned renunciation toward a new stance rather than a neat epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the magnetic shift and pump reversal raise pressure; the miniaturized burn is the act that reweights the system, landing in an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the first lines (greenhouse dome, desert, caretaker). The cost is real if subtle—risking damage, defying system logic, and accepting a new “map”—and persists in the charged final image of workable storm. Setups (tin, north drift) pay off without deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dome, pumps, tilt, and crystalline roses are tactile and purpose‑driven; the environment constrains tactics (must miniaturize heat in glass). Systems and tools (valves, arrays, nutrient fog) are integrated into action rather than touristed. Recurring objects (tin, moth wing) function as micro‑setting that charge the last image. World rules stay consistent, with the magnetic drift felt as “tilt,” and the setting’s logic shapes the solution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (contain the roses’ thirst/system destabilization) and tightens with the hard click and polarity flip. The key turn is the decision to contravene system homeostasis via a controlled, mini burn that narrows options and carries risk in a glass dome. Internal and external pressures braid effectively, with the roses’ “desire” angling into the paths mirroring the narrator’s own need. The price is more conceptual than visceral but lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—the tin of fears, the compass drift, the controlled burn—to answer how to live in flux: contain chaos without denial. The final insight (“workable storm”) reweights earlier images and avoids false symmetry. One sentence edges toward moralizing (“That is how you survive a world that moves under you”), but it’s earned by the preceding action and image. Subtext carries through image rather than lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and coherently android‑human, with a calibrated technical lexicon (“polarity flips,” “nutrient fog”) braided with sensuous image. Psychic distance is steady and modulates under pressure; purposeful elision is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or register drift; the perceptual signature (“radio of empty frequencies,” “low snow of memory”) remains consistent. Rhythm tightens at the turn and relaxes at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line work is dense but controlled; images are fresh and mostly non‑redundant, carrying multiple jobs per sentence. The figurative texture stays legible in peak beats (“water burns in memory…”) without muddling cause/effect. Minimal scaffold and no evident synonym loops; momentum is maintained across paragraph turns. A handful of lush metaphors could be thinned, but they don’t blunt the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—android caretaker, mineral roses, compass drift, and a ritualized micro‑burn using a child’s fear tin—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from established logic rather than late rule changes, and risk‑taking in diction and concept heightens stakes. The controlled‑burn-as-pedagogy for both roses and self is a non‑obvious, memorable angle. Specific images avoid template sci‑fi tropes and carry emotional truth.</comment>
