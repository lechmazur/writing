<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The guide’s motive—rescuing dying arts—translates into concrete, pressured choices (inventing the bread-initials ritual, wielding the lens, leading the waterfall test). Interiority is vivid and specific (“nectar armor, sweet and unbearable”) with a credible flaw: the “historically oriented” compulsion that risks embalming rather than nursing. Relationship dynamics with Senka are legible and shift as responsibility is transferred. If anything, the protagonist’s competence smooths struggle slightly, reducing visible cost mid-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: ritual density and object rules (the lens selects survival) build to the public trial under the falls, reweighted by the stranger’s correction and the gifting of the lens. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the guide accepts stewardship with cost and a seasonal obligation. Orientation is clear early (who/where/mission), and causal links (bread → softened wax → legible faces → ritual) hold. The cost is felt: burden accepted, names now literally eaten to endure, and the guide leaves under a charged vow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is uniquely embodied—the grotto’s damp, beeswax scent, and the waterfall’s “cold lace” actively constrain tactics and shape the climactic test. The emerald lens and snail-shell vents function as micro-settings that govern survival and method. World rules (lens selects what endures; wax won’t take impressions) are consistent and dramatized through action. The final image is charged by place and tool, not mere postcard detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving names/arts against dissolution—is present from the outset and tightens through the lens rule revelation to the risky waterfall rite. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation (proposing the bread method, choosing what survives, staging the test). The stranger’s arrival risks convenience but reframes only a secondary tension (murder rumor) without solving the central pressure. Cost is visible in assuming the lens and instituting vows that bind the community.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around nourishment as memory—bread, wax, honey, and names as edible testimony—without moralizing. The lens reweights care/curation as an ethical filter; the vow to “keep our names warm” finds a non-literal answer in eating one’s own initial while remembering another. Subtext about authority, selection, and communal grief is carried in ritual, not thesis. The closing reprices history as embodied, perishable, and sustained through shared appetite and burden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (“rosewater dread,” “hive-slick rope”). No head-hopping; elisions and mosaics are taught and legible. Rhythm modulates with pressure (ritual cadence at the falls, quick, declarative shift with the stranger). Diction remains character-true and precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with multi-function images; figurative language is rich yet coherent and forward-driving. No scaffolding loops or muddled metaphors; sentences vary in length and purpose to maintain propulsion. Key beats are shown, not summarized, and syntax supports rising pressure. Final lines cleanly recharge earlier motifs without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—a curator in a drowned grotto preserving culture by baking initials seen through a survival-selecting lens—is striking and organic, not gimmicky. Turns feel inevitable from seeded particulars (lens rule, wax’s failure, bread ritual). Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens stakes while preserving clarity. Emotional truth grounds the novelty, especially in the communal vow and the burdened acceptance.</comment>
