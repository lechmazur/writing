<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character-particular interiority grounded in tactile craft; the narrator’s patience and listening ethos drive every micro‑choice. The internal tension—certainty versus humility—surfaces credibly in “Noise is not always error” and the later vow to “unlearn” silence. Actions (rebalancing, muting, sanding) align with motive under pressure. The cost is subtle but legible as endurance and renunciation rather than dramatic sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: quake → misalignment → noisy chronometer reinterpreted → re‑tuning → sharper image → faint heat tremor captured. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the chronometer’s “message” and the final decision to unlearn the Moon’s “silence.” Orientation is immediate (lunar observatory, night after landslide). Cost reads as risked data loss, time, and a relinquished dogma rather than spectacle, but it’s on‑page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, dome, pier alignment, cooling lines, and the frantic chronometer constrain tactics and charge the final image. Technical details are selective and lived‑in, filtered through a repairer’s priorities (“smear a photon over three pixels,” “muted a whining regulator”). Environment actively shapes choices and risk. Atmosphere and tool‑as‑setting fuse to thematic payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—catching a faint lunar tremor against noise—tightens via the quake’s tiny misalignment and the chronometer’s “plea.” Escalation is a deepening of interpretation and calibration culminating in the quarter‑turn click to painful sharpness. Agency drives the turns; the price is endurance and relinquishing certainty, not a dramatic loss. Pressure remains coherent and grows to a meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening to “noise,” humility before the supposedly “changeless” Moon, and answering faint signals. The leaf motif reweights meaning at the end, tying early patience to the final stance. One near‑thesis line (“We would unlearn...”) is earned by the scene’s struggle. The ending’s conceptual repricing lingers without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, assured lyric voice with a repairer’s lexicon and sensory bias; metaphors felt and apt (“metronome for a sky whose rhythm had shifted”). POV remains stable and plausibly knowledgeable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening around key adjustments and easing into the closing cadence. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; most lines do double duty (world + psychology). Lushness risks purple but stays coherent; images interlock rather than blur. No notable loops or cadence templates, and the final image is clean. Minor metaphor saturation is taste-level, not clarity‑harming.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a sage camera repairer in a lunar observatory decoding “noise” as message, with craft‑level adjustments carrying thematic weight. Recurring objects (chronometer, leaf) turn with earned reweighting. Risks in lyric density and conceptual closure pay off cleanly. The piece feels singular and memorable.</comment>
