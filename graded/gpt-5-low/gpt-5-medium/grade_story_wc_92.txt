<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and consistent—using the blackout to “spark a silent revolution”—and actions align (sundial reading, quill‑holder lockwork, regulator tuning). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, though internal contradiction is muted; the narrator remains highly competent under pressure. The relationship with Fara is warm but functional; the real crucible is the quick turn with Rhun. The final stance shift—“guarding consent instead of fear”—lands, but the visible cost is light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: blackout → coded path → workshop intrusion → Rhun’s arrival → recalibration of the fort → town’s new dusk. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: the fort’s purpose changes and authority rebalances, and the record’s “unexplained” blackout becomes lived knowledge. Orientation is clear early, and set‑ups (sundial, quill holder, cradle of sparks) pay off. The only softness is the low friction of Rhun’s pivot, which trims the felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, tactile, and constraining: the luminous fort’s glare versus glow shapes tactics; the blackout and subterranean workshops govern access and timing. The bronze quill holder and sundial function as micro‑settings/tools that steer choices and charge the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“coals dream under ash,” “lanterns pretend to sleep”). World rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear—transform spectacle to hearth—and pressure coheres through the stealthy traversal and clandestine adjustments. The meaningful tightening occurs with Captain Rhun’s entrance, testing resolve and legitimacy. Resolution derives from the protagonist’s stance and persuasion, not coincidence. However, Rhun’s quick assent reduces the bite of the trade‑off and the sense of jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres around consent versus surveillance, spectacle versus hearth, and the ethics of light; recurring images (locks, breath, hush) reweight at the end. Subtext operates in small actions and tools—the quill holder’s shift from ceremonial to functional power. One line edges toward thesis (“A silent revolution is not the absence of sound; it is the consent of doors.”), but it works as image not sermon. The final image answers the central question without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that never slips in register. Dialogue is sparse yet subtextual and functional (“I wondered who tended this hush.”). Diction sustains tension without opacity, and elisions are taught early by the style and paid off. Rhythm modulates well between hush and urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs and propel without scaffolding. Figurative density is high but coherent within one metaphorical field (light, locks, breath), avoiding mixed vehicles. Minimal redundancy; images land crisply. A faint risk of over‑lyric saturation remains, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—luminous fort, sundial code, bronze quill holder as axis of quiet insurrection—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and conceit cohere and heighten meaning without gimmickry. Turns arise from established tools and motives rather than late rule changes. The piece avoids template beats and carves a memorable conceptual space.</comment>
