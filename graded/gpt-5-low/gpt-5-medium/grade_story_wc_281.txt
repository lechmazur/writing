<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motives are clear and particular: easing grief by retrieving memory through a jointly devised method. The narrator’s anxiety (misreading taps) and Mara’s skepticism/affection give live contradiction. Micro‑choices under pressure (counting down, resuming; codifying taps/breaths) reveal values. The emotional shift—Mara not flinching, shoulders softening—reads earned and paid for through vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught and held: breath/tap grammar + wand + geode cohere toward a cadence shift. The static shock interrupts, forcing recalibration, then the method crystallizes into a charged final image (geode set aside; rig stilling). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: kindness-as-method reframes the goal with felt cost (grief confronted, not erased). Orientation is clean early (studio, rain, rig) and supports the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The studio, rig, wand, camera, and geode are tactile and constrain tactics (breath‑aligned passes; arcs from the floor rig; camera “drinks” lines). Weather and light affect action and mood without postcard excess. The geode and rafters reappear to charge the final beat (“willowglass hope” kept in the rafters; geode left dull). Specificity is high and filtered through a practiced eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (placing memory within reach) and pressure coheres via misreads, skepticism, and the jolt of static that forces a reset. The tightening is gentle but present: a pause/countdown → recommitment → successful recall with visible effort. Costs are emotional and embodied rather than plot‑heavy; they register but never bite hard. Resolution arises from the protagonists’ chosen method rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kindness as method, art as conduit, and grief’s navigation emerge from action and image. The line “the trick is kindness...” risks stating theme, but it’s dramatized by the subsequent, quiet cure. Recurring images (lantern near stairs, river forgiving a field) reweight the premise at the end. Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature holds steady; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from hush to steadied breath to stillness). Dialogue is spare and subtextual, fitting each speaker. No head‑hopping or stance slips; certainty never exceeds what the POV can know. Elision is purposeful and taught early by the style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry layered work—image, action, and interior charge—without padding. Figurative density is high but coherent and thematically yoked to light, mapping, and breath; no mixed metaphors blur sense. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies to match tempo. One mild on‑the‑nose thematic line is absorbed by strong surrounding craft.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—light painting, telepathy pill recall as attentional tuning, somatic grammar, a muscovite seed—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density; conceptual method) heighten stakes and land clearly. The final reconfiguration is surprising yet earned by prior particulars. Emotional truth is specific, not template‑bound.</comment>
