<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and pressure-shaped: find who tried to kill her and decide what to do with the ledger. The internal conflict is on the page—guild justice vs. destruction—resolved by the annealed “midpoint” choice with visible conceptual cost. Embodied perception (sand chilling bones, rod singing) reveals psyche under stress. If anything, the rival remains off-stage, trimming relational crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image-density builds to a Charged Poise closure—an annealed plan that forecloses other paths. Orientation is clear from the opening (canyon, night, aftermath), and each move (ledger → frost → rival → plan) coheres. Cost is legible on the page (“He’ll claim I forged it” vs. “truth unfixed”); the chosen tactic binds her to the canyon and dawn. The persistent constraint of frost/dawn and the canyon’s acoustics shapes the final option set.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon, frost, and kiln-world objects are not backdrop; they constrain method and charge the ending. Dawn frost as writing medium and canyon acoustics as witness reconfigure tactics and meaning. Sensory detail is selective and professional (crown glass, anneal, rod’s song). Space and weather steer action rather than decorate it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (justice and truth without self-erasure) tightens through the frost-reading revelation and the triage of options. The choice to anneal the ledger forecloses both easy routes and carries reputational and physical risk. Escalation is quiet but tangible: evidence identification → rival implication → procedural dilemma → charged plan. A live confrontation is deferred, but the cost and stance crystallization are clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Heat/cold, sound/silence, pause/pressure motifs braid into a coherent meditation on witness and making. The final image—fused ledger, dawn-readable, canyon as kiln of listening—reprices truth and craft without moralizing. Insights arise from particulars (gaps between names become routes). Thematic complexity holds without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is singular, precise, and craft-authentic; diction and rhythm match a glass artist’s mind under lyric pressure. Patterned metaphors are consistent (anneal, crown glass, frost filigree) and modulate intensity at turns. No head-hopping or register slips; purposeful elision pays off. The line “I am steadily adaptive” risks label-ness but is redeemed by the enacted solution.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double duty. Figurative language is abundant but controlled; metaphors cohere to a glass/frost/acoustic palette. Rhythm varies and propels toward the charged final plan. A few intensifiers could be trimmed, but clarity and cadence survive peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: forensic frost-reading and canyon acoustics as tribunal for a glass artist’s near-murder. The ledger as both evidence and material to be annealed is ingenious and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without muddying sense. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through to a non-obvious resolution.</comment>
