<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (retrieve logbook vs “seek out the joy beneath anguish”) drives concrete micro‑choices: angling goggles for cipher, calming the elevator, opening and then arranging letters without trespass. Contradictory impulses—duty versus gentleness; myth of Mirek versus purposeful detachment—run concurrently. The final vow and curation choice read as an earned renunciation of possessive impulse. Slightly soft cost keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the floor‑by‑floor ascent and pays off with a resonant reconfiguration: “encrypted against despair” reframes the mission, and the narrator assumes stewardship. Orientation is crisp from the outset (elevator, spire, assignment). Closure lands on the page with a clear stance change and conceptual cost (keeping what breaks you close, curating others’ grief). The elevator’s stop and open arrangement of letters seal the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, shaft, frost flowers, and elevator “throat” are not backdrop; they constrain tactics (scattered light through frost, the vertical clock of floors) and charge the final image. Tools and micro‑settings (goggles, tin, shelves) integrate with environment to unlock meaning. Sensory specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered, with weather actively shaping choices. The setting’s logic remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens via cadence and discovery: each rise adds a functional layer (goggles → cipher → keys in refusals → shelves = absences). The decisive tightening is the recognition that the encryption resists despair, forcing a choice of curation over possession. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than peril‑based, but it meaningfully narrows options at the crest. A slight softness in external risk keeps stakes elegant but contained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (joy smuggled beneath anguish; affection as decryption) emerges through image and act, not sermon. The diary’s line “Keep what breaks you…” reweights the entire ascent without reading as authorial moralizing because it’s diegetic and earned. Subtext—care as method, encryption against despair, non‑trespass curation—operates consistently and charges the last tableau. The ending invites reflection without closing ambiguity down.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical POV with controlled metaphor and disciplined rhythm; diction fits the character’s sensibility and world. The voice modulates with pressure (soothing bolts, micro‑oaths, final vow) and keeps psychic distance stable. Purposeful elision is taught by the patterned “rise” structure and remains legible. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; sentences propel without scaffolding or loops. Figurative load is rich but mostly coherent and pattern‑grounded (light, frost, throat, coins), avoiding muddle. A few near‑purple flourishes brush the edge, but clarity holds, especially at closure. Mechanics are clean and sequencing precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Airship lore, elevator‑as‑throat, and “encryption against despair” synthesize into a fresh, inevitable design. The scattered‑light method and ten‑rise structure are inventive without gimmickry and grow logically from the premise. The final conceptual reweighting feels both surprising and retrospectively seeded. Risks in diction and structure heighten resonance while preserving clarity.</comment>
