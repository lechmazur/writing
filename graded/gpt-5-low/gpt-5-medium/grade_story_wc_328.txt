<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (undercover cryptid researcher) and a credible internal tension between “hero” and “keeper” culminate in a chosen surrender. Specific embodied tells (“ache that arrives when something nearby wants to metamorphose,” hairs lifting) ground emotion. Micro-choices—pressing the arrowhead to ear, planting it, singing static, accepting being kept—align with the character’s values. The acceptance carries real cost: autonomy traded for stewardship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: images accrue (phone, arrowhead, seedlings, drain) toward a charged descent and consent to be keeper. Closure lands on the page with cost (“keepers sometimes must be kept” → “I stayed on…”), a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the pattern taught by midpiece pays off in the staircase and choir. Each move coheres: phone → instruction → song → opening → names → consent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underground garden is tactile, strange, and directive: drain-breathing floor, vertebrae stairs, bulbs that follow, roots reading masonry. Environment constrains choices (descent through the drain, light’s behavior guiding movement) and charges the final image of kept stewardship. Object-as-setting (arrowhead/“tooth”) integrates seamlessly with space and rules. Sensory range is wide yet purposeful, especially sound/pressure in the choir.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to engage the untamed harmony without becoming lost—tightens through the arrowhead gambit and the phone’s instruction. The decisive turn is singing static and planting the arrowhead, which opens the way and demands a commitment. The keeper-not-hero calculus registers as a trade of freedom for belonging. Escalation is clear for lyric mode, though the external risk remains more numinous than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres around hospitality versus naming, bitterness reworked into a cosmic joke, and consent to be remade. Recurring motifs (“frostbitten hope,” the tooth/seed, bulbs’ play) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final stance answers the piece’s question by choosing stewardship with cost. Occasional explicit lines (“I spoke aloud the mission…”) flirt with telling but are earned by action and voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature (iron-tasting patience, backward-weeping gravel). POV remains tight and credible; elisions are purposeful and paid off. Dialogue fragments carry subtext and pressure without over-explaining. Rhythm modulates well from observational to incantatory during the singing and descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density imagery largely serves momentum and clarity; the pattern is taught early so lushness reads deliberate, not purple. No significant loops or scaffold; lines often carry dual duty (world and emotion). A few stacked metaphors approach saturation but do not blur the closure image. Syntax and pacing accelerate appropriately during the opening of the drain and the final consent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: janitorial cover + cryptid research + herbarium undercity + “harmony untamed” as embodied pressure feels singular. The arrowhead-as-tooth/comet-pruner and “sing the hiss between stations” are fresh, tactically meaningful turns. The risk of embracing a keeper role under a living garden’s terms lands as non-obvious yet inevitable. The piece commits fully to its own logic without retreat.</comment>
