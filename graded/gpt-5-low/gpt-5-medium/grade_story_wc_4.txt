<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive and specific interiority: the “subtle puzzle archivist” frames method and choices, with calm hands offered as a borrowed rhythm. Contradiction lands (perceptively calm vs. an admitted tremble) and informs tactics. Micro‑choices (circle, mirror reveal, route test, refusal of the ride to face ruins) feel coherent. Relationship pressure is light but credible (the mayor’s deference and communal need), enough for this scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual builds density from circle to mirror to corridor walk to final word‑kites. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: the town’s breathing “less fractured,” the weighted case, and the choice to walk the ruins mark a before/after with emotional cost (unnamed trembling points, endurance to keep walking). Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/why). Setups (case, photos, lavender/factory) pay off in the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated—lavender, bees, diesel ghosts, factory ribs—filtered through the archivist’s sensibility. Environment shapes action: rows become a memory corridor; the map case’s mirror snags sunset; ruins and field frame ritual choices. Sensory palette is varied and purposeful. Minor cap below 9 as the environment constrains gently rather than forcing a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“chart their grief”) is signaled early and tightened through staged acts (circle stories → mirror reveal → walking the route → final word offering). The material cost is subdued but legible in the trembling “places we have not named” and the protagonist’s solitary walk to face the ruins. Escalation is a cadence shift consistent with the lens rather than a causal reversal, yet it meaningfully reweights options. Earned resolution arises from the protagonist’s method and stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory, ritualized repair, and transforming labor into art emerge through particulars (twine, ribbons, field rows, mirror). Subtext operates in images (humor as hallway; mirror binding faces to light) rather than sermonizing, despite one direct articulation of aim. The final acts offer a resonant, non‑literal answer: healing as a walkable map learned by feet. Ambiguity remains (unnamed trembling spots), enriching aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled voice—earnest whimsy grounded by tactile detail—stays stable and confident. Perceptual signature is specific (engines and moonlight; bees as punctuation), and modulation under pressure is clean. No head‑hopping or register slips; dialogue snippets fit status dynamics and tone. Patterned lyricism is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do double duty (world, theme, and action). Repetition (“as vines climb”) is intentional and rhythmic, not a loop; metaphors cohere to the machine/field lexicon. A touch lush but controlled, with no figurative muddle at the end. Syntax varies and propels without clutter or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a “puzzle archivist” mapping grief with photos, ribbons, and a mirrored map case in a lavender field by rusted factories feels singular. Risks (ritual method, lyric tone, mirror reveal) heighten stakes and cohere through to the charged final image. Turns grow from established pattern rather than late tricks. Emotional truth reads particular rather than templated.</comment>
