<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (to slow a town through “humble rebellion”) animates concrete actions; interiority is specific (“title never fit my shoes,” trembling plans). Contradictory impulses—strategist vs. doubter—coexist on the page. The earned renunciation at the end (“live with our next moves unfinished”) feels credible, though the cost remains subtle rather than bite-hard visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: windows, grotto, clock chime, and deliberate stalemate build toward a quiet reconfiguration. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the town accepts unfinished moves; price is the refusal of quick decision. Stakes and pattern cohere, though the cost signal is more conceptual than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the magnetic grotto disrupts compasses and thematically reweights choice; the library’s chime triggers the synchronized reveal. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the coach’s perception. The final image (“magnets do not force, only suggest and wait”) directly charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (slowing the town) is signaled early and deepens via the synchronized windows and the staged stalemate. The clock’s single ring and moonrise provide a tangible tightening. Cost registers as the foreclosed path of decisive victory; effective but muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of hesitation, listening, and communal pacing emerge organically from particulars (metronomes stopped, uncut cloth, stalemate). A few lines edge into thesis (“decisions need a longer cradle than a clock”), trimming some subtextual charge. Still, the ending reweights prior images with resonance rather than summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the narrator’s sensibility. Psychic distance is steady; elisions are purposeful. Minor risk of aphoristic tilt in late lines, but overall modulation remains disciplined.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density lines carry multiple jobs; images are fresh and internally coherent (“needles hold still,” “shoes thinking”). Figurative texture is lush yet mostly controlled; minimal redundancy. A touch of abstraction creeps into the final didactic phrases but doesn’t dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—civic choreography plus a chess stalemate as rebellion—feels fresh and inevitable by the close. The magnetic grotto and synchronized windows elevate beyond trope. Bold, quiet risk pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
