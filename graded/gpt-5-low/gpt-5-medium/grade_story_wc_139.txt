<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motives are vivid and particular: the narrator’s hunger for a “fair trade” collides with a legacy of cons, producing concrete choices (ledger, refusal to lie, hand steady on Arman’s shoulder). Interiority is embodied and precise, not abstract. Micro-choices under pressure feel real and value-driven (theatre for the camera, timing the breach, taking evidence instead of money). The cost—risking legal and moral exposure—is felt without melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: the director’s habit with the bolt and the shift-change reset create the window; the dolly push, camera blink, and van handoff culminate in on‑page change. Closure lands with cost via the signed witness, the evidence transfer, and the cleaning of residual warmth. A hairline convenience (the director reliably leaves the bolt hanging) is seeded early and reads earned. The ending’s conceptual repricing (fairness as math, not miracle) is grounded by tangible consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prep room is tactile and constraining: cameras, alarms, vents, the reset chime, and the service door shape tactics. Sensory specificity is rich and purposeful (citrus/ethanol, gel chill, “air that tastes like coins”). The ink pot functions as micro‑setting, charging choices and the final image. Environment consistently guides action, not just mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (move Arman to asylum) and tightens at the director’s entrance and the timed alarm reset. The breach forecloses alternatives and tests the narrator’s ethic (won’t lie if stopped), adding moral pressure. The visible price is understated but present: legal risk through signed witnessing and possession of incriminating numbers. Escalation is clean and coherent under the causal lens, if quiet rather than explosive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honest exchange versus fraud accrues through ledger, ink, and the “inverse function” motif, with a resonant repricing at the end. A couple of lines verge on overt statement (“If I write, I must write the truth”), but they remain anchored in action. The final image (cleaning warmth, ink‑moon’s tide) deepens questions of fairness without sermonizing. Subtext—camera theatre, sponsors’ “invisible passport of touch”—does strong work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident first‑person with crisp professional noticing and lyrical compression. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from poised observation to precise, timed moves) without losing clarity. The diction and imagery feel inseparable from this narrator’s mind. No POV leakage; brief dialogue is integrated and character‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with controlled lyricism; images are fresh and non‑redundant (“calendar without numbers,” “air that tastes like coins”). Figurative texture is consistent and purposeful; momentum rarely stalls. Minor risk of saturation is offset by clean sequencing and causal connectors. The closing cadence is sharp and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Smuggling asylum through a funeral prep room via “waiting actively,” a ledger, and a vintage ink pot is an original synthesis. The fairness calculus against a con‑man legacy reconfigures familiar rescue stakes. Risks taken in diction and structure heighten coherence rather than obscure it. The final repricing feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
