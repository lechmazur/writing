<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Compelling interior contradiction (“closure seeker who opens wounds”) fuels concrete choices: descending without a lamp, letting plants lead, and breaking Mira’s hourglass. Embodied detail (numb fingers, pins of sensation) grounds emotion. The sacrifice of the hourglass reads as a felt cost aligned with her flaw. A hairline risk remains around how smoothly the “displaced miracle” motivates the exact ritual, but it holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs accrete toward a decisive ritual that reweights stakes. Orientation is clear early (tower at dawn, post‑anesthesia), and the two‑shard structure (tower → tunnel) threads because/therefore continuity. Closure lands on the page with cost: cracking the hourglass and planting the ivy in the fossil ring. The price—relinquishing Mira’s object and accepting a non‑reversal—reads unmistakably.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the tower’s cold steadies the tremor; the tunnel’s moss/ferns guide and frame the vigil; the fossilized coffee ring anchors the act. Recurring objects (hourglass, cups/rings, ivy) operate as micro‑settings that constrain the final choice. Sensory selection is disciplined and POV‑true, sustaining tone without tourist cataloguing. World rules (plant telepathy) are consistently learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep opening wounds to seek closure—tightens as she chooses action over rumination and renounces the keepsake. The reversal is internal-to-external: from scrying coffee rings to irrevocably pouring sand into a fossil ring. Cost is legible in the loss of the hourglass and the acceptance that the miracle won’t be “put back.” Pressure coheres under the chosen lens without needing an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: closure as cultivation, not a gate; misallocated grace and the ethics of carrying it. The final image (“not a gate but a garden”) reweights prior motifs (rings, roots, hush) without sermonizing. Subtext lives in the trade—the hourglass’s time repurposed into growth—answering the central question with resonance. No platitude; complexity persists alongside acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains coherence and modulates with pressure (“pins of sensation return,” “meteor hush”). Elision is purposeful and taught early; no head‑hopping or register drift. Psychic distance and certainty fit the POV’s lived texture. A few heightened lines flirt with density, but cadence remains disciplined.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do double duty (coffee rings as grief tide lines and method). Figurative language is consistent (botanical/time lexicon) and rarely overmixed; rhythm varies well. Minimal scaffold; no loops that dull momentum. Slight lushness in clusters is controlled and does not cloud the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: plant telepathy + coffee‑ring divination + displaced miracle reframed through a sacrificial, tactile act. The hourglass-to-ring transference feels inevitable in hindsight and not gimmicky. Risks (lyric density, conceptual premise) heighten stakes and pay off with clarity. The piece reads singular rather than template‑driven.</comment>
