<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and embodied: hunger and the mother’s absence funnel into a string of micro-choices (freezing at the crack, slipping on the tag, sounding each note, stepping into glare). Interiority is specific to a “spiral-shell cartographer” who reads world-patterns rather than abstractions. The key tension—warn the city vs. follow the lattice—is live at the peak and resolved with cost. A hairline note: the internal contradiction is present but could tighten one more notch before the final step.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern density builds (shell seams, rhythms of five/six/five, lattice grammar) to a Charged Poise/DC—stepping into the corridor to be “measured.” Orientation is clean early (city on turtle shells; gate rusted shut; mother missing) and all set-ups pay off (tag, ledger, whistle notes). Cost is legible in the corridor image and conceptual repricing (“measures, not mercies”) lands. Causal threads are tidy without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is singular and functional: shells dictate routes, gullies hold lashings and ledger, wind and algae roofs calibrate the whistle, and the watchers’ spacing literally opens the path. Sensory specifics are purposeful and POV-shaped (barnacle constellations, pulse of shell). Environment constrains the final choice via the corridor of glare and the city’s hunger pressure. No postcard excess; details carry tactical weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake—seek an answer at personal risk—tightens through tangible turns: the crack → mother’s tag; ledger → lattice grammar; watchers turning → corridor of glare. The final decision forecloses retreat, with cost implied as annihilating measurement. Internal/external threads braid (duty to city vs. drive to ask). Escalation is clean and unbroken under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres without moralizing: questions vs. mercy, measurement vs. humanity, inheritance of risk, and the ethics of being “counted.” The watchers’ answer—spacing as response—reweights the world and reframes the lost expedition as a unit of distance. The final image rings with conceptual cost and refuses tidy comfort. Recurring objects (whistle, lattice) convert symbolism into action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a professional perceptual signature (pattern-reading mind) sustains across pressure. Diction is consistent and earned; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates toward the climax without sacrificing clarity. Purposeful elision (world rules through use) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do double duty for world and psychology. Figurative language is fresh and coherent, rarely overstacked; repetition (“five, then six, then five”) is functional, not ornamental. Minor saturation risk is kept in check by momentum, especially near the ending. No loops or filter-verb stacks dulling the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Concept and execution feel singular: a cartographer of spiral shells, wind-charting whistle notes as a speech-act, watchers that reply by spacing. The mother’s map becoming a unit of measure is a sharp, non-obvious reweighting. Risks (dense worldbuilding in brief span; lyric closure) pay off cleanly. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
