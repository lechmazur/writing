<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear from the opening and deepens credibly as the vow meets the practice of weighing griefs. Interiority is particular and embodied (“saltshaken hand,” “ledger of bone”) and the fear revealed near dawn complicates the stated aim. The micro‑choices—asking permission, adjusting stance, naming weights—show values under pressure. Slight neatness in the final acceptance keeps a hair of ambiguity cost from cutting deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned actions (orienting, threading, weighing) build to a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator reorients to shelf their own fear. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and the closure lands on the page with cost—admitting the fear of being “weighed beyond my marrow” and revaluing it as duty. The lamp guttering and ledger drying provide a concrete cadence shift that seals the before/after. A whisper more constraining consequence would tip this into the 9s.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposive: the bronze grotto, river, and lamp shape perception and tactics (light buys a path; echoes, drips, and mineral “bronze” inform the work). The “shingled hush” bridges cave and city and returns with new function at the end. Though constraint is soft rather than hard, the environment charges the final image. Rich sensory weave avoids tourist cataloging by staying task‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens as public burdens cede to the private, with a mid‑scene deepening (soldier’s name that can’t be lifted alone) and a peak test (the narrator’s own fear). The decisive tactic—orienting—costs honesty and posture; the weaver’s touch nudges but doesn’t solve, preserving agency. Stakes are internal but legible, shifting from competence to vulnerability. The piece resists melodrama and earns its quiet turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of grief’s weight, naming, and ethical handling emerge through image and action, not moralizing. Recurrences (“shingled hush,” coins, ledger, breath/orientation) revalue at the end, offering an answer: not to lessen but to place burdens truthfully. The soldier/widow beats complicate any tidy universal. The final reframe to “duty” carries conceptual price without didactic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice—tactile, marine‑mineral in diction—remains consistent and controlled; syntax modulates with pressure and never frays into vagueness. The POV stays tight to the narrator’s sensorium; the weaver’s lines feel integrated and spare. Inventive coinages (“saltshaken,” “whalebone reverie”) serve effect rather than flourish. No head‑hopping or register slips undermine control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High figurative density is largely coherent and work‑bearing; images cross‑reference rather than collide (“coins discussing the afterlife of pockets,” “lamp buying a path”). Momentum holds; little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. A few lush stacks flirt with excess, but cadence and clarity remain intact through the closure beat. Line endings carry image and consequence cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise and imagery feel fresh: a ritual of weighing burdens via orientation in a bronze grotto guided by a “Fractal weaver.” Risk‑taking in diction and concept coheres into a singular vision. Turns grow organically from the taught pattern rather than twistiness. The emotional truth lands with specificity rather than generic uplift.</comment>
