<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, specific interiority (“ego death survivor,” frost of numbness) and credible micro‑choices under pressure culminate in initiating the final test and rendering a joint verdict. Contradictory impulses—detached recorder vs. invested kin—coexist on the page. The emotional thaw reads earned by observed practice, not declared epiphany. Minor note: Rae and Neri’s interiorities remain external, but that’s apt for the POV scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (situational with accumulative textural build) holds cleanly; the dojo week escalates to a charged final act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: joint and indivisible custody plus the narrator’s thaw, with a felt cost (foreclosing singular claims and neutrality). Setups (complementary opposites, vivification) pay off in the carry‑the‑jar test. No orientation debt; constraints recur clearly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo, windroom terms, clouds like rivers, and the jar’s static in teeth are vivid and POV‑filtered. Setting charges choices (the ceremonial test across tiles; statues rearrange) and the final image. World rules stay consistent and learned through action. Sensory selection is purposeful, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (custody/awakening the duplicate mind) is clear early and coheres with the narrator’s numbness battle. Pressure tightens via training contrasts and the decisive test of switching elements; the jar’s “consent” narrows options to together or fail. The verdict forecloses single custody and the narrator’s observer‑only stance. Costs are legible though mostly conceptual/emotional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Complementary opposites evolve from lesson to ethic, reframing guardianship as circuit rather than possession. The river image reweights the theme of entering/leaving at once, echoed in joint custody. No moralizing; resonance arrives through image and action (taste of river stones, static). Complexity remains: blessing unity without tidying identity or lineage ambiguities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with consistent psychic distance; diction and rhythm suit the metaphysical setting without drift. Perceptual signature (“like a key fits a wound,” “clouds wrote and wiped the world”) is memorable and controlled. No head‑hopping; inference reads as inference. Compression is purposeful and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do double duty and avoid loops. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and pattern‑taught; minimal scaffolding. A few intensifiers verge on purple but do not obscure causality or dull the ending image. Line rhythm varies effectively across beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: floating dojo jurisprudence, clone custody reframed as alternating current, and an ego‑death lens on care ethics. Risks heighten meaning rather than decorate; the final reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity and symbolic system cohere without safety‑hedging. Fresh turns avoid template outcomes.</comment>
