<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—uplifting the unnamed dock workers—drives concrete choices (starting the Ledger, forgiving demurrage, planning discounts) and she risks social capital by publishing quiet names. Her “cautious exuberance” threads through action rather than label alone, and Jun’s counter‑texture complements her. Interiority is lyric rather than deep psychological torque, so the internal contradiction (risk vs recognition) is felt but not combatively dramatized. The closing key‑handoff is a credible renunciation of sole custodianship with a mild but legible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build from misaddressed envelope to Ledger to public naming, culminating in shared custodianship and a charged promise. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s attention has been retuned, and Mara/Jun accept an ongoing cost of stewardship. Orientation is clean early (harbor, open‑air library, night librarian). The tightening is gentle rather than stark, but the final image reweights the premise with a clear before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The breezy, colonnaded roof with swaying lamps and gulls is vivid and integrated into action (late openings “after the symphony,” roof rehearsals, rolling the cart outside). The locket functions as a charged object that anchors the desk and final display, and the harbor weather and sounds shape cadence and choices. Specificity feels filtered through the characters’ professional sensibilities (manifests, pier logs, resin), avoiding postcard genericity. Environment charges the ending rather than just decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes centralize on whether recognition can be pursued without spectacle, with the envelope complication leading to a Ledger that tests Mara’s resolve in public. The deepening arrives via naming Hideo Arai and inviting the granddaughter to speak, then the public signing—each step increases exposure and potential social cost. The explicit prices are modest but present (forgiven fees, public stance, transfer of the key). Escalation is accumulative and coherent, not reversal‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—attention as an ethical act and compassion as cyclical—is earned through specific exchanges (fee waived → demurrage forgiven; locket → granddaughter’s arrival → public gratitude). Subtext hums in images (gulls falling quiet, the ledger as “harbor music”) without overt moralizing. The final promise reframes the harbor’s sounds as a shared duty, a conceptual repricing rather than a neat lesson. No late motif grabs; the symbols are seeded and pay off.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, musical, and consistent in a close third that favors textured, tidal diction. Dialogue is minimal but pointed, with Jun’s “tide‑smile” and attentiveness legible in action rather than exposition. Psychic distance and tense remain stable; patterning (“after the symphony ends”) is taught and reprises. The lyric register matches the setting and never breaks plausibility for the focal stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images do multi‑work (violin resin for splinters), sentences vary, and momentum carries without scaffolding. Figurative density is high but coherent within the maritime/music palette, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal redundancy; no noticeable template cadences or filter‑verb stacks. The closing image is clean and earned without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “open‑air library under stars” and a civic ledger of quiet debts feel fresh, with inventive details (bookmark from spare rope; “straightens the horizon line”) that elevate beyond familiar small‑town uplift. The mistaken‑address inciting object avoids contrivance by shaping multiple beats. Emotional truth emerges through specific, local economies of care; the piece commits to its gentle risk profile without hedging. It’s distinctive and memorable without gimmickry.</comment>
