<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular—“Static had tempers; silence had accents”—and the narrator’s ethos (cautious hope held until evidence) drives choices. Temptation vs. principle surfaces under pressure when the wave offers tenure and the dean offers a chair. Embodied moments (tingling palms, hiss to breath to friction) ground the thinking. The renunciation at the end feels earned and costs status/power.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative texture and clear causal turns: detect anomaly → trace booster → deploy countersigns → resist temptation → redefine channel. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (university radio, midnight, election season). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—refusal of power, reallocation of frequency—with an on‑page price. The sequence tightens logically with the wave’s counter‑pressure and the dean’s constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The radio station’s tools and spaces constrain and enable action: mixer, antenna array, theater booster, mittens in cold. Soundscape and gear are integrated into tactics (phase inversion, subsonic seeding). The environment charges the ending via the labeled emergency frequency and the annotated charts. Specific sensory choices (hiss to breath, cables humming like throat singing) deepen atmosphere without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resist manipulative cadence—intensifies through coherent pressure: dean’s refusal, orchestrated campus symmetries, and the wave’s escalating bribes. The protagonist’s phase‑inversion and countersigns constitute a decisive tightening and test of resolve. The visible cost is a foregone status path and ongoing vigilance. Tension operates at line and beat levels, culminating in a chosen slower, messier civic tempo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: neutrality redefined as a landing pattern for meaning; breath and cadence as civic autonomy. Subtext hums in the wave’s “ear that loved us as noise” and the countersigns that salt pauses into rallies. The final pencil note edges toward a stated moral, though it’s earned via lived tactic and paid cost. The piece leaves resonant ambiguity about vigilance without flattening into sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled voice marries technical lexicon and lyric perception; rhythm modulates with pressure cleanly. POV remains tight and plausible; inference reads as inference, not omniscience. Dialogue snippets (dean, callers) carry status dynamics and subtext economically. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the cadence shift at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images are fresh and purposeful (“arguments practiced righteousness,” “a grin pressed into bone”). Figurative texture is rich yet legible, and syntax varies to match scene tempo. Minor risk of aphoristic neatness at the end, but clarity and propulsion hold. No loops or muddled metaphors impede closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—cosmic manipulation countered by subsonic civic “breath” from a university DJ—feels both novel and inevitable in hindsight. Tools-as-ritual and cadence politics are reimagined with concrete tactics. Risks (lyric diction, conceptual premise) heighten stakes and cohere at closure. The final reconfiguration (emergency channel, refusal of chair) honors the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
