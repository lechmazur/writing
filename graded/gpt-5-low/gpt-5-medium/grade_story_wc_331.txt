<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, specific interiority—duty-bound curiosity versus yearning—drives micro-choices (stepping into the “saddle of space,” reciting theorems, choosing to return). Contradictory impulses (refusing “shock” yet needing to “reawaken” the path) feel earned and embodied. The renunciation—to return with news rather than stay—lands as a credible cost. Secondary figures apply light pressure without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of geometry/sea intensifies until the map opens, then reweights at the card-writing and renunciation. Closure is a charged poise/Earned Stasis: “I must return with news, or else the map will fold shut forever” and she does, paying the opportunity cost. Orientation is clear from the outset; one continuous scene with a single cadence turn. Constraints (patrons browsing, closing time, fold-shut risk) shape the final action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is tactile and rule-bearing: negative curvature, the “saddle” gap, meteorite desk, salt air—all learned through use. Environment actively enables and limits choices (path only opens through hyperbolic practice; must re-enter the public room). Recurring objects (scarf, card) charge the final image. Sensory range is deft without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find where stories live—tightens as the room opens and the map threatens to vanish without news. The key turn is agency-driven: she forgoes going deeper to preserve/translate the discovery for patrons. Stakes remain intimate but legible, with a real trade-off felt in the return. Pressure is coherent, if quiet, throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The motif net (curvature, coastlines, memory as weather) coheres into an earned realization: “Every ending is a coastline” reframes the quest without sermonizing. Final cadence—“not found… seen its weather”—reprices meaning and value of partial knowledge. The scarf and snow reprise charge the ethic of care over conquest. No platitudes; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric “I” with controlled rhythm and technical diction that suits the character. Patterned elisions are taught early and paid off (math/sea/library lexicons braid without leakage). No head-hopping and the modulation under pressure is precise. The voice feels lived-in, not ornamental.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs; metaphor families stay coherent (geometry/sea/shelving) with minimal excess. Rhythm varies, few if any scaffolds or loops, and images advance action. Lushness stops short of purple; clarity holds at the ending beat. Minor saturation risk, but managed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Scientific poetry library + hyperbolic shelving is a fresh, integrated frame that generates tactics and theme. The reawakening through quiet theorems rather than shock is a non-obvious, character-true pivot. Final snow-from-salt turn is surprising yet inevitable within the established logic. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
