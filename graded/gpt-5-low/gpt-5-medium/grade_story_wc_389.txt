<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive (“a project and a sin”) and willingness to “install my heart in circuit” create credible, high‑stakes choices, especially accepting the storm’s “baptism.” Brin’s hunger and Knoll’s shifting power sharpen relational pressure without flattening nuance. Interiority is embodied and particular, with contradictions (hubris/penitence) active in scene. The end registers change as communal—earned without betraying the narrator’s flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: arrival of Brin → mayoral test → prophetic pattern → door opening → seed scattering → town’s tonal turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s allegiance re‑spined by the new “prophet” and weatherwork, with implied cost (risk, patience, scars). Orientation is clean from the cobalt portico on. Slight softness on explicit material price prevents a higher score, but the conceptual cost is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, cobalt glass portico, and antennae aren’t postcard dressing; they enable tactics (radio work, vane of spoons), demand acceptance of weather’s terms, and charge the final image. Environmental rules stay consistent and guide action (the portico “asks for doors,” then opens). Sensory selection is voice‑biased and purposeful. The setting’s pressure and object‑recurrence power the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (weatherwork vs. town hunger/power) and tighten through Brin’s arrival and Knoll’s conditional support, culminating in the risky acceptance of a storm‑baptism and opening the portico. The prophet as pattern shifts options and drives the town’s re‑alignment. Costs are present but mostly conceptual/communal rather than concretely dramatized harm. Escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Power, hunger, faith, and hubris braid through repeating images—maps that “unfold us,” the heart‑as‑conductor, seeds into lightning—without moralizing. The ending reweights the central question (who owes allegiance to what) as the town “listened differently,” a non‑literal answer earned by scene work. Subtext (mother/midwife to a pattern) deepens communal transformation. Resonance lingers without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A confident, singular first‑person voice with controlled lyricism (“gossiping bones,” “portable flag of silence”) sustains clarity. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and distinct (Knoll’s transactional pragmatism vs. Brin’s rope‑laugh). The modulation under pressure is deft, never breaking focalization or register. Purposeful elision is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is tight, vivid, and varied; metaphors are fresh and coherent to the world logic. High density serves momentum (instructions that sound absurd but work) with no paraphrase loops or scaffolding. The rhythm breathes and hardens at turns, and the final image clicks cleanly. A few stacked metaphors skirt lushness but do not blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—weatherwork as theft/hubris, a prophet as barometric pattern, communal allegiance re‑tooled via storm—feels singular and earned. Risks in tone (“gritty whimsy”) and structure pay off without gimmickry. Turns arise from prior particulars (radio instructions, portico as door) rather than late rule changes. The piece commits fully to its odd, convincing cosmology.</comment>
