<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation and flaw are crisply embodied: the compulsion to count heartbeats versus the urge to repair produces concrete micro‑choices (scraping frost with the shard, warming the radio, speaking to interrupt counting). The “death certificate error survivor” identity meaningfully pressures her stance with the digital ghost. Emotion is tactile (iron taste, staccato pulse) and contradictions persist through the fix. Slight safety in tidy competence during the technical repair keeps it just shy of transcendent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens holds: pattern → pressure → recalibration/defragmentation → renunciatory alignment. Closure lands on the page as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the choice to “let the signal fade” and pocket the shard as a lens, not a wound—at felt cost. Orientation is clear from the opaline dome and radio; causality is clean from ghost coordinates to technical rectification to reweighted self‑relation. No soft reset; the before/after is legible and paid for.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely specific and functional: frost on the eyepiece demands scraping, cold forces hands to warm the radio, the dome slit refracts light through the shard. Weather and architecture shape tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection tracks urgency without tourist catalog. The opal dome and ink/heat dynamics feel indispensable to the scene’s logic and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem the failed array/self) is present early and tightens via the ghost’s accusation and the risky choice to re‑enter the burned archive. A decisive deepening occurs with defragmentation and the mentor’s reframing; the final renunciation (letting the signal fade; refusing to feed the wrong ghost) carries cost. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly. Only minor softness: the technical task unfolds smoothly without a visible hazard beyond psychological stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (“fetch wisdom from failure,” hubris vs humility, which ghost to feed) emerges organically from spilled‑ink method, shard/lens, and the mentor’s voice. The final act reweights prior images without moralizing; “a lens cut small for carrying” reframes pain into tool. Purposeful ambiguity lingers around identity and the ghost’s ontology while answering the central question via stance. No sermonizing despite aphoristic lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature (ink as language, snow as lattice). Dialogue is sparse but barbed and goal‑driven, with subtextual pressure (“You left the sky disordered”). Diction remains coherent to this speaker; rhythm modulates under stress (staccato heartbeats, clipped ghost). No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and purposeful recurrence; images do double duty (ink as method and theme). Lushness skirts saturation but stays legible; metaphoric fields (snow/ink/radio/light) cohere without muddle. Minimal redundancy; repeated lines reprise with new charge. Slight risk of over‑ornamentation in a few adjacent metaphors constrains a perfect score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a death‑error survivor dialoguing with her digital ghost through stochastic ink‑reading at an opaline, snow‑hushed observatory. Risks (lyric method, conceptual tech) pay off in stakes and closure rather than feeling gimmicky. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the shard becomes a lens and the ghost yields the mentor’s laugh. Fresh, confident execution that avoids template beats.</comment>
