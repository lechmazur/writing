<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and singular, with a credible tug‑of‑war between envy for past selves and a disciplined present that “bows to chaos without kneeling.” The micro‑choices—using jealousy as a method, bargaining with feral nostalgia, refusing to descend to correct the funeral—reveal values under pressure. Motivation (to distill chaos into narrative) drives every action and is tested. The Earned Stasis at the end (keep walking, accept non‑resurrection) feels paid for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and tactics densify from cabin to scroll to sky‑script, culminating in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Cost is legible where urgency to “correct the program” is replaced by ink and acceptance, and later by choosing to patrol after one’s own funeral. Orientation is clear early; the taught pattern (lyric dream logic) pays off in the reconfigured ending. The closure reweights the premise without hand‑waving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cabin, stove, snow, kettle, and scroll are tactile and function as constraints and resources (stove wants feeding; kettle hisses out; scroll is packed like a wound dressing). Environment charges the final image and tactics (spruce tea for patience; stovepipe underlining the day of death). POV‑filtered detail remains purposeful and profession‑true throughout. Weather and tools influence choices rather than serve as postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (cohering chaos into narrative to keep living) tightens through the jealous method, the feral nostalgia confrontation, and the alignment of dates into switchbacks. A meaningful trade‑off occurs: the narrator renounces the urge to intervene at their funeral; cost is accepted to gain continuity. Pressure coheres and deepens rather than flip via reversals, fitting the chosen lens. Stakes remain internal but are embodied by funeral, grave, and patrol readiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: continuity versus chaos, narrative as heat, and the trickster nature of memory/time. Motifs (grave, scroll, kettle, ravens) return reweighted, with the final stance offering a resonant, non‑literal answer—keep walking while narrative “soars just ahead.” The conceptual repricing of continuity (“trick river plays on stones”) is earned by on‑page struggle and bargain. No sermonizing; ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with consistent psychic distance and a professional’s perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from tick of stove to sky‑script), and elisions are taught and legible. Diction is precise and character‑bound; metaphoric texture serves mind and moment. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line work is vivid and economical for the mode; most sentences do multiple jobs. A few stretches flirt with metaphor saturation, but the pattern is consistent and does not blur sense or closure. No discernible loops, scaffolding, or cadence monotony; momentum stays intact. Final images land with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept and execution feel fresh: a mountain ranger paid to map sleeping weather, bargaining with feral nostalgia, and signing one’s own dreams. Risks (lyric dream logic, dense metaphor) heighten rather than obscure stakes. Turns grow inevitably from seeded methods and objects (jealousy method, birch scroll). The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
