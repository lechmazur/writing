<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (to locate where unused love is stored) guides tactile, character‑specific choices (threading film, palm to gate, opening letters). Interiority is vivid and embodied through sensory metaphors that feel earned. The self‑implication—finding boxes stamped with her own name—creates credible internal conflict. Writing “a new goodbye that said, stay” registers an earned, value‑laden shift with implied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and sustained: pattern builds through objects and breathlike sound until the aisle with her name reframes the search. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing coupled with a small decisive act (writing “stay”), reweighting the premise with a felt personal price. Orientation is clean by the first lines (who/where/when clear). The final image (projector exhaling, thunder speaking) seals the before/after without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The projection booth, projector, reels, and storm are tactile and purpose‑driven, not postcard: she threads film for “muscle memory,” the machine “tightens its belts,” and it “exhales” at the end. Setting functions as tool and pressure, charging the final image and aiding method. Sensory balance (sound, touch, smell—“rain on velvet”) deepens mood with specificity. The environment meaningfully shapes what is possible and how closure lands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but coherent: finding unused love consolidates into discovering her own deferred life. Escalation arrives when the projector answers and the aisle labeled with her name forces a choice, narrowing her stance from divining for others to revising her own goodbye. The price is subtle—admitting self‑denial and marking a shelf for others rather than securing a neat fix. Pressure is gentle but tightens once in line with the lyric lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: unused love as “overqualified,” letters as scripts, thresholds replacing departures. The concluding “goodbye that said, stay” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that reweights the whole. Recurring images (reels, doors, thunder/breath) shift meaning at the end without sermonizing. Any explicit aphorisms are earned by precedent and folded into scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, consistent lyric voice with controlled rhythm and image chains; psychic distance remains steady and apt. The perceptual signature is specific to her craft and sensibility, avoiding generic diction. No dialogue needed; modulation intensifies appropriately at the aisle‑with‑her‑name beat. Elision is purposeful and legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied cadence; figurative language is lush but coherent. Few, if any, scaffolding or paraphrase loops; motifs recur with purpose. Metaphors stay within the film/warehouse/weather lexicon and do not muddy sense in the final third. Momentum holds through line‑level control to the charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—psychometry in a vintage booth to locate “unused love” as a physicalized warehouse—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns grow from established methods and objects rather than late rule changes. The vision feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
