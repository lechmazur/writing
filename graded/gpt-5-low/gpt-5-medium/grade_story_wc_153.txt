<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete, self-implicating, and pressured by contradictory impulses (to leave before cruelty vs. to stay and listen). Micro-choices—anchoring, lowering the shard, asking for “that hour,” practicing stillness—align with a felt flaw (premature leaving). The final renunciation (“go home and not decide… share the hinge”) lands as earned stasis with cost. Shame and tenderness remain unresolved enough to feel honest, not tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: song → fog-writing → reflection → injunction → practice → poised refusal. Closure is on-page as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she forecloses rushing a decision and commits to a different practice. Cost is legible in the scar/time-keeping wound and the relinquishment of the old “compass” of leaving. Orientation is clear early (skiff, mangroves, spirits) and serves the closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and blackwater mirror actively shape options (navigation by condensation messages, spirits’ evocations) and reframe the cathedral memory. The shard functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains touch and marks time/cost on the body. Environmental details evolve with action (lantern fog, roots, heron comma), and the final “path feels like a listening” charges the setting in the last beat. Specificity is lush yet purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is crisp: retrieve the “moment before deciding” to bring back to Mara. Escalation tightens via the condensation’s admonition (“let your wanting be small…”) and the choice to practice stillness, trading the old tactic of leaving. The price—abandoning the self-protective compass and accepting an open, vulnerable hinge—reads. Pressure is internal but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of listening vs. self-protective wanting, apology as practiced attention, and healing as legible surface accrue through concrete motifs (shard, fog-script, hinge). The “let your wanting be small” line toes the edge of stating the thesis, but is diegetically earned via the glass. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: not deciding becomes an ethical stance with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive, controlled, and specific to this consciousness; diction and rhythms modulate with pressure without slipping register. Purposeful elision is taught early (“answers arrive sideways”) and paid off in the method of revelation. No POV leakage; certainty stays within plausible perception and image logic. Sonic choices (“heron… comma”) reinforce perspective rather than decorate it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High density lyricism mostly serves momentum and sense; images stay coherent and interlinked (hinge, ribs, plumbline) with minimal redundancy. A few stacked metaphors flirt with excess but don’t blur causality or the closure image. Syntax varies, and nearly every line carries dual duty (image + pressure/theme). Copy is clean and rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mangrove-spirits + condensation-oracle + gargoyle shard as timekeeping wound is a fresh synthesis. The conceptual reprice—choosing poised listening over decisive action—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, nonliteral mechanics) heighten stakes and cohere at the end. Emotional truth outpaces ornament.</comment>
