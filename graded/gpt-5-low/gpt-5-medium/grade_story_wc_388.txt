<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (“conspiracy debunker”) drives concrete choices: noticing the calm, reconstructing letters, teaching calibration, refusing the diamond. Interiority is particular and embodied (“cone of calm… a hush shaped exactly like a prayer”). Slight deficit in contradictory impulses—the narrator rarely doubts or wavers—so the final renunciation carries modest rather than searing cost. Still, endurance and refusal read earned and character‑true.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Causal: storm → observation of calm → investigation → shredded‑letter reconstruction → resonator explanation → recalibration → next storm holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: “traded a curse for a calibration,” with social and ethical cost (loss of myth; liability line). Orientation is clean from the outset; no teleports. The cost is more conceptual/social than visceral, but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: radioactive dust, the calm cone, the packing shed, the diamond resonator shaping tactics and final image. Details filter through a professional, skeptical eye, avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment constrains choice (mapping nodes, tuning with a wrench/metronome). Strong integration; minor dock only because the world beyond the orchard is gestured rather than pressured on‑page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival and demystification—tightens via storm observation to technical proof to communal recalibration. The meaningful turn is the reveal of the resonator’s design and its retraining of tactics, culminating in the held storm. Costs are present (relinquished myth, social friction, refusal of the diamond) but not punishing. Tension is steady, not razor‑edged, yet coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—design over myth, imperfection as utility, truth as maintenance—emerges through object and deed. Recurring images (flawed diamond, stillpoint, irrigation lines) reweight at the end. A few explicit theses (“Comfortable lies cost less…”) flirt with sermonizing, slightly blunting subtext. Overall, the final image answers the premise without needing explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled voice with crisp metaphorics (“a herd of hammers,” “a hush shaped exactly like a prayer”) and a plausible lexicon for a debunker‑mechanic. POV certainty tracks what could be known; inference reads as inference (“I did not intuit magic; I intuited design”). Rhythm modulates well between lyric and procedural. Occasional aphoristic lines brush didactic, but cadence stays persuasive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; lines often do multiple jobs. Figurative language is precise and rarely overstacked; momentum rarely stalls. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies with pressure. Minor risk of aphorism creep is contained and does not blur closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: post‑liquidation orchard, bottle‑cap‑paid debunker, a “flawed synthetic seed” resonator reframing a curse. Turns feel earned by observation and method rather than twistiness. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens coherence. The piece commits to its premise without retreat into trope.</comment>
