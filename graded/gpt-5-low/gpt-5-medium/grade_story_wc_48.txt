<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied through recurring objects and tactile choices (wading in; the shell’s “pocketed star”). The central motive—resisting the market’s “tidy raft”—drives credible renunciation at the end. Contradictory impulses (yearlong resistance vs. desire for a pact) act on the page. Slight abstraction in a few lines (“arranging permission”) mutes the felt cost a notch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from hush → visibility pocket → contrary thread → pact → renunciation. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: “I chose the river…” with the market path foreclosed. Cost is present (refusing market ladders) but shaded rather than dramatized. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear from the outset, with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The feral nexus, mist, and “river within the river” do real work—revealing the contrary thread and enabling the pact. The shell functions as micro-setting, aligning with the “secret spine” and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven, never a tourist catalog. Minor symbolism risk is contained by consistent use-through-action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: integrity vs. market compliance. Escalation reads as a purposeful deepening—the mist opens, artifacts arrive, the protagonist wades in, and chooses the river. The price is implied (turning from market structures) rather than viscerally tested, keeping the tightening subtle. Still, the pact moment and renunciation are earned and narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: emblems as “shapes of different hopes,” upstream letter, contrary thread. The final choice reframes the piece as arranging permissions rather than imposing resolutions—clean CR that resonates. One line edges toward thesis (“stop seeking resolution and start arranging permission”), but the surrounding images keep it earned. The aftereffect is contemplative rather than sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, rhythmic, and confident; diction and syntax fit the lyric mode without head-hopping. Compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue needed; interiority carries subtext. A few abstract phrases approach didacticism but don’t break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do two jobs (image + motive or image + turn). Figurative language is rich yet coherent to the river/book motif, with no muddle at the peak beats. Minimal scaffold or loops; rhythm varies well. Occasional abstraction (“architecture for hope”) introduces slight air but not drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The river-within-the-river and “ephemeral cameos” synthesize into a fresh ceremonial of artistic ethics. The upstream letter and empty violin case are memorable, non-obvious turns that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mode, conceptual closure) heighten coherence rather than obscure it. Only the soft-pedaled cost keeps it from the very top.</comment>
