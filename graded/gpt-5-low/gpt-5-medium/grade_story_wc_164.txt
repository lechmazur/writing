<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct, embodied interiority with a credible professional ethos; the “cheerful gloom” contradiction animates choices. Motivation is clear (find why the path vanished), and micro‑choices (summoning the bird, rerouting with seeds) align with values. Internal conflict remains gentle—more courtesy than anguish—so cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. Still, choices reveal a specific hierarchy: duty to travelers balanced with deference to the land.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: listening → vision → reframe → reroute → letter → charged final image. Closure is a conceptual repricing: paths as caretakers, not cowards; the alternate route is an earned stasis with cost (detour, delay, communal adjustment). The stakes stay contained yet coherent; the deadline motif supports urgency without literal countdown. The cost is more ethical than bodily, but it lands on the page (“walk a footnote that becomes a poem”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The geode, pool, wind, and crater glass shape tactics (listening through fingertips, pool‑mapping, seed commas) and charge the ending. Sensory specificity is rich and filtered through the narrator’s idiom; the setting’s rules are learned through action. Environment constrains and enables the method and final reroute. Vividness never drifts into postcard static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightens when the path is revealed to have self‑edited; the “courtesy” reframing narrows options to rerouting. Agency drives the turn (summoning the bird, pressing glass to pool, reseeding a safer path). The price is measured—social/ethical recalibration rather than pain or loss—but it reweights the village’s habits. Tension remains low‑flame yet consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: revision as care, language of land, trust in disappearance. Recurring images (seeds as punctuation, glass as memory) shift meaning at the end to affirm responsible detour. A few aphoristic lines risk neatness but are earned by scene work. The final image carries quiet resonance without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Singular, controlled lyric voice with consistent perceptual signature; metaphoric lexicon is taught early and sustained. POV certainty stays within plausible inference, and pattern‑compressed moves remain legible. Rhythm modulates with pressure—listening, vision, decision—without head‑hopping. Diction is cohesive and character‑bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lush metaphors largely pull double duty; information density is high with minimal scaffold. No significant loops; cadence varies and propels. A few ornamental flourishes (“polite ghosts”) flirt with excess but do not blur causality. Syntax and punctuation are clean; final line recharges earlier motifs with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: memory work as transliteration, seeds as punctuation, paths as caretakers—fresh and integrated. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the narrator’s craft and the cave’s logic. Risk‑taking in texture heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
