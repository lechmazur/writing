<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied in concrete micro-choices (unraveling knots, weighing memories with stones, whispering a hymn, choosing the worst-broken mask). Interiority is understated but specific to a craftsperson’s attention and ethics (“never to banish, only to ground”). The caretaker relationship adds gentle pressure without stealing focus. A richer note of contradictory impulse inside the narrator (beyond the laugh/fall beat) could elevate further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through iterative knot‑work and memory-catching to a resonant reconfiguration where the hush “changes weight” and the masks release the last storm. Orientation is clean from the outset and the final image reweights the premise with cost (collected storms, surrendered voices, kept-but-not-forever). The wind snap near‑fall is the decisive intensification that tightens resolve. Closure lands on the page with a felt price and a coherent before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, the iron stair, the glass facets, the brittle net, and the needle form a lived system that dictates tactics. Environment and tool constrain choices (climb, unravel, catch silence) and charge the final ringed mask/locket hearth image. Sensory specificity is high without becoming museum‑tour. World rules (silence as gatherable, knots as breath pockets) are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground the restless spirits) is active from the start; escalation accrues as each knot yields memory and some resist, culminating in the snapped line and near fall. The choice to persist and adapt (hymn, weighing, braiding joy with grief) narrows options toward an earned stasis. Costs are gently framed but present (drinking the room’s quiet; releasing “last sip of storm”). A single sharper trade‑off could have heightened the pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of keeping versus taking, grief’s braiding with joy, and the ethics of grounding rather than banishing arise from particulars (stones, locket, net, “but not forever”). Subtext is carried by image and act, not statement, and the ending offers a resonant answer: stability as a tended, temporary poise. The caretaker’s line about what the sea would take reframes the sanctuary’s purpose with conceptual cost. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingering without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a maritime-craft lexicon remains stable and precise. Psychic distance is deft, allowing tactile action with figurative reach; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Brief dialogue is minimal, purpose‑driven, and subtextual. Rhythm modulates with pressure (snap/laughter beat) without breaking the taught pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (needle as tool and metaphysics; hush as medium and pressure). Figurative language stays coherent to the sea/prism/silence palette; no mixed metaphors that blur action. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentences propel rather than pad. The final lines re‑strike earlier motifs cleanly without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise (a mask restorer harvesting silence to ground storm‑haunted masks by unraveling a dead fisherman’s knots) feels vivid and non‑derivative. The locket, net, and needle synthesize into an inevitable yet surprising ritual. Risks in diction and design heighten stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity. The final repricing of “keeping” versus “taking” reads fresh and earned.</comment>
