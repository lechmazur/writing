<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, particular motive—“turn obstacles into instruments”—drives every choice, and embodied perception (hearing D in the clouds, tapping timbre) reveals character under pressure. Competence feels earned through tactile actions (mallet, crates, dubbing), and fear flickers (“eyes bright with fear and rehearsal”). Internal contradiction is lighter; the narrator rarely falters or errs. The endurance at the end reads credible but low‑cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds (approaching “mouth,” D drone, bee overtones, tower, knife net), each tactic reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the storm passes because threat is transformed into orchestra; final listening to silence reframes control as attunement. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/when) and pattern is taught early (dubbing/naming). Cost is implicit (risk, exertion), if not deeply taxed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constraining: a floating orchard on driftwood dictates tactics (oars, crates, hull, rigging) and enables musical countermeasures. Weather and sea directly pressure choices; objects double as instruments under duress. Recurring tools (mallet, crates, tower) charge the final calm. Sensory palette is rich across sound, motion, and texture without becoming a static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—keep the orchard alive—tightens through specific turns (counter‑D, bee swarm, perforated tower, knife net). Each adaptation narrows options and alters tactics; the tower moment is a clear escalation pivot. Consequences are felt in tilt, swarm, and deck danger, though no lasting loss is paid. Resolution arises from the protagonist’s deliberate re-framing rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: artful naming/arrangement converts violence into cooperative rhythm, rethinking control as collaboration with forces. The final image—listening to clouds “rewrite their letters into silence”—reprices the whole premise with grace. Recurrences (resonance, dubbing, instruments) deepen meaning rather than decorate. No moral is stated; resonance is earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, musical POV with disciplined metaphor and precise lexicon (“Bass of Anchors,” “sketched resonance”) maintains control under stress. Focalization is steady and plausible; certainty tracks perception rather than omniscience. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and patterning is taught then paid off. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is lush yet controlled; images carry multiple jobs (world‑rule, action, theme). Figurative density stays coherent to the governing sound/resonance metaphor, rarely muddling logic. Momentum persists through varied syntax and purposeful paragraphing. Minor risk of lyrical saturation, but clarity at peaks holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Orchard‑ship + dub as survival system feels genuinely new, executed with internal logic and payoff. The crate‑tower of perforations and bee‑summoned overtones are inventive, consequential turns, not ornaments. The synthesis of music, weather, and seamanship reads inevitable in hindsight. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
