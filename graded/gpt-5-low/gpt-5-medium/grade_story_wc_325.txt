<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied: “counted drips,” “measured the air seam with my lips,” panic against compulsion. Contradictory impulses (claustrophobia vs. compulsion to return and witness) operate simultaneously in action. Micro‑choices under pressure reveal values (risking suffocation, opening the lock, reading names, leaving the charm). The renunciation of the lucky fleck reads as an earned cost that forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: pressure coheres through environment and ritualized actions toward a charged final stance. Orientation is clear early (cave, tide, forgotten facility) and causality is tight (fleck → lock → terminal → names → renunciation → escape). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she leaves the fleck and exits under a live tidal clock, with felt conceptual and material cost. The brine/phase transition mechanism set early pays off in the door and final seam.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The environment shapes every tactic: tidal window, squeezes, air seams, phase‑transition seals, and the facility’s corroded geometry. Sensory specificity is high across senses (pressure, temperature, sound), filtered through a trained perceptual bias. Objects function as setting constraints (RETURN key, sensor slit, contact pad) and charge the final image. The final “evening metal” light and “sea took a long breath” reweight the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—return and witness within a deadly window—is clear and tightens through entry, activation, reading, and renunciation. The meaningful deepening is the choice to leave the talisman, sacrificing luck/control for remembrance. Time pressure and claustrophobia interweave with operational challenges (lock, terminal, tide). Cost is legible without melodrama, though no hard reversal beyond the ethical trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Memory, attention, and moral return emerge through particulars: phase transitions, “Return” key as ritual, and reading names aloud. The piece resists moralizing, letting the renunciation and the machine’s comment field do the thematic lifting. The ending reweights the premise: being “noticed back” becomes standing witness and surrendering a charm. Subtext is consistent and earned, with no exposition of thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with tactile precision and surprising but apt metaphors (“door unlipped,” “evening metal,” “seals… like a held breath”). POV is stable and knowledge stays character‑bound. Rhythm modulates with pressure; compression never obscures clarity. No register drift; technical terms serve character and setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax; images work double duty for atmosphere and plot. Figurative language is fresh and largely coherent to the physical logic (ice bridging, magnetic itch, crashing hush). Minimal redundancy; no scaffold loops. A few ornate lines flirt with excess but do not slow momentum or blur the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original fusion of monastic gold, brine conductivity, and undersea surveillance rendered with ethical poignancy. Risks a highly lyric, tech‑inflected register and sustains it under pressure. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (RETURN key, phase transitions, renunciation) and cannot be swapped without breaking the design. The conceptual integrity is strong and memorable.</comment>
