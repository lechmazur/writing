<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation and interiority are vivid and consistent: a defunct revolutionary-poet seeking proof beyond longing. Contradictory impulses (superstition vs method; hunger for consolation vs demand for evidence) are dramatized through the mirror‑covering “method.” Micro‑choices escalate (ordering shrouds, public readings, requesting a storm) and reveal values under pressure. The earned endurance at the end—accepting the revolution’s failure while revising the archive—lands with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (textural accumulation to a causal public test) is clear: shard discovery → method → public readings → council storm demo → vote. Closure is on‑page with cost: the archive is revised while the narrator remains “defunct,” and the shard cracks. The orientation is strong from the outset, and setups pay off (mirrors, storms, shard, Ledger’s opposition). The final act reconfigures the central question without tidy absolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, visible time, and storm mechanics integrate setting with action and constraint (covering mirrors; admitting a storm into the hall). Specific objects and textures (oxidized velvet iron, rubric‑lit colonnades) are purposeful and POV‑filtered. Environment shapes tactics at the climax, charging the final image. World rules are consistent and learned through enactment, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (the archive’s truth and the narrator’s credibility) are clear and tightened by Ledger’s petition and the council adjudication. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation, culminating in the risky storm demonstration. Costs are legible—professional risk, ideological suspicion, and the shard’s eventual cracking. One decisive deepening suffices at this length without needing multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of ornament as solidarity and song as archive emerge organically through procedures and public ritual, not sermonizing. The shard’s “breath marks” and the mirror ritual generate subtext about communal authorship and the ethics of looking. The ending reweights the premise—revision not as apology but as ornament—while holding ambivalence (“My revolution remained defunct”). Resonance lingers beyond plot without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled voice—lyric yet purposeful—maintains stable POV and credible knowledge bounds. Diction modulates with pressure (from private ritual to public performance) while retaining the narrator’s idiom. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and pay off cleanly at closure. No head‑hopping or register slippage undermines the effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and musical with high information density; images carry multiple jobs (world‑building, mood, stake). Repetition (“we made, we made, we made”) is earned and climactic rather than redundant. Figurative language remains coherent to the world’s logic and does not swamp clarity. Rhythm and paragraphing propel rather than stall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—time made visible enabling an evidentiary ritual via ornament—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric-argument hybrid; superstition as method) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The shard/mirror/storm triad synthesizes concept, setting, and conflict in a fresh way. The final image transforms familiar revolution/academy tropes into something memorably strange and humane.</comment>
