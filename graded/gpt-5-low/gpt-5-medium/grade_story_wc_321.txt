<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, character‑bound motive (“tired of losing arrivals”) drives concrete micro‑choices: keeping the radio on, sketching the lattice, instructing the helmsman, and choosing the tide door. Interiority is specific and embodied (broom, dew, humming bulkheads), with a credible contradiction between craving permanence and embracing tidal uncertainty. The captain provides light counterpressure without stealing agency. The final Earned Stasis—remaining a “permanent transient”—reads earned with a felt conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: patterned images (wake lattice, dripping letters, hourglass dust) accrue toward a decisive choice at the doors. Closure lands on the page with cost: selecting the door that keeps the tide—permanence purchased with undertow—reconfigures stakes and outcomes (arrivals stabilize but never simplify). Orientation is taught early and serves the payoff; all key set‑ups (radio, hourglass, grotto) pay out. No causality breaks; each turn grows from prior images and decisions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The river, grotto, and ferry are tactile and rule‑consistent within the surreal frame; the environment constrains tactics (aligning wake lattice to mirrored constellations where the ceiling drips “delay”). Tools and objects (broom, hourglass, radio) function as micro‑settings that shape action and charge the ending. The final docking image is inseparable from place. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the deckhand’s working eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: end the ferry’s vanishing. Escalation tightens via the captain’s order to shut the radio, the entry into the grotto, and the instructions to drift under the next drip, culminating in the door choice. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible: he forgoes a tidy, tide‑less certainty in favor of honest undertow. Agency drives turns rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: permanence vs. transience, labor’s ritual meeting time’s indifference. Recurring images (wake lattice, hourglass, fog‑rumor schedules) reprice themselves at the end where farewells become arrivals that “move through” the narrator. No moralizing; the final acceptance of tide offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that enriches prior beats. Ambiguity is meaningful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyric POV with consistent selective noticing and idiom; the metaphoric register is controlled and character‑specific (nautical, calendrical, tidal). Brief dialogue carries subtext and pressure without exposition (“shut it off”—“a minute more”). Psychic distance modulates cleanly at peak beats. The voice sustains compression without head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is tight and musical with high information density; images often do double duty (stars as decades, radio silence shaped like doors). Figurative richness stays coherent to the time/river lexicon; no muddled metaphors or loops dull momentum. A few high‑ornament lines brush the edge of density, but cadence control and clarity hold through closure. The final image cleanly resolves motifs without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a commuter ferry as a temporal negotiation, with radio self‑dialogue and wake‑star lattices creating a distinctive method and world logic. Risks (lyric surrealism, conceptual mechanics) heighten stakes and remain legible. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the pattern grammar is taught. The “permanent transient” stance lands with uncommon specificity.</comment>
