<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation and method are clear and character‑specific: a “silent carousel carpenter” who listens, fails by force, then risks voice. The internal contradiction (silence vs choosing to sing) lands as a credible cost and change. Embodiment through tactile craft (sanding radii, routing slots) feels lived. Pressure is mild rather than bruising, but the renunciation of silence and vow to tend the train reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: attempts → failure (no power) → “wrong turn” oasis → repricing to voice → singing restores the carousel. Closure is an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with a soft but legible cost (vulnerability and ongoing stewardship). Orientation is clean from the opening and the two‑shard transition pays off. The causal thread is lyrical but coherent and purpose‑driven.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is richly specific and functional: generator car, menagerie, couplers, and water tank all constrain choices and supply resources. The wind bells and tank directly charge the final image and tactics (timed breath, resonance treaty). Sensory detailing is balanced across sight, sound, and touch without tourist catalog. World rules (consent/voice over power) are learned through handling objects, not explained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reanimating the carousel without brute power—is clear early. Escalation tightens via the failed mechanical attempt and the discovery that “the train had been thirsting not for power but for voice,” which forces a different tactic (singing). Cost is understated but present in breaking his defining silence and assuming guardianship. The pressure is coherent and deepens rather than multiplies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes through action: consent over coercion, listening as agency, community drawn by “wrong turns.” The final cadence reweights prior images (bells, hush, halo) without moralizing, delivering conceptual repricing with emotional afterglow. Subtext moves in objects and intervals; no thesis is stated. The closing vow and shared breath resonate beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person closely tracks perception with controlled rhythm and diction consistent to craft and listening. The voice modulates under pressure (from patient observation to resonant singing) while maintaining pattern-legibility. No head‑hopping; certainty tracks plausible knowledge. The prose’s music serves POV rather than authorial display.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and musical with high information density; images often do dual duty (bells as time, halo as conduit). Occasional luxuriance skirts purple but stays coherent and purposeful; no paraphrase loops or scaffold drag. Syntax variety supports momentum and breath. Final lines resolve by charged image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—abandoned circus train revived by accrued listening and a literalized hush—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The “wrong turn” oasis and treaty‑by‑resonance are fresh turns rooted in earlier particulars. Risks in conceit and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The object ecology (bells/halo/tank) is ingeniously integrated.</comment>
