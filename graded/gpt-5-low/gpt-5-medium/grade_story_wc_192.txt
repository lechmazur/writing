<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—to steward pain and teach breathing to what suffocates—is consistent and embodied in concrete micro‑choices (lifting the ring, denying the girl’s wish to vanish, stepping aside). Contradictory impulses (“burns bridges carefully” vs. returning to keep watch) complicate her stance credibly. Emotions are conveyed through tactile images (scars waking, cold ring) rather than labels. Slight abstraction at times keeps us a half‑step from visceral heat, but not enough to blunt credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of return → invocation (ring) → student’s arrival → lesson → earned stasis with the unescorted crossing. Closure lands with cost (“breathed out names I had promised never to speak,” the hour of mercy, stepping aside). Orientation is clear early (sanctuary under starlight; the door without a house), and the single‑scene frame is tight. The final image reconfigures the premise without strain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary, door, threshold, and ring aren’t ornament; they constrain choices (how to summon, where to teach, how the threshold wavers if watched) and charge the ending. Sensory specificity (“cool as moonwater,” “ashes… stayed bright enough to read”) is POV‑filtered and purposeful. World rules (threshold steadies via attention and practice) stay consistent. Setting functions as micro‑mechanics and atmosphere in one.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can she teach breath and stabilize the crossing without self‑erasure?) tightens with the student’s arrival and the chilling ritual; the threshold steadies, then the test: an unescorted crossing. Cost is legible in the naming taboo breach and the choice to step back. Escalation is a decisive deepening rather than reversal, apt for the lens. Stakes remain intimate but unmistakably pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, boundaries, mercy, and ethical leaving arise from particulars (ash as proof, ring as cold promise, lighthouse image) rather than declaration. Subtext runs through action—teaching to breathe mirrors the narrator’s own held ache; “mercy is how thresholds learn to hold” caps a practice earned on the page. The ending reweights prior material: the lesson’s proof is her not looking back. No sermonizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice with controlled rhythm and images; distance is stable, and elision is pattern‑taught from the first lines. Diction remains coherent to the narrator’s sensibility, modulating under pressure without head‑hopping. A few high images risk saturation, but cadence and intent keep them legible. The prose feels lived, not generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: strong verbs, minimal scaffold, and multi‑tasking images. Figurative density is high but coherent; images echo rather than tangle (door/threshold/bridge/ash). Sentence rhythm varies to suit pressure, with no loops or clotted syntax. A hair of purple glint remains, but it doesn’t blunt clarity or propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “door without a house,” “linking through scars,” and “burning bridges as stewardship” synthesize into a fresh cosmology that feels inevitable by the end. Risks in imagery and structure heighten stakes and coherence rather than distract. The final reconfiguration (teaching that preserves crossings) is non‑obvious yet fully prepared. Distinctive vision reads authentic, not templated.</comment>
