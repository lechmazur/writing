<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline from the first lines (“shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) and actions track it: lighting, steering, listening, naming wrecks, adopting and training the child. Interiority is embodied in tactile, professional detail rather than labels (“cheek against green coolness,” “steer silence into shape”). Change reads as Earned Stasis: a costly, lucid commitment to endure and keep guiding. If there’s a gap, it’s the relative gentleness of internal contradiction; the voice rarely wobbles under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern is taught early (ritual, laughter, beam, storm) and deepens with the child’s arrival, the newsroom of two, and the “burn absence into direction” move. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: an emerald vow that reweights the post‑print premise with felt cost (endurance, solitude, responsibility). Orientation is clear within the first lines (who/where/when; after the last print newspaper; emerald lighthouse). The persistent constraint (storm, reefs, beam) shapes the final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse, optics, and sea are not backdrop but instruments that constrain choice (beam angle, reefs, fog grammar). Recurring objects (emerald glass, wick, prisms) charge the final image and tactics. Sensory selection is expert‑biased and tactile; world rules (total internal reflection) stay consistent and matter. Atmosphere aligns with theme without slipping into postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep meaning and guidance alive—tightens via an accumulative escalation: ritual → storm dialogue → prophetic crate/child → newsroom of two → burning absence. The child’s arrival is the key deepening that raises responsibility and narrows options. Cost is endurance and vigilant care; the storm’s “edits” strip indulgence to verbs, which reads as pressure. There’s no sharp reversal, but the density increase credibly reweights the stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of post‑print meaning, stewardship, and joy as ballast emerge organically from concrete acts (steering, feeding names to storms, teaching the “alphabet of reefs”). The final headline—“weathered joy”—reprices the world without a sermon. Recurring images (light/shadow, laughter, TIR, green glass) shift meaning by the end. Insight feels earned rather than declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with controlled metaphor and precise technical diction woven through character perspective. Distance and stance are steady; no head‑hopping or register drift. Patterned elision is taught and pays off in the closing cadence. The mind on the page is particular and memorable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with high information density; rhythm varies and images stay coherent to the lighthouse lexicon. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined and legible (light as bell, laughter as ballast, storms with memory). Minimal redundancy; no loops that stall momentum. A hair of metaphor saturation prevents a higher mark but doesn’t obscure closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑print lighthouse as newsroom, total internal reflection as ethics of guidance, laughter as ballast—is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, invented optics vernacular) heighten stakes and cohere. Turns arise from established pattern (prophecy → crate/child) rather than late rule changes. The vision reads singular, not templated.</comment>
