<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and active—arrive to “defy the gravity of hopelessness” by teaching light to “play seriously.” Interiority filters through a precise professional lens (filtering fuel, mapping wind), and micro‑choices abound (following the mosaic note, choosing placements). The Lark relationship adds a crucible for decision and a pact that reframes action. Slight softness: minimal internal contradiction or visible personal cost beyond labor and risk keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: discovery of the mosaic note → tool cache → placements via wind and structure → hush → ignition → communal lift. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when) and the pattern is taught early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “gravity loosened, not vanquished,” with the rag knot retied and options reweighted. Cost is felt in endurance, risk, and the earned cadence shift without a neat fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated and constrains tactics (ivy and wind breaks, cistern, east wall mosaic, cubby behind vine). Sensory detail is POV‑specific (salts, petals, soot, kerosene) and evolves with action. Objects (the rag knot, the mosaic note) charge the final image and guide choices. Atmosphere and rules stay consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (lifting communal hopelessness) is clear and narrows through the hush and the ignition count. The main tightening is the no‑stars silence into the lit cord, with tactics constrained by wind and sequence. Cost is present as risk and responsibility rather than loss, but the cadence deepens convincingly. No antagonist needed; pressure accrues through environment and time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of play as prayer, filtering fear like fuel, and persuading gravity emerge through concrete action. Recurring images (note in mosaic, rag knot, hush) reprice the ending without moralizing. The final green hush reframes the world’s weight with earned ambiguity. A single on‑the‑nose line (“This play was our prayer”) still supports rather than explains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with professional idiom and tactile noticing; rhythm modulates with pressure. Dialogue is minimal but distinct (Lark, the keeper) and purposeful. POV certainty stays within plausible bounds and avoids head‑hopping. Elision is patterned and paid off at ignition and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent figurative language tied to action (“teach light to play,” “filtering fear”). Varied syntax and clean sequencing keep momentum. Slight risk of lushness, but the metaphors stay internally consistent and task‑bound. No loops or scaffolding that dulls the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fireworks craft as ritual, a mosaic note as a score for light, and a rag knot as fuse/talisman synthesize into a fresh, inevitable design. The accumulative closure feels non‑obvious yet earned. Specific occupational and environmental detail prevents template drift. Bold but legible risk‑taking charges the final reconfiguration.</comment>
