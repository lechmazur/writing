<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motivation (recovering the sister’s lost laugh) drives concrete choices: consulting the chemist, trespassing to the whale, exhuming the box, and selecting a memory. Interiority is textured and embodied through lantern‑work, gravity’s tug, and the tin of flowers; no stock phrasing. Internal tension (duty to light vs. compulsion to retrieve) is present though understated. The final endurance/realization feels earned, with a quiet cost in risk and trespass rather than a sharp sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens that holds: image‑driven escalation culminates in a on‑page RR/CR. Causal threads are clean (grounds → pier pockets → whale → glass memory → corridor → retrieval → recharged tin). Orientation is firm from the outset (lantern lighter, harbor, beached whale). Cost is legible at closure through the reweighted vocation and the risky crossing into gravity pockets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: harbor, piers, salt chamber, and the whale’s ribcage constrain tactics and charge the finale. Recurring objects (lanterns, tin, salt glass) function as micro‑settings that shape choices and the final image. World rules (memory‑listening salt, pockets of gravity) are taught through action without expositional drag. The final lantern image is inseparable from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve a lost memory) tightens through the chemist’s divination and the grave‑robbing of the salt box; pressing the glass becomes the critical turn. Pressure grows coherently as gravity pockets become active hazards (“opens like an unscheduled mouth”). Explicit material cost is gentle, but risk and trespass are palpable and reconfigure options. Resolution stems from the protagonist’s choices, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of custodianship—what it means to “keep” light and memory—emerges organically via work, salt, and gravity. The ending’s repricing (“what my work really keeps”) is earned by the corridor/library retrieval and avoids moralizing. Recurring images (lanterns, tin, whale) shift meaning to deliver a resonant answer about preserving paths through change. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Singular lyric voice with disciplined imagery and consistent POV; diction matches a lantern lighter’s poetic, work‑soaked perception. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident (“The ground lifts my heel, then eats my step…”). No head‑hopping or unjustified certainties; elisions are purposeful and paid off. The voice flexes between gleam and gravity without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; figurative language is fresh, controlled, and legible in peak beats. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies to modulate pace. Metaphors (“a new moon beached into our calendar,” “a buried hinge remembering its purpose”) remain coherent to the story’s physics. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: gravity pockets, salt‑memory sheets, and lantern craft cohere into a distinctive cosmology. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once salt “listening” is established. Risks (lyric worldbuilding, quiet stakes) heighten rather than obscure clarity. The vision feels singular and memorable.</comment>
