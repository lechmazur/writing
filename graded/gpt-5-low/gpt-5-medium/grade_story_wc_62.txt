<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The carver’s motives and micro-choices are clear and specific, from measuring “breath and silence” with the ribbon to inviting the father to choose a notch. The restraint vs. ornament tension—policed by the mother’s hush—creates live internal conflict. Embodied emotion appears in tactile actions (shallow cuts, then deeper as the father steadies). The endurance-based change (accepting spareness as cost) is earned on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece builds patterned beats (ribbon, hush, butterflies) toward a charged final act. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, when), and the greenhouse frame stays coherent across the migration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise in the spare kite curve with visible cost (renunciation of ornament, measured pacing). No causality breaks; the father’s arrival tightens pressure at mid-scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is not mere backdrop; it calibrates silence, steadies characters (lettuce beds), and enforces restraint (seedlings, storm-stressed panes). Environmental details evolve with action (vents, condensation, roof cracks), and the hush directly influences craft choices. The setting charges the final image by making spareness feel protective and earned. Sensory specificity remains POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carving language that can hold grief—tightens when the father asks for “words strong enough to hold the date.” Agency surfaces in offering the ribbon and adjusting carve depth as his hand steadies. Under the accumulative lens, escalation arises from density and restraint rather than reversal, with a felt price in pared ornament. The storm and migration deepen pressure without resolving it conveniently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonance accrues through recurring particulars (ribbon, butterflies, hush), culminating in the spare kite curve as an ethical stance. One explicit thematic line—“Movement…is the shape of our collective grief”—edges toward telling, slightly thinning subtext at a late moment. Otherwise, the piece lets images do the work, and the final action offers a non-literal answer about form, mercy, and distance. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with craft-accurate diction and controlled rhythm; the perceptual signature (measuring breaths, seedlings, hush) is character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but natural and advances pressure with subtext (“words strong enough to hold the date”). Psychic distance is stable, and metaphoric texture is taught early and maintained. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and purposeful metaphor; images generally cohere (butterfly feet as commas, glass ribs as tide). Overwriting risk is managed by patterning and by linking figurative moves to action. Little to no scaffold or loop; beats keep momentum. The final line is clean and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone carving as communal grief cartography inside a living greenhouse, with spectral mentorship and a poem-notched ribbon—is fresh and memorable. Risks (lyric density, accumulative structure) heighten meaning rather than obscure it. The butterfly commas and the restraint-as-mercy ethic feel non-obvious yet inevitable by the end. Closure grows organically from these specific inventions.</comment>
