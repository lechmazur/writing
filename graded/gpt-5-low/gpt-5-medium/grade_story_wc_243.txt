<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archivist’s motive (“I did not repair, I remembered”) governs every micro‑choice—asking for proximate causes, walking the jetty, drawing lines—revealing a coherent, particular psyche. Emotions are embodied through tactile acts (steeping the nib, mapping fingertip to plank) rather than labels. The woman’s need is sketched efficiently and pressures the archivist’s ethic without collapsing it. The final renunciation—stepping back—reads earned and costly in its restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a Charged Poise/RR closure. Orientation is clear from the opening and the pattern (proximate causes as method) holds to the end. The reunion arrival edges toward coincidence, but the piece frames it as the payoff of context restoration rather than deus ex machina. Cost lands in the archivist’s acceptance of limits and the couple’s tentative, touch‑withheld exit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The jetty, tide, sea thrift, and board knot are not postcard detail; they guide tactics (where to walk, where to pause) and charge the final image. The environment becomes a working instrument—“timepieces” and “keeping tides”—that reframes memory as tidal. The locket background matching the present rail/rust is a precise setting‑driven turn. Weather and light modulate pressure toward dusk, enriching the cadence shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can memory reconstruct a covenant—tightens through the methodical reconstruction, then deepens when the figure appears and the couple talks via particulars. Agency is quiet but present: the archivist designs the walk and yields the stage; the woman chooses to recount anchors. The coincidence of his arrival slightly softens pressure causality. The cost—risking vulnerability without immediate forgiveness, and the archivist’s discipline not to intervene—is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: context as timekeeper, memory as proximate causality, covenant as a living system. Recurring images (tide, ink, locket) reprice meaning at the end without moralizing; “entries belong to the hour when context changes” crystallizes the conceptual answer. The piece resists tidy absolutes by ending in charged poise (no touching yet). A couple of explicit statements flirt with telling but are earned by the concrete scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and steady; the diction (“walnut ink,” “charged poise” feel) is character‑bound and sensorially grounded. The narratorial certainty matches what this archivist could know, with inference flagged as metaphor rather than omniscience. Rhythm modulates gracefully from patient accrual to a firmer cadence at the reunion. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line‑level is vivid and efficient, with images doing double duty (ink steeping as breath/time). A few borderline purple phrasings (“moon drawing breath,” “white parenthesis”) remain coherent within the taught pattern. No notable scaffold or synonym loops; momentum is maintained. The density never occludes the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “walnut‑ink archivist” and “proximate causes” methodology make a fresh frame for a reunion narrative; the locket/timepiece conceit is distinctive and integrated. The final reweighting—regenerated covenant as accurate return of neglected proximities—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in lyric compression pays off without muddle. Minor reliance on a coincidental arrival prevents a higher score.</comment>
