<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, credible internal conflict between a scheduled vanishing and a newly learned vocation of listening; micro‑choices (tapping seams, storm preparation, accepting the whistle) reveal values under pressure. Emotions are embodied through tactile details (parasol tip as “ivory thorn,” boats knocking like knuckles). The delay call at the end reads as an earned renunciation with cost. A slight lyric remove occasionally softens the felt friction of the suicidal impulse, but motivation remains legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring acts of listening, scanning, and preparing build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—asking the clinic for another delay. Orientation is clean early (euthanasia tourist at a drift‑ice marina), and set pieces (child rescue, storm feint) ladder meaningfully. Cost is present on the page: choosing to continue living with vigilance over a scheduled “clean” ending. Structure coheres without and‑then drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The marina and ice are tactile and operative: the parasol tip constrains movement, the groan under pontoons guides timing, the snapped buoy triggers readiness. Weather and water pressure choices; the final salute with the tip recharges place and purpose. Sensory detail is selective, POV‑true, and integrated into action. World rules stay consistent and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to meet the appointment) tightens via concrete pressures: child overboard and buoy snap/approaching storm. Escalation is textural, not twist‑driven; readiness and listening become tactics that foreclose the immediate oblivion path. The phone call cements a price—continued endurance and vigilance—earned by prior beats. Stakes remain coherent and felt without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: listening as an ethic, patience redefined, endings that want to be seen. Recurrent images (rope that “remembers,” whistle that stays quiet, parasol tip) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. Dialogue carries subtext rather than thesis, even in aphoristic lines from Erland. The final walk along the “margin of mercy” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric voice with controlled rhythm and image logic; perceptual signature is memorable and plausible for the character. Dialogue is sparse but natural and revealing. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure. Occasional aphoristic shine nears ornateness but remains in character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; images do more than one job and propel momentum. Figurative language is consistent to sea/ice/wind and avoids mixed metaphors; cadence varies well. Minor risks of over‑ornament (“handwriting of gulls,” “weather inside people”) are balanced by clear action lines in key beats. No loops or scaffold that blunt the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a euthanasia tourist transformed into a marina listener using an heirloom parasol tip is fresh and specific. Risks (lyric accumulative structure, aphoristic dialogue) heighten rather than obscure stakes. Turns and reprises feel inevitable in hindsight—the whistle’s silence, the storm’s veer, the delayed call. The piece commits to its premise with conceptual integrity.</comment>
