<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A singular, coherent interiority blends rigor and tenderness; “Stoically sensitive” is enacted through careful, unspectacular work. Micro‑choices under pressure (wresting the door, threading a line, retrieving the program, tucking notes into mortar) reveal a hierarchy of values. The internal paradox (firmness as a way to hold trembling) is dramatized, not merely stated. The quiet renunciation of recognition at the end reads as earned endurance with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: an entry window opens “after the drawbridge rises,” the descent deepens from service door to the “deepest room,” and closure crystallizes in the final slip and waterline mark. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he accepts witness over repair and pays anonymity and ongoing labor. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/when) and never lost. The persistent constraint (water level/bridge timing) shapes tactics and charges the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is tactile and operative: silt, pilings, service door, wavering daylight, and ironwork guide choices and limit access. Environment and tools (tripod, inkwell) function as micro‑settings that constrain action and load the final image (marking the waterline). Sensory selection is expert and POV‑true, with smell (“letters never sent”) and sound (fox bark, hinge moan) advancing mood and action. World rules remain consistent and learned through maneuver.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens via access and time: the river calms post‑bridge, the sealed door must be wrested, and the descent culminates in the “deepest room.” The felt price is endurance and invisibility, sharpened by the refusal of spectacle (“heat without spectacle”). The move from survey to custodial care (program retrieval, names copied, final slip) is a clear deepening consistent with the chosen lens. Stakes stay singular and legible: to witness and ledger absence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of witness over repair and “interlaced absence” grows from concrete acts (hiding notes in mortar, mapping light coins) and culminates in a resonant refusal. “Hushed blaze” reframes restraint as an ethical heat and returns at closure. One line edges toward thesis‑statement (“I was here not to repair the past...”), slightly on‑the‑nose but anchored as the content of a slip, mitigating sermonizing. The ending reweights prior images without collapsing into a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a surveyor’s lexicon and ritual exactness; imagery and syntax modulate pressure without blur. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; focalization stays tight and plausible. Patterned elision is taught early and sustained; metaphors track the physical logic of water, light, iron. Rhythm varies purposefully, with crisp verb choices (“wrest,” “thread,” “coughs”) doing work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; most lines perform two jobs (image and action/theme). The figurative register is lush but disciplined; mixed metaphors are avoided, and momentum persists through tactile verbs. A few coinages risk purple (“ballroom for weeds”), yet clarity and propulsion hold, especially in the descent and closure beats. No loops or template cadences dull the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conceit of a surveyor clandestinely ledgering absence via mortar‑slipped notes feels fresh, inevitable in hindsight with the drawbridge window and inkwell ritual. Risks (lyric density, concept‑driven stakes) pay off through coherent execution and a charged final image. The synthesis of method, setting pressure, and ethical stance reads singular rather than stitched. The “hushed blaze” tonal frame is a memorable, non‑obvious redefinition of restraint.</comment>
