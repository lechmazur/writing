<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—recovering a lost name to “honor overlooked histories”—and actions align: placing the lens, speaking coordinates, gathering letters, naming. Interiority is embodied through sensory lexicon (tar, iron, hush) and the practiced “stillness while moving.” Contradictory impulses are subtler than ideal (competence dominates), but restraint (“I drank nothing…did not want a third [world]”) registers a cost-bearing choice. The painter adds light pressure, sharpening the narrator’s stance without hijacking the POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the lens and listening tactics intensify to a resonant reconfiguration as the name surfaces and alters the painting’s state. Orientation is crisp from the start (dusk, elevated market, translator’s aim); beats link coherently from lens placement to naming. Closure lands on-page with cost—the narrator pays in awakenings, refuses further intake, and the scene’s anonymity is permanently reweighted. The single-scene scope is tight and the final tied sailcloth functions as a before/after marker.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: rope bridges “sigh,” stalls chime, pigments mixed with river ash and berry salts, cups shaped like gulls. The micro-setting tool—the lighthouse lens—charges and constrains choices and the final image. Environmental pressure (wind braiding voice; bridges steadying) mirrors and supports the narrator’s action. World rules feel consistent and learned through use rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—returning a hidden name—tightens through clear pressure points: the painter’s “unsellable” stance, the shard’s activation, the scramble to “gather” letters before they fall back. The key turn is the act of naming and tying the sailcloth, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is present but conceptual rather than painful; nonetheless the refusal to “drink a third world” marks a price. Tension scales by density and cadence rather than overt reversals, suiting the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of restitution through attention and naming emerges organically from acts, not thesis statements; “only a witness paid in awakenings” is earned, not sermonized. The final image (sailcloth name tied, scene no longer drowning in anonymity) reweights the entire premise. Subtext hums in the painter’s deflection (“only texture”) and the narrator’s ethical counter. Ambiguity lingers without confusion—the cost of carrying histories is felt but not fully resolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature—metaphor as thinking rather than ornament. POV distance is steady; dialogue is sparse yet functional and subtextual. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from patient noticing to urgent “gathering” of letters) without head-hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off via the shard’s workings.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often do two or three jobs at once. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and scene-driven (“varnish became tidewater”; “harbor of absence”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; syntax varies and momentum holds through the naming beat. The final lines land cleanly without muddle or over-explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a between-worlds translator using a lighthouse lens to read paintings in an aerial alchemist market. Risks (lyric density, accumulative drive) pay off with legible closure. Specific inventions (dried thunder, zeroed maps, berry salts) feel integral rather than quirky. The reconfiguration by naming is both inevitable in hindsight and surprising in execution.</comment>
