<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interiority is present (doubt softening; the final understanding that “repair is sometimes just remembering together”), but the POV mostly observes Rowen’s agency rather than facing a pressured, contradictory choice. Motivation—restore sacred practices—is clear and consistent, with embodied touches (throats polished, jars warmed by breath). The internal conflict is gentle and lacks a sharp micro‑choice under stress. The final shift reads earned but low‑cost, tilting more toward acceptance than sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual preparation → harvest‑moon alignment → communal singing → reconfiguration of the village’s relation to place. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: bowls mend, wells find echoes, and the village carries a new calm “like water in open hands.” Cost is implicit—renouncing convenience for patient, collective attentiveness—and paid in the practice and restraint. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grove, frame, and vine filament are tactile, rule‑bearing setting elements that shape action and the final image. The arbor “bends closer,” the moon’s timing governs the ritual, and the frame/tendril constrains how sound is made. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful across beats (dew into tone; needles keeping time). The closing image is charged by place: the grove’s voice answering the hum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore rites before the harvest moon) is signaled early, and pressure tightens via the live clock and rehearsal until silence becomes a “tool.” Escalation arrives as density and cadence shift when the moon rises, the tendril glows, and the ritual effects manifest. The price is felt in endurance and communal discipline rather than jeopardy; no hard reversal, but the deepening is clear for the chosen lens. Stakes resolve through collective action guided by Rowen’s method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of attention, consent with the natural world, and communal repair emerge organically from action (listening as structure; songs as maps; remedies preferring collective hands). The final understanding reweights prior material without a spelled‑out moral, and images carry meaning (mended bowls; warmed jars; the grove “agreeing to meet us”). One line verges on thesis (“alignment is not precision but consent”) but it’s embedded in scene and supported by enactment. Resonance lingers without tidy didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice sustains a consistent psychic distance and perceptual bias (“smiling like someone who trusts dew to teach”). Rhythms modulate with the ritual’s build, and speech snippets feel integrated rather than expository. No head‑hopping or register drift; the collective‑first‑person singular “I” stays coherent. Purposeful elision clarifies rather than obscures.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet controlled; metaphors are largely coherent and advance sense (“dew trembled into tone,” “moon lowered its chin”). Minimal scaffold or synonym loops; sentences carry multi‑tasked information with momentum. A high figurative density risks saturation, but cadence and specificity keep clarity intact, especially at closure. No artifacts dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a tinkerer‑shaman with a living vine instrument, jars catching notes, and consent as the ritual’s moral physics. The harvest‑moon alignment trope is revitalized through tactile mechanics and communal praxis. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the setup of listening and restraint. Risk‑taking in diction and method heightens stakes without losing legibility.</comment>
