<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear motive—proving whispers over shouts—drives concrete tactics (steeping petals, humming, using the vial). Interiority is specific and embodied (“loses its need to be right”), with a credible tension between restraint and the urge to assert. The mentor dynamic briefly but effectively pressures the desire to be believed. The earned endurance at the end (workful listening) forecloses the easy path of horn/shout without tidy sanctimony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern intensifies from ritual preparation → hum/scent release → wind seam → freighter’s quiet approach → mentor’s witness. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the salute and mentor’s eyes closed reconfigure status and validate the method. Cost is present as disciplined restraint and labor; while subtle, it’s legible on the page. Orientation is crisp from the first line; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, fog, rails, wick, and lantern glass are tactile and POV‑filtered; the micro‑setting (vial, lantern) charges the final image. Environment shapes tactics (horn vs whisper; gallery wind; horizon watch) and informs options for guiding the ship. Sensory balance across smell, sound, and touch deepens atmosphere without excess cataloguing. The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is integral, not postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding the freighter and validating the whisper ethos—is signaled early and tightens through the scent gambit and the wind’s “seam of calm.” The meaningful turn is the ship’s bow leaning to the seam and the mentor arriving to witness. Costs are self‑suppression and sustained attention rather than physical peril; they read but stay quiet. Escalation is lyric and controlled, if restrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around tenderness as effective force, ritual as labor, and listening as ethics; it emerges through action (scent, hum) and the beekeeper parallel. The final cadence reweights prior images—the vial, prayer‑wheel light, wind seam—without moralizing, aside from one earned line (“the right kind of listening is work”). The “screaming tenderness” phrase recurs meaningfully and blooms at closure. Ambiguity lingers productively in the sea “hears nothing and everything.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, assured lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction and rhythm feel native to the character’s sensibility. Sparse dialogue is subtextual and in‑character (the mentor’s silence as assent). Patterned elision is taught early and maintained without confusion. No head‑hopping or register slips sabotaging pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphor; lines often do double duty (world + psyche). Occasional flourish risks purple but stays coherent and voice‑justified; no paraphrase loops or template cadence drag. Rhythm modulates well from ritual calm to charged poise. Final lines resolve by image without blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: guiding a freighter by night‑garden perfume and hum, a vial that purifies intention, and a beekeeper’s trumpet lore. Turns feel earned from seeded logic rather than late rule drops. The conceptual risk (tenderness as navigational technology) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Memorable images and method make this feel singular.</comment>
