<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation (scarred body, pillbox history) fuels specific, pressured micro-choices. His “prudently daring” tactician’s mindset manifests in the snow‑code method and the measured disposal of leverage. The relationship with Len tightens choices and reveals character through silent codes and the ring reveal. The final renunciation (film to sea) feels earned, with a credible cost and an interior realignment on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with tight causality under a Situational lens: the rendezvous pressure coheres toward a decisive act. The closure lands on‑page: the microfilm is sacrificed, the ring is chosen, future options reconfigured with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and set‑ups (pillbox, codes, promise) pay off. The cost (forfeiting intel/lever) is legible in the act and its negotiated consequence (reentry via Len).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bluff, mist, snow, sea, and wind are not postcards; they constrain tactic and meaning (snow as code medium; sea as disposal). The pillbox functions as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. Sensory textures are selective and POV‑driven, with professional noticing shaping detail. The final water image reweights the environment into a carrier of cost and transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (trust/return vs. self‑erasure) is signaled early and tightens via the ring reveal and the agreed signal to open the pillbox. The meaningful turn is the disposal of microfilm—foreclosing a path and accepting reliance on Len. Internal and external conflicts interweave (self‑repair vs. operational risk). Quiet but palpable pressure; price is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of courage as practice and trust as the locus where “unused courage waits” emerges through action (codes, renunciation, ring). Subtext resides in pressure, gesture, and object choice rather than sermonizing, though Len’s line edges close to voiced thesis. The final image of ring over scars and walking home renewed offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity persists without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a professional’s perceptual signature—precision about tools, surfaces, and pressure. Dialogue is minimal, well‑placed, and subtextual; it advances choices without expository drag. The stance and distance remain stable, and patterned diction is taught early and held. Rhythm modulates at peaks without head‑hopping or clarity loss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; minimal scaffold or loops. The figurative palette is rich but largely coherent to the scene (“silver hush,” “fox weight,” “maplines”). A few metaphoric stacks approach saturation but do not blur action or cost. Syntax varies and the final line cleanly resolves image and intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Spy rendezvous tropes are transformed through tactile micro‑methods (snow codes, cane/boot/finger alphabet) and the pillbox’s evolving contents. The ring turn is specific and rehumanizes the espionage frame without cliché fireworks. The seawater disposal as choice (not chase) feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Boldness lies in the quiet, procedural lyricism that heightens risk without gimmickry.</comment>
