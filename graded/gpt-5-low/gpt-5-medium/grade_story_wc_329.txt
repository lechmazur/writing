<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (to reawaken beauty) under real pressure, with concrete micro-choices: playing “resonantly soft,” adopting the locust mute, and switching to heart‑rhythm signaling. The internal contradiction (longing vs. fear of punishment) is dramatized, not told. Embodied reactions (bow as conductor’s wand; the wrist reach) reveal character under stress. Only minor note: the protagonist achieves a lot with high competence, with limited on‑page stumble.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and cadence build to a resonant reconfiguration as statues’ halos gutter, joints unclench, and the orchard shifts from surveillance to shelter. Orientation is crisp from the first line; objects and stakes recur coherently. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (risk of punishment) present throughout, though little paid after the turn. The final image (“Beauty… teaches stone to dream in daylight”) reweights the premise without breaking prior rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated and constraining: living statues police sound, forcing the “soft” tactic; the sky‑bridge and cables thrum back; the orchard responds via sap/scent. World rules are learned through action (halos spin at sound; copper leaves fall at the turn). Recurring objects (violin, locust shell) function as micro‑settings that charge the final image. Specific sensory work (peach, thunder, soil) evolves with stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightens: play awakens beauty without triggering punishment. Escalation is earned via the statues stepping closer, the wrist‑reach, the gathered crowd, and the heart‑signal deepening. The locust mute is a tactical adaptation with consequences for tone and risk. Cost is mostly averted rather than paid, but tension operates at beat and sentence levels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motifs (locust husk, heart rhythms, copper halos) articulate a theme of attention as liberation; subtext moves through image rather than explanation. The orchard’s shift from courtroom to listening animal embodies the thematic turn. A single explicit thesis line (“Beauty does not beg…”) edges into moralizing, slightly dulling the afterglow. Overall resonance is strong and earned by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric I‑voice with consistent perceptual signature (“breeze between gears,” “tiny cathedral of absence”). Psychic distance modulates cleanly at pressure peaks without head‑hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and sustained. No dialogue needed; the voice itself carries subtext and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; syntax varies to manage breath and pressure. Figurative language is abundant but coherent within a mechanical/natural palette; few, if any, mixed vehicles. No looped scaffolding or clarity loss in the climax. Read‑aloud rhythm lands especially in the copper‑leaf guttering and final tonal lift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: heart‑rhythm signaling as covert language, locust shell as mute, statues’ enforcement reframed by music. The orchard’s sensory replies (sap, scent) escalate inventively and pay off. Risk‑taking in structure and diction heightens stakes without obscuring legibility. Only minor conventionality: a near‑aphoristic closing line tones down the strangeness.</comment>
