<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motive (“graft myself onto community”) drives concrete choices (ear sculpture reply, pact with Farrin, marking whispers, embedding shards). Interiority is textured and embodied through work and “luminescent ache,” with a credible endurance at the end. The flaw “boldly sympathetic” constrains tactics and exacts cost (tenderized, ongoing ache). Internal contradiction is gentle rather than sharp, but sufficient for this quiet arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the listening walk accrues signals to a posture discovery, communal mirroring, and a vow to tend the arbor. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the posture reframes “tag” and the protagonist dedicates practice; the cost persists (“not healed… ache… meant for many hands”). Orientation is swift and stable; set‑ups (obsidian arbor, shards, permission) pay off in the final build. The beat‑to‑beat causality is associative rather than linear, but coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard and crater are vivid and functional: they dictate permission, host the seam discovery, provide shards, and charge the final image (orchard chimes; crater quiets). Sensory specificity is high without feeling touristic; details are filtered through maker’s priorities. Environment constrains tactics (listening to “webs of kinship,” searching panes/roots) and reweights the ending. World rules stay consistent and legible through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rejoining communal center) is present early, with tightening when the “tag” is redefined as posture and bodies test it to form a living arbor. Pressure rises texturally via rumor, participation, seam discovery, and the embodied lean; cost lands in the vow to tend and the ache that remains. No antagonist, but coherent situational pressure and one decisive deepening suffice at this length. Stakes remain intimate but consequential for the community.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of community as practiced posture (not symbol) emerges from particulars: ear sculpture, listening walk, seam/“Together,” living arbor, shards as “teeth.” The final vow and glowing ache offer a resonant, non‑literal answer about belonging through ongoing tending rather than cure. Subtext flourishes in image and gesture rather than exposition. Complexity remains (not healed, forgiveness contingent on leaning again).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV; diction and rhythm fit a maker attuned to materials and light. Minimal dialogue is reported cleanly; no head‑hopping; elision is taught and legible. The voice modulates at turns (twilight seam, communal lean) without losing coherence. A hair from perfect only due to sustained elevation that risks, but avoids, excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density and largely clean momentum; images do multiple jobs (seam, curve/posture, shards as faces). Lyric intensity runs hot but remains coherent; little to no paraphrase looping or template cadence. Syntax varies, and the final lines land crisply. Minor risk of purple never obscures sense or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: crystalline orchard, void‑sun panes, a “posture” as a street tag, and a living arbor formed by bodies. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight: listening becomes architecture; shards become teeth; ache becomes communal lantern. Bold structural restraint and risk‑taking heighten stakes without gimmickry. The vision feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
