<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied (smell, pressure, the shard against ribs), with the protagonist making micro‑choices under pressure (tuning the shard, asking the bay, deciding not to erase). The internal contradiction—refusal to forgive or blame, yet acceptance of responsibility—reads credibly. The child’s “cyclically spontaneous” nature functions as a flaw that caused harm. The final stance (keep the record; map for survivors) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory and multiverse thread intensifies toward the reveal that she pressed REDIRECT. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: accepting guilt and choosing preservation over erasure with a felt cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why) and the bay/shard mechanics pay off. The child-image across worlds is the meaningful tightening that reweights options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and task‑relevant: metal “keeps better records,” the terminal and coolant coughs ground action, and the shard-as-tool micro‑setting constrains tactics. Sensory hierarchy (smell foremost) is integrated with the narrator’s profession. The environment charges the final image (bay unlocked across differences; shard warming). World rules (smell aligns across universes) stay consistent and functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discover and bear the withheld truth) is clear and tightens at the console replay until the decisive self‑implication. The cost is internal but legible: choosing memory over mercy, accepting that her act redirected lives. Escalation is a deepening of pressure rather than adversarial reversal, apt for the lens. The final choice forecloses the path of self-erasure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through motifs (redirect, mapping, smell) and actions: truth kept vs. erased, responsibility woven into routes others can survive. The mother’s silence becomes love/terror, reweighted at the end without moralizing. The final image—redirecting the lost one heartbeat per world—offers resonant, non‑literal answer. Subtext operates in the shard’s warmth and the refusal to “decorate ruins.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and sensory-driven with controlled repetition (“redirect,” “smell”) used as pattern, not padding. POV is stable and knowledge claims match the focalizer’s rules. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially around the console sequence. No dialogue, but narrative texture carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do double duty (world rule plus emotion). Repetition is pattern-taught and functional rather than looped. No figurative muddle; metaphors (aurora in glass, metal as record) stay coherent. Minor lushness never blurs causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a sensory cartographer reading multiverse consensus via smell, using a canopy shard as recorder and prism. “Smell agrees before color” is an inventive rule that drives tactics and theme. The redirect motif reframes fate and care without cliché. Risk-taking in structure and diction heightens stakes while remaining legible.</comment>
