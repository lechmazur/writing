<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—work over sorrow to leave a living legacy—and actions align (wiring, grafting, convening a council). Interiority remains embodied and particular (ears to stone, ink smudged with soil and salt), avoiding diagnostic shorthand. The internal conflict is quiet but present (teaching children “nothing of timelines” while racing a clock). Cost registers in fatigue and the final renunciation, though contradictory impulses could surface more under duress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned acts (wiring, listening, community rules) deepen until the final copper circle. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: “silence arrived not as absence but as trust,” with on‑page cost (fatigue, a lost branch, acceptance of death). Orientation is clear from the first lines (caretaker, orchard, six months). The ending reweights the premise without resorting to a tidy mechanical wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living pillars operate as active setting that shapes choices (where to place wire, how shade and “mineral leaves” respond, pillars widening paths). Tools and environment charge the final image (the slow chord under the final copper circle). Sensory specificity is rich but purposeful across senses (hum, shiver, scent). World rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent and early: tune the orchard before time runs out and build interspecies trust. Escalation is a deepening consistent with the lens: fishermen’s suspicion, community agreements, storm test, and the narrator’s dwindling stamina. A visible price is paid (branch lost, energy waning), narrowing options toward a final act of consecration. Conflict remains primarily situational and ethical rather than adversarial, but the tightening is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “architectural secrets” repriced as relationships, stewardship as listening, legacy as shared practice. Subtext breathes in images (otter ramps, shell offerings, mushrooms’ “white alphabet”) rather than statements. The final trust‑silence reframes death and labor without moralizing. Ambiguity remains productive and moving, inviting reflection beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice with controlled distance; perception is selective and professional (how vines choose companions, grammar of arcs). Rhythm modulates with pressure (storm, fatigue) and culminates in a poised final cadence. Elision is patterned and legible; no head‑hopping or register slips. The diction feels native to the caretaker’s sensibility, not imported.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and musical; images multitask and propel (“copper sang faintly, an insect choir corrected by the living stone”). Minimal scaffolding; each sentence earns its place. Figurative density is high yet coherent, with only rare risk of saturation that never muddies closure. Final lines deliver clean, charged imagery without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The living stone pillars and copper‑tuned orchard are strikingly original, integrated with character and theme. The otter ramps and community council reimagine “remodel” as ecological negotiation, not cosmetic change. The closure image (“silence as trust”) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and tone heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
