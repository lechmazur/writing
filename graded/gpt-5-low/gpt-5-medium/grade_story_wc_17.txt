<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑POV interiority is rich and particular: a vow‑driven listener whose micro‑choices (follow ivy, warm the negative, hop through hopscotch, read the letter aloud, bind the strip) reveal values under pressure. The central contradiction—beautifying vs bearing legacy’s weight—surfaces in “map it faithfully or shirk the weight with pretty symbols.” Embodied cost registers (“my name slid away like a coin down a tide drain,” the shawl of burden). The arc lands as an earned acceptance rather than a tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (diaries → negative → silhouette/child → letter) tighten toward a charged poise. Closure lands on‑page with cost as the narrator accepts legacy and promises return, mapping “future footfalls” while the tide lifts the house. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). The final image reweights the premise without mechanical wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drowned district, ivy‑veiled passage, soot‑black hearth, and negative as ghost‑tool are vivid and character‑filtered. Environment constrains tactics (ivy leads entry; hearth yields method; water is a “landlord” and tide later lifts the house). Sensory detail is balanced and purposeful across sight, sound, touch, even pressure. The ending’s tide/house rise charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethically mapping legacy—intensifies through a pattern break: the image’s instruction to “play the room,” leading to the letter and vow. Pressure coheres as the narrator chooses burden over aesthetic evasion, with a felt price (self‑erasure hints, weight accepted). Escalation is internal but tangible via distinct beats. Quiet, but a clear tightening and stance crystallization occur.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Legacy, guilt, climate grief, and listening as citizenship emerge organically through object/action (negative, hopscotch, letter), not through moralizing. The final “map of future footfalls” answers the piece’s question with a non‑literal, resonant ethic of attention and return. Recurrences (ivy, echoes, diaries, tide) are reweighted at the end. Ambiguity is meaningful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyrical voice with controlled imagery and consistent focalization; diction suits an “echo cartographer.” Rhythm modulates well—lush but legible, with precise metaphors that align to the sensory vocation. No head‑hopping or register drift; the taught lyric pattern pays off at closure. Quasi‑dialogue (tapping walls) carries subtext without breaking stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet mostly free of muddle; metaphors cohere to the acoustic/marine palette. Momentum holds through varied sentence rhythms and purpose‑driven images. Minor risk of saturation, but repetition is purposeful rather than scaffolding. The final third remains crisp, preserving the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “corridor echo cartographer” premise is striking and integrated, transforming familiar post‑climate ruins through a fresh method of listening/mapping. Objects (film negative, diaries) and play (hopscotch) become inventive investigative tools. The ending synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten coherence rather than obscure it.</comment>
