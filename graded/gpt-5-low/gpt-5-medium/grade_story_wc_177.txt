<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority (“names are maps…mine is a maze”) and motivation shape concrete micro‑choices: breaking the wafer, feeding dream‑translations, and finally opening the door. The internal friction between algorithmic duty and chosen invitation is dramatized, not merely stated. Bodily/sensory anchoring under pressure (“bunker becomes a lung…”) keeps emotion embodied. The renunciation of captivity carries a felt cost as she steps into the storm.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm pressure, dream‑method, wafer breach, recovered verb “to shepherd,” culminating in opening the door. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—directives “decay into invitations”—with the cost of leaving safety implied by weather and relinquishing algorithmic shelter. Orientation is strong early (who, where, when) and pattern is taught and kept. One decisive cadence shift (map steadies, door opens) delivers the before/after cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bunker, archive, and storm aren’t wallpaper—they constrain and channel action (waiting, sealing/unsealing, weather clock). Recurring objects (wafer, reels, door) charge the final image; the bunker “as lung” directly frames the choice to leave. Sensory specificity across sound, touch, and smell is integrated with tactics. World rules are learned through use (archive directives, drone projection) without dumpiness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fate vs chosen path) tightens through the approaching storm and the archive’s failing directives. The meaningful turn arrives with the recovered verb “to shepherd,” forcing a stance beyond maintenance into risk. The wafer’s designed brittleness converts duty into invitation, foreclosing bunker‑safety. Price is legible in stepping into weather and abandoning the sheltering algorithm.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: decaying authority, consent, and agency reframed (“directives decay into invitations”). The final act reweights the premise without moralizing, answering the central question through image—opening the door as chosen reciprocity with the path. Motifs (wafer, lung, map/eels) shift meaning at the end. A couple of aphoristic lines flirt with statement, but they’re earned by scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV and register; metaphor systems are coherent and character‑specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure (cadence tightens around the opening). Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is minimal but fits the voice and subtext (the drone’s riddle underscores tone without derailing action).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; most lines do double duty (world + theme). Figurative language is abundant but disciplined, with minimal metaphor clash; the “lung” and “map/eels” threads sustain clarity. Momentum rarely stalls; sentence variety supports flow. A few aphoristic turns edge toward purple but don’t blunt the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archive‑as‑organ, decaying directives, and dream‑driven cartography synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame. The “wafer designed to fail” and “directives → invitations” turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and structure heighten coherence rather than gimmickry. The piece avoids template beats, delivering a singular stance.</comment>
