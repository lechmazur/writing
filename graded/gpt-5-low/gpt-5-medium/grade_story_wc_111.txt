<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—he wants proof the garden knows him—and his choices (rituals, planting the marble, confession, trimming, leaving the gate unlatched) align under pressure. Contradictory impulses—pragmatic superstition vs. honesty—collide at the fountain. Embodied emotion lives in tactile actions (polishing, kneeling, offering soil). The change reads as Earned Stasis: he accepts cost (admitting the lie, accepting wither) to recalibrate the relationship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the maze’s elegant objection and the fountain confrontation create the decisive tightening; confession reconfigures options, leading to the garden’s acceptance. Closure lands: the exchanged nods, steady dials, and unlatched gate crystallize a before/after with visible cost and reweighted agency. Orientation is clean early (garden, dials, maze, persona). Causal links hold without contradiction: deception → maze censure → confession → partial absolution → earned equilibrium.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden maze is tactile and rule‑bearing: it steers visitors, hisses dissent, parts to reveal the oldest vine, and literally presses a dial. Recurring objects (dials, bell, marbles) function as micro‑settings that constrain choices and charge the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true, with weather and tools affecting action. The final tableau is inseparable from place logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recognition by the garden) is pressured when the maze rejects his “mended deception,” spinning dials and forcing confession. The tightening forecloses a path: performance‑ritual alone won’t suffice; honesty with cost (penance, trimming) is required. Cost is concrete (surrendering a crafted myth; accepting wither in trimming), though the tension is quiet rather than visceral. Resolution stems from his altered stance, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of mercy, stewardship, and reciprocity evolve through specific acts (planting a lie during drought, confession, revaluing marbles from prizes to witnesses). The “luck measurable” conceit integrates with ethics: metrics bow only after moral recalibration. Aphoristic lines risk neatness but feel earned by scene pressure (e.g., “fortune is a mirror” lands because it reweights the marbles and vine moment). The final equal‑standing image offers a resonant, non‑moralizing answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric first‑person with a gardener’s perceptual bias; rhythm modulates with pressure without head‑hopping. Patterned diction is taught early (rituals, measurements) and paid off cleanly at closure. No register drift; images feel voice‑born, not generic. The voice’s confidence matches what he can plausibly infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do two jobs (world + motive), and rhythm varies. Occasional aphoristic turns approach ornateness but remain legible and scene‑bound. No paraphrase loops or muddled metaphors in peak beats. Final images are crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The measurable‑luck/garden reciprocity frame is fresh, and “mended deception” as ethical hinge is distinctive. Recurring objects are transformed in non‑obvious ways (marbles as penance/witnesses). Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The end synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
