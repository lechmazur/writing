<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivations are clear (save the district by “capturing” the dream) and evolve credibly into care over control. Interiority is specific to Ilen’s craft (“worker of surfaces”) with embodied action guiding emotion. The relationship pressure is live—Noor’s falter (“breath shook”) creates a crucible where Ilen adapts. The change lands as earned endurance/care rather than triumphal trap.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres through the ritual corridor and breath pattern, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (teach holding, not trap). Stakes are anchored early and the final seam “bright as glass mountains” registers conceptual cost and relief. The strain (wobbling mirrors, fear of shatter) is on-page and paid off. Closure is quiet but decisive within this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard, fog, frost, mirrors, and sextant are woven into tactics and constraint, not just scenery. Environmental specifics (frost as ground, fog learning their pulse) directly shape choices. Tools and place charge the final image. Spatial and sensory choreography remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates when Noor’s breath wobbles and the corridor threatens to split. Ilen’s stabilizing choice (heel to frost, counting seasons) is the key tightening that narrows options from chase to contained re-creation. Costs are modest but felt (risk of shatter, endurance under cold and fear). Resolution arises from the protagonists’ altered stance and disciplined method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of boundary, care vs capture, and brokenness as instruction emerge organically through objects and action. The final reweighting (“not to trap, but to teach holding”) resonates back through mirrors, sextant, and orchard. Symbolic recurrence (“glass mountains,” bees) stays grounded rather than didactic. Ambiguity remains meaningful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with controlled distance stays anchored to Ilen’s perception and craft lexicon. Patterned diction is taught early and maintained under pressure without leakage. Minimal dialogue is apt and subtextual. The voice modulates with intensity (from hush to knife-singing) while remaining legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-density lyricism largely avoids muddle; images are consistent and do multi‑tasking work. Occasional metaphor stacking verges on lush but maintains clarity and momentum, especially in the corridor sequence. No notable loops or scaffold. Final lines are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mirror‑craft ritual to coax a runaway dream in a frost‑fog orchard is striking and cohesive. The reconfiguration from capture to caretaking via breath and broken tools feels fresh and inevitable. Risks in diction and concept pay off without obscuring stakes. The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
