<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—“to unbind the silence” and find beauty in the unfinished—is clear, embodied through choices (playing incomplete songs, gathering objects, deciding to tend “halves and almosts”). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (the ear trained by breakwaters; rosin drawing voice from maple). There’s limited internal contradiction, but the gentle acceptance of cost (abandoning bonfire tradition, taking on “gentle obligations”) reads as an earned endurance rather than a neat epiphany. Dialogue with Lark sharpens values without flattening them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through image and ritual until the group decides to “visit the halves and the almosts,” and the bowl’s contents “draw a map.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the community assumes ongoing obligations; the artist enshrines incompletion as practice. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (who/where/when). The final cadence (“song that refuses to be done”) reweights the premise without tying off too neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse-orchard ringed by wrecks is vividly rendered and functionally active: shipwrecks “keep watch,” tide drifts doors ajar, footprints are left on steps. The environment charges choices and the final image, and the bowl and instruments act as micro‑settings. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through an acoustician’s attention. Consistent world rules support the surreal‑real hybrid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but coherent: can music reorient a damaged place/community toward “unfinished” beginnings. Escalation is a density‑increase rather than a reversal; the key tightening is the communal decision to carry obligations forward, with the gift exchange sealing a costed stance. The conflict is more stance‑than‑opposition, but the hush braiding around notes offers pressure. One could wish for a sharper on‑page test, yet the chosen mode sustains tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: incompletion as communal practice; repair via direction rather than glue; tradition adapted without fire. The ending offers a non‑literal answer—the “map” of unfinished places and footprints as ongoing song—without moralizing. Recurring images (bowl, hush, shipwreck timbers, seeds) accrue meaning and shift at closure. No sermonizing; the “magnificent simplicity” credo feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with an acoustical perceptual signature; metaphors feel of a piece with the narrator’s craft. Elision is taught from the first line and remains legible; POV is stable. Dialogue is spare, natural, and carries subtext (“Not with glue…with direction”). No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, images doing multiple jobs. Figurative load is heavy but disciplined and coherent to the voice, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffold or loops; rhythm supports the accumulative build. A touch of metaphor saturation keeps it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑burn tidal orchard, violin as directional repair, a bowl mapping the unfinished—feels original and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mode, quiet stakes, communal closure) heighten coherence rather than obscure it. Emotional truth lands without trend chasing or prefab tropes. The piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>
