<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Jae’s motives (care for the mantas and a stubborn need to prove sideways time) drive every choice, from pulling the lever to setting markers afterward. His competence and gentleness cohere into a credible, particular interiority (“listening without shiver,” “icy warmth”). Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal—he rarely wavers under pressure—yet the quiet concealment of his own delayed selves suggests an earned, private cost. The final acceptance of proof “as an affection, not a test” lands as a measured evolution rather than a tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with a causal spine: missing mantas → probe/lever → lattice → inversion → return → markers for proof. Orientation is clear early; each move follows because/therefore logic, with the lever and gantry constraining options. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: rescue accomplished and meaning reweighted by the intimate proof and its kept secret. The cost is quiet (surge loosened, the concealment, the peril of the nexus) but on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station, ravine, gantry, and lever are tactically integral; environment and tools determine what is possible and charge the ending. Sensory texture is vivid and selective (“breath pulled sideways through ice,” “a vault smelling of ozone and distant rain”). World rules are learned through action (field layering, inversion) without dump. The final image (“air smelled like cold salt and new paper”) reframes the place after risk and return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (return the mantas; secondarily, prove sideways time) tightens when Jae risks the surge to wake the coils and again when he inverts the fields. The reversal/deepening is clear: apparent solution (mapping) forces a bolder choice (refracting homeward), then a subtler, costed push (markers and offsets). Price is present but understated; peril and repair are gestured at more than dramatized. Still, agency governs every turn and coincidence does not resolve anything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Listening, care versus proof, and time’s sidelong drift braid through recurring images (“hush of wings,” “icy warmth,” the lever) and culminate in a repricing of what counts as evidence. The choice to accept proof as affection rather than spectacle offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question. Subtext blooms in the withheld confession and the choir of “delayed selves.” No moralizing; the theme lingers with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a technician’s bias for tools and textures; diction is consistent with Jae’s sensibility. Rhythmic modulation tracks pressure (from hush to surge to steadied lattice). Purposeful elision is taught and paid off (sideways time moves from hunch to on‑page pattern and private proof). No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple loads—world, action, and tone—without padding; imagery is fresh and coherent to the concept. Metaphoric density is high yet disciplined; few, if any, mixed metaphors or loops. Momentum holds through lyric passages, with strong verb choices and minimal scaffolding. A touch more sentence-length variance under peak pressure could sharpen propulsion, but clarity remains excellent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Migratory sky mantas, a harp‑shaped station, and sideways time made operational via holographic inversion feel striking and integrated. Turns are non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight, rooted in character and environment. The quiet final repricing—proof as affection—elevates beyond concept-cleverness. Risk-taking in voice and premise pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
