<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (“I have come to make friends with uncertainty”) and borne out through the binding choice to “wait” and to interiorize rather than cross. Interiority is vivid and embodied (frostbite reading, breath tithe), showing contradiction between homesick ache and chosen endurance. The guardian as foil sharpens values without over‑explaining. A hair of abstraction remains, but the micro‑choices land.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and rules (boundaries of light, interiorizing) accrete toward a charged poise ending. Closure arrives with felt cost: the bead keeps a “sliver of my breath,” and the narrator leaves by not leaving, reweighting options. Orientation is taught early (frozen garden, guardian) and feeds the final image. No causality breaks; set‑ups (sundial, pendant) pay off precisely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden, mist, sundial, and pendant shape tactics and the ending—light’s radius literally constrains proximity and behavior. Sensory selection is purposeful (frost, breath, vellum, salt), and world rules are learned through action. The final respect for the light’s edge charges the last beat. Environment is not wallpaper; it governs choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging without erasing self) tightens through the pendant test and the demand to “give to stay.” The reversal/deepening comes when waiting is reframed as binding work, not stasis, and the breath tithe makes cost explicit. Escalation is internal but legible and coherent under the chosen lens. No cheap resolution; endurance forecloses easy crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring particulars: boundaries of light, carrying thresholds, and the ethics of respect. Subtext operates in object action (pendant’s radius; sundial’s “confession”) rather than sermon. The final image rephrases home as portable thresholds, a resonant answer without moralizing. One direct thematic line appears early, but it’s earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (“interiorizing exteriors,” “read by frostbite”). Dialogue is spare, subtextual, and functional; the guardian’s idiom contrasts gently with the narrator’s. Psychic distance holds steady; elision patterns are taught and kept. Rhythm modulates with pressure without head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and economical despite density; images do multiple jobs and avoid muddle. Repetition is patterned, not looped; no scaffold or synonym churn dulls momentum. Figurative language remains coherent to the world’s physics (ice, light, breath) and peaks with the cost beat. Syntax and paragraphing breathe naturally into the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a feral library guardian of unwritten books, a dawn bead that refuses mist, “interiorizing exteriors” as praxis. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the taught rules, and closure is singular. The piece avoids template metaphors and settles into an authentic, memorable vision.</comment>
