<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motives (keeper lacks the “heart key,” promises not to “wake grief”) guide choices and foreclose paths (ignoring the trader; accepting loss as the ghost fades). Interiority is embodied through tactile, specific actions (threading the bead, pruning cadence as vow). Contradictory impulses—longing versus restraint—are dramatized rather than labeled. The final endurance (keeping her vow without her) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lessons accrue through cameo teachings to a charged cadence shift (“six cold syllables,” saplings uncurl). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: bead hung in the doorway, ghost gone, vow kept, travelers altered by pause—cost is palpable. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and sustained. The trader’s knock provides a concrete decision that tightens options without breaking the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse refusing dawn and winter‑cracked fields are not postcard decor; they constrain tactics and stakes (need for the heart key; nocturnal harvest; the vow to warm its own dark). The bead functions as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. Environmental rules are consistent and learned through action (chimes, sap, grafts). Tone and texture fuse with place to shape choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—awakening without selfishness—tightens via the promise, bead’s activation, and the trader test. The choice to “ghost” the knock is a meaningful foreclosing with implied cost (lost wealth/power) that preserves the lesson. Pressure deepens through pattern density (cameo teachings → cadence mastery) culminating in the ghost’s departure. Stakes remain coherent and internal/external threads reinforce each other.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of vow, debt, and memory ripen through concrete acts (grafts “remembered their marriages,” salt of stars in fruit). The final answer—“the orchard waking to sing”—reweights names, commerce, and possession without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful (identity across lives) yet not vague; resonance lingers through the charged object and kept vow. No thematic sermon replaces scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; the ghost’s lines carry subtext and move action (“not to wake grief,” “six cold syllables”). Rhythm modulates with pressure (from lush to clipped at the awakening command). Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off in closure. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (bead as ferry, vow, planet). Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and purposeful; cadence supports momentum. Minimal redundancy; no template cadences dulling the closure. A hairline risk of over‑ornamentation never obscures cause/effect at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost bride + alchemical orchard + bead‑as‑ferry synthesizes into a singular vision, not a stitched trope set. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (debt → promise → bead → cadence → renunciation). The risk of a fully lyric, accumulative structure pays off with clarity and cost. Final image is fresh and indispensable to the concept.</comment>
