<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied: he seeks “the shape of possibility” and renounces the old vow. Interiority is specific (visor unsnapped, gorget clasps, breath, shivering bliss) and the mother’s program personalizes the stake. Contradictory impulses (trained for thunder vs murmured allegiance) act in scene. The final choice—pressing the kernel to his tongue—feels earned and carries the cost of foreclosing other possibilities.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cues, patterned movement, and image density tighten toward the kernel choice. Orientation lands early (who/where/when) and the program’s directions causally step him through the greenhouse. Closure is on-page with cost (“choose one shape and release the others”) and a decisive act. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse-orchard is vivid and functionally constraining: stage‑mapped rows, mercury sap, crucibles as fruit, the ladder, and the clenched‑hand fruit all steer choice. World rules are learned through action and remain coherent. The environment charges the final image (theater bells, nectar, kernel on tongue). Detail selection is purposeful and filtered through this knight’s tactile, ritualized attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens at the kernel: he must pick one future and release the rest. The “unsnap the old vow” cue deepens internal conflict and narrows options. The decisive escalation is his climb and selection under the program’s pressure; price is the relinquishment of other possible mornings and the knightly identity. Tension remains coherent without needing an external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: allegiance redefined from war to tending, art/science syncretism, inheritance via the mother’s program. The final act reweights prior images (stage, orchard, stars) into a non‑literal answer about possibility and care over conquest. No moralizing; resonance rides image and cost. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single POV lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“equations spliced into bark,” “constellations that had learned to root”). Psychic distance and tense remain stable; elision is taught by early diction and paid off in closure. Lushness skirts purple but stays legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative richness is heavy but mostly coherent and pattern‑driven, supporting momentum rather than smothering it. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates dulling pressure. Minor risk of over‑ornamentation is contained by clear action steps.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: chivalric vow meets alchemical greenhouse and theater grammar, unified by inheritance and quiet renunciation. Turns feel earned from seeded motifs (program cues, proscenium, ladder, kernel). Bold risk in diction and conceit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration—choosing one possibility—lands as both concept and felt cost.</comment>
