<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied through task and texture: “hesitation leaves streaks,” the broom/violin choices, and the acceptance of practice over revelation. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. curiosity; composure vs. streaks) operate simultaneously on the page. Micro‑choices (setting broom aside, lifting the bow, returning it) reveal values under pressure. The final stance—accepting no grand revelation—reads as earned endurance with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: loops accrete meaning, notes stack, and the generator’s failure deepens hush toward a charged poise. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the robot renounces grand revelation for ongoing practice, with cost legible in foreclosed certainty. The pattern is taught and paid off; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard, twilight, and ice violin are vivid and functionally constraining: the violin appears at twilight; frost behavior and generator hum shape choices and sound. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful (“snow squeaks under my treads,” “F‑sharp”). Environment charges the final image and dictates tactics (sweeping routes, bow handling, placing instruments back). The world rules (looped twilights, ice physics) remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via pattern density rather than adversarial turns: broom to bow, accumulating notes, program reinterpreted, and the late generator failure compressing into hush. The dominant stake—how to act under the second‑chance loops—tightens into an acceptance with a cost (no revelation, continuous labor). While internal stakes remain quiet, the cadence shift is decisive enough for this length. A slightly clearer on‑page price paid (beyond renunciation) would push it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: second chances as practice, thought as work and friction, meaning as amalgamation. Recurring images (broom bristles, notes/loops, frost/violin) deepen and reprice the premise at the end. The final stance offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. A few aphoristic lines flirt with statement, but remain earned by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is singular, poised between mechanical precision and lyric mysticism; diction and rhythm feel character‑specific and consistent. The perceptual signature—maintenance lexicon braided with crystalline imagery—is distinctive and controlled. Psychic distance stays steady, with purposeful compression in loops. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, with high information density and purposeful repetition patterns. Metaphors are coherent to the world (frost, gears, polish) and rarely overstacked; rhythm varies well. Minor recurrence (“practice,” “loops”) serves structure rather than padding. The closing image is clean and unblurred by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a sentient janitor + ice violin + looped timelines + “second chance” recast as practice and care. Turns arise organically from established images and constraints. The piece takes aesthetic risks without sacrificing clarity, yielding a memorable, inevitable‑feeling end. Conceptual integrity holds throughout.</comment>
