<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The therapist’s motives and micro‑choices are precise and embodied (peeling the clementine, dialing the son, modulating the hymn). The father and son each reveal layered contradictions through action and subtext (“be here and going,” shard as careful joy). The therapist borders on idealized—conflict within her is minimal—but her decisiveness under pressure reads earned. The shard transfer registers a credible endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear orientation from the first lines, a single continuous scene, and a tight causal chain (lab result → call → arrival → farewell). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the son stays, the shard passes, and the father’s breaths thin. The cost is on the page (imminent death, admitted estrangement) and the accumulative hymn pattern tightens toward silence. Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance is taught and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated through tactile, auditory, and olfactory detail (monitors’ beeps, radiator clang, clementine, cloud‑light). The room’s tools and objects (IV, monitors, shard) charge the final image and inform pacing and rhythm. While the “haven above the clouds” doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, the micro‑setting’s objects do. The ending’s pooled light and loosened monitors amplify the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—facilitating a flawless goodbye—tightens immediately with the “hours, maybe a day” clock. The therapist’s decision to call the son creates the major turn; the shard hand‑off and the father’s last breaths seal the cost. Pressure remains coherent and grows via accumulative songwork and the live medical cadence. Resolution is earned by action and renunciation, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: care as craft, joy as something sharp, and hope as scent and attention to the ordinary. The shard/gauze motif reweights meaning at the end, avoiding sermonizing while landing deep regret and gentleness. Subtext in dialogue and silence (“It stopped, but you can still dance”) carries the moral calculus. The final held note enacts meaning rather than stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature sustains control without lapsing into haze. Dialogue is spare, subtextual, and purposeful, differentiating voices. The hymn‑like cadence modulates with pressure and stays within plausible lexicon for the POV. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean rhythm; metaphors are precise and coherent (“light shifts in chords,” “pulsing stillness”). Repetition is purposeful (hymning the mundane) rather than looped scaffold. A few elevated images flirt with lushness, but clarity never suffers and the closure beats are crisp. Syntax and paragraphing pace breath and pressure effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hospice music‑therapy frame with “hymning the mundane” and the clementine as hope feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The broken vinyl shard as talisman and transfer object is an elegant, specific pivot. Risks—lyric mode, quiet climax—heighten stakes without obscuring sense. The synthesis achieves singularity beyond template reconciliation scenes.</comment>
