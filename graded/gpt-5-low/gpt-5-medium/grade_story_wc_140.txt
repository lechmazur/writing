<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid—he’s a “survivor of my own erasure” seeking the “texture of memories”—and his tactics (collecting fragments, confronting the widow silently) align with that drive. Contradictory impulses surface: desire to reclaim vs. refusal to name or accuse, culminating in placing the label and leaving. Interiority is concrete (bitter taste, oily constellations) rather than diagnostic. The cost is an earned endurance: he relinquishes direct restoration of identity in favor of a charged, risky exposure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: overheard whispers → mechanic’s info → targeted wait → widow confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he sets the label as a “small verdict” and exits, forcing her choice while accepting continued erasure. Cost is legible on the page (he remains nameless and exposed). Orientation is clean from the opening: docks, containers, death on paper.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port is tactile and formative: steel alleys, refrigerated vents, catwalks, oily constellations. Environment constrains and enables choices (he moves invisibly because paperwork says he’s dead; the import line maps him to a specific stack; surveillance norms and clipboards shape risk). The final image—the label on a crate in that maze—arrives fully charged by the setting. Sensory selection reflects the narrator’s biases without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming/forcing truth against bureaucratic death) tightens through concrete steps and culminates in a moral trade-off: confrontation without naming or violence. The pressure coheres; luck complicates (overheard whispers) but does not resolve. The cost is the renunciation of overt reclamation for a subtler, riskier exposure. If anything, a sharper on-page threat from the widow or guards could intensify the squeeze further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of bureaucratic fiction vs. lived memory, commerce repainting mourning, and erased histories being shipped and inventoried arise through objects and actions, not moralizing. Recurring images (label, tides, containers) reweight meaning at the end. The piece resists tidy resolution; the final choice reframes identity as a perpetual, costly listening. Subtext hums in the widow’s tremor and the clerk’s exit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; metaphors are coherent to port life and bureaucracy. Elisions are purposeful and pattern-taught; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but charged, serving subtext. Rhythm modulates effectively, tightening toward the confrontation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, integrated figurative language (“recognition unbutton her throat” stands out). Minimal scaffolding, no paraphrase loops, and clean sequencing. Metaphor frequency is high but disciplined and legible. A touch more syntactic variation in the middle third could add propulsion, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bureaucratic ghost premise fused with port logistics and a poison-label breadcrumb feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. Objects and environment are not ornament but engine. The story commits to its conceit’s implications and refuses safe resolution.</comment>
