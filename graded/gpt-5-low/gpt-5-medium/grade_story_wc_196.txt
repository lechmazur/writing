<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The narrator’s contradictory impulses—“broken‑hearted” yet “tactfully hopeful”—play out in micro‑choices: pulling the box, reading the dust, amending the record, and making the envelope. Emotions are embodied through tactile noticing (dust crescents matching finger habits, the “talc‑gray air”). The choice to add an addendum and not resolve the address is an Earned Stasis with cost. No stock psychology; the archivist’s lens is specific and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density escalates from dust readings to the button to the counselor’s “gentle italics,” culminating in the addendum and the envelope. Orientation is clear from the first lines (foster care file room, morning routine). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unknown reweighted from “cavern” to “corridor,” with the cost of accepted uncertainty. Each step (dust → button → prints → addendum) coheres and tightens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The file room and dust function as micro‑setting that actively shapes tactics and perception, not backdrop. Sensory specificity is vivid and purposeful (fluorescents, “cardboard coffin,” dust stippling), filtered through the archivist’s occupational bias. The infantryman’s button operates as charged environment/object, constraining the final act. The closing corridor image is earned by place logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing/recording quiet kindnesses against institutional erasure—tightens via the discovery sequence and the realization of the counselor’s return. The decisive act is not to solve the address but to archive kindness with an addendum and staged hope (the envelope), paying the price of living with unknowns. Pressure is quiet but coherent and deepens once. A touch more jeopardy or counterpressure could have raised the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece earns its themes—how institutions mute kindness, how attention can be an ethical act—through particulars (bus tokens → cookies, stroller bolts refused payment). Subtext lives in dust patterns as language and the two sets of prints as a dialogue across time. One line flirts with thesis (“we pretend is sky”), but the final images avoid sermonizing and reweight the premise. The button and corridor reframe “unknown” without tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct perceptual signature runs throughout: technical, tender, and forensic (“gentle italics” in dust). Rhythm modulates well from crisp observations to longer lyric sentences at the end. No head‑hopping; inferences are presented as inference, not omniscience. The voice bears the character’s history and competence without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and propulsive; sentences often do double duty (image + inference). Figurative density is high but patterned and coherent (dust as grammar, button as breadcrumb), avoiding muddle. Minimal redundancy; no scaffold clutter. A couple of ornate metaphors (“hospital of paper and sighs”) brush purple but stay controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reading dust as “requests” and fingerprints as “gentle italics” is an original operational metaphor, made functional, not decorative. The archivist frame in a foster‑care file room feels specific and untemplated. The closing hope‑with‑cost (envelope for “When We Meet Again”) is a fresh, inevitable synthesis. Risks in lyric accumulation pay off with clarity.</comment>
