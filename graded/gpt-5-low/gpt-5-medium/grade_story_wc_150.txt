<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied: “time hesitate like a held breath,” the tooth/coin/heel images, and the ache of “home as a rumor” all root motive in felt experience. Contradictory impulses—hired to document vs. yearning to restore faith—play simultaneously and drive micro‑choices (listening with feet, returning objects). The decisive acts (rebuilding the sundial; choosing to stay and tend) align with a deepening, not a flip. Cost is present as renunciation of departure and professional detachment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/why), and the accumulative/textural lens holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: aligning the sundial to the guide’s stele reweights time/home, culminating in the charged choice to remain. Costs are legible on the page (slowed excavation, foreclosing leaving), and motifs are paid off (gnomon absence → rebuild → elders' blessing). The sequence coheres without outliney “and then” beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and sundial base are vivid, sensory, and instrumental—missing gnomon creates a concrete problem and the environment dictates gentleness. Objects recur with charged specificity (coin under root; rib of pomegranate as gnomon) and shape tactics. The final image is environment‑charged (dew, first light striking the gnomon) and would collapse without this setting. Tonal atmosphere is sustained without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal—restoring faith—but coherently pressured by the excavation, elders’ watch, and the broken prayer‑clock. The meaningful tightening is the decision to rebuild and align the sundial to the guide’s route, which narrows options toward staying and a gentler excavation ethic. Cost is quiet but clear (slowing the dig, abandoning a clean “plan,” choosing caretaking over departure). Escalation suits the accumulative lens, though external jeopardy remains low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Interrupted journeys” evolves from image to ethic (returning objects, aligning time to the guide) and culminates in “walking with time” rather than arresting it. The sundial’s restoration reframes faith as practice and attention, not belief—an earned, image‑led answer. One explicit line (“I understood that faith could be rebuilt...”) skirts telling but is earned by the preceding enactment. Subtext in elders’ braided prayers and Sami’s grammar remark deepens the thematic weave.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“starlings circled like punctuation”). Dialogue is sparse but natural, advancing relation and meaning without explaining. Distance and tense are stable, and diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates to suit pressure, especially around the sundial beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, varied syntax, and images that pull double duty. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and disciplined; no noticeable mixed metaphors or cadence templates. Minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; momentum never stalls. The final lines resonate cleanly without purple sprawl.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” and sundial‑as‑prayer‑clock retooled with a pomegranate rib feel fresh and inevitable once revealed. The diaspora return arc avoids template beats through specific, tactile choices (returning items to finish their journeys). Risk‑taking in a quiet, accumulative structure pays off with clarity and emotional truth. The synthesis of timekeeping, burial, and homecoming is memorable and singular.</comment>
