<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (recover the “shape of home”) and credible internal conflict (self‑erasure vs. reclamation) are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices: accepting the feather, touching the stone, choosing what to seed, moving the shame‑encyclopedias, and speaking the final hello. Embodied sensations (feather barbs, stone warmth) keep emotions specific. A brief urge to deny (“I wanted to deny it”) provides a live counter‑impulse but could tighten with one more on‑page hesitation under peak pressure. Overall, the change reads earned and carries a felt cost: confronting past shame and relinquishing the safety of silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: images and rules (feather, stone, nightly substitutions) layer toward a cadence shift during the bookstore’s reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a door “sized for your voice” and the first true hello—cost made legible by the earlier admission of buried accent/talents and the active re-shelving of shame. Orientation is clear from the start (mountain bookstore, quest for seer) and there’s no causality break. The final image reweights the premise without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore is vivid and functional: labyrinthine aisles, shelf‑lamps, and nightly substitutions constrain navigation and force the protagonist to “hold fast.” The environment actively shapes options (the corridor forms like a question mark; following it leads to the door) and charges the final image. Sensory variety (smell of rain, flint, old rivers; mercury tremble) supports tone and stakes. World rules are learned through action and remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal (recovering voice/home) and pressure escalates via density and disruption: the feather test, stone vision, and the seer’s nightly reality swap that literally rearranges paths. The tightening is clear when the bookstore convulses and the protagonist must make space for resurfacing talents, culminating in choosing to follow the corridor and speak. Cost is emotional (exposure, shame) rather than external harm but is legibly paid on the page. One more concrete external constraint at the peak could have intensified the squeeze further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: language as home, the ethics of self‑erasure, and forgiveness. Recurring images (feather, stone, jars, hidden thunder) shift meaning at the end; “Your home has the shape of your mouth” risks on‑the‑nose but is earned by the world’s logic and dramatized acts. The final hello offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful (practice vs. place) and invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction and syntax reflect the narrator’s sensibility and pressure. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext and rule‑teaching without exposition dumps. Rhythm modulates well, especially during the substitution storm. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; lines mostly advance character and setting simultaneously. Figurative richness is sustained yet coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors and template cadence. Minor risk of saturation is offset by clarity at turns and closure. Final lines are sharp and recharged without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The bookstore‑mountain, mercury‑glass seer, feather‑texture reading, and “seeding” lexicon synthesize into an original, integrated vision. Risks (lyric density, rule‑light magic) heighten stakes and land cleanly under the chosen lens. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (door sized for voice from the feather/stone work). Emotional truth (accent shame → reclaimed voice) grounds the novelty.</comment>
