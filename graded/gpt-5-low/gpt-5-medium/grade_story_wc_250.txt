<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, embodied interiority (“a familiar door in my chest lift and breathe”) and credible micro-choices (taking and angling the mirror) reveal grief, shame, and a hard-won openness. The guardian’s pressure is cleanly external yet intimate, catalyzing action without speech. Slight mythic idealization of the guardian trims the grit of human flaw, but the narrator’s contradictions land. The renunciation/endurance at the end feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: shutters, light, water build to a Charged Poise closure as the narrator bears the mirror and re-aims the light. Orientation is clear quickly (dock, rain, canal, guardian), and beats cohere causally within the lyric mode. Cost is on-page in the brother’s “refusing the old pull” and the narrator’s vulnerable confession. The patterning intensifies rather than resets, culminating in the “final chord” of shutters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and specific (cobalt dock, oil rainbows, shutters, bollards) and actively shapes tactics: reflective surfaces and rain enable the mirror’s function and the shutters’ language. The canal responds like a character, charging the final image. Details are filtered through grief and attention, not a tourist catalog. The micro‑setting (mirror + water + shutters) decisively charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can the narrator hold/use light against grief’s undertow) tightens through patient acts: light‑weaving, the silent question, confession, and finally bearing the tool. The key pressure turn is the transfer of the mirror and the narrator’s choice to aim it, with a felt price in reopening the “familiar door.” Escalation is quiet but clear under the accumulative lens; no soft reset. A single mythic remove slightly softens the sense of immediate risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of grief, witness, and the ethics of holding light emerge through concrete action and motif rather than sermon. “Teach darkness the value of stars” risks explicitness but is earned by the mirror/shutter praxis and the brother’s on‑page cost. Subtext hums in nonverbal exchange and material gestures; the final charged poise reweights everything without moralizing. The piece invites reflection without blurring into abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent perceptual signature (“rope snoring,” “bees” sampling water) sustains lyric pressure without head‑hopping. Elision is taught early and paid off; the guardian’s “signed with his throat” and shutter‑speech are legible through implication. Rhythm modulates with turns (from long, patient clauses to crisp closures). No register drift; the voice remains character‑bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush figurative density is purposeful and coherent across water/light/voice; sentences multitask without scaffold or synonym loops. Variations in syntax keep momentum; images rarely overreach and stay physically plausible. A few heightened lines flirt with purple, but pattern consistency and clarity hold, including at closure. The final images land clean without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dental mirror as conduit for shy light and shutters as language feel original and organically tied to grief-work. The guardian trope is reimagined through precise, tactile ritual rather than mystic shorthand. The ending’s reconfiguration (transferring the mirror’s stewardship) reads inevitable in hindsight. Bold, quiet risks heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
