<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied: the engineer’s “archeologist of abandoned dreams” drive manifests in concrete tactics (kit setup, timed light, breath calibration). Contradictory impulses surface credibly (“calm panic,” fear vs. purpose) and decisions follow character logic. The final renunciation—accepting fragmentation and leaving with “pathways, not trophies”—feels earned by prior beats. Minor note: explicit personal cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: three pulses and the quake/seam intensify pattern density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as the mirror splits and the narrator departs with a new stance (a map of pathways), reweighting the premise with a conceptual cost (choosing process over possession). Orientation is clear early and consistent. If anything, the price paid is quiet rather than sharply dramatized, but it’s legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon is tactile and functional: mica scatterers, limestone shelf, quake, and the seam of cold air shape options and amplify the method. The broken mirror as micro‑setting/tool entwines with environment and charges the last image as it splits. Sensory detail is selective, POV‑filtered, and integrated with action. World rules are consistent within the lyric logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—opening safe routes for old dreams—tightens through pulses, the colleague’s apparition, and the quake’s seam; the final split forecloses the salvage path. Escalation appears as density/reprise rather than adversarial turns, appropriate to the chosen lens. Cost is present (embracing fragmentation) but understated, keeping tension more meditative than fraught. Still, the cadence shift at the seam provides a clear deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres through event and image: entanglement, industry’s collapse, and tending seams culminate in a non‑literal answer about memory stewardship. Recurring motifs (mirror, helix, noise as carrier) reprice meaning at the end without moralizing. The colleague’s return adds layered subtext about absence and co‑agency. The resonance lingers without prescriptive takeaway.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (“helix‑minded,” “chaotically precise”) remains stable under pressure. Diction, rhythm, and image modulation track the pulses and quake cleanly. No head‑hopping or stance slips; elision is purposeful and taught early. The voice earns its density without explanatory crutches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and varied rhythm; images multitask (tool, method, theme). Metaphor volume is high but coherent and rarely mixed; minimal scaffold or loops. A few lush phrasings flirt with overload, yet clarity holds at closure. Syntax and punctuation are clean and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of industrial decay, entangled cognition, and a canyon‑mirror instrument feels freshly conceived and internally necessary. Risks in diction and conceit heighten stakes and coherence rather than distract. Turns grow from established images (pulses → seam → split) with inevitability in hindsight. The vision reads singular, not templated.</comment>
