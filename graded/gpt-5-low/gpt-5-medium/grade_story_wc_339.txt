<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied: the diver catalogs, copies Morse, taps flakes, answers the current with “two deliberate pulls,” and chooses to take the globe. Contradictory impulses—quiet analysis versus an urge to “mother the past”—coexist in scene. Motivation (to listen, to understand letting go) coheres with micro‑choices and culminates in an Earned Stasis stance. The cost registers as breath/time and the risk of sentiment in removing an artifact, held in a disciplined, character‑specific voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues via time/air limits, current, and layered transmissions; closure lands in a charged ascent with the gauge’s “time for air and sorrow.” Who/where/when anchor early and hold. The final act—filming, then pocketing the globe and rising—reconfigures the mission from listening to carrying, with a felt price. Quiet but legible cost and a coherent single scene meet scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library tangibly shapes action: rope lines, silted chairs, swelled logbook, algae‑green globes, current misreads posture, gauge dictates time. Object‑as‑setting (snow globe) and tools (recorder, lamp) charge the final image. Details are selective and profession‑filtered; water’s “alphabet of ruin” mirrors stakes without blunt symbolism. Environment constrains choices and powers the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—listen/understand letting go under limited air—tightens once when the current tugs and the narrator answers, prompting a measured exit. The choice to remove and promise to “return [the globe] to light” forecloses a pure‑observer path. Prices are articulated as drift vs. weight and tallied in breath/time, scaled to length. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of transmission, memory, and relinquishment emerge through particulars: logbook prayers, flakes’ “minor weather,” vector without coordinates. The final cadence (“time for air and sorrow”) reweights the enterprise without moralizing. One overt thesis line (“The physics of letting go…”) skirts abstraction but is anchored by on‑page images. Resonance lingers as conceptual repricing rather than summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice—technical yet tender—stays consistent and plausible for a seasoned diver‑cataloger. Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction choices (“capillary in glass,” “drowned lung”) feel character‑filtered. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful and pattern‑taught. The voice carries subtext without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with little scaffold; metaphors are coherent within the sea/library system. Sentence rhythm varies and accelerates naturally near the tug and ascent. No paraphrase loops or mixed vehicles dulling closure; the final image is clean. Minor lushness never clogs causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “sunken ship library” with a snow globe and logbook prayers is a striking, integrated frame; the scientific metaphor of letting go as surrender of reference frames is fresh. Risks in lyric compression pay off, and the artifact choice feels inevitable in hindsight. Earhart is deft context, not a gimmick. Emotional truth outruns novelty; synthesis feels singular.</comment>
