<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motive (honor the ancestor) drives concrete choices, and “nervously confident” manifests in the bold but anxious activation of the panel. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“spongey dread,” “like a rickety priest”). Relationship pressure appears briefly but effectively via Liza, sharpening the moral calculus. Minor note: the cost to the narrator remains mostly institutional/social rather than personally perilous on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: decoding couplets → locating the panel → copper nail insertion → mists reverse → confrontation with the director. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a conceptual and social cost (defiance of authority, redefinition of exile as refuge). Orientation is strong from the first lines. A slightly sharper on‑page price at the end would push this higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The weather station is tactile and oppressive (“corridors bleed humidity”), and the boundary mists plus panel actively constrain choices. The copper nail functions as micro‑setting/tool charging the final image. Environmental logic stays consistent and filters through a map‑librarian’s sensibility. Vivid sensory economy supports pressure rather than pausing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (reverse exile/honor ancestor), and escalation tightens from discovery to activation to public consequence. The director’s attempt to shut the protagonist out provides credible antagonistic pressure. The visible cost is mostly reputational/institutional; a deeper immediate consequence would intensify the squeeze. Still, the reversal line of exiles is a strong earned test of commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around stewardship vs control, the ethical duty to the dead, and maps as inquiry. Subtext blooms in the reframing of “exile” as “refuge,” culminating in the braid that now runs both ways. The witty “librarianship… stewardship with better indexes” toes the line of thesis but remains character‑true. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV and precise metaphoric palette (“prunes,” “wetly shiver”). Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and carries status dynamics and subtext (“storms require sacrifices; he meant other people’s bodies”). Rhythm modulates well from dense description to crisp action. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double duty. Lyric figures are abundant but largely coherent and scene‑specific, avoiding muddle. A few rich metaphors cluster (“smelling like wet bread,” “kelp,” “tongue pronunciation”), but momentum holds. Mechanics are clean and propulsion steady into the charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a map librarian decoding couplets to rewire a weather‑station exile protocol via a coffin nail is striking and cohesive. Turns feel earned by established motifs and skills rather than late conveniences. The conceptual repricing of “exile/refuge” feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Boldness serves meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
