<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation (to preserve the echo of wisdom) drives concrete choices—guiding, anchoring, asking how, and adopting peripheral attention. Interiority is lyrical but credible, though internal contradiction is minimal and pressure rarely cracks the narrator’s poise. The walker’s reserve and the prophet’s restraint sharpen status dynamics without dialogue clutter. The endurance at the end reads earned, but the felt personal cost could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → wind test → method shift → charged quiet. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: a widened clearing, sealed record, and vow to repeat despite the valley’s forgetfulness. Costs are present (restraint, labor, non‑speaking, ongoing vigilance) and shape tactics. Orientation is legible early and stays coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is original and operative: the murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and wind actively constrain tactics (sewing calm, reading the under‑sand rampart). Sensory specificity serves function—hushed consonants, glass ribs, drift soot—filtered by the keeper’s professional bias. The environment directly charges the final image (parapet settling; pavilion resuming its murmur). Only limitation: spatial stakes are exquisitely framed but rarely threaten outright failure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving legible echoes) is clear and tightened by the midday wind and the shift to peripheral awareness. The stitch‑across‑gust beat and the “face away” tactic are decisive deepening moves that reweight options. Cost is endurance and disciplined quiet rather than loss, so danger reads controlled rather than precarious. One more concrete risk or near‑loss would heighten escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Echo vs blare, humility, and attention-at-the-margins accrue through ritual and image, not moralizing. The final sealed cup and vow to continue reprice prophecy as vessel rather than trumpet. Subtext in restraint—“We consecrate the record by not speaking over it”—feels earned. Depth is high, though the piece skirts transcendence rather than confronts a harder trade-off.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is controlled, patterned, and coherent to vocation; no head-hopping. Diction and cadence are distinctive without opacity, and psychic distance modulates with pressure. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual, fitting the hush premise. A few elevated phrasings lightly romanticize rather than strain, keeping reliability intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut and musical with high information density; images often do double duty (parapet as both world logic and theme). Figurative network stays coherent (edge, breath, hush, periphery), and rhythm varies. No paraphrase loops or template cadence intrusions. A hair from maximal due to occasionally luxuriant imagery where a starker beat might have sharpened tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: peripheral awareness as method, kinetic parapet as living boundary, prophecy as cup not trumpet. Risks of ritual quiet and accumulative structure pay off with a reweighted ending. Emotional truth feels specific to this world and voice rather than template. Slightly low jeopardy keeps it just shy of revelatory.</comment>
