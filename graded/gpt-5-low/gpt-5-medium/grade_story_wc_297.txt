<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied (“roots in my ankles and questions in my ribs”), with credible contradictory impulses (“anxious elation” making them “brave and foolish”). Micro-choices under pressure are clear: consenting to scar-linking, heeding the leaves, stepping onto the maze, refusing the gardeners, proposing a braided vow. The graft to the mapletree functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and perspective. Slight softness: the gardeners yield quickly, so the protagonist’s cost feels more conceptual than acutely felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain from scar-link vision to maze activation to confrontation to the new vow sealed in cambium; the rule-set is taught through action. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: rejecting the eclipsed covenant and instituting a braided vow that reweights the world’s terms. Cost is legible (foreclosing noon certainty, joining pain as bridge, recording in flesh/wood), and the mapletree constraint persists through the final image. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cobalt glade, the grafted mapletree, and the mirrored pool are tactically active, not decorative; environment dictates method (skin-to-bark linking) and enables the vow’s sealing. Recurring objects (clipping, sundial) evolve functionally and charge the final image. World rules (hedges speaking/doors) remain consistent and learned via interaction. Minor note: spatial stakes at the confrontation are more ritual than physical, limiting environmental peril.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberating/redefining the covenant—tightens through the scar-link vision, the maze’s emergence, and the heart confrontation. The pivotal refusal and counter‑offer are protagonist-driven and narrow options with conceptual cost. Pressure coheres under a hybrid lens, but the antagonistic force (gardeners) subsides swiftly, softening the felt jeopardy at the peak. Still, escalation is clear and purposeful for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of consent, time’s authority, and co‑agency with a sentient environment emerge through concrete images (hedges as doors, sundial that “told only tides,” braided vow). The final reconfiguration (“maze… a grammar”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to oath‑making: yes without erasing no. No sermonizing; meaning accrues via pattern and object reprise. Slight limit: opposition’s quick acquiescence mutes the ethical pressure in the final pivot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric first‑person voice has a distinct perceptual signature (botanical/time lexicon) and remains consistent under stress. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible; inference reads as inference, not omniscience. Reported speech blends with the narrator’s idiom without muddle, and rhythmic control supports pressure. A hair’s breadth from excess lushness, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (“a sundial that told only tides”); momentum rarely stalls. Figurative consistency is strong across botanical/temporal fields; minimal scaffolding and no loops. The prose rides close to purple in places, but the pattern is purposeful and coherent, with no muddled vehicles at the climax. A touch more sentence‑level austerity at the confrontation could heighten force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bold synthesis: oath‑magic reframed through horticulture and somatic memory (“linking through scars”), a sentient maze as grammar, and time arriving early. Turns feel earned by prior particulars (clipping → living maze; noon vow → braided vow sealed in cambium). Risks in diction and world logic heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, and the final image recharges the opening. Fresh, memorable vision with conceptual integrity.</comment>
