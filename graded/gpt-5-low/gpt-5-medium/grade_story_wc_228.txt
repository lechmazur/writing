<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and specific—“intimately aloof” yet compelled by “salt ghosts”—and the micro‑choices (following the brine/smoke path, dipping the shell, painting only a breath, leaving the corridor) align with the vow and its cost. The fear is acknowledged without melodrama, and restraint at the climax reads as character‑true. Slight softness: the struggle feels mostly lyric rather than frictional, with limited on‑page resistance beyond declared fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: mirror crack → cave progression → oasis mirror → corridor → single curve → renunciation → return. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he keeps the promise by not living in the painting, returning to paint “inhales and exhales.” Cost is legible in the refusal and the un‑fixed mirror reflecting the chosen split.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is sensorially precise and tactically active: tide window, forked pathways by smell, the oasis mirror that opens a corridor, the crack becoming a star. The painted shell functions as micro‑setting object that charges the final image. Environment constrains choices and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the hidden promise versus safety in replication—is clear and tightens as the wrong turn becomes a right door and the corridor demands restraint. The on‑page price is choosing a single curve and then leaving, foreclosing the seductive option to stay. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and escalating within the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of authenticity vs. replication and “temporary eternity” emerge organically via mirrors, breath, and the unsigning. The pool’s voice edges close to stating thesis (“keep yourself from vanishing into copies”) but is embedded in scene and earns its clarity. The final choice reweights prior images without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a painter’s perceptual bias; rhythm modulates with pressure and sustains clarity. No head‑hopping or register drift; the diction pattern is taught early and paid off in closure. The sensory lexicon and metaphoric logic feel character‑specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and efficient; images carry multiple jobs without padding, and cadence varies with scene needs. Figurative density stays coherent (mirrors, breath, tide) without muddle, and key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. Minor risk of purple is managed by clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—painted shell as light/boat/quay, cave mirror becoming portal, “temporary eternity” operationalized—feels singular and inevitable by the end. The restraint choice avoids cliché heroics and honors the premise’s implications. Risk‑taking in structure and diction heightens stakes without obscuring sense.</comment>
