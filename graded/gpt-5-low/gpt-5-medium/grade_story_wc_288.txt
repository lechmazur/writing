<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear motive—translate isolation into independence—embodied through careful, task‑based choices (wick, pitch, atlas, herd song). The interiority is particular and sensorial, though internal contradiction is subdued; the narrator remains highly competent with little true slippage. Cost is felt conceptually (risk of shelves dropping, endurance) but not deeply personalized as loss. Still, the micro‑choices under atmospheric pressure reveal values credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of hum/sundial/voices densifies until the stone circle falters, prompting a focused retuning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the library steadies; “weather into shelter” gains literalized charge via the word scratched into the sundial. The cost is present but mostly atmospheric, not decisively priced in character terms. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: vapor tides, liquid floorboards, and the hum constrain movement and tactics. The brass sundial and stone circle act as object‑as‑setting mechanisms that charge the final image. Sensory specificity is purposeful across the piece; world rules stay coherent and learned through action. This environment decisively shapes choices and the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining tuned coexistence without calcifying into isolation—tightens when the stone circle coughs and shelves drop. The protagonist’s agency (angling the dial, answering with herd‑song) earns resolution; the narrowing is clear and coherent under the chosen lens. The price lands more as exertion and attentional endurance than a concretized loss. Still, escalation reads as a purposeful cadence shift rather than a soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of solitude vs. independence, translation, and coexistence accrue through recurrent images (blade of light, baskets, hum) and reweight at the end (“weather into shelter”). Subtext works through listening as labor and mutual patronage with the extinct; no sermonizing. The final shelter-word and prepared empty chairs offer a resonant, non‑literal answer. Minor ding for the relative neatness of the calm return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature—marine/atmospheric lexicon, measured syntax, and controlled rhythm. Compression is taught early and remains legible at pressure; no head‑hopping. Modulation under stress is subtle yet present (“kneeling,” “hoarse and patient”). A few high-density figuratives approach lushness but stay coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (sundial scratches as hoofprints resolving to “shelter”). Figurative language is abundant but disciplined within a coherent metaphor field; no muddle at the peak beats. Minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies with momentum. Line-level clarity sustains the lyric while advancing action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—tidal library above clouds, stone circle hum, reflective sundial slicing fog—is fresh and integrated. The herd‑song/atlas turn feels earned and specific, not a late gimmick. Risks in diction and conceit heighten coherence rather than distract. Emotional truth emerges through tactile tasks, avoiding platitude.</comment>
