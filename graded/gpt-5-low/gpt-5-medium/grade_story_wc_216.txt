<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent: the narrator seeks to “understand the texture of time,” choosing tactics (pocketing the fragment, coded garage sales, waiting the hinge awake) that reveal character. Interiority is sensory and particular rather than diagnostic. The relationship with Lio adds pressure by reframing method, but internal contradiction is gentle—there’s little friction beyond renunciation of numerals. The earned endurance at the end carries cost (accepting waiting) but remains soft-focus rather than sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrue (capsule → fragment → walking the letter) until the cadence shifts and the final ritual reframes time. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—choosing patient, non-numeric timekeeping for the community—visible in the weekly sales and the last “follow the soft thunder” cue. Orientation is clear early (emerald silo, role, visitors), and set-ups (garage posts, capsule, fragment) pay off. The on-page cost is felt but modest, landing more as conceptual repricing than decisive sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The emerald silo and its objects tangibly shape action: the glass light teaches perception; the capsule’s hinge demands patience; the floor path enables “reading” the letter. Sensory specificity across smell, touch, and sound is purposeful and POV-filtered. The setting charges the final image (community rituals within the hum), meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes cohere (how to live without numbers) and tighten via the capsule opening and the walking-letter discovery, which deepen options and knowledge. The main turn is internal/ritual rather than confrontational, so escalation reads as density and cadence shift rather than narrowed choices. Visible price (renouncing prior certainties; accepting waiting) is present but understated. Absence of sharper resistance keeps the pressure below elite level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: time recast as texture, communal ritual as measure, memory as metronome. The urn fragment/loop/cricket reprise reweights earlier images without moralizing. The final gesture (“follow the soft thunder”) offers a resonant answer to the central question. Ambiguity lingers productively, with no didactic summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is singular, lyrical, and steady, with a precise sensory lexicon and controlled modulation at the hinge-opening and cricket beats. POV distance is stable, no leakage; elisions are pattern-taught and pay off. Dialogue is minimal and functionally embedded, with subtext conveyed through action and object-handling. Rhythm is varied without tics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but disciplined; figurative language is coherent to the premise and advances scene and mood. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few high-lyric stretches flirt with saturation but remain legible and propulsive. The closing image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: post-numeric time, garage-sale cryptography, a letter read by walking, and an urn fragment as hinge-key feel fresh and inevitable together. Risks heighten meaning rather than serving as ornament. The reconfiguration of timekeeping into communal ritual feels authentically earned. Minor softness in conflict keeps it just shy of extraordinary.</comment>
