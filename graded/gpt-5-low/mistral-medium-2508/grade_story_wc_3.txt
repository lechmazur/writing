<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s grief, professional rigor, and “analogical thinking” create a coherent, specific psyche; his micro‑choices (climb, plant, touch, then choose to go back) align with motive. The renunciation—seeing his wife yet not staying—lands as a credible cost. Interiority is embodied (sap, hum, magnetic pull) rather than labeled. A slightly neater self‑diagnosis (“the spirit had been a hypothesis”) trims a trace of ambiguity but doesn’t cheapen the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the density and cadence tighten from study → climb → planting → reversal/tilt → reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: reestablishing love while accepting loss; the decision to return “not to stay, but to understand” forecloses a path. Orientation is clear and consistent, and the Arbor’s rules hold. The causal throughline (translate → seed → flowering → passage) is clean enough to support the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Sky Arbor is vividly singular (inverted ironwood, magnetic pull, glowing sap) and tangibly affects action and choice (two‑day climb, tools tugged, branch hum). The setting charges the final image—the branch swaying in still air while he chooses understanding. Detail selection stays character‑filtered (a translator’s attention). World rules feel consistent within the fable‑physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning how to leave without rupture—tightens effectively; the planting and upward flow pivot the pressure. The peak choice is internal but consequential: experiencing the reunion then choosing not to remain. Emotional cost is legible; the scene avoids soft reset. Stakes are mostly existential/intellectual, but they carry felt weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme arises through particulars: leaving-as-bending, grief as hypothesis, reestablishing versus undoing. The final stance reframes the “haunting” as inquiry and tenderness, not exorcism; the Arbor hum continues as living subtext. One near‑aphoristic line (“Some doors only open when you stop knocking”) risks on‑the‑nose but is earned by the path taken. The resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a precise perceptual signature (technical and tender) holds steady. Dialogue is brief, natural, and subtextual; her “You’re late” carries history. Rhythm modulates well from methodical to incantatory at the tilt. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Imagery is lush yet disciplined; metaphors cohere to the Arbor/transition motif without mixed vehicles. Minimal scaffolding and strong verb/noun choices keep momentum. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but remain purposeful and clear. The final cadence revisits earlier textures without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The magnetic, inverted forest and “physics of leaving” seed synthesize grief, science, and myth freshly. The reestablishing (not undoing) twist feels inevitable in hindsight given “analogical thinking” and the sap-light motifs. Risks in concept and diction pay off with clarity. The piece commits to its singular vision without hedging.</comment>
