<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Veyra’s motive—to break the cycle and carry light without fire—is clear, persistent, and tested by the gear’s demand for a memory. Embodied interiority (“thrum through her bones,” “breath hitched”) keeps her specific and felt. The choice to surrender her first‑bloom memory lands as a credible, costly micro‑turn that earns the final step. Ambivalence toward her people’s “heresy” charge adds lived contradiction without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: patterning of petals/gear/sonar densifies into a path and a trade. Closure is on‑page and costly: she relinquishes a memory, builds a resonant bridge, and steps into transit—a decisive change with lingering price. Orientation is immediate (nebula garden, gear, ancestry), with a single scene that tightens cleanly. The “approximating the infinite” motif threads through to the gear’s final stillness, reweighting the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and operative, not a postcard: petals, frequencies, and the garden’s “heart” shape tactics and the revealed route. The gear as tool-object interacts with the environment to generate the path, charging the final image (last petal, new garden). Sensory specifics (ionized blooms pulsing with her heartbeat; shimmering sonar threads) feel character-filtered. World rules (illumination from resonance, aversion to fire) stay consistent and drive choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—share light without loss—tightens when the gear demands a memory, turning desire into a trade. The escalation is internal but concrete: heresy vs. inheritance, comfort vs. transit-of-self, culminating in the surrendered first-bloom and step. Cost is legible and alters options going forward. The pressure remains coherent without requiring an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, stewardship (“borrowed light”), and breaking cyclical fatalism emerge through action (memory sacrifice, resonance path) rather than thesis. Recurring images (petals, hum, gear) reconfigure at the end into a charged promise (“someone would answer”) that conceptually reprices the cosmos’ rules without sermonizing. The refusal of fire and embrace of resonance crystallizes a moral calculus with genuine ambiguity and cost. The final image lingers as a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric voice is steady, tactile, and plausibly filtered through Veyra’s sensibility; diction choices (“troubling serenity,” “approximating the infinite”) feel earned by the world. Rhythm modulates at pivots (gear at temple, memory trade, step) without head-hops or register slips. Purposeful elision enhances the accumulative texture without obscuring closure. No dialogue needed; interior stance carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; images do double duty (worldbuilding and pressure) with minimal redundancy. A few intensifiers risk purple, but clarity and momentum hold, especially across the cost and step beats. Sentence variety and paragraphing pace the escalation cleanly. The final cadence resolves with precision and without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Light without fire,” sonar-thread cartography, and a memory-for-transit price produce a fresh synthesis. The gear’s antique calculus and the nebula garden’s sentient hush feel singular rather than generic SF-lore. The final repricing (“why the stars no longer dimmed”) is bold yet inevitable from the set-up. Risks in tone and concept pay off with coherence and emotional truth.</comment>
