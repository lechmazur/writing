<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Liora’s “forgiving skeptic” stance is vivid and consistent; she keeps the needle, offers the tooth, and bargains without panic. Interiority is concrete (“teeth ache,” “cleft in certainty”), and her bone‑setter competence maps credibly to calm under pressure. However, internal contradiction is light and the choice lands with minimal visible cost, softening the crucible. The brother relationship is mostly off‑page, keeping pressure more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—gap → tooth → changeling → bargain → restoration—reads cleanly with on‑page Decisive Change. Orientation is swift and firm; the well/tooth mechanics track. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt (she relinquishes the tooth and accepts a reconfigured world), making the victory a touch easy. Still, set‑ups (needle, memory flood) pay off coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The secret garden is sensually specific and integrated: vines that tremble, flower pulses, a well whose symbols “made her teeth ache.” Environment and objects constrain tactics—the tooth and well literally gate access—and the humming needle charges the final image. World rules are taught through action rather than exposition. Small deduction only because the garden offers little resistance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve/repair the brother’s loss—arrives early and tightens with the changeling reveal and memory‑flood. The key turn is Liora’s bargain (“Turn them into stars”), which reweights options. Escalation is elegant but soft: the garden and changeling yield quickly, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed on the page. The resolution feels earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bone‑setting → “set the world” motif, cracks letting light in, and wounds becoming constellations create a coherent thematic weave. Subtext arises from actions and images rather than lecture, and the final humming needle preserves a charged ambiguity. A slightly aphoristic line (“Some doors shouldn’t stay closed”) nudges toward neatness but doesn’t overwhelm the resonance. The thematic reweighting feels integrated with character.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to Liora; diction and rhythm remain consistent under stress. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and subtextual (“You’re not him. But you remember him.”). The voice’s sensory bias (touch, scent, ache) feels character‑specific to a bone‑setter. No leakage or over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Precise images (“iron left in the rain,” “polished river stones”) do multiple jobs without bloat; momentum stays taut. Figurative language is disciplined and legible; no mixed metaphors or cadence loops. Minor polish: a couple aphoristic lines trend toward summary texture but don’t slow the scene. Mechanics are clean and the final line lands with image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Changelings and fairy bargains are refreshed through the bone‑setting ethos and the tooth‑as‑key device. The wound‑into‑door and mistakes‑into‑stars turn feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis avoids checklist novelty, privileging emotional and conceptual clarity. Slightly low cost keeps it just short of startling.</comment>
