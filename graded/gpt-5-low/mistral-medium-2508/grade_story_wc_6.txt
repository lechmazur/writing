<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Liora’s contradictions are embodied in tactile choices (sewing the coin, sprinting toward the cry), and her compassion is tested on the page with the boy. Her interiority is precise and unsentimental, anchored by concrete objects and sensations. The visible cost—village scrutiny and the boy’s blood darkening her thread—grounds her stance as Earned Stasis. Minor note: her competence borders on frictionless; a trace more strain under pressure would deepen the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative dominance: motifs accrue (coin, thread, obsidian, clouds) and then hinge on a situational test (the boy’s injury), resolving in a charged final cadence (alarm, coin pulsing). Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to mending fire with fire, paid for in blood and social suspicion. Orientation is clean and the throughline holds causally and texturally. The rescue is a single tightening rather than a full turn, but it’s enough at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, dunes, and black sand are vivid, integrated with action (sewing, wading, binding a wound in saltwater). Setting isn’t postcard—its properties matter (heat memory, abrasive sand, still water mirroring sky) and charge the final images. The coin and thread function as micro‑setting objects that constrain choices. A touch more spatial choreography during the rescue would push this to the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One clear tightening: the cry interrupts ritual, forcing Liora to enact her ethic under pressure by using the very thread she’s been sewing. The cost is legible (blood on the thread; ongoing social scrutiny) and informs the closing sprint toward the alarm. Stakes remain focused on identity and action coherence. Slightly low friction in the rescue sequence keeps the escalation just shy of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Compassion as a chosen fire emerges through images and deeds (coin graft, binding, coals banked) and culminates in a resonant reweighting: scars sing when given voice. The line “compassion wasn’t the absence of fire” edges toward thesis, but it’s earned and doesn’t displace scene pressure. Recurring motifs recontextualize at the end without sentimentality. Ambiguity remains in the village’s gaze, which deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close reflects Liora’s perceptual signatures (heat, texture, pressure) with steady stance and clean mechanics. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext (scars/stories transference via the coin). Rhythm modulates from lull to urgency without head‑hopping. Diction stays within voice while allowing elevated metaphor consistent with character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: strong verbs, selective imagery, and multi‑tasking sentences; minimal scaffolding. Lyric density is controlled even in motion; no figurative muddle at the peak. A few aphoristic turns flirt with overstatement but are grounded by concrete counterpoints (blooded thread, coals). Momentum carries cleanly into the charged final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise (arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter) is revitalized through tangible devices (coin, red thread) and the “scars sing” conceit. The obsidian lagoon and migration of clouds provide a fresh textural ecology. The rescue beat integrates symbol and action without gimmickry. Not radical, but authentically shaped and memorable.</comment>
