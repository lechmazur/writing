<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—repaying a lifetimes‑old debt by waking Vesper—is clear and drives each beat; her actions align with that purpose. Interiority is lyric rather than analytic but embodied through image (ashen‑veil, silver nightshade) and cost. The keeper’s brief pressure reads specific and credible. Internal contradiction is light; the piece prioritizes devotion over conflict but pays visible cost in Liora’s dissolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated ghost-cameos, bead resonance, and poison economy intensify toward the split‑tree awakening. Closure lands on the page with cost (bead crumbles; Liora unravels), yielding a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (greenhouse, bead, debt), and set‑ups pay off without teleports. The “for now” coda preserves cycle logic without softening the paid price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse and endless night aren’t decorative; they constrain meanings and tactics (poisons as sustenance, tree as crucible, dawn‑slash as repricing). Details are selective and character‑filtered (nightshade blooming where Liora touches). The bead as object‑setting charges the final image. World rules feel consistent and are learned via action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens: each “ghosting” costs Liora more, culminating in the tree’s rupture and her unraveling. Agency drives escalation (her clawing back through resonance); the keeper’s push (“You’re lovingly venomous”) frames resource pressure. The price is unmistakable at the peak. Slight softness in on‑page dilemma (no competing choice) keeps it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres around love as debt/poison that both sustains and consumes; the “lovingly venomous” line refracts across the orchard’s economy. The ending reweights the world—debt paid yet cyclical hunger ordained—without moralizing. Subtext in the keeper’s stance and the dawn‑wound image deepens meaning. The resonance of objects and environment carries the emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“petals crumbling,” “smoke through a keyhole”). Dialogue is spare but charged, carrying subtext and action. POV remains steady, with brief keeper insights integrated without head‑hopping confusion. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and economical for the mode; images do multiple jobs (nightshade = love/poison/trace of presence). Figurative density is high but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Momentum holds; no scaffold loops or template cadences distract. A whiff of purple is possible, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ghost‑as‑hunger in an alchemical orchard with a dowry‑bead resonance feels fresh and integral, not ornamental. The split‑tree awakening and dawn‑as‑backwards wound are striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and worldbuilding serve character and closure. The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
