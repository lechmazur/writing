<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied: she preserves starlight through ritual patience. Micro‑choices (blood on the plate, deliberate layering, whispered seal) align with her craft and values. The interior turn (“she had not been preserving light. She had been teaching it how to stay.”) is earned, though internal contradiction is minimal, keeping pressure modest. Endurance carries a felt cost of isolation and time rather than a contested dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps mount to the sealing and the map’s pulse, then reprice the premise. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when established), and set‑ups (flash‑paper, plate, orchard, starlight) all pay off. Closure lands on the page with cost (blood, patience, relinquished urgency) and a reweighted rule (“teach light to stay”). The single tightening—nothing happens, then warmth—creates a precise cadence break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crater orchard is vivid and purposive: silence, frost, and apples become materials and constraints. Weather and terrain charge the final image (embers under drifts) and dictate tactics (hollow apple as reliquary). Tools and micro‑setting integrate with action rather than postcard description. World rules are taught through use (flash‑paper, gold leaf) without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping starlight—tightens through ritual precision to the seal. The beat where nothing happens before the plate warms functions as the crucial pressure point. Cost is quiet but legible: blood, time, and renunciation of the world’s larger “ending/beginning” in favor of patient craft. Escalation is primarily cadence and density rather than adversarial force, appropriate to the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: preservation vs. transience, patience as agency, art as instruction to the cosmos. The final repricing (“teaching it how to stay”) deepens earlier images (apple husks, maps, flash‑paper) without didacticism. A couple aphoristic lines risk neatness, but they are earned by scene pressure and concrete ritual. The ending invites reflection beyond plot via a charged image rather than a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and diction; sensory selection reflects her craft and patience. No head‑hopping or stance drift; psychic distance modulates purposefully at the seal. Patterned phrasing supports the ritual mood without opacity. Minor aphoristic turns remain within the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and imagistic, with sentences doing multiple jobs (world, action, theme). Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“breath curling like smoke,” “frost on iron” as taste of starlight). Momentum breathes yet advances; minimal redundancy. A few gnomic lines brush purple but do not blur sense or cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a flash‑paper alchemist safeguarding starlight in a subarctic orchard via storybook techne. The closing reweighting is non‑obvious yet inevitable from the craft details. Risk lies in quiet, accumulative pressure executed with confidence rather than contrivance. Images and processes feel particular, not template.</comment>
