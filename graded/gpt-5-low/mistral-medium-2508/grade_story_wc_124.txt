<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are precise and embodied: his aromatically cautious nature collides with the aching need to unseal the vial. Contradictory impulses—aversion to scent as a trigger vs. compulsion to know—play out in scene. His renunciation (recorking, smashing lanterns, selling the vial, leaving) feels earned and costly. The interiority is character‑specific, not generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure coheres as scent and light intensify toward a conceptual repricing: the perfume is a key and the tears are feed. Closure lands via Earned Stasis: he forecloses the door and accepts the wilt as cost. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph and props/payoffs (UV, vial, Luminara) are kept. The causal chain (uncork → revelation → renunciation) is clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse, UV lamps, and extinct flora saturate the senses and constrain options; the environment literally changes what can be seen and understood. The object‑as‑setting (vial) and tool (UV) charge the final image by contrast with the harsh dawn outside. Details stay filtered through Elias’s olfactory bias, avoiding tourist catalog. Consistent world rules and tactile specificity elevate mood and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to continue feeding grief to keep the Luminara alive—tightens as UV flickers and the plant drinks his tears. The reversal is internal but decisive: recognizing the perfume as key and choosing renunciation. Costs are explicit (losing the flowers, smashing livelihood, selling the vial). Pressure is coherent, with one strong deepening rather than multiple turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The smells‑as‑doors motif evolves into a moral calculus about consent and grief as resource; the ending reweights prior images without moralizing. The line “some smells were doors. And he, at last, had stopped walking through them” resonates as a thematic answer. Ambiguity remains (will Luminara find another mourner) but not at the expense of stance. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elias maintains a distinct perceptual signature (olfactory lens, precise textures). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and italicized memory lines are clean and earned. No head‑hopping or register drift. The voice sustains elegance without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, with images doing double duty (wet earth/burnt sugar/coin tang as key and memory). No paraphrase loops or purple muddle; figurative density rises at peak beats with clarity intact. Sentences vary in length and propulsion. Final images carry charge without over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lantern broker + grief‑feeding UV flora + perfume as memory key is an original synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its premise’s implications (costly renunciation) without hedging. Risks in diction and structure heighten coherence rather than obscure it. Familiar grief terrain is made specific through olfactory logic.</comment>
