<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular: the face-forgetting versus hand memory sets a credible flaw that drives choices. Her micro-decisions (coin by touch, building channels, refusing to run, painting “nothing”) show a hierarchy of values under pressure. The Earned Stasis at the end—accepting limits—feels motivated by prior failures and the night’s cost. Minor note: we glimpse little reactive fear in the collapse beat, but the calm reads intentional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: coin → instruction → overnight craft → dawn refracting sky → collapse → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing, with the lost library and erased coin indentations as on‑page cost. Orientation is clean early (artist, oak library, demolition clock), and setups pay off (coin returns warped; “mirror the sky” reframed by the final blank portrait). Tight causality for a lyric piece; no soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The oak hollow, sap, mildew, and dawn light aren’t decorative—they constrain tactics (working by touch in living wood, refracting dawn through a cut ceiling). The demolition context and the tree’s “dying flesh” charge the final images of collapse, ash, and sky‑colored light. The coin as micro‑setting object recurs to inflect meaning at the end. Sensory detail stays POV‑filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can she contain the infinite) is clear and tightens under the demolition clock. The meaningful turn is choosing to build the refracting ceiling and then refusing to run as it fails, paying a visible price. The final renunciation (“painted nothing”) is an earned response to escalated pressure and loss. Stakes remain coherent and interwoven with her craft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of limits versus capture emerges through concrete acts—touch‑lock coin, refracted dawn, failed likenesses—and reweights at the end without moralizing. The erased indentations and the blank portrait refract the title instruction into acceptance rather than conquest. Imagery (sap, sky, ash, hush) accrues subtext without strain. The final quiet answers the central question with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“fractually precise,” “hush before demolition”) maintains distance and rhythm under stress. No dialogue; the voice modulates smoothly from tense craft to charged stillness at closure. Lexicon stays coherent with the artist’s sensibility; patterned elisions are taught and legible. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense but purposeful; images carry multiple jobs (action, mood, theme). Minimal scaffolding and strong verbs keep momentum despite lyricism. A few metaphor stacks edge toward purple, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at the peak. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—tree‑library wound, tactile coin code, refracting dawn as attempt to hold the infinite, then painting the “space between breaths”—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet collapse, no chase, concept‑heavy closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Familiar “artist fails to capture” premise is transformed by world logic and objects. The closing reconfiguration is fresh and memorable.</comment>
