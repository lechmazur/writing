<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—to “harness the ephemeral” to rewrite guilt—is clear and intensifies under pressure, and her contradictory impulses (flee vs. stay, breathe vs. hush) are dramatized on the page. Embodied emotions are specific (salt, violets, silt, pressure), avoiding label-speak. The Earned Stasis at the end (refusing the call, selling the gear) forecloses a path with a felt cost. Minor note: Elias’s final image risks softening the conflict, but it reads as consequence rather than easy absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the signal’s falter, the vial’s uncorking, and the hush’s gathering escalate density toward a cadence shift when the signal dies. Closure lands as Earned Stasis (refusal to answer + life change), with on‑page cost and a persistent constraint (the hush follows). Orientation is crisp within ~120 words; single POV and two‑shard structure are clean. A slight plausibility wobble (rebreathed half‑full after three days) is absorbed by the established rules of the hush rather than breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple and its pressures (oxygen clock, collapsed dome, drifting jellyfish, unreadable symbols) are vivid and functional, guiding choices. The micro‑settings (vial, rebreathed, mosaic constellations) recur and charge the final image. World rules are learned through action (no exposition dump) and stay consistent. The environment constrains options at peak beats, satisfying the 9‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeeming/rewriting the self via the hush before air runs out) is signaled early and tightens when the signal dies and the hush gathers. The decisive act—uncorking the vial and surrendering—forecloses the path of continued answering. Cost is legible in the renunciation and the lingering hush, though external resistance is more atmospheric than antagonistic. Pressure coheres under the chosen lens without gimmicks.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, guilt, and the ethics of forgetting emerge from concrete images (perfume, signal, constellations, hush), not lectures. The final refusal reframes “time” as something to hold and release; the violets’ afterscent gives a resonant, non‑literal answer. One line (“Time, she decided…”) edges near explicit thesis, slightly blunt compared to the otherwise subtle subtext. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close adheres to Liora’s perceptual bias (pressure, scent, light) with consistent distance. Rhythm modulates under stress (shorter pulses around the signal’s death), and diction stays coherent. No head‑hopping or unmotivated elision; the voice carries thematic weight without over‑explaining. Minor purple flickers never obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, emotion, stakes) with good momentum; repetition is patterned rather than redundant. Figurative language is vivid but mostly disciplined; no mixed metaphors at the peak beats. A few phrases risk lushness (“weight of words,” “softened”) yet do not dull the closure image. Mechanics are clean; no loops or scaffold drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “gathered hush” as a harvestable, identity‑altering phenomenon, paired with a perfume vial under an underwater temple, feels fresh and integrated. The turn from rescue to renunciation is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Specifics (violets, mosaic constellations, jellyfish sky) personalize genre elements. Boldness serves coherence rather than flourish.</comment>
