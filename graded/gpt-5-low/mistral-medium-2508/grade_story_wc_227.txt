<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied—the trembling fingers, the “half-drowned in doubt” reflection—and the contradiction between compulsive repair and the fear it’s not enough drives the final renunciation. Micro‑choices (which key, when to step, narrating to the void) reveal values under pressure. The ultimate let‑go forecloses the identity built on mending, with felt cost. Minor safety in overt thematizing (“kintsugi for the soul of the world”) keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure coheres (acid sea, ticking breaths, keyed scars) and tightens to a clean on‑page closure: key turns, statue lifts, workshop dissolves. Cost is legible in the loss of the workshop and the surrender of the fixer‑self. Causal motifs are honored (three keys with distinct functions; the third transforms the world’s stance). Orientation is immediate and consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The acid sea and groaning brass workshop actively constrain choices and charge the ending—the floor dissolves, the sea rises, and the final image hangs over the waves. Sensory economy is strong: corroded copper, gears, mercury eyes, all filtered through the alchemist’s craft‑biased gaze. The setting functions as pressure and as charged micro‑setting through the key/object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save/reprice what’s breaking vs. surrender) is clear early and escalates with the breath‑clock and structural failure. The meaningful tightening arrives as the invitation and step forward—an earned renunciation with visible loss. Internal desire and external peril interweave; no cheap coincidence resolves it. Slightly abstracted world stakes keep a hair of distance from maximal visceral cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Repair vs. relinquishment resonates through concrete motifs (keys, scars, mercury eyes), culminating in a reweighted final silence between worlds. Subtext of control, shame, and desire is carried by action rather than sermonizing, though one line names the metaphor. The last image conceptually reprices the premise: becoming gold by letting go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric voice is controlled, with patterned diction that modulates under pressure and remains character‑specific. The brief quoted lines carry subtext and history without expository drag. No POV leakage; figurative choices align with the craft‑mind lens. A few elevated labels flirt with overstatement but don’t break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors; rhythm varies to match intensification. Minor purple edges (“kintsugi for the soul of the world,” “scream frozen mid‑birth”) are coherent to the conceit and don’t stall momentum. No looped scaffolding or template cadence; the final image lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alchemy/kintsugi tropes are made specific via a three‑key ritual, acid‑sea workshop, and the act of narrated stitching as tactic, not mere metaphor. The lift at the end avoids cliché rescue by framing it as chosen renunciation. Fresh synthesis and strong image system feel distinctive without gimmickry.</comment>
