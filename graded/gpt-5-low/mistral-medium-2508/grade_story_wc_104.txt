<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lena’s motive—liberate and disperse seeds at the wall’s fall—drives concrete, high‑pressure choices (decoding, reverse‑keying, piano trap, scattering seeds). Interiority is economical but specific; “Patiently strategic” threads backstory to present tactics. The hesitation at the vault and refusal to run from the guard add lived texture, though contradictory impulses are lightly sketched. The earned endurance/cost is clear: risk, exposure, and emptying her pockets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: wall trembles → move to vault → decode via arrow notches → guard interruption → tactical trap → planting beyond rubble. Orientation is crisp by the first paragraph, and props introduced early pay off without teleportation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: seeds in cracked earth, pockets emptied, the work continues in a reweighted world. Cost is legible on the page (spent resources, peril, renunciation of safety).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The carnival prizes, piano, duck‑pond pit, and ticket booth aren’t scenic; they directly constrain options and enable tactics. The environment’s textures (rust, broken tickets, sign creak) are specific and POV‑filtered. The final image with the creaking sign charges the setting with meaning. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake stays focused—secure and plant seeds under live threat—and pressure tightens with the guard’s arrival and the time‑ticking wall collapse. The reversal (piano note triggering the floor collapse) is protagonist‑driven and alters options. Visible prices include exposure, relinquished haul, and the decision to scatter rather than hoard. The guard resolution is efficient, verging on easy, but momentum and risk remain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The seed/grace vs force motif is organically seeded (keys, roots, scattered planting) and coheres in the ending image. However, the explicit thesis statements—“Not with a roar… Not with force, but with grace…”—tip into moralizing and reduce subtext. Even so, the scattered planting and empty pockets offer earned, non‑literal answers about resilience. The thematic throughline feels integrated with action, not appended.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction fits Lena’s focused, tactical mind. Rhythm flexes from crisp action to poised reflection without head‑hopping. Purposeful elisions (backstory months decoding) feel earned and pay off. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, tactic, theme—without sludge; strong verbs and concrete nouns dominate. A few aphoristic lines in the close flirt with sentimentality, but clarity and momentum hold. Imagery stays coherent (roots through stone, keys, seeds) with minimal metaphor churn. No noticeable loops or scaffold clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival plus piano‑key puzzle plus agrarian resistance yields a fresh synthesis. The arrow’s corn‑husk fletching and the duck‑pond trap are inventive and character‑driven. The reweighting from breach to sowing (grace as strategy) feels earned, not gimmicked. Emotional truth marries novelty without resorting to template beats.</comment>
