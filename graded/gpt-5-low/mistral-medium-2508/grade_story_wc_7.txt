<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’ motives and contradictions are clear—rule-bound hunger versus empathetic risk—embodied in choices to plant, taste, and serve. Interiority is vivid and character-specific (tasting memories; “context” as palate). The renunciation of chef status is earned via prior beats. Slight softness: external pushback is off-stage, so felt struggle on the page remains gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → cultivation → tasting → feeding → renunciation, culminating in saving a seed. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/CR with a visible social cost (defying elders/critics) and a reweighted role. Orientation is clean from the opening. Minor convenience in the plant’s rapid success slightly reduces pressure but not closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is tactile and lived-in (“iron ribs rusted into lace”) and functions as sanctuary and later as communal table. Environment charges the final image (vines on rust, laughter through cracks) and frames choices (he goes there for silence, serves at its door). The setting subtly constraints tactics without becoming a set-piece obstacle. Rich sensory economy avoids generic cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to violate taboo and transform the fruit into food for others—tightens through planting, tasting, and public serving. The meaningful turn is the choice to feed the homeless rather than hoard or sell, foreclosing career-safe paths. External antagonism (critics/elders) is summarized not dramatized, keeping stakes felt but soft. Cost reads as social and vocational, not physical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of context over answers, care as rebellion, and making beauty from ruin emerge organically through culinary acts and pruning. The final seed-saving reframes rebellion as cyclical stewardship without sermonizing. One explicit line (“didn’t give answers… gave context”) risks thesis-stating but is credibly earned by the tasting beat. Resonance lingers via the greenhouse’s transformation and the choice to feed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistent, sensuous voice filters perception through culinary and horticultural lexicons; diction fits the POV’s craft and temperament. Rhythm modulates well (quiet imperatives, lush description, clipped renunciations: “He wasn’t a chef anymore”). No head-hopping or stance leakage. Lyric compression is controlled and legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery, anchored to action. Metaphors cluster but stay coherent to food/growth (dough, pruning, broth), avoiding purple muddle. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; cadence supports pressure. A few elevated phrases (“synaptic plasticity”) brush against register but do not mar clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—memory-tasting chef, forbidden knowledge fruit, and feeding as context—feels specific and fresh; pruning becomes both technique and philosophy. Risks (quiet stakes, non-commercial rebellion) cohere and heighten meaning. Turns arise from established premises, not late rule changes. The closing seed image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
