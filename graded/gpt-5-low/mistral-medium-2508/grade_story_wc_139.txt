<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—to invert her father’s predation and save the twelve—drives every choice, and her math-as-morality conflict is embodied in tactile actions (dipping the nib, recruiting the girl). The status dynamic with the girl is sharp and pressurized without sentimentality. The shift from “me” to “them” feels earned by the scene’s events. A slight tilt toward aphorism near the end trims some rawness from the emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: writing names → ink’s appetite → warning of seven deaths → joint naming sprint → pot shatters → rule‑break cascade → flight. Orientation is swift and precise; the drive lens reads as causal with a conceptual repricing at closure. Cost is legible: Lira abandons the ledger logic and unleashes unpredictable consequences under sirens. The closure sits in a charged poise as they flee with a reweighted “we.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prep room and its tools shape options and outcome: mortuary paper, ledgers, locks, and the embalming environment all matter. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (ozone, wet prints, clicking coffins). The ink pot functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. World rules are learned through action without clunky exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens from private repair to imminent discovery (door creak, sirens) and a moral trade recalculated under the clock. The decisive turn—the pot’s shattering—both escalates stakes and forecloses the ledger path, forcing flight. The cost is ongoing and specific, not abstract. One more concrete consequence on the refugees’ side might have intensified the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fairness versus counting, debt versus mercy, and the ouroboros of con and counter‑con. The final reweighting—“the numbers… added up to them”—lands as a conceptual answer without didacticism. A few explicit statements (“the only math that mattered”) nudge toward telling but do not overwhelm the earned images. The serpent motif coheres the moral calculus across beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, vivid, and consistent with Lira’s perceptual signature (math, ledgers, tactile noticing). Dialogue is spare, pressurized, and carries subtext; the girl’s idiom and acuity read distinct. Rhythm tightens under stress without syntactic monotony. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lean and propulsive with high information density; images do more than one job. Figurative language (ink as blood, rules liquefying) is coherent and motif‑guided rather than piled on. No scaffolding or paraphrase loops slow momentum. A couple of aphoristic lines verge on summary but remain anchored by concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Funeral‑home grift meets magical‑ink ethics is a fresh synthesis; the object’s behavior recasts the con ledger trope with bite. The refugee/asylum stakes integrate without feeling topicality‑driven. The shatter-as-rule‑break turn is surprising yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in tone and object logic heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
