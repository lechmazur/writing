<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s motive (the ledgers and the “disappeared”) is concrete and drives each micro‑choice. His competence and calm inventiveness are embodied in tactile action (picks, tension wrench, timed reset). Internal contradiction is light—he’s steady more than conflicted—so the emotional cost reads as risk rather than a torn psyche. The closing renunciation (“vanished into the dawn”) lands as earned stasis, though the felt personal price could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout + sundial window → hatch → gearwork lock → opened armory → signal. Closure is on‑page with a decisive change and a resonant final image (light returns, but the world has changed). Cost is implied (risk of alarms/light flare) more than dramatized in consequence, keeping tension credible but not crushing. Single‑scene focus holds the lens without cracks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (silvered walls humming with trapped daylight; half‑painted sundial; gearwork pulse). Environment and objects actively constrain choices—the dial’s alignment window, the blackout, the stored light that could flare. The bronze quill holder functions as micro‑setting and returns to charge the final image. Sensory selection remains purposeful and character‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open the armory to ignite revolt) is early and clear, with one solid tightening via the timed reset under blackout. On‑page danger (alarms, stored orbs flaring) frames risk, but there’s no reversal; success comes on the first pass. The price is primarily situational, not personal or moral, which tempers intensity. Still, agency drives every step to the click and signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Light as authority and “spark” as counter‑power recur in concrete ways, culminating in the light’s return recontextualized by change. The “cradle of sparks” motif meaningfully reframes the quill holder from tool-cache to ignition, not mere ornament. A couple lines skate close to slogan (“The revolution wouldn’t begin with shouts or blood, but with a click”), but they’re anchored in action. The ending’s quiet promise avoids moralizing while offering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third sticks to Kael’s perceptual bias—mechanical, tactile, and timed. Lyrical cadence is controlled and modulates with pressure (tighter around the hatch and gearwork). No head‑hopping or stance drift; slight flourish fits the character’s meticulous temperament. Withholding is minimal and paid off through concrete action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with clean syntax and strong verbs; information density is high without scaffolding bloat. Some figurative heat (“lantern left burning too long,” “gearwork pulse”) edges toward purple but remains coherent and scene‑serving. No notable loops or template cadences dulling the peak beats. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The luminous‑fort economy, stored light, sundial cipher, and clerk‑turned‑lock‑sentinel synthesize into a fresh heist‑revolution vignette. The quill holder’s reweighting and the “silent click” origin myth of a revolt feel non‑obvious yet inevitable. Stakes and world cohere without exposition‑dump crutches. The only limiter is the largely unopposed execution, which trims the sense of risked originality at the apex.</comment>
