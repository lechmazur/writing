<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—curating and preserving extinct sounds—drives both the inciting repair and the decisive destruction, with embodied tension when the name unfurls and she recoils. The contradiction between caretaker impulse and necessary renunciation lands credibly at the break. Interiority stays concrete (orchids, breath, ink) rather than abstract labels. Minor note: the turn to “Only mourned” edges toward aphorism but is earned by the prior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: repair by flame → awakening of names → environmental rupture → decision to silence by breaking. Closure is a decisive change with legible cost: loss of the preserved wonders and acceptance of mourning. Orientation is immediate (Liora, opal library aloft), single scene, single stake. The final quiet reconfigures options and meaning without ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal library, glass‑orchids, and bamboo chime are vividly sensorial and filtered through Liora’s curator’s gaze. Setting charges the final image (sunlight into the ruined hall) and the recurring object functions as micro‑setting that dictates action. World rules feel consistent and learned through use. Slightly more constraint-by-environment could push this into 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens from gentle curation to existential threat when the name reanimates the hall; the choice to break the chime forecloses her life’s aim. Stakes stay coherent (preserve vs. release) and escalate via her own actions. Cost is felt in the ruin and loss of vocation. The single meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of preservation vs. mourning, the ethics of curation, and the danger of reviving what should remain dormant emerge from concrete events. The final image reweights the premise (a cradle, not a tomb) with sunlight as repricing. One explicit line—“some things were not meant to be preserved. Only mourned.”—skirts didactic but is supported by the scene. Subtext carries through objects and silence more than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person closely held to Liora is steady and confident; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from hush to command to exhale). Imagery remains within a coherent idiom (glass‑orchids, opal, ink). No head‑hopping or gratuitous elision. The prose maintains control under stress without resorting to explanatory scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is dense but purposeful; metaphors are fresh and integrated with action (“ink that whispered,” “foxglove regret”). Minimal redundancy; sentences do more than one job and propel momentum. A highly figurative register never tips into muddle. Minor risk of saturation is managed by clear sequencing around the match, note, and break.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds as a museum of extinct feelings is a distinctive synthesis; the chime and name‑song feel new and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from her role and choices rather than gimmickry. Final repricing is bold without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and pays it off with specific, memorable images.</comment>
