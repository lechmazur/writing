<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Her motives are clear and intensify under pressure—protect, rechannel, pay the cost—and the internal contradiction (“Logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay.”) surfaces at the precise hinge. Embodied perception (“molars ache,” “vibrations hum through her gloves”) grounds lyricism. The final endurance and bodily cost (“nerves rewriting themselves”) credibly foreclose a former, safer self. Minor note: we glimpse little beyond vocation, but at this length it serves the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: thinning ice threatens → tuning plan → key turned → resonance redirected → artifact stabilized with on‑page cost. Orientation is swift (engineer, lighthouse, marina, artifact), and the drive lens reads Causal with lyric inflection. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with cost explicitly paid in body and a charged final image. No soft resets or unearned abilities; the bomb’s rule‑set holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina is not backdrop but mechanism—its disharmony constrains and then enables the tactic, and the environment literally “sings back.” Tools and objects (resonator, key, sphere) are folded into setting function and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and lived‑in; the weather and ice actively shape choices. The beam and wind close the loop, charging the world beyond the room.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the outset (prevent catastrophic resonance) and tightens as the ice thins and the sun fades. The hinge choice (turn the key, accept bodily unraveling) is protagonist‑driven and paid for on the page. Pressure coheres through a single, meaningful intensification without reliance on coincidence. The bodily cost sustains tension into the coda.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Sonic absolution” is interrogated and redefined through action (not erasure but matching), culminating in “She called it work,” which reframes martyrdom as a professional ethic. The motif of forgiveness by physics versus human guilt lands without sermonizing. Slight explicitness in labeling (“The monks would call it martyrdom… She called it work.”) trims subtlety a hair but remains earned. The final listening under‑ice presence extends the theme beyond her body.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyric, and technically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in sound and pressure. Diction modulates under stress without breaking stance; no head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience. Purposeful compression reads intentional and legible. Image‑logic aligns with POV expertise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world rules, emotion, and action—without scaffold or paraphrase loops. Metaphor density is high but coherent to the acoustic frame; rhythm varies to propel pivots. A few heightened phrasings flirt with purple but do not blur causality or closure. Final images are crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse acoustics as bomb‑taming through resonance, the marina as disharmonic cage, and “forgiven by physics” are fresh, integrated turns. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight given the setup. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The closing invitation to the ancient listener is a non‑obvious, memorable reweighting.</comment>
