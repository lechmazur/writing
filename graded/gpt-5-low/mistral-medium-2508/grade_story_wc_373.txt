<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motive (avenge/answer the hush that killed her father) is clear and her tactics (studying Veyne’s lies, baiting with routes) reveal competence under pressure. Interiority is textured (“neither fearless nor foolish”) and embodied (the watch fob’s weight, steady hands). The relationship dynamic flips credibly when she laughs and refuses trust. Slight limitation: little visible inner contradiction beyond controlled anger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a predominantly causal lens, the encounter tightens from approach → bait → self-incrimination → communal consequence. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she withholds trust, triggers the market’s old-rule punishment, and accepts the cost of letting the tide judge. The cost is legible in her final renunciation (“She didn’t need to hear it again”). Minor opacity remains around the exact mechanism of enforcement, though the text signals it clearly enough (“rules here were older than blood”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vividly tactile (salt-bleached planks, tar and rum) and functions as law: the pirate market’s hush-rules constrain violence and deliver consequence. The micro-setting object (the fob) charges multiple beats and the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered, never touristic. The environment’s social order directly shapes the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (expose Veyne and resolve her father’s debt) are signaled early and escalate through Lena’s false-offers until the decisive refusal. The meaningful tightening is Veyne talking himself into a corner, foreclosing Lena’s option of physical violence and shifting to communal justice. The price is internal—she relinquishes the knife and the need to hear the “sound” again—subtle but present. Tension is steady, though danger remains more atmospheric than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of trust, debt, and hush accrue through concrete particulars (routes, coin-counting, the tide’s due) rather than overt thesis. The “sound of trust breaking” motif reweights at the end as a private, carried silence, offering a resonant answer without moralizing. The father’s fob and the market’s law fuse personal and communal ethics. Complexity endures: she lets the dark keep certain truths.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, noir-lyric with controlled rhythm; diction tracks Lena’s perspective and never leaks. Dialogue is goal-driven, subtextual, and status-aware (“That watch don’t tick no more… Time’s up.”). Psychic distance modulation is purposeful, tightening toward the key reveal and release. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is sharp and economical; images do multiple jobs and cadence varies with pressure. Recurring metaphors (tide, hush, sound) are coherent and not overstacked. Minimal scaffold; sentences carry momentum without synonym churn. A hair of motif repetition skirts the edge but supports resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pirate-market hush economy plus the “sound of trust breaking” gives a fresh angle on revenge. The plan via “false starts” and communal enforcement avoids cliché violence. While the core frame is noir-familiar, specificity and the final conceptual turn feel distinctive. Risk is measured and lands cleanly.</comment>
