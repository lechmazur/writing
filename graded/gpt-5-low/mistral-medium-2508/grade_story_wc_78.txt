<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leeward’s motive—to dub the storm and turn resistance into rhythm—is specific and enacted in micro-choices (what he strikes, leaning into the sway). Interiority is concrete and embodied (salt-stiff mallet, orchard tilt) with a flicker of contradiction (knowledge of prior harm vs. thrill-seeking). The emotional turn from restlessness-as-fear to restlessness-as-anticipation reads earned. Slight thinness in visible cost to him personally keeps it below elite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates through iterative strikes that reshape clouds until the sea’s hum arrives and the “heart” strike crystallizes a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear early; the closure’s cost is implied (risk of storm, possible sink or soar) rather than paid, but the stakes are legible. Tight and coherent without causality slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating orchard, driftwood circle, iron pot, shells, and mallet are tactile and rule-bound, and the sea’s sway literally guides choices (“he leaned into it”). Setting charges the final image (sink or soar; blue hour deepens) and shapes tactics across beats. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, filtered through a musician’s perception. It satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform obstacle into instrument. Pressure tightens with the sea’s answering voice and the decision to strike the heart, which reweights the field. Costs are mostly conceptual (risk to self/others, prior damage to a junk) and the ending’s uncertainty functions as earned tension. A more explicit trade-off or loss on the page would push it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The theme of transmuting resistance into art accrues through concrete action and objects (pear-wood mallet, shells, pots) and culminates in “Obstacle had become instrument.” The final Charged Poise image reweights the premise: instead of mastery, reciprocal play with risk. No sermonizing; resonance lingers. Slightly undercut by the relative safety of the ending’s tone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric voice is confident, controlled, and consistently focalized through Leeward’s musical attentions. Syntax varies with pressure; images maintain a coherent lexicon (sound, fractals, resonance). No head-hopping or register slips. The cadence intensifies cleanly at the sea’s hum and relaxes in the final charged breath.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; figurative texture is rich yet legible (“sound bloomed like a bruise” lands). Repetition serves pattern rather than padding (“strike, listen, sketch”). No template cadence or filter stacks; rhythm tracks escalation. Slight saturation of metaphor keeps it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A tide prophet dubbing a storm via a floating orchard’s found instruments is strikingly original, and the fractal-cloud feedback loop feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk choice at the end reframes mastery as collaboration. Bold yet coherent, with an authentic singularity of vision. Minor cost-softness is the only brake.</comment>
