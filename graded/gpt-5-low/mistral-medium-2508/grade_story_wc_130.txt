<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied—he wants to “map grief” and chooses asking over resurrecting, then renounces resolution with visible cost. Contradictory impulses (precision vs. acceptance; reach for the mist vs. let it go) play out on the page. Micro‑choices—placing the eyes, whispering an incantation to ask, reaching, then pocketing the eyes—reveal hierarchy of values. A slight neatness in the final realization (“some equations weren’t meant to balance”) trims a touch of messiness from an otherwise complex interior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught immediately and held: patterns, drips, mosaic, and eyes layer into a cadence shift at the mist almost‑face and its dissolution. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts non‑resolution, leaves lighter, with the eyes’ state altered (the clear eye clouding). Cost is legible in the refusal to force resurrection and in the relinquishment of precision as salvation. Orientation is clear early; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard, stalactite drips, bioluminescent lichen, and mosaic stepping stone aren’t decor—they shape attempts and the ending image (droplet “Morse,” lichen mist, prism, clouding eye). Objects function as micro‑setting constraints; the chipped patterns create the method and the orchard’s silence charges the final poise. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his mathematic/ritual bias. World rules remain consistent and learned in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and tightens: tracing patterns → dovetailing eyes → prism/mist → almost‑apparition → dissolution → acceptance. The near‑solution (her face forming) forces the sharper renunciation, and the price (letting ambiguity stand) reads. No antagonist needed; the dominant stake remains focused. A slight softness in external stakes keeps the intensity just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from charged images (clear/clouded eyes, prism that recalls green, dripping “code”) toward a resonant answer: remember without preserving; accept imbalance. Subtext hums in the wife’s note and in his choice to “ask.” A couple explicit theme lines (“Some equations weren’t meant to balance”; reprise of “Some things can’t be preserved”) edge toward stating what the images already carry. Still, the final poise reweights all prior motifs with feeling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct perceptual signature—mathematical and tactile—pervades diction and noticing. Psychic distance modulates cleanly as pressure rises (from patterned observation to the mist reach to the quiet repricing). No head‑hopping; elisions are purposeful and taught by early lyric patterning. Voice remains controlled without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and propulsive; images often do double duty (equation/mosaic, eyes/prism/tears). Minor risk of overwriting with high metaphor density and a couple reiterated thesis statements, but clarity holds and the peak beat isn’t muddled. Rhythm varies and avoids template cadences. No visible grammar or sequencing errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of conjuration with “mathematics of emotion” and a cavern orchard feels fresh and cohesive. The dovetailing glass eyes as both tool and moral axis is memorable. The near‑apparition that refuses payoff for a truer repricing risks and lands. A hair shy of groundbreaking only because a couple aphoristic lines nudge toward familiar phrasing.</comment>
