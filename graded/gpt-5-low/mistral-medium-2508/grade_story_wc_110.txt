<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motives—mistrust transformed into a practice of nonverbal honesty—are concrete and enacted through micro‑choices (drawing, sliding the ticket, continuing the practice). Her interior contradiction (skeptical of words yet hungry to connect) is dramatized rather than told. The shift from “cryptic” to “clear” doodles reads earned. Cost is subtle—the relinquishing of guardedness—but legible in her altered stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the acoustics enable eavesdropping, prompting the drawing and the couple’s recognition, culminating in Lena’s reconfigured stance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she no longer needs to translate; she chooses to keep leaving tickets. The cost is understated but present as a relinquished defensive habit. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt and the salvaged lens aren’t just pretty—acoustics carry the conflict to Lena and the lens charges the final image. Environmental specificity is vivid and filtered through her sensibility. The morning light on tickets reprises setting to seal the thematic turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure is quiet but coherent: whether Lena remains a passive registrar or risks nonverbal intervention. The tightening occurs when the doodle becomes a mirror (“Us”), validating her method and reweighting the night’s silence. Stakes are modest; the price is internal (risking intrusion, letting go of guardedness).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Seeing versus saying accrues through recurring objects (lens, tickets, light) and culminates in a wordless pact. Subtext works via images and gesture; however, explicit statements (“The work wasn’t about answers. It was about the asking.”) verge on moralizing, softening the otherwise earned resonance. The final image still lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—syntax and diction match Lena’s attentive, tactile mind. Dialogue is sparse and natural, operating in subtext. Rhythmic modulation supports beats without head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful fragments, and images that carry multiple jobs. Minor tendencies toward aphoristic lines and reiterated structures are present but do not stall momentum or blur sense. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The projector lens as an “ambiguously clear” truth tool and tickets as wordless confessions feel fresh. The accumulative hush, the crystal forecourt’s acoustics, and the transformation of “cryptic” to “clear” doodles synthesize into a distinctive vision. Risk‑taking is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
