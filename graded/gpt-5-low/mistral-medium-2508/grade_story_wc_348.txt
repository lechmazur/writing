<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Interiority is acute and character‑particular (polymer bridges as a worldview), with credible embodied grief anchored to tactile acts (tracing foam, handling the chrysalis). The renunciation of “atonement as bridge” into “dissolution” reads earned through on‑page observation. Minor neatness in the inscription “The strongest connections…” edges toward tidy aphorism, slightly smoothing contradictions. The girl’s brief presence sharpens his values without hijacking the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: river patterns accrue until the decisive placing of the chrysalis and the final wade to convergence. Orientation is clean from the outset; the closure lands with cost (letting go of the fetishized object and his atonement model). The lens is taught through motifs and paid off by the confluence image. No causality breaks; the single scene coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The braided ravine and foam patterns are vivid, sensorially selective, and filtered through a polymerist’s bias. The environment charges choice—he selects the confluence stone—and powers the final image (wading toward where paths become one). While not a hard physical constraint, the setting acts as a conceptual and spatial guide for action. Detail economy is strong; no postcard filler.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to live with separation—tightens from analysis to relinquishment, with the chrysalis placement as the narrowing choice. The insight from observation functions as escalation under the textural lens; the girl’s question tests and seals his stance. The cost (relinquishing the bridge‑builder’s fix/atonement impulse) is legible and felt. Pressure remains internal but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through images of braiding, scaffolds, and emergence; the final act reweights prior material without preaching. “Separation wasn’t the end. It was a pause.” is close to thesis‑speak but is earned by scene work. The last image—moving into convergence—answers the question non‑literally and lingers. Subtext in the girl’s echo of his sister deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature matches a “symphonically minded” engineer; diction is consistent and confident. Dialogue is spare, age‑true for the girl, and subtextual (“Everywhere”). Rhythm modulates well at pressure points (insight, release). No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but controlled, with musical and polymer motifs cohering rather than clashing. Sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, action) with minimal scaffold or loops. A few lines brush aphorism, but cadence keeps momentum. Mechanics are clean; the final line resolves by image without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of materials science, river morphology, and grief ritual feels singular rather than templated. The chrysalis/scaffold reversal and “atonement as dissolution” move avoids cliché. Risks (lyric density, child cameo) pay off without obscuring clarity. Not groundbreaking, but distinctly imagined and integrated.</comment>
