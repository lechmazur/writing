<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motives (safety vs. “sprouting”/silence‑collecting) drive choices, and the father–child crucible sharpens the final decision. Embodied perception (“air tasted like rust,” “honey and lightning”) grounds interiority. The contradiction (loyalty to father vs. refusal of the coffin) is present but the final beat could register a sharper internal tremor as the child leaves. Still, actions align with a coherent desire that intensifies under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterned inversions and the doll‑key escalate toward a decisive, costly rupture: unfolding the bunker and abandoning the father. Closure lands with both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing (“You were never the lock. You were the door.”). Orientation is firm early; no causality breaks. The persistent constraints (inversion windows, hush mechanics) shape tactics through to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, sensorial, and operative: bunker confinement, gravity inversions, and the xenial trellis all constrain options and guide tactics. The doll functions as a micro‑setting/tool that literally tunes the environment. World rules are learned through action (breath counts, hum, trellis warmth) and charged in the final image. Specificity serves mood and stakes without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rejecting “safety” to claim transformation—tightens through the bloom’s hush (gilded palm) to the choice that forecloses return and costs the father. Escalation is protagonist‑driven at each turn: climb, take, unfold, depart. The “they’re coming” pressure adds external urgency without resolving anything by coincidence. Cost is unmistakable in the bunker’s collapse and the refused backward look.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres through shifting images of silence (flavor), safety as shrink/coffin, and the hinge/lock/door reframe, culminating in a resonant non‑literal answer. The doll’s final whisper reweights every prior beat without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful (who “they” are; the trellis’s nature) and enriches the moral calculus. The ending’s “taste of beginning” is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains the piece; diction and rhythm fit the character’s sensory mind. Elision patterns are taught and paid off; no head‑hopping. Sparse dialogue carries subtext and pressure (“For the quiet you carry”; “You are the hinge”). Modulation under stress stays coherent with the established perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; little to no scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is rich yet coherent to the established sensoria (taste/silence, hush/lightning). Rhythm varies to match pressure; the final lines land cleanly. No line‑level artifacts dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: flavored silences, a xenial trellis, inversion windows, and a doll that hums a sprouting frequency combine into a specific, memorable vision. Turns feel inevitable from planted patterns, not arbitrary. The hinge/lock/door repricing is both fresh and thematically tight. Risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
