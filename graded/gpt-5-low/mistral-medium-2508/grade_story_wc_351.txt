<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motives and contradictions are vivid: an engineer self‑rewired into an “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” torn between control and surrender. Embodied beats—the trembling surgeon‑hands, knees hitting ground—ground the lyric thought. Her final acceptance reads earned by prior choices with a felt cost of self‑redefinition. A touch of aphoristic neatness (“the void had been inside her”) slightly tidies complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a steady deepening from canyon/mirror setup to entanglement realization. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses to “unfold” and leaves as “cartographer of the entangled dark,” with the mirror in hand. Cost is conceptual but legible—identity and psychic burden embraced. Orientation is clear and single‑scene scope is tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon, moonlight, and rusted gear are sensorial and purposeful; the mirror functions as object‑as‑setting, constraining angle, tactic, and final image. Atmosphere mirrors internal state without forced symbolism, and the environment’s threshold quality charges the ending. Details stay POV‑filtered through an engineer’s eye, with tactile action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will she risk self and sanity to embrace entangled memory) tightens through the stranger reflection and the decision to “unfold.” Escalation is a density increase consistent with the chosen lens, culminating in an irrevocable stance. The price remains more implied than dramatized, keeping it short of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory as entanglement and identity as a negotiated precision emerges through recurring images and choice, not moralizing. The final reweighting—engineer to cartographer of the dark—lands with lingering resonance. A couple of thesis‑adjacent lines flirt with stating the idea but are supported by scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent, distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and image patterning; POV distance is steady and credible. Technical diction (nanites, synaptic plasticity) integrates cleanly into a poetic register. No head‑hopping or gratuitous withholding; modulation intensifies appropriately toward closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful figurative language. A few stacked metaphors approach saturation but remain coherent and voice‑true. Momentum holds without scaffold or loops, and the final image is crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar cosmic/lyric materials are recombined freshly: a broken survey mirror as entanglement tuner, self‑modification for mnemonic cartography. The closure image feels inevitable given the setup. Risk‑taking in style serves coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
