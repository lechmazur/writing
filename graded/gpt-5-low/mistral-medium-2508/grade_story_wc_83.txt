<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motive—reclaiming agency by “hunting” potential rather than undoing the past—is coherent and builds into a risky, specific choice at the console. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“burnt sugar and copper,” the geode’s heat), with credible contradiction between yearning to intervene and choosing only to witness. Micro-choices (stealing the hard drive, keying the frequency despite the warning) reveal a clear value hierarchy. The final renunciation—remembering rather than fixing—feels earned and carries cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (observatory during a storm, three weeks post-strike, single POV); the causal chain from frequency entry to field collapse to the charged glimpse is tight. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes agency from altering outcomes to reclaiming stance, with the observatory’s failure as tangible cost. The hybrid lens (causal steps toward an accumulative thematic end) is held. No soft reset; alarms and blackout mark the price paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory, storm, and console form a coherent pressure-box; the “cooling breakers” and power loss shape and limit action. The geode functions as object-as-setting, charging the final image when it goes cold. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through Lena’s lexicon. World rules (harmonics, perturbation) are taught through action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (whether to risk collapsing the field to reach the pre-choice thread) tighten credibly via “spiking” readings, the keyed frequency, and alarms. The scientist’s warning sharpens the tradeoff, and Lena’s decision visibly forecloses a safer path. The cost is on-page (system failure, blackout) and thematically integrated. Tension operates at sentence and beat scale without gimmick reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of agency, potential, and the ethics of memory accrue through specific images (veil “intangibly tangible,” geode as “unused time,” perturbation as knife) rather than sermonizing. The ending reweights the premise: choosing to remember the edge of choice is the awakening. Purposeful ambiguity lingers without confusion. One overt line (“She called it an awakening”) states the insight but is supported by earned imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and character-specific, with scientific diction bent into blade-like metaphors that feel owned by Lena. POV distance is stable; elisions are purposeful and legible. Dialogue is minimal but functional, applying pressure rather than exposition. Rhythm tightens effectively at the alarms/white-screen turn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; lines often do double duty (world and psyche at once). Figurative choices are sharp and consistent; a few high-register metaphors push the edge without tipping into purple. No notable loops or template cadence. The final cadence lands cleanly without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of SF mechanism (harmonic perturbation) with poetic metaphysics (hunting unused time) feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The geode and “pre-choice thread” reconfigure familiar time-intervention tropes. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reorientation toward memory-as-agency reads singular.</comment>
