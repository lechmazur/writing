<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—defiant memorialization through naming—reads consistent, embodied, and specific; the broken fingers and steady hands under threat texture him beyond trope. His gentleness and “steel” create a credible contradiction enacted in his refusal to stop. The commander’s wavering and kneeling sharpen status dynamics credibly within the scene. Minor note: his interior remains largely unwavering, offering endurance rather than a richer internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative build: the ritual intensifies until the commander arrives, escalates to lethal threat, and resolves via a resonant reconfiguration as the sword drops. Closure lands on the page with cost (risk of death, surrender of violence), and the final image reweights the plaza’s meaning. Orientation is clean from the first lines. Slight softness in explicit costs (no immediate loss beyond risk) keeps it shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plaza, shattered sky, and tesserae are tactile and constantly in play; the environment is both tool and reliquary, charging the final gold‑filled cracks. Sensory specificity (charred cedar, dust, ghost of rain) and the minaret’s silence shape tone and action. The mosaic constrains the method of resistance. A hairline from 9+ only because the constraints are poetic more than logistical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes—will the act of remembrance survive power’s threat—are legible early and tighten with the commander’s entrance and drawn sword. Elias’s choice to continue naming under imminent violence earns the reversal. The cost is primarily moral/emotional rather than materially paid on the page, which slightly blunts the peak pressure. Still, the turn is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mercy reframed as carrying rather than burning resonates through the ritual and the final shared kneeling, with the mosaic’s kintsugi glow embodying repricing. Subtext in the commander’s “my son’s name” works. A line like “Mercy should cradle, not consume” reads a touch thesis-forward, slightly edging toward overt statement. Overall, the images do most of the thematic work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled lyric third with a distinct perceptual signature; diction is precise, rhythmic, and character‑bound. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, with subtext and status shifts (“They’ll kill you for this”; “Go ahead”). The voice sustains under pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. A few aphoristic sentences flirt with pronouncement but remain anchored in scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with vivid images; lines often do double duty (world + emotion). Figurative language is rich but stays coherent to the mosaic/fire/mercy palette; cadence varies well. Minimal scaffold or repetition; no mechanical loops. Occasional elevated aphorisms risk purple but don’t obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ritualized renaming of tesserae as resistance and the kintsugi‑like closure feel fresh and organically integrated. The gentle radical vs. tyrannical “mercy” frame avoids cliché through specific objects and actions. The commander’s conversion is swift but grounded in the charged ritual. Not radical innovation, but a distinct, memorable synthesis.</comment>
