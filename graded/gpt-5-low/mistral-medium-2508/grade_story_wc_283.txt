<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—prevent the hourglass’s shattering—drives concrete choices, and his craft habits (ledger, needle, thread) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is grounded in tactile beats (ribs ache, breath hitch), not labels. The contradiction between reverence for time and willingness to risk “We do” registers, if quietly. Internal conflict is more muted than searing, but the final renunciation/acceptance is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens: jar’s clue → perilous retrieval → threading the ninth button → hourglass reverses. Closure lands on the page with a charged reconfiguration; the conceptual cost (“The hourglass doesn’t break. We do.”) is legible and reweights prior stakes. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; scope is tight to one mission. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, the cliffside, the iron‑tasting well, and the tools are vividly filtered through craft‑focused perception. Environment and object constrain action (needle and thread into a slick well) and charge the final image (hourglass singing from below). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across senses. Rules feel consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightens as Elias moves from echo to well to threading. The key turn (the face in the amber; the ledger pattern “snapping into place”) deepens pressure and reframes the prophecy as choice. However, external resistance is light, and the retrieval reads relatively unopposed, keeping the on‑page price modest. The resolution stems from his agency and carries conceptual consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Threads/buttons/time interlock to propose a theme about agency over fate; the final reversal makes “choice” the core answer. Subtext emerges through images (offerings to the drowned god; leaving the button on the rim). The thematic line “shared wisdom wasn’t about knowing the future” veers into explicit statement, dulling resonance. Still, the closing act functions as a non‑literal answer with aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinctive, tactile lexicon (craft verbs; material nouns) and controlled lyricism. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance leakage. Patterned phrases (prophecy fragments, echo) are taught early and pay off cleanly. Voice confidence matches what Elias plausibly infers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (amber as fossilized time). Minimal scaffold and no significant loops; syntax varies to sustain momentum. Figurative language is rich yet coherent; only rare moments brush explicitness. Mechanics are clean and sequence is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: jars of preserved whispers, buttons as pivot points of fate, and an hourglass turner who reweaves prophecy through craft. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (ledger code, ninth button) rather than gimmicked. The worldbuilding feels singular and lived‑in. The conceptual price at the end adds bite without overexplaining.</comment>
