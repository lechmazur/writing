<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation is specific and credible—“to honor what the world forgot”—and his method (twine, bone, wind-readable patterns) reveals character. Interiority is embodied through tactile acts (knotting, weaving, waiting) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction is faint; he rarely wavers, so the emotional tax lands more as quiet endurance than contested choice. The earned stasis at the end feels right but light on visible trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern intensifies from construction to gust to unraveling, culminating in an earned stasis/charged poise. Closure lands on the page with cost as he accepts transience and begins again (“The migration was over, but the remembering wasn’t”). Orientation is clear from the opening. Persistent constraint (wind/time) shapes tactics and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto’s mossed acoustics, altitude above clouds, and valley contrast are vivid and POV-filtered. Environment meaningfully pressures action (gust sways the spiral; weather/time dissolves it) and charges the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and lived-in (“smelled of damp earth and crushed petals”). The setting’s rules stay consistent and integral to the stake.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring the forgotten) tightens via the gust and the visible unraveling—an on‑page intensification that reweights his stance. Agency is endurance and renunciation; he chooses fragility over permanence with a cost in loss and futility. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A sharper foreclosed alternative would amplify the price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transience, remembrance, and the ethics of attention arise through concrete particulars (wing, twine, spiral, wind). The interrupted cadence motif gains weight in the spiral’s widening turns and final unspooling. One declarative line (“Permanence was a lie…”) edges toward thesis but is earned by scene. The last acts—watching it vanish, then gathering new materials—offer a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, singular lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“esoteric realist,” “blushing stillness”). Rhythm modulates with pressure (from tactile making to hush to unraveling) without head‑hopping. Diction remains coherent and character‑plausible. No gratuitous elision; images carry subtext cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut: images do multiple jobs and momentum holds. Figurative language is fresh and consistent; minimal redundancy. A few near‑summary lines risk over‑statement but do not blunt the closure image. Syntax and paragraphing vary to match breath and pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a sky‑grotto artisan sending wind‑signals to honor lost monarchs is striking and specific. The “interrupted cadence” spiral translating absence into form feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric quietude, minimal plot) pay off with integrity and a charged final image. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>
