<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s motivation (heeding scars to unearth the eclipsed covenant) is concrete and consistent, and her embodied cost (weeping scar, prior three‑day rooting) grounds her drive. The “you’re early” beat creates a credible inner tension between urgency and patience that she resolves by running the bridge anyway. Micro‑choices (pressing clipping to sap‑weeping scar; veering through the maze guided by pain) reveal values under pressure. Slight softness: the renunciation or foreclosed alternative isn’t fully priced beyond pain and risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: image density builds (glade → maze → dais → bridge → future‑self) and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration—“The covenant was never broken” reframes the quest with cost encoded in scars. Orientation is clear by ~120 words and the single‑scene flow with one transition (maze heart) holds. Closure lands on‑page via the silver leaf and keeper naming; the cost is felt but not crushing. Minor quibble: the “you’re early” complication doesn’t materially alter tactics beyond a sprint, softening the because/therefore chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the hedge‑maze physically constrains routes and the scars interface with it; the glade “screams/exhales,” charging turns. Sensory economy (damp earth, crushed violets, cobalt dusk) supports tone without tourist cataloguing. Recurring objects (yew clipping, willow, root‑bridge) directly affect choice and the final image (silver leaf). World rules (maze shifts unobserved; scars as loom‑threads) stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uneclipsing the covenant—tightens as Liora enters, navigates by pain, and confronts a future self who complicates timing. The bridge sprint is the clear pressure point where she commits despite warning; the result is a knowledge/depth gain rather than a fight. Cost exists (pain, risk, history of being rooted) but feels more mythic than immediate sacrifice at the peak. Still, escalation coheres and ends in a reweighted option set (keeperhood accepted).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of listening to embodied history and fate as loom (not prison) arise from particulars (scar guidance, maze mechanics) and reprice at the end. The final silver leaf and “keeper” naming offer a non‑literal answer: the covenant needed accurate heeding, not brute force. A slight on‑the‑nose note (“The covenant was never broken… waiting…”) trims subtlety but doesn’t collapse resonance. Ambiguity remains productive around time and readiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is controlled and sensorially biased toward touch and plant‑imagery, matching a “root‑bound” visionary. The lyrical register is consistent; dialogue is sparse yet effective with subtext (“You’re early”). Rhythm modulates well between breathy description and brisk action on the bridge. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is lush with largely coherent metaphors (loom, nautilus, eclipsed covenant) and good sentence variety; momentum rarely stalls. Minor purple drift and small repetitions (“the glade held its breath” motif twice) lightly over‑sweeten peak beats. Information density remains high; few expendable sentences. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scars as navigational loom, an eclipsed covenant, and a mutable hedge are fused into a distinct mythic system with fresh images (shadows sewn to soil). The future‑self “early” complication adds a non‑obvious torque. Some elements are familiar (prophetic maze quest) but transformed through botanical tactility and body‑bound fate. The final silver leaf recharges the opening in a satisfying, specific way.</comment>
