<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and method are clear and character‑particular—she tunes by unlearning—and her actions (pressing the fragment, surrendering to the note, jumping) align. However, internal contradiction is light; she faces little resistance once the note arrives, so change costs feel more conceptual than hard‑won. The brief “I thought I’d failed” moment is effective but quickly resolved. A deeper struggle before the leap would raise the charge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image and cadence intensify through dish activation → shatter → internalization → city‑wide resonance → leap. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a charged act (jump) and visible cost (dish destroyed; surrender of tool/assumption). Orientation is crisp by line ~1 (who/where/when), and the ending reconfigures the premise without explanatory backfill. The gorge and gravity reversal render the before/after legible and costly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The radio‑tower city over a gorge is vivid and integrated: spiral stairs, cracked dish, wind‑snapped wires, and the gorge all constrain action and shape the climax. The environment evolves with events (city begins to sing; the gorge receives and returns her leap as light). The star fragment as micro‑setting/object charges the final image. Sensory selection stays purposeful and character‑biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent: attune to a cosmic frequency that is itself the message; the pressure tightens when the dish shatters, forcing a renunciation of instrumentation. The leap is an earned escalation that risks bodily cost and affirms the surrender method. Still, much tension is lyrical rather than oppositional; resistance is atmospheric more than adversarial. The meaningful tightening is there, just not agonized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of surrendering assumptions and finding beginnings inside endings arises organically through the dish’s failure and the note’s internalization. The “method was clear: stop searching; become the silence” edges toward on‑the‑nose statement, slightly flattening subtext. Nevertheless, the final image (laughter swallowed and returned as light) reweights earlier motifs without a moral. Resonance lingers with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A consistent, controlled lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature—“serenely electric,” “shard of hush,” “lightning made gentle”—carries through under pressure. Psychic distance modulates smoothly from tactile action to cosmic insight without head‑hopping. Patterned diction is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue needed; the narrative stance remains confident and plausible for this POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished, with varied rhythm and strong verb choices; images often do double duty. A few phrases recur (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”), mostly as purposeful leitmotif, though the density of metaphor occasionally runs hot. No scaffold loops or template cadences impede momentum. Line clarity supports the closure image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive fusion of decayed radio urbanism, a Hollywood prop star as cosmic key, and a physics‑tilted leap; the piece commits to its strange logic and follows it to a non‑obvious, inevitable end. Risks—a lyric method, conceptual closure, and a reality tweak—heighten stakes without confusion. Specifics (set forged in a Big Bang scene; city singing under lunar pull) feel singular. The turn from tool to state (“the shard of hush” inside her) is fresh and earned.</comment>
