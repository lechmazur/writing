<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s avoidance of song versus comfort with tinkering gives her a credible internal contradiction, and her choice to sing under pressure reads earned. Embodied beats—trembling fingers, palm to soil, throat burning—ground emotion. The change to “keeper of songs” is motivated, though the personal cost skews gentle and neat. A secondary pressure from the absent village is felt but off‑stage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: arbor failing because songs are forgotten; therefore Mira chooses song over tools; therefore the arbor revives and her role reconfigures. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and a modest cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene cohesion holds. Escalation is smooth rather than contested, but coherent under a causal/lyric hybrid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arbor at dawn, copper automaton, and harvest moon are vividly rendered and filtered through a tinkerer’s sensibility. The environment constrains the remedy (song bound to place/time) and charges the final image (vines forming an arch, listening). Sensory selection is purposeful—earth pulse, stretching silk—without museum‑tour excess. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the arbor/blessing) is explicit, and pressure tightens as the song begins to work and her throat burns. The key turn is her renunciation of tools in favor of truth/song; the final verse (“the moon’s cradle”) provides a credible cadence shift. Costs are present but light; no real setback tests commitment beyond initial hesitation. Tension is more lyric than combative, yet it holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of cultural memory and truth versus comforting artifice emerges organically from action. Recurring images (gears, vines, moon) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing; “some things are too precious to lose” toes the line but stays character‑rooted. The ending’s reconfiguration—tinkerer to song‑keeper—offers a resonant answer. Complexity is modest but honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical lexicon meeting vegetal imagery). Rhythm modulates well from hush to flare without head‑hopping or register slips. Minimal dialogue lands naturally and functions as action. Voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry atmosphere and action with efficient specificity; several metaphors do double duty (melody as key/time as lock). Occasional lushness risks redundancy but rarely stalls momentum. No significant scaffold or cadence templating; syntax varies and breathes with the scene. The closure image is clean and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Core premise (song restores a withering place) is familiar, but the clockwork‑meets‑ritual synthesis and charged final arch give it freshness. The hummingbird automaton adds distinctive texture without feeling gimmicky. Turns feel earned from set specifics rather than late rules. Innovation is tasteful rather than radical.</comment>
