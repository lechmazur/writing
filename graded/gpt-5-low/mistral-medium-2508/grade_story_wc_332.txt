<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (retrieve and “vitalize” the escaped dream) drives specific micro‑choices—aperture tweaks, whispered title, and finally the renunciatory “Stay.” Interiority is embodied through tactile objects (ink‑stained fingers, pulsing paper) and credible hesitation when the dream pleads. The contradictory impulses—custody vs. wonder—coexist on the page and culminate in a costly refusal. The choice forecloses freedom for the dream and innocence for the librarian, earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural: the sunrise clock, failed attempt, then partial success tighten pressure toward a final stance crystallization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she binds the dream and accepts the cost (the footstep smear, the library’s hum of swallowed dreams). Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp by the opening lines; props and rules recur coherently. The causal thread (attempts → apparition → plea → refusal) is clean and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally constraining: dawn light, black sand, ozone, tide, and the archipelago’s mist determine tactics and possibility. The palette and camera operate as micro‑settings/tools that shape action and the ending image (dew as “light made liquid”). World rules (dreams hunger, sunrise stitching) are learned through use, not dump. The environment directly charges the final image and decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—contain or release a fugitive dream—tightens under a real clock (sun climbing, edges fraying). The failed first attempt escalates; the apparition’s plea forces an ethical trade‑off rather than a mere technical fix. The decisive “Stay” carries visible loss (the dream’s untethered life) and reweights the world’s order. Tension operates at beat and sentence levels without gimmickry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of art-as-custody vs. art-as-lived experience emerge from particulars (refracted light, pulsing photograph, library’s “hummed” appetite). The final images (footstep smear; dew-filled palette) resonate and reprice the premise. Slight dock for overt statement—“Because some stories weren’t meant to be read. They were meant to be lived”—which edges toward thesis articulation. Subtext otherwise holds in image and refusal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“light made liquid,” “whispering archipelago”) remains stable under stress. Dialogue is spare and charged, functioning as action rather than exposition. Psychic distance modulates cleanly across attempt, plea, and renunciation. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language tied to action; lines often do double duty (world rule + mood + tactic). Minor risk of purple, but images stay coherent and grounded in the scene’s physics. Rhythm varies and the prose propels through beats without scaffold or loops. Final cadence is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—librarian who “vitalizes” dreams via sunrise photography and a prism-charged palette—is fresh and integrally used. The core turn (choosing containment with cost) is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight given the library’s appetite and the dream’s hunger. Risks in diction and premise pay off without obscuring clarity. Memorable images distinguish it from common magical‑library tropes.</comment>
