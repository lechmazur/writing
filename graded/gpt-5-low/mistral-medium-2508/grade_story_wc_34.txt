<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The balladeer’s interior motive—translating the unspoken—drives credible micro‑choices and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses a path. His hesitation when the ghost “wanted out…into him” shows a live internal contradiction sharpened by embodied detail (heat, raw throat). The final refusal carries loss without overstatement. Slightly soft cost prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: encoding summons response; revelation of the ghost’s true need narrows options; the decisive act (slamming the bolt plate) produces an on‑page change with cost. Orientation is immediate and stable, and the drive lens holds to closure. The cost is legible in the image of his raw silence and the world’s wiped graffiti. Tight and sufficient for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the courtyard, lanterns, mist, and altitude aren’t postcard; they house the entity and participate in the climax (mist inverts, lanterns flare). The bolt plate functions as micro‑setting/object that constrains the final act. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑charged. Consistency of world logic is maintained through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—whether to host or expel the code‑ghost—tightens coherently to a single, high‑leverage choice. The ghost’s “into him” revelation is a meaningful deepening that forces trade‑off. The visible price is quiet but real; tension threads at sentence and beat scale. A touch more consequence on the back end would raise the pressure band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, silence as language, and ethical containment are earned through particulars (grandmother’s press; graffiti as song). The child at the end reframes the work as communal and ongoing without moralizing. Subtext operates through image rather than thesis. Slight neatness in the “work continues” beat keeps it just under the highest band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person close sustains a coherent perceptual signature; rhythm modulates with pressure. Syntax and diction suit the character’s sensibility, with purposeful italics/elision. No head‑hopping or stance drift; uncertainty is voice‑motivated and legible. A few lush turns flirt with excess but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and musical; images generally do double duty, advancing plot and mood. Minimal scaffolding and no substantive loops; cadence varies to match beats. A dense metaphor field risks purple, but coherence and clarity hold, including at the climax. Strong propulsion without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” mediated through graffiti and a flower press bolt plate feels freshly synthesized and inevitable in hindsight. The inheritance motif binds tech and tactile craft in a non‑obvious way. The final image (child and chalk) reweights the premise elegantly. Bold yet coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
