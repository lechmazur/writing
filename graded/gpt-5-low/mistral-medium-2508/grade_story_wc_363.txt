<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Desire and cost are clear and consistent: she’ll sacrifice herself to send a message. Interiority is economical but specific (pressing amber to her ear; the refusal to weep), though true contradictory impulses are faint. Micro‑choices (cracking the bead, weaving through the night, hanging the tapestry to the wind) align with motive and reveal steel. The renunciation—sender must stay—lands credibly with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: find bead → transform silence into thread → dissolve tapestry → receive reply seed. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost (“the sender must stay” followed by decades passing). Mosaic shards (orchard, traveler, city) are legible and cohere under the single stake. No orientation debt; the closing image reconfigures options and locks the price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard and bamboo forest are tactile, constraining choices (amber found there; tapestry hung from the apple branch; wind as carrier). Environmental mechanics directly shape the outcome and charge the ending. The city shard contrasts atmospherically without breaking rules. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with the object-as-setting (amber, thread) functioning dynamically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is tight: carry a message at the cost of self. Escalation arrives via the amber’s discovery and the commitment to weave the silence, culminating in irreversible release of the tapestry. The explicit price (“sender must stay”) forecloses options and reverberates into the decades‑later beat. Tension is more tonal than contested, but the pressure coheres and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sacrifice, craft as communion, and distance bridged by attention accrue through concrete acts rather than stated morals. The “raveling silence” motif evolves from tool to shared breath, reweighting the premise at the end. The quiet reciprocity—his silver‑dusted hand and decision to weave—offers resonant, unsentimental reply. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third person with a distinct perceptual signature; image‑driven cadence modulates under pressure. The late POV shift to the lover is clean and discrete, maintaining coherence under one thematic lens. Diction stays consistent and voice‑true without explanatory excess. Elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is luminous yet disciplined; metaphors (“dissolve into distance,” “raveling silence”) are coherent and work double duty. Minimal scaffolding and strong verbs sustain momentum. Density is high but not purple; no loops or muddled images at peak beats. Rhythm varies naturally to match turns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Weaving as interdimensional message is familiar, but the “silence as thread” and orchard/amber mechanics feel fresh and specific. The dissolution into distance and the silver dust reply are memorable, earned turns. Risks in lyric compression pay off without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads singular and quietly bold.</comment>
