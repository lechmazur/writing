<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Two-character crucible is clear: Liora’s protective, reformist impulse meets the intruder’s mission and doubt. Interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, fogged helmet, knees hitting mosaic) and contradiction is active (duty to poison vs. surrender to truth). The turn—drop the ampoule, press the seam, remove the helmet—feels motivated by Liora’s “incisively kind” pressure. Pace of conversion is swift but justified by telepathy working “where the cracks already were.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural holds: revelations compound and culminate in a concrete act (“thread the needle”) that reconfigures options. Closure lands on-page with cost (helmet removed; old world’s “mercy” relinquished; ampoule repurposed). Causal links read clean: Liora’s pressure → dropped ampoule → seam press → dome splits → transformation. Orientation is firm early; no lens slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned garden is tactile and operative: arches, mosaic, dome seam, pressure suit, and abyssal light constrain choice and shape climax. The environment charges the final image (kelp-wrapped light, child’s song, statues sloughing stone, ampoule as pigment). Detail selection stays POV-filtered and functional. World rules stay consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (kill/save; ossified certainty vs. living nuance) tightens through one meaningful deepening—revelations that force a renunciation choice. Agency is clear in the intruder’s press and self-endangerment; price is legible. Micro-reversals (belief → doubt → action) escalate cleanly without coincidence resolving the core pressure. Stakes remain embodied rather than abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of womb vs. weapon, god-making, and welcoming nuance emerge organically via objects and actions (ampoule’s repurposing, seam via “thread the needle”). Subtext of institutional lies and mercy’s cost enriches the turn. A few explicit lines (“gods are just stories we drown in fear”) edge toward stated thesis but do not flatten the resonance. The final mural image delivers a conceptual repricing that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close-third through Liora with telepathic projections; rhythm modulates with pressure. Dialogue-as-pressure works (silent signing vs. mind-voice), carrying subtext rather than exposition. Diction is lyrical but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density lines pull double duty—image and action—without scaffold or synonym loops. Metaphors are coherent to the sea/stone/organics palette; patterned phrases (“planted,” “womb”) pay off. Slight purpleness at peaks remains legible and purposeful. Final cadence is sharp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Telepathic living statue guiding a revisionist underwater genesis with poison-into-pigment is a fresh synthesis. The “planted city/child heart” reframing and structural-weakness motif (mind and dome) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final threshold-rising image is memorable and particular.</comment>
