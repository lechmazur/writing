<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motives—refusing easy comfort to deliver precise, costly truth—are consistent and dramatized through tactile choices (guiding the widow’s hands; producing the locket; submitting herself to the same scrutiny). Interiority is particular and embodied, with contradictions (she “let go” yet clings to “parts worth saving”). The widow applies live pressure and shifts under it. The earned endurance at the end forecloses false solace while carrying felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single scene, single POV, clear anchors, and a clean accumulative/textural drive: ritual → revelation (child, not husband) → personal counter-ritual → charged poise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the widow’s re-seeing and Lena’s chosen partial holding. The shrine, globe, and locket are set up and paid off; no causality breaks. The before/after is legible without mechanical wrap-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and candles are not décor; they shape the ritual and charge the last image (the glacier “almost like laughter,” the dead going quiet). The snow globe functions as a micro-setting/tool that channels action and meaning. Sensory detail is selective, salt/diesel/ice working with voice and stakes. World rules feel consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around truth versus comfort, tightening when the vision reveals the child and deepening as Lena risks exposing her own grief. The price—accepting a reframed haunting and Lena’s refusal to “let go” cleanly—is visible. The escalation is lyrical rather than combative, but it sharpens and narrows options credibly. Slight softness in overt external stakes keeps it just below top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—wreckage, salvage, windows/cracks—and reweights at the end without didacticism. Subtext in the widow’s “That’s not him” and Lena’s “I kept the parts worth saving” lands emotionally. The “cracks/light” image is powerful but brushes a familiar cultural echo, trimming uniqueness. Still, resonance is sustained and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, coherent lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Dialogue carries subtext and advances the beat without exposition. POV control is tight and modest—no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images do double duty (the globe as both tool and window). No notable loops or scaffolding; rhythm supports momentum. A minor originality drag from the “cracks/light” formulation and a density of figurative language that nearly tips into purple in places keep it shy of the highest tier. Otherwise, the prose is clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The glacier-shrine medium, melted snow globe, and dream “cameo” method feel fresh, synthesizing grief work with tactile salvage. Turns are earned and non-obvious. The slight echo of a famous aphorism softens novelty. Overall, it’s a distinctive and coherent vision with measured risk.</comment>
