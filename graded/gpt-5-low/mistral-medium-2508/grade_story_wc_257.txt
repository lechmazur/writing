<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lena’s motives are clear and embodied—grief drives tactile choices (tattooing, folding, placing cranes). Contradictory impulses (to hold and to release) are dramatized in the “curtains of intention” motif and her shift from lilies to cranes. The pain of inking her skin and the vulnerability of scattering coordinates register as credible costs. The arc edges toward tidy insight but remains earned through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and choices accrete from the found crane to the box to self‑tattoo to communal dispersal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she opens the curtains and teaches others, with the cost of exposure etched into her skin and practice. Orientation is clean early (observatory, bench, mentor), and set‑ups (stencil, coordinates, flower) pay off. The montage span across days remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory is tactile and determinative: cracked dome, telescope, steps, and curtains direct where cranes and light are placed and frame the final opening gesture. Tools and objects (bench, vellum, box) integrate with action rather than decorate. Atmosphere (clockwork hum, moonlight) supports the theme without leaning on cliché. The final image recharges setting objects into meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (whether grief isolates or becomes shared light) are focused and tighten through concrete choices: self‑tattooing, shifting craft, and releasing cranes. The decisive deepening occurs when she moves from memorial jewelry to luminous cranes and then publicly leaves them, foreclosing private hoarding. A returned black feather adds pressure via response from the world. Costs are emotional and bodily, legible on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of concealment/revelation and grief as a form that can be shaped accrue through recurring objects (stencil, curtains, cranes, artificial flower) and culminate in a communal turn. Subtext operates in acts of making and leaving rather than talk. A few explicit statements (“Grief… was not a thing to be buried in metal”) flirt with didacticism but don’t overwhelm the earned resonance of the last images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held to Lena’s perceptions; diction and rhythm suit her craft‑mind without register slips. Quoted mentor lines function as charged artifacts rather than dialogue scenes, keeping POV modest. Cadence modulates from taut grief to quietly expansive resolve, matching the accumulative design. No head‑hopping; inference stays within Lena’s ken.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and purposeful: images do double duty (vines/veins, cranes/light) and sentences carry momentum. Minimal scaffold and little redundancy; rhythm varies with scene needs. A few aphoristic lines edge toward over‑statement but are buffered by concrete action. Final images are crisp and legible without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>While grief‑through‑craft is familiar, the specific synthesis—observatory as atelier, vellum tattoo map, “genuinely artificial” copper bloom, crane‑coordinates—feels fresh and coherent. Turns grow from prior particulars rather than clever gimmicks. The communal feedback loop (gilded feather) adds an elegant, non‑obvious beat. Risk is measured but confident, landing a memorable final cadence.</comment>
