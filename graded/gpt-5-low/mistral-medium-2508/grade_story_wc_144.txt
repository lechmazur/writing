<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s competence and humility are vivid, and his sensory substitutions create embodied motive. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he identifies, decides, and executes with little friction. The “savant before the accident” line adds texture without complicating present stakes. The quiet renunciation (anonymity, returning to work) reads, but the cost is soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causality is clean: detection via water and Lumen → diagnosis → tailored patch → ship’s course corrected → return to shop. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he restores order and reaffirms his role. Cost is implied (effacement, ongoing vigilance) rather than dramatized. Orientation is strong early; scope adheres to a single continuous window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist, water barrel, depot acoustics, and light all shape tactics and charge the final image (“wake split the mist”). The environment constrains vision, necessitating refraction and Lumen’s mediation. Details remain POV-filtered through touch, sound, and light behavior. The depot and weather evolve with action: mist parts, corridor clears.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing a flawed maiden voyage—is clear and tightens as the anchor locks and the crowd swells. Escalation is modest because resistance is low and the patch works on the first attempt. The time pressure is present but gentle. The earned resolution stems from Elias’s agency, though cost clarity remains muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Repair as an ethic—patience, listening, aligning—emerges organically via recurrent images (light, feedback, seam, film). The final return to the watch reframes the grand fix into a life stance without sermonizing. “Dreams needed patience” risks thesis, but it’s dramatized by the specific act. The closing cadence leaves a quietly charged afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, tactile, and sensorially specific to a blind artisan; the perceptual signature is distinct. Diction stays coherent and modulates with pressure without slipping registers. Dialogue is minimal yet effective (the captain’s one line). No head‑hopping; focalization remains tight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and efficient, with images doing double duty (refraction as tool and theme). Lyric density is high but seldom purple; metaphors are coherent to the world’s physics. Minimal scaffold or repetition; sentences vary and propel. A few high-level statements (“The world was full of things that needed mending”) are earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind artisan, hummingbird drone, water‑lens diagnostics in a misted rail‑air dock—feels fresh and inevitable. The iridescent film solution is specific rather than generic “fixing.” Risks are taken in tone (magnetic calm) and worldbuilding without overexplaining. The closure image reconfigures scale from epic voyage to intimate repair convincingly.</comment>
