<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motive—transmuting bureaucratic erasure into agency—drives palpable micro-choices (pulling archives, gripping the shard, consenting to sync). Her contradictory impulses (control via counting vs surrender to the chorus) are present on the page and resolved through Earned Stasis. Embodied cues (fogged shard, pulse tracking) keep emotions concrete. The change forecloses the path of solitary vigilance with a felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: the radio clears, the ink instructs, the archives wake, and the heartbeat reweights meaning. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis—she chooses to count with, not down—while the death certificate remains as persistent constraint. Orientation is crisp from the opening. Cost is emotional but legible in the renunciation of fear-as-control.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The opal observatory, auroras, frost window, and humming servers create a lived microclimate that shapes options and the final image. The porcelain shard functions as object-as-setting, charging choice and the ending (“warm in her palm, its edge no longer sharp”). Environmental details are selective and POV-filtered, never touristy. Tone and world rules remain consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure tightens when silence breaks at 11:47, the ink demands “Defragment,” and she activates the archive, culminating in the sync choice. Stakes remain internal but coherent: the cost of relinquishing the countdown worldview. The escalation is a single, clean deepening consistent with the lens. Slight softness in concrete external consequence keeps it just shy of top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of identity, error, and salvaging wisdom from failure emerge through particulars (static as chorus, archive ghosts, heartbeat as count). Subtext is mostly image-driven, with the shard’s repricing and the observatory as “digital ghost.” The explicit line “Not failure. Possibility.” edges toward thesis-stating, dulling some resonance. Still, the final image reframes prior material without simplistic moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is precise, lyrical, and coherent to Lena’s perception; rhythm modulates with pressure without losing clarity. Patterned elision (ink-as-voice) is taught and legible. No head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue fragments serve as action and subtext rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight and propulsive, with images doing multiple jobs (ink as waveform/voice; shard as rosary). Figurative density stays coherent; minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops. A few high-register flourishes approach purple but remain controlled and purposeful. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—observatory-born ghost speaking via ink, heartbeat counting reframed, porcelain as secular sacramental—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Genre elements are transformed through specific tactile choices. Risk-taking in concept and method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The turn from “static as absence” to “static as chorus” is an elegant, non-obvious reweighting.</comment>
