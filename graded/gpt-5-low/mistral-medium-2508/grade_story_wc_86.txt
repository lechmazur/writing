<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are clear and layered—principled neutrality, personal inheritance, and a willingness to pay a private price. His micro‑choices (producing the drawer pull, reframing terms, reading Kaelis’s hesitation) reveal a specific moral calculus. Kaelis’s ruthlessness softens credibly through the nephew and childhood memory. The visible cost—surrendering his father’s object—earns the quiet endurance at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single scene with tight causal flow: refusal → adjusted terms → symbolic lever → handshake → retrieval of the boy. Closure lands on the page with cost (he parts with the heirloom; the war persists) and a reweighted final image. Orientation is crisp by the first paragraph. The Decisive Change (boy freed) and Earned Stasis (war limps on) cohere cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The parapet, chasm, mist, and storm are vivid and purpose‑driven, echoing the precarious truce. The object‑as‑setting (drawer pull) charges multiple beats and the ending. Weather and stone add tactile risk and tonal pressure, though they rarely constrain tactics. Specificity remains POV‑filtered rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (free the boy) and tightens when “They won’t release the boy” forces a new tactic. Elias escalates via a costly trade that leverages memory and intelligence, not force. The price (sentimental loss; war’s continuation) is legible. Escalation is elegant rather than dramatic, but sufficient for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of neutrality, pride’s cost, and the interval between apology and forgiveness emerge through action and image. The drawer pull’s transformation from talisman to traded lever embodies the moral argument. A few lines verge on thesis (“Neutral territory… letting it breathe”), but the final exchange with the boy restores earned resonance. Subtext in Kaelis’s hesitation and the sibling memory is effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elias with consistent texture. Dialogue carries subtext and advances pressure without exposition bloat. Elevated diction matches the solemn register and holds under stress. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lean yet musical lines; images do more than one job (moon, chasm, mist). Occasional intensifiers (“as it always did”) flirt with overstatement but don’t stall momentum. No loops or scaffold, and the cadence supports the scene’s hush and strain. The final image clicks without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The negotiator trading a familial heirloom as a psychological lever in a misted war‑border is a fresh inflection on familiar terrain. The “between apology and forgiveness” and “seeds” frames deepen rather than decorate. The boy’s release alongside the war’s limp endurance resists tidy closure. Risks are measured and coherent.</comment>
