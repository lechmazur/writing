<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained: she must record the unspoken before the second letter erases them, then pivots to write the truer letter. Interiority is embodied (veil snagging, watch burning) and particular, though the final realization veers slightly tidy. Micro-choices under pressure—climbing, opening the watch, tearing a page, abandoning the watch—reveal values with some cost. The turn from collector to speaker reads earned by prior beats but edges close to aphorism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (situational pressure + causal tool) is consistent: the watch’s reverse ticks create glimpses; the second letter’s posting collapses options. Closure lands: she renounces dependence on the watch/library and commits to saying the unsaid—visible costs include the library’s loss and leaving the watch. The two-shard structure (library → desk) is clean, with the chime as hinge. Minor softness: the “document them before dissolution” goal yields to a new aim, but the repricing makes it cohere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library and mist are vivid and functional, constraining time and choices (collapsing shelves, thickening mist) and charging the final image. The watch functions as a micro-setting tool whose properties drive action and the close. Sensory selection is purposeful (amber glow, parchment over bone, burnt sugar). World rules are shown through use, not explained, with no spatial confusions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are focused and escalate: record the unsaid before the second letter posts; the chime tightens pressure; the library’s collapse forecloses further options. Agency drives turns—she opens the watch, chooses to tear a single page, and chooses speech over continued extraction. The cost is legible and alters tactics (loss of access, renouncing the watch). Tension is more cumulative than combative, but it narrows options effectively at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: silence versus speech, tools that steal versus agency that declares. The watch-to-letter shift reweights the premise, and the final images (door/heart, path appearing) resonate. A slight explicitness (“It was about learning to say it.”) trims the subtlety, tilting toward moralizing. Still, the recurrent objects meaningfully refract the theme without checklist symbolism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“breath curling like ink,” “parchment over bone”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; syntax varies and remains legible. Quoted lines are used sparingly and with subtext, not expository dump. No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions (mechanics of the watch) are purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and efficient; images carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, stakes, theme) with minimal redundancy. Figurative density is high but coherent; few mixed metaphors, and momentum is maintained through action-linked description. Lines like “a thief, stealing moments from the future to pay for glimpses of the past” earn their place. No scaffolding loops or cadence templates slow the closing beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Library of Unspoken Words paired with a reverse-ticking watch and “propagation delays” feels fresh and integrated. The revaluation from retrieval to articulation is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric compression, conceptual tool) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. A trace of familiar “library of lost things” DNA remains, but execution lifts it well above template.</comment>
