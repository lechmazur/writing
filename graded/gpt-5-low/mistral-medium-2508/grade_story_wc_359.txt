<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s motive—to reject the elders’ control and “certify wonder as essential”—is clear and enacted through concrete micro-choices (theft, unfurling, each strike). Interiority is embodied via synesthetic perception, though her certainty leaves little contradiction under pressure. A few thesis-like lines (“silence was just another kind of cage”) flatten nuance at peak moments. The visible cost is mostly social and implied, not deeply felt in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chime deepens the pattern and reweights stakes, culminating in the aurora “staying.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (defiance, destruction of the amber sheet, a village reconfigured). Orientation is precise from the start; cause-effect within the lyric frame is consistent. The on-page cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ice cavern and aurora are richly rendered and integrated into action—the ice “groans,” acoustics rebound, light becomes architecture. Environment and objects (chimes, amber sheet) charge the final image and shape tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered through synesthesia. A slight preference for assertion over tactile consequence near the end keeps it below 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tame vs. free wonder) is clear and tightened via the escalating chime sequence; the crumbling amber sheet forecloses a path. Pressure is coherent and grows in cadence rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. Costs are present but primarily implied (social exile, loss of the forbidden tool), not deeply dramatized. The escalation still credibly culminates in a reweighted world.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme of liberation from imposed silence surfaces through image (colors as conversation, architecture of light) and action. However, explicit thesis statements (“She had given the world back its voice.”) edge toward moralizing, slightly diluting subtext. The final invitation image reweights prior material without unnecessary plotty closure. Resonant but not elusive enough for the highest tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close remains stable; the perceptual signature (seeing sound) informs rhythm and diction. The voice modulates with pressure—cadence builds with each chime—without head-hopping or register drift. Occasional declarative theme lines are the only minor tonal flattenings. Overall, distinctive and assured.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly purposeful; images carry multiple jobs (world, motive, turn). Minor tendency toward purple assertion in a few lines, but no paraphrase loops or mixed vehicles dulling closure. Rhythm varies, and the final lines land with clarity and charge. High density without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Synesthetic bell-ringing to converse with an aurora in an ice cavern feels fresh and coherently pursued. The “amber sheet” and “sculpted hush” braid concept and world with minimal exposition. The reconfiguration (aurora that stays; ice as gateway) is both surprising and retrospectively inevitable. Small reliance on stated theme prevents a leap into the rarest band.</comment>
