<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena’s motive—recovering her brother and the erased traces—drives every action with credible urgency and professional competence. Interiority is specific (neural lace, hands shaking, the patch against her chest) but the internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers despite termination risk. The final renunciation (letting the algorithm take her) reads earned and costly. A touch more friction between duty and love would elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal spine: the number sequence → deep search → redirected logs → server coordinates → breach → restoration → termination notice → self‑sacrifice. Closure lands on the page with explicit cost (flagged for termination; she yields to deletion), functioning as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern of numbers is taught and paid off. No major causality seams or convenience patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archive environment is tactile and instrumental—firewalls flare, subdirectories matter, server farm coordinates constrain action. The patch functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image and enabling contact. Details are selective and POV‑filtered; proper nouns (ECHO_OF_FORGOTTEN_SONGS, Unit 418) are earned. The world’s rules are learned through attempts, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is lucid: retrieve erased lives at the cost of self. Escalation tightens through “Access denied,” alarms, and the termination flag; the option set narrows to a single costly path (slot the crystal and accept deletion). Agency drives the turns rather than coincidence. Stakes are felt in the body and system response, not just asserted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and institutional control are carried by concrete images (redirected logs, the lullaby, the child’s drawing rubbed away). The recurring numbers reprice meaning at the end (mother’s birthdate; the home combination), giving the final image resonance without moralizing. One explicit line (“EchoNet didn’t just store data. It consumed it.”) borders on thesis, but the scene earns it. Ambiguity lingers productively around what “being taken” means.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyric‑tech without drift, with consistent close third focalization. Diction suits a meticulous operator under pressure; metaphors are patterned to the setting (“angry stars,” “ghost‑light”). Dialogue is sparing and purposeful; the patch’s voice introduces a charged rupture without breaking stance. No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean with strong image economy and few redundancies; momentum holds through the breach and restoration. Metaphor density is high but coherent to motif; it rarely muddies sense. Sentence rhythm varies, and key lines carry multiple jobs (plot + theme). Minor intensifiers (“shuddered,” “angry stars”) flirt with purple but don’t blunt the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Digital erasure as predation is familiar, but the execution—numbers as a living breadcrumb system, the patch as speaking reliquary, the subdirectory name—feels fresh. The final reweighting (home combination/door open) is non‑obvious and earned. The synthesis of corporate archivist noir with cosmic‑lyric beats reads singular rather than templated. Risk is taken in the lyric register and pays off without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
