<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motive—refusing the lull and hunting for meaning—is clear, embodied (bare feet, opera glasses), and her micro‑choices (touching the stone, using the glasses, handing them off) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“awkward confidence,” toes curling), though internal contradiction is light. The final stance shift to catalytic purpose reads earned, but the felt cost is muted. The scout adds a faint relational crucible but doesn’t pressure her values meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single continuous scene holds cleanly: discovery of the hum → contact with the stone → glasses flare → communal ignition. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and sound build to a Charged Poise closure (re‑membering the rebellion) with a tangible external turn (ships light up). Orientation is crisp early, and set‑ups (glasses, stones) pay off. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, keeping it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The repair bay and stone circle are vivid and tactically active: warmth in stones, rust flakes, metal waking, ships coughing to life; the opera glasses function as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful across touch, sound, and light, filtered through Lena’s bias. World rules are introduced through action, not dumps, and the environment evolves with events. Strong, but not quite to 9+ without a sharper constraint on choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the lull by reignition—is signaled early and escalates via the hum intensifying and communal uptake. Lena’s agency drives key turns (press, aim, hand off, declare “It’s not over”). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, but a visible price or foreclosed path is soft; the win arrives without a tested trade‑off. The scout’s arrival confirms escalation rather than challenging it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motifs (hum, memory, listening) braid into a coherent theme of rekindling collective purpose, and the final communal breath image lands. However, the text states its thesis directly—“The rebellion wasn’t about winning. It was about this”—creating a Thematic Echo and edging into moralizing in the final paragraph. Much resonance arises from concrete particulars (glasses passed, engines coughing), but the overt articulation blunts subtext. The insight is earned yet told too plainly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑limited voice with rhythmic control and sensory signature (“war drum made of stars,” “margin of daylight”). POV boundaries hold; no head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Diction fits the character and modulates under pressure without register drift. Minimal dialogue is functional and charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is strong and purposeful, with varied cadence and high information density; repetition of “hum” is patterned and functional. Occasional flourish borders on purple but remains legible and scene‑driven. No significant loops or scaffold; momentum holds through the climax. Minor intensifiers (“of course the universe…”) are stylish rather than slack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Combining a derelict spaceport with an ancient stone circle and vintage opera glasses is a fresh synthesis that feels organic, not gimmicky. The sensory‑driven ignition (listening as rebellion) adds a non‑obvious angle. While the macro premise (reigniting a rebellion) is familiar, the object‑and‑sound pathway is distinctive. Greater cost or a more surprising turn could elevate uniqueness further.</comment>
