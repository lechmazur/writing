<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora’s drive reads clean and character‑specific (lonely chant, tactile craft, refusal to heed the curse), and her micro‑choices under pressure (lighting the rag, choosing the highest tower) align with that. Interiority is textured through sensory bias rather than labels. The one limitation: minimal contradictory impulse—she rarely wavers—so the emotional price is implied more than felt. “The world was heavier… so was she” gestures at cost but doesn’t fully dramatize it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative texture leading to a causal release: fireworks → blooms ignite → stars return. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the mosaic’s command tightens the middle. Closure lands on the page with a decisive world change; the cost is present but light. The chain is coherent, and the final reprise of “Defy the weight” reconfigures the premise without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fortress, blooms, hush, and dusk are vivid, integrated, and tactically relevant (height, wind, pulsing vines, starless sky). The mosaic and rag function as micro‑settings/tools that shape choices. Environmental response (blooms flaring) charges the final image. Rich specificity serves action rather than pausing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defy the starless curse/hopelessness) is clear and escalates: climb → mosaic → ignition → world response. The meaningful tightening is Liora choosing to light the rag despite social pressure and unknown consequences. Price and risk are gestured at (villagers’ judgment, the hush, potential curse) but consequences don’t bite back directly on the page. Escalation feels earned, if gentler than the premise could allow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonance grows from concrete motifs (light as memory, “Defy the weight,” the hush), and the final image reframes darkness as something to push against. However, several aphoristic lines edge into told thesis, especially “And that was how you defied gravity. One spark at a time,” which flattens the subtext into moral. The best meaning is already present in the image of the sky returning. Slightly less statement would lift the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature (pyrotechnic lexicon, embodied noticing). Rhythm modulates well from hush to ignition without head‑hopping or register slips. Quoted lines carry texture and subtext rather than exposition. Voice confidence matches what the POV can plausibly know.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is supple and image‑dense without collapsing into muddle; metaphors mostly cohere with firework/light physics. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support momentum from climb to ignition to release. Minor aphoristic turns and a few stacked modifiers flirt with purple but don’t obscure clarity or causality. No loops or scaffolding slow the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fireworks artisan confronting a starless sky via a mosaic’s imperative and a charged rag knot is a fresh synthesis. The world’s response through blooming light and returning stars feels both inevitable and surprising. The piece risks lyric seriousness while holding narrative clarity. A slightly sharper cost or turn would push it into rarer territory.</comment>
