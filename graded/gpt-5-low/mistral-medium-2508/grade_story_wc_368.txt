<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation—his donor heart’s strange rhythm and the wing’s iridescence pull him toward understanding. Micro‑choices (pinning the wing, accepting the map, leaving at dawn, painting in the square) reveal values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. reluctance to claim stories as his own) surface in the choice to help others find theirs. The cost is legible in his renunciation—he will “help others find” stories rather than tell his own.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: light, wing, and heart accrue into a reconfiguration where he internalizes the sun trails. Closure lands on the page with cost (the wing dissolves; he foregoes owning stories) and a charged final image (quiet tea house as invitation). The mysterious visitor is a slight coincidence but functions as pressure rather than a resolution. Orientation and through‑line remain clean within the two‑shard travel frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the floating rock tea house, mist, suspension bridge, and glass lanterns shape mood and choice. The wing and sun as micro‑settings constrain tactics (pinning/positioning for dawn; following sun arcs) and charge the ending. World rules are learned through action (ink moves under light) and stay consistent. The final stasis reweights place—he no longer needs the sun outside because he carries its trails within.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the need to understand and reconcile with the heart, tightening at the public painting where stories move “through” him and the wing is consumed. The price is visible (physical depletion, loss of the wing, acceptance of a helper’s role). Escalation is quiet but distinct—experiment → invitation → journey → communal test → renunciation. No soft reset; the new stance forecloses a path (performer/owner of stories).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: stories as recognition rather than magnetism; light as caution; art as conduit, not possession. The line explicitly reframing the heart’s power risks didacticism but is earned by the square’s scene. The closing invitation reframes silence as charged hospitality, not absence. Subtext in touch and image (villagers reaching for each other, steam curling as a question) deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent close third‑person focalization. Diction and rhythm suit the character’s craft and sensibility; image selection reads character‑specific. Sparse dialogue carries subtext and pressure without over‑explaining. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; pattern‑taught lyricism pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet disciplined; images work in service of action and theme (iridescence, dye, mist), avoiding muddled metaphors. Momentum holds through varied sentence rhythms and purposeful paragraphing. Minimal scaffold or repetition; no filter‑verb stacks dulling immediacy. A few lush phrases flirt with purple, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a dye master on a floating rock, a donor heart as narrative magnetism, and light‑driven, ephemeral illustration of communal truths. The wing’s iridescence as both instrument and cost is fresh and integral. Risk‑taking in quiet, accumulative structure heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
