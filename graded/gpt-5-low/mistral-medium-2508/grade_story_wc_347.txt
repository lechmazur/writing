<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s burdened competence and reluctant mercy are well‑drawn; the “refusing pleas” history sharpening the choice to help the girl lands. Interiority is specific (nuts, routes, frost windows) and action‑tied. Internal contradiction is present but quiet; we don’t see a visceral stumble at the peak so much as a steady endurance. The cost (spending the last nut, renewing a duty) feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she uses the last nut, fixes nothing yet, and recommits to guiding as frost locks the birds. Orientation is clean and the because/therefore of routes, frost, and birds coheres. Cost is legible on the page (resource depletion, ongoing burden). The blueprint reframes the maze’s intent, lending a subtle conceptual repricing at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard, cliffside, frost, and brass birds are vivid and functional; the frost literally constrains the birds and times her moves. The nut and blueprint operate as charged objects that shape choice and final image. Sensory economy is tight and POV‑filtered, with mechanic detail integrated into action. World rules (fruit’s three bites, jammed gears) stay consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure rises through the dusk window and the dwindling resource, culminating in the “last nut” choice. The conflict is predominantly internal and environmental; no antagonist enters the scene. The tightening is real but modest, with limited on‑page jeopardy. Still, the renunciation/endurance resolution feels earned and consequential for this scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of guidance versus entrapment and memory’s theft is embodied through blueprint, nuts, and frost. The final image reweights the labyrinth as a thing that can be taught to remember via “impressions,” a resonant answer without moralizing. The orchard’s cursed beauty mirrors the cost of duty elegantly. Ambiguity lingers productively around risk and hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. Brief dialogue is functional and in character. Voice maintains tension without over‑explaining, and selective elision (past caretaker, years of study) is paid off in present tactics. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet lush, with images doing multiple jobs (“ink the color of old bruises,” birds locking in frost). Repetition (“She had spent years…”) reads as purposeful pattern rather than loop. Figurative language stays coherent and does not swamp clarity. Momentum holds to the final image without scaffold clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mechanical birds plus cursed fruit plus a mechanical labyrinth remembered through “impressions” synthesizes into a fresh myth‑tech folktale. The “offhandedly exact” path of nuts is an idiosyncratic tactic that feels particular to this character. The close quietly innovates via the idea of teaching the labyrinth to guide again. Risks are controlled and integrated without gimmickry.</comment>
