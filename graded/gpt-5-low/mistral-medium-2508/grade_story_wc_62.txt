<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior motive is clear and particular—“Could grief be carved?”—with embodied costs (the slipped chisel, the crack, the withheld scream). The father’s spectral coaching creates a credible relational crucible that shifts his tactic from names to hollows. Micro-choices (retracing Liora, unspooling the ribbon, placing the butterfly for trade) reveal values under pressure. Slight neatness in the acceptance arc keeps it just shy of extraordinary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via motifs (butterflies, ribbon, chisel) toward a resonant reconfiguration where the gravestone becomes a vessel. Closure lands on the page with cost: he abandons the safety of engraving names for carving absence and commits to teaching his daughter within the migration’s window. Orientation is clean early; the two-shard dinner transition is smooth and purposeful. A few aphoristic lines skim didactic, but causality and cadence hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk, glass, soil, jasmine, and butterflies create a tactile, constraint-rich micro-setting that shapes action and image (lantern effect, wings whispering against glass). Tools and materials (chisel, cracked granite) matter to choices. The environment charges the ending as storm and migration refract the family ritual. Sensory selection tracks the carver’s priorities without tourist catalog breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to hold/shape grief) is signaled early; escalation occurs when the chisel slips and the father intervenes, forcing a tactical shift with visible cost. The move from engraving names to carving hollows forecloses a path and reweights meaning. The final dinner act (placing the butterfly) crystallizes commitment. Stakes are mostly internal but carry real consequence for legacy and practice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres through concrete particulars (chisel grip, hollows, ribbon poems, migration) rather than abstraction, with the final image repricing grief as communal vessel. Subtext lives in the father’s instruction and the trade of the butterfly. A few declaratives (“The dead were not gone…”) verge on thesis, slightly blunting mystery. Still, the resonance lingers and invites re-reading.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature sustains across pressure; diction and rhythm modulate with the storm and spectral presence. Dialogue is spare but subtextual and functional, particularly the father’s lines that both instruct and reframe. POV remains stable and character-bound. The voice’s elevated register feels earned by the character’s vocation and ritual context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is controlled and dense, with images doing multiple jobs (butterflies as breath/pages, greenhouse as lantern). A few aphoristic phrases flirt with purple but do not obscure action or closure. Rhythm varies well, and there is little scaffolding or looped phrasing. Syntax supports momentum through the turn and into the charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Synthesizes fresh elements—grave-carving technique reimagined, spectral mentorship as practical craft, poem-trading ritual, migration as communal clock—into an organic whole. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the rule-set is revealed. The final “door not wound” image is memorable without gimmickry. Minor thematic on-the-nose lines keep it just short of singular brilliance.</comment>
