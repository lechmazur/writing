<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s precision-as-defense is dramatized through tactile choices (compass, punch, hour) and culminates in a costly renunciation—turning away from the platform. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“belief that precision could outrun grief”). The choice to leave his sister is motivated, not tidy, with a credible ache. Slightly idealized self-articulation trims the upper band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of cracks → vault → punch tears air → question → confession → reweighted return. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/CR: he declines the platform and folds the map with a permanent crease, accepting uncertainty at cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and set-ups (hour/gates, punch) pay off. A touch of explanatory summation attenuates the final beat’s mystery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The starlit vault, mist, and iron gates aren’t postcard backdrops; the hour-gated vault and pedestal directly constrain access and tactics. Objects-as-setting (compass, punch) charge the final image (crease instead of ink). Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered by a route mapper’s eye. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to pursue the impossible platform or name/accept the unspoken truth—tightens at the punch’s “bite” and the voice’s demand. The decisive turn is his refusal to board, paying the price of not following his sister. Pressure coheres via the hour constraint and the tool’s activation. Stakes stay intimate yet felt; no false antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of surrendering certainty to live with charged unknowns emerges organically through motifs (arrows, tickets, schedules like “The Hour You Missed”). The final crease reweights prior material without neat solution. One line explicitly states the thesis (“wasn’t a destination but the courage to name them”), edging toward didacticism and slightly dulling subtext. Otherwise the imagery carries resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person sticks to Elias’s perceptual signature (maps, currents, cracks), modulating rhythm at pressure points. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with subtext in the sister’s line. No head-hopping or stance slips; elision patterns are taught and paid off. Diction is elevated yet coherent with the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with strong verbs and clean choreography; the “bite” into air and “wind through a keyhole” whistle are precise. Figurative density is high but controlled; images cohere around mapping, fractures, and transit. Minor abstraction late slightly blunts edge but does not obscure causality or closure image. No loops or scaffold clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Phantom transit and cartography metaphors are familiar yet freshly synthesized through specific tools and rules (hour, punch, schedule names). The renunciatory ending is non-obvious and earned. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off. A hair from landmark-level novelty, but distinctly realized.</comment>
