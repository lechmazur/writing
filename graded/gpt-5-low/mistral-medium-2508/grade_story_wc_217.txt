<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and tactile micro‑choices (choosing the frayed feather, not looking up at the crack, wading after the kite) ground his motive of coaxing beauty from incompleteness. Internal contradiction is mild; he largely confirms a long‑held ethos rather than contending with a sharp counter‑impulse. The envy of the patched boat and the choice to leave some things unwritten offer a credible, if subtle, cost. Overall, strong specificity without a hard crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: a dawn‑frame scene accrues motifs (feather, kite, boat, heron) toward a charged repricing—acceptance of incompletion as the living condition of his art. Orientation is clean and continuous. Closure lands on the page via Earned Stasis/CR: he refuses to “stitch” one shimmer, ties a temporary tether, and writes the last lagoon line. The cost is quiet but legible in the renunciations and the tether’s temporariness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly particular and filtered through the poet’s perceptual bias (wet salt, crushed reeds, cobalt shallows shifting to bruise‑violet). Environment and objects constrain action: the feather becomes a quill; the shallows enable retrieval; dawn’s indecision mirrors and pressures his method. Recurring elements charge the final image (feather bridging kite and notebook; the lagoon’s “recognition”). Lush but purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he make the poem alive without finishing it—tightens through the kite’s snap and the choice to retrieve and then tie it loosely as a sign of temporary bonds. Escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens. The visible prices (wet trousers, refused inscription, loose knot) are subtle yet felt. A clear deepening, not a dramatic reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: mended boat, frayed feather, untethered kite, and the decision to leave some shimmer unwritten. Occasional explicit aphorisms risk overstatement, but they’re contained as on‑page couplets and earn their keep via image. The final “woven dawns” line reweights prior material without moralizing. Resonance lingers as acceptance with cost rather than triumph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm feel confidently modulated to the scene’s hush. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful and legible. Sentence music supports pressure without obscurity. Poem‑within‑prose moments integrate cleanly with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with largely crisp, evocative lines; figurative language is fresh and tended (e.g., bruise‑violet, paper skin fluttering like a wounded bird). Minimal scaffolding and little redundancy; cadence varies well. A few aphoristic statements flirt with purple but remain anchored to concrete action. The final image is clean and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of feather‑quill, patched boat, and snapped kite around an ethos of “coaxing from ruin” feels fresh and earned. The core idea (loving the broken) is familiar, but rendered with specific, tactile choices. The closing formulation “woven dawns” is memorable without gimmickry. Risk is quiet and controlled rather than audacious.</comment>
