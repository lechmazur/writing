<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and embodied choices (“pressing the vellum to her chest,” “she did not look back”) ground motive in grief and duty. The contradiction—burdened by memory yet actively regenerating covenant—feels earned. Minor limitation: pressure stays mostly interior with few live external constraints to force harder trade‑offs on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density builds to a cadence shift (whispered words, harbor’s response, bell chime, refusal to look back). Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; cost is the chosen burden of remembrance and the foreclosed backward glance. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, violets, salt‑bleached wood, and harbor soundscape are vivid and POV‑filtered, not touristic. Recurring objects (ink, locket, vellum) and place charge the final images and enable action. Slight cap from not exerting more overt physical constraint beyond mood and ritual frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—whether memory can bind a new covenant—and escalate via density and ritual beats (ink to whisper to bell to departure). The tightening is subtle but legible: she commits to carrying the cost and not looking back. Pressure could sharpen with one on‑page counterforce testing her resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as covenant emerges organically from concrete acts, avoiding sermonizing; motifs reweight at the end (“the covenant was not yet complete, but it was breathing”). The piece resists tidy morale: endurance over triumph, with felt cost. One slightly declarative line about “context…by her hand” skims the edge but doesn’t blunt resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled POV with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with quiet intensity. No head‑hopping or register drift; metaphors are consistent with the archivist’s sensibility. A hair more syntactic variety in a couple of adjacent lines could add torque.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density and clean syntax; images do multiple jobs without scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and well‑placed; very little redundancy. A few metaphors cluster early (“parchment,” “tea,” “ink”), flirting with saturation but not obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The walnut‑ink archivist regenerating covenant through proximate causes on a blooming jetty feels fresh and specific. Final reconfiguration (“breathing” covenant; bell‑marked threshold) feels inevitable in hindsight. Strong originality without gimmick; risk is quiet but purposeful.</comment>
