<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lydia’s motives (truth vs. filial loyalty) are clear and intensify with the ledger’s “Final payment—V. Estate.” Her interiority is specific (observatory acoustics, ledger textures, secretary’s flinch) and her micro‑choices (start a new ledger of questions; decide to publish) feel earned. The contradictory impulses register on the page, though the cost remains mostly emotional and could be sharpened. Secondary characters apply light pressure rather than crucible‑level force.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning causal: the journalist’s call → ledger check → damning entry → arrival of plates → decision to publish. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost (implicating her father’s legacy). The plates’ convenient timing feels coincidental and partially resolves pressure externally, muting the earned grind. Orientation is crisp and scene unity holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory is vivid and purposeful (brightness, ghost‑moon, echoing acoustics, spiral stairs), and the pen nib functions as a charged micro‑setting object. Details filter through Lydia’s priorities, and atmosphere aligns with theme. The environment doesn’t materially constrain choices, so it remains more tonal scaffolding than a tactical force.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—publish vs. protect legacy—is present early and tightens at the ledger reveal. Lydia’s agency initiates the inquiry, but the plates’ arrival supplies resolution pressure from outside, softening the felt price. The final choice is clear, yet consequences and loss are more inferred than dramatized. A touch more on‑page cost would elevate escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Regret as orbit” and “leverage/proof by contradiction” recur and reweight the ending (“The orbit breaks here”). Thematic integration arises from particulars (ledgers, plates, the inherited nib) and lands with earned resonance. A couple of lines lean declarative (“All it took was the right leverage—and the will to push.”) but don’t tip into sermonizing. The final image (tea/typing hammer) neatly reframes legacy as action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident close-third voice with precise, rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature (soundscape, tools, textures). Dialogue is minimal but functional and subtextual. Diction stays coherent to Lydia’s sensibility; psychic distance modulates smoothly. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean, economical lines with layered images doing multiple jobs; sensory detail serves momentum. Motifs reprise without bloat; minimal scaffolding and no evident loops. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but remain controlled and purposeful. The final cadence is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory/newspaper‑heiress pairing with logic‑proof method feels fresh, and the pen‑as‑legacy throughline is elegant. The coincidental plates are a familiar device that trims novelty and grit. Still, the synthesis of scientific method with journalistic ethics is distinctive and memorable. Risks are measured and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
