<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are coherent and particular: a surveyor compelled to preserve murmurs in stone, dramatized by answering the found note and later sacrificing his heirloom. The “stoically sensitive” tension is embodied (precision vs ache), though live, in‑scene pressure is gentle rather than acute. The wife/archive backstory sharpens his flaw without slipping into therapy‑speak. The trade of the inkwell is a credible cost that crystallizes his stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern (notes, water, iron, ink) and closes with a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he relinquishes the inkwell, adopts the Keeper’s ethos, and reweights his vocation. Orientation is clean from the drawbridge to the pavilion to the library. Cost is legible on the page in the exchange of the heirloom and the foreclosed ordinary life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is tactile and selective (algae slick, iron teeth, rust and old paper), filtered through a surveyor’s eye. Environment and tools shape tactics: mortar seams as message channels, the drawbridge window, waders, ledger. The inkwell functions as micro‑setting charging the ending even off‑site. Rich atmosphere supports theme without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to commune with what’s abandoned—tightens through the found note and culminates in giving up the inkwell. Escalation is quiet; pressure accrues via time (engineers at dawn) and the memory of the Keeper rather than conflict beats. The price is felt but the opposition remains largely internal and aesthetic. Still, the reply and sealing, then the trade, are clear turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (cracks as whispers, “interlaced absence,” “before the bridge remembers”), not lecture. The final stance reweights the world: to answer the drowned city via small acts at a personal cost. Symbolic echoes (ink color, bridge, notes) deepen meaning without shouting. Ambiguity lingers productively in the shadow under water and the Keeper’s ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a surveyor’s lexicon anchors the POV; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates well between observation and decision (“He scribbled a reply… He pressed the note…”). Purposeful elision (the carp shadow, the Keeper) enriches without obscuring action. Dialogue absence is appropriate for the solitary mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; images are fresh (“ink the color of dried violets,” “iron teeth locking the past”). Minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; syntax variety sustains momentum. A few lyric intensifiers flirt with purple, but clarity holds and closure lands cleanly. Line choices often do two jobs (world and psyche) efficiently.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blend of civil engineering detail with epistolary archaeology in a drowned ballroom feels fresh. “The Keeper of Sunken Hours” and the mortar‑notes method transform familiar nostalgia into a specific praxis. The inkwell trade as closing beat is elegant rather than gimmicky. Risks are controlled and cohere with the story’s aim.</comment>
