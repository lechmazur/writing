<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rook’s motive to convert loss into closeness is concrete and embodied—old joints, twitching nose, the leaf burning his pocket. His choice to follow the cylinder’s riddle and finally submit to the vines reads as earned endurance with cost. Interiority stays character‑particular, avoiding therapy‑speak. Slight softness: the inner contradiction (fear vs. pull) is present but not deeply dramatized at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the pattern of objects (cylinder/leaf/script) accrues until the dome scene reconfigures meaning. Closure lands on the page with cost as Rook enters and the dome seals—Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing (“first garden war”). Orientation is clean from the opening. Minor quibble: the map‑following is smooth, with little resistance beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scrapyard, cracked wasteland, and glass‑etched dome are tactile, filtered through Rook’s senses. Environment and objects constrain choices: the cylinder’s pathfinding and the leaf unlocking the dome directly shape outcome and the charged final image. Sensory detail (sound of grooves, smell of rain) is purposeful and varied. World rules (script, wax, vines) are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridge the wound of distance—tightens as the riddle becomes a map, then a door that exacts a price. The key tightening is at the fissure/dome: the option to remain outside forecloses when he presses the leaf and is pulled in. The cost (self‑surrender, possible death/transform) is legible in the sealing dome. Pressure is atmospheric more than antagonistic, but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motifs (wound/bridge, rust/garden, breath/hush) evolve into a resonant answer: connection requires becoming part of the living system. The final images reweight prior material without overexplaining, and the “grave/home” reframing lands. A few direct thesis lines (“The first garden war had begun”) edge toward stated theme, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, subtext largely carries the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close maintains a consistent perceptual signature: smell‑forward, object‑attentive, time‑worn cadence. Rhythm modulates well through discovery and surrender; the cylinder’s quoted lines sit naturally within the texture. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Minor distance flare: elevated diction occasionally risks outpacing the focalizer’s grit, but voice coherence holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, propulsive, and image‑dense with purposeful variation; concrete verbs do heavy lifting. Recurring figures (wound/bridge, ribs of metal) stay coherent without muddling. A few high‑register formulations flirt with purple but do not obscure causality or the closure image. No noticeable loops or scaffolding in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Old bloodhound + phonograph riddle + post‑war garden dome synthesizes into a singular vision. The vine‑mediated “garden war” reframes apocalypse tropes with freshness and felt stakes. The closure turn feels inevitable in hindsight given the seeded leaf and script mechanics. Risk‑taking in image and method heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
