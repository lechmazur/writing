<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—obsessively seeking the color of sound—is concrete and embodied in tactile choices (wading into the wreck, turning the key, lighting the lantern). Interiority is particular (cobalt despair, amber longing) and the final act costs him the comfort of ignorance, replacing it with a charged secret. The leap “He understood then” borders on an easy epiphany, but it’s earned by prior beats. Emotional contradiction (awe/fear, longing/rigor) is present, if understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural is held: ritual → wreck → key → door → frozen festival → decisive lantern release → repriced return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he carries a vow and a transformed sensorium. Causality is coherent within the taught rules (the key opens the liminal door); no orientation debt. The price is quiet but legible in the charged final image and foreclosed naïveté.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: salt-crusted pier, half-submerged Marigold, the brined library constraining access and supplying the key and door. Recurring objects (lantern, key, tinderbox) charge the final image and shape tactics. Sensory balance is strong (brine, metal sighs, cold water) and POV-filtered. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres: ritual habit is disrupted by the snagged lantern and the discovered key; the door and faceless figure force a stance. The decisive tightening is choosing to “make” the color by lighting and releasing his own lantern, foreclosing mere seeking. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral, but they carry into the earned stasis of the ending. One more concrete impediment could have sharpened stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of making vs. finding truth and vows shown rather than spoken recur through image and action (the tagged passage → silent signing). Subtext is strong in the hush and ritual; the final shimmer reweights the premise without moralizing. The figure’s line risks a brief thematic on-the-nose moment, but the piece mostly lets images carry the argument. Resonance lingers with the idea that some truths wait for choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person closely held to Elias’s sensibility; diction and rhythm match the meteor-hush mood. The prose modulates under pressure without head-hopping or register slips. The signed “dialogue” integrates without breaking voice. Patterned imagery is taught early and paid off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet purposeful; metaphor vehicles remain coherent with the maritime and lantern lexicon. Minimal scaffolding and strong propulsion through varied syntax; no paraphrase loops. A couple of heightened phrases (“like a blade through veil after veil of half-truths”) brush purple but don’t blur sense. Final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—lamplighter ritual, sunken library, synesthetic quest, and luminous vows—feels fresh and integrated. The liminal door via a hotel key and frozen festival tableau are striking, not gimmicky. Risk-taking is measured and coherent; the twist is a conceptual repricing rather than a trick. Only the one explicit thesis line slightly tempers the ingenuity.</comment>
