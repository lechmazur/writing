<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation—he wants to give the sculpture voice—and his micro-choices (ear to fissures, adjusting grip, strumming specific cracks) align with that desire. The inner life is filtered through tactile listening rather than abstract labels, which feels character-particular. Internal contradiction is minimal; the piece favors devotion over tension, so stakes rely on endurance rather than a value clash. The visible cost is modest but present (numbed fingers, renunciation of the insulator).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of vibration imagery deepens until the grove “answers,” reweighting silence as waiting. Closure lands via a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—he leaves the insulator, the grove keeps the song, the birds carry it forward—making a legible before/after. Causality is coherent, taught by tool use and method; no teleporting props. The cost is felt (forfeiture, bodily drain, acceptance that the song is not “his”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the alder grove, siskins, and stress-struck oak are perceived through a sonic bias. The porcelain insulator functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains tactics and charges the final image when left behind. Environmental response (birds, alders) escalates and culminates the piece’s atmospheric logic. The world rules (silent wires, wood’s vibrations) stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coaxing a true song from grief—tightens as the sculpture’s voice shifts from groans to a melody the grove shares. The pressure intensifies via sensory consequences (insulator heats, glaze “weeps,” fingers numb), and the bird’s reply forces a stance: he plays “for the bird,” then relinquishes the tool. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but coherent under the chosen lens. The price is renunciation and bodily strain, small yet legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars—“a silent world didn’t mean a soundless one”—without moralizing. “Empathy in motion” is enacted rather than declared, reweighted at the end when the grove remembers and the insulator stays. The final image reframes silence as communal resonance, not absence, deepening prior motifs. Ambiguity is purposeful and humane, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and convincing; perception is filtered through a musician’s tactile ear. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, maintaining lyric clarity. No head-hopping or register drift; the patterned syntax supports rather than obscures sense. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature (vibration-first noticing) that sustains the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and mostly economical; images carry multiple jobs (world, mood, theme). A few intensified metaphors (“glaze began to weep”) border on lush but remain coherent and purposeful. Rhythm varies, sentences propel rather than loop. The closing cadence cleanly resolves image and idea without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—an ex-electric relic used to draw a lament from a war-grief sculpture in a listening grove—is fresh and specific. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric accumulation) pay off with a precise, charged finish. The object logic and sonic worldview feel original rather than ornamental. The ending’s reweighting reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
