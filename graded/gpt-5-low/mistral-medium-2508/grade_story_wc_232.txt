<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s cautious, paper‑bound temperament rubs convincingly against the chip’s pull, and his late answer to “You promised you’d come back” motivates the final choice. Interiority is concrete (ink, mint, fungi) rather than abstract. The cost—foreclosing the path toward “the scent of ink and the weight of unsold maps”—is legible. Slight opacity remains about the specific history of the promise, but it doesn’t undercut the choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal pressure + situational clock) holds: chip → ants → fissure → door → fork → renunciation. Closure is a decisive change as he chooses the child’s sob over the maps, with the creek’s surge and the door sealing making the before/after undeniable. The chip going dark reads as a paid-off constraint. All anchors are clear early and transitions are clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern’s wet limestone, mint tang, and bioluminescent blooms are tactile and shaped into action—the fissure opens, the ants’ path guides, the rising creek accelerates choice. The glow residue remains on his skin, charging the final image with cost and continuity. Details are filtered through a map‑seller’s bias, never a tourist catalog. Environmental rules stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes compress under one tightening: the rising creek and the door’s demand force a trade‑off at the fork. Agency is clear: he puts his hand to the door, then selects the sob over the maps, foreclosing a life with a felt price. The pressure escalates coherently without needing reversals. A hair more on what he loses would heighten severity, but the cost still lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Promises, maps, doors, and trails accrue into a quiet but resonant moral calculus about return and reorientation. The woman’s line—“Some doors only open when you’re lost”—reprices the entire journey without moralizing. The wet‑ink map at the end reframes authorship and fate with earned ambiguity. Sentiment is avoided; the aftertaste is reflective and precise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Close third with a supple, image‑forward diction suited to a map dealer; rhythm flexes with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but loaded, advancing plot and subtext (“You promised you’d come back”; “Took you long enough”). No head‑hopping or register drift. Lyric touches are controlled and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, motive, and pressure) without scaffolding or loops. Figurative language (foxfire in metal, ants like oil slicks) is fresh and coherent. Momentum holds through the turn; no template cadences or filter‑verb stacks dull the climax. A few modifiers verge on lush but do not blur clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The matrix chip as a luminous guide, the ink‑stained foundry provenance, and the ant procession make the quest feel singular. The “doorway of decisions” myth lands freshly through tactile particulars and a non‑obvious final house/ink map reveal. Risks are measured and integrated; the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Familiar motifs (door as choice) are revitalized by craft.</comment>
