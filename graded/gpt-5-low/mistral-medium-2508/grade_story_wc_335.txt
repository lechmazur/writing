<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elspeth and Kael are sharply etched through action and subtext—her shard-gift and his trembling annotation reveal motive and fear without exposition. The mentor’s aim (“I’ll teach you how to return”) coheres with years of geometry-tactics and the combative tenderness in her instruction. Kael’s micro‑turn from hesitation to binding the shadow lands credibly. The visible cost is mostly deferred, softening the impact of her implied renunciation (withholding “the cost of coming back”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via charged objects (cup, glass, shadow) and culminates in a Charged Poise—shadow re‑sealed, map glowing, and the line about waiting for the next knock. Orientation is immediate and clean; tactics arise from established rules (angles, tea‑geometry). Closure lands with conceptual cost implied rather than fully paid, but the earned stasis—hold and wait—reconfigures the situation. The single scene is coherent, with a tidy because/therefore chain within an accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library’s geometry and single pane constrain options and directly shape tactics; the room’s angles yank the shadow back, and the window imprisons it. Micro‑setting objects (teacup, shard) act as tools, not ornament. Atmosphere is tactile (wax, cracked leather, swing hush), and discoveries occur through action. World rules (reversible exile, mirrors) are consistent and learned in-scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containing and reframing the door‑shadow while mentoring Kael—tightens when the shadow lunges and Kael’s annotations bind it. The escalation is crisp but somewhat safe; Elspeth’s perfected geometry undercuts danger, and Kael succeeds on his first attempt. Still, the decision to teach “return” over “leave” narrows the path and seeds future cost. The final quiet cadence is charged, not slack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around reversible exile, the ethics of mentorship, and the truth inside lies; tea‑leaves as geometry literalize reading thresholds. “I’ll teach you how to return” reframes liberation with price, and the last line hums with consequence. Subtext in dialogue (“Good. Lies are where the interesting truths hide.”) avoids moralizing. The cost is suggested more than felt, keeping it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and character‑filtered; diction and rhythm sustain tension without opacity. Dialogue is taut and subtext‑rich, advancing stakes and status calmly (“you’re staring at the leaves like they owe you an apology”). Psychic distance remains stable and apt; brief peeks at Kael’s fear are earned by on‑page behavior. The narration’s certainty aligns with what can be observed in‑scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful images; lines often do double duty (world‑rule plus emotion). Figurative language is fresh and controlled (“quiet that makes people lean in”; “shadow pulsed like a held breath”), rarely overstacked. No visible scaffold or paraphrase loops; syntax varies to pace pressure. A hair’s breadth from 9+ only because cost is carried more by implication than by line‑level turn of the screw.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard‑mirror archivist, reversible exile, and tea‑geometry create a distinctive synthesis; the piece commits to its rules and mines them for tactic and theme. The door-as-shadow used bidirectionally is elegant and non‑obvious. The mentorship framed as teaching return rather than escape feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tonal blend and concept pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
