<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motive (pattern‑seeking editor drawn by the falcon/page) is clear and coherently embodied in her calm, exacting actions. The interiority is specific (condensation as cartography) and her composed curiosity under uncanny pressure reads as a credible flaw/strength. Contradictory impulses are understated but present—skeptical editor vs. fated “herald.” The final choice (offering the page, stepping forward) is earned and forecloses safety with a felt, if quiet, cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned images (condensation, deltas, drawn rivers) build toward a resonant reconfiguration when the water “unfolds” and names her herald. Orientation is clean early; causal threads (falcon → page → dock → offering) hold. Closure lands on‑page with cost: she relinquishes the map/page and steps into an unmapped role, sealing the ice behind—a before/after with tangible consequence. The motif network coheres the turns without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The outpost and frozen lake are tactile and determinative—the rust, dock, thin black ice, and breath on glass all shape choices and the final image. Environmental rules are learned through action (ice thinning, unfolding water). The setting’s textures mirror and pressure the theme of origins without feeling ornamental. The closing image (ice sealing, rusted bones groaning) is charged by place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover/accept the source) tightens as the condensation points NNW, the lake “stillness” condition is met, and the voice asserts her role. The key escalation is her offering the page, which narrows options and triggers a world‑level consequence (a river reverses). The cost is quiet but legible: she abandons the mapped world for the unmapped. Pressure is coherent, though not blistering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of beginnings/ends, authorship vs. cartography, and being written vs. writing oneself accrues through particulars (vellum, phrasebook, “rivers drawn here”). The final act reframes mapping as invocation, a conceptual repricing that lingers. Subtext stays in image and action rather than moral. The “herald” line risks explicitness but is mitigated by the surrounding imagery doing the heavier lift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third with a lucid, mineral lyricism that fits an atlas editor’s gaze; diction is controlled and consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure (quiet accumulation → solemn bloom). No head‑hopping or register slips; the voice carries authority without over‑explaining. The brief “voice” in the dead tongue integrates smoothly as diegetic phenomenon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences are economical yet layered; most lines do double duty (action plus image/theme). Figurative language is fresh (“water unfolded,” “quiet catastrophe”) and rarely over‑stacked; no muddling in peak beats. Minimal scaffolding; momentum is maintained through line rhythm. The closing cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Rivers drawn here” and water remembering creation offer a distinctive spin on portal/harbinger tropes. The falcon/phrasebook/condensation triad feels specific and integrated rather than ornamental. The acceptance of heraldship through editorial gesture (releasing a page) is an elegant, non‑obvious turn. Risk is quiet and conceptual but lands.</comment>
