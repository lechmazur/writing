<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s drive to decode wounds and her compulsion for closure are embodied and specific (archive work, the scar-touching, the pen note on her mother’s file). Contradictory impulses are present: the urge to read/solve versus the surrender to carry. Her actions align with motive and escalate credibly, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses her old tactic. One slightly declarative line (“Some stories weren’t meant to be read”) edges toward telling but remains earned by prior images.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring objects (hourglass), plant voices, and the archive build toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the pattern—frozen time, listening—stays consistent. Closure lands on the page with cost as she refuses her habitual reading to carry the wound instead. The hourglass running out and the tower’s “wounds allowed to stay open” provide a clean before/after cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower, frost, ivy, archive, and the hourglass form an integrated environment whose textures filter through Liora’s sensibility. Setting actively charges the ending (the hourglass’s state, the tower’s “wounds,” dawn’s held breath). World rules (plant-telepathy, frozen time) are taught via observation rather than exposition and remain consistent. The micro-setting of the hourglass constrains perception and punctuates the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—pursue answers or accept the cost of carrying—tightens with the archive opening, the mother’s file, and the hourglass thawing/running out. The meaningful turn arrives with “She was the thing in the walls” and the confrontation with her mother’s “unremarkable” scar. Final agency is renunciatory but decisive, with visible cost: surrendering her identity as a closure-seeker. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without needing an antagonistic figure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—wound as timekeeper, displaced miracle, listening versus decoding—rather than thesis-first statements. The hourglass and scars reweight meaning at the end, offering a resonant answer: remembrance over cure. One direct thematic articulation (“the miracle wasn’t in the healing”) is close to explicit, but the surrounding imagery earns it. The plants’ line about beginnings v. endings deepens the question without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (medical archive meets vegetal telepathy). Psychic distance and tense remain stable; no head-hopping. Rhythms modulate under pressure, especially in the mother-file and hourglass beats. No dialogue is needed; interiority and image do the work cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level is dense but purposeful; images pull double duty (wounds as architecture, sand as time-cost). Figurative language stays coherent; no mixed metaphors that muddle sense at the peak. Momentum holds with minimal redundancy, and sentences vary in rhythm. A few aphoristic lines tread near summary but are supported by concrete images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Telepathic flora paired with surgical archives and a frozen hourglass feels fresh and integrated rather than ornamental. The “displaced miracle” frame refracts common wound/healing tropes into something particular. The tunneling revelation and final hush synthesize prior motifs with inevitability. Risks in lyric compression pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
