<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Veyra’s guilt-driven rigor (“last time she’d trusted intuition over data”) collides with the necessity to “listen,” producing credible contradiction under pressure. Micro-choices (entering the alley, pressing the container, running, lighting the flare) reveal priorities and cost. Embodied responses—itching patch, burning lungs, limp—keep emotion grounded. The renunciation at the end (from pure data to charged attention) feels earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and pattern recognition lead to a conceptual repricing (“the city had learned”) with on‑page cost (shattered instrument, lost patch, limp). Orientation is clean and the single-scene window coheres. The flare’s brief efficacy is a decisive cadence shift that reweights options. Closure lands as a charged poise with a tangible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port’s container maze constrains movement and creates the wind throat; tools (anemometer, flare) interact with environment to change options. Vivid, purpose-driven details (rust‑streaked grates, resonance hum, leaning stacks) serve both action and meaning. The setting itself becomes an antagonist/system. The final image is charged by place: cranes stirring as she writes “Listen.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: survive and decode an anomalous wind system. Pressure escalates coherently—from pulsing readings to needle shatter to vortex—and Veyra’s agency (flare) creates the vital tightening. Prices paid (equipment destroyed, patch lost, physical toll) are legible and alter tactics. The resolution is a stance crystallization rather than a neat fix, and it feels earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of humility before adaptive systems and the shift from measurement to attention emerges organically. The patch’s loss and “Listen” convert earlier skepticism into a new ethic without sermonizing. The city-as-learner notion resonates beyond plot while avoiding tidy binaries. A hair shy of transcendent because the thesis edges close to articulation, but it’s grounded by image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV remains tight and plausible; diction blends technical clarity with lyric compression in a controlled way. Rhythmic modulation under stress (shorter lines during the chase) sharpens pressure. No head‑hopping or register slips. The perceptual signature (engineer‑investigator noticing pulse, resonance, geometry) feels distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffolding; imagery is fresh and mostly precise (“tuning fork” hum, wind that “pulsed”). Minor lushness doesn’t swamp clarity, and momentum is steady through the peak. No noticeable loops or template cadences. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The adaptive‑city wind system in a container labyrinth is a distinctive synthesis, and the investigator’s procedural lens freshens the premise. The flare-induced pattern break and conceptual turn feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks are measured and coherent. It stops short of radical reinvention, but the craft elevates familiar elements.</comment>
