<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Embodied interiority is specific and credible; contradictory impulses (wanting to hate the tourists, choosing not to correct “bird”) reveal depth. The somatic coping (“press your palms…”) grounds emotion in body rather than label-only affect. The decisive act—releasing the photograph—forecloses a path with a felt cost and enables a believable, modest reorientation. Mild therapy-speak risks abstraction but is anchored by tactile detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image and sensation build toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure (photo released, leaf pocketed, commitment to prune deadwood). Orientation is clear early, and the on-page cost is legible in relinquishing the photo and bearing the sting to manage overwhelm. The tour group/child’s misrecognition tightens pressure without hijacking agency. The final cadence reconfigures options from memorial stasis to present-tense tending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cliffside arboretum is vivid and purposeful: wind, foghorn ghosts, cypress, and tide shape mood and action. Environment meaningfully interacts with choice—the cypress catches the photo; the leaf’s oils charge the ending. Sensory selection matches stakes, especially touch and scent under stress. Occasional symbolism edges near overt, but integration remains grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to stay frozen in grief or risk rootedness—tightens through the tourists’ presence and the child’s misreading of the photo. The meaningful turn is Lena releasing the photo and substituting a living leaf, accepting pain via somatic method. The price is clear: she yields an anchor of loss to make room for a different anchor. Quiet, but the pressure coheres and grows under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of realism-inflected optimism accrues through concrete acts (embodied pause, photo release, pruning deadwood) and recurring images (roots, tide, cypress). The final stance offers a resonant, non-literal answer: tending over erasure. A couple of explicit lines (“That was the realism…”; “Optimism wasn’t…”) verge on moralizing, slightly reducing the understated power. Overall, subtext remains dominant and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrically restrained close third sustains through the scene; diction and rhythm modulate with breath and bodily tension. Perceptual bias is strong (trees, oils, tide), and no head-hopping occurs. Therapy terminology is absorbed by voice and practice on the page, not as exposition. Sentences carry varied cadence with clean control at the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are tight and layered; images (leaf oils, foghorn ghosts) do multiple jobs without bloat. Rhythm breathes with the protagonist’s regulation attempts; momentum never stalls. Minor risks of overt statement are isolated and do not dull the closure image. Figurative choices are coherent and physically grounded.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar grief terrain is refreshed by the somatic-therapy lens and the arboretum’s active role in the turning point. The misrecognition of the photo as a “bird” is a small but memorable inventive beat. The leaf-for-photo exchange and pruning vow synthesize theme and action with understated ingenuity. The piece avoids gimmickry while taking a quiet formal risk that pays off.</comment>
