<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (ink bleeding, ribs “X‑rayed by grief”), and his contradictory impulses—hoarding the poem vs. letting the storm edit it—culminate in a credible renunciation. The censored‑poet identity consistently informs his micro‑choices. Slightly low external pressure, but his internal pressure reads specific, not generic. The final refusal forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm + timer + poem build to a resonant renunciation with clear cost (tearing and scattering the poem). Orientation is clean from the outset and the motif chain pays off at closure. The persistent constraints (storm, crack in dome, timer) shape tactics and the final image. Quiet but decisive cadence shift lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory and storm are not postcard backdrops; the leak blurs ink, the altitude enables scattering, and the timer/workbench frame his options. Specific objects (1978 timetable, darkroom timer) are integrated and reweighted at the end. Atmosphere serves pressure rather than ornament. A model of purposeful, POV‑filtered detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep/preserve vs. relinquish/transform—tightens via the chimes, the leak, and the self‑test of pressing the poem to glass. The decisive act (tearing the poem) carries a visible price and narrows options. Pressure is coherent and grows without reversals for their own sake. Quiet escalation fits the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of censorship, grief, and authorship’s ethics emerge through actions and images, not thesis statements; the “cartography of scars” motif reweights in the final “cartographer” turn. The storm editing the poem is an elegant subtextual answer to control vs. release. A couple of lines verge on aphoristic, but they’re earned by the scene’s particulars. The final blank page avoids moralizing and resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, lyric third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature—mechanical (timer) and bodily (wrists, ribs) details inflect diction. Rhythm modulates well through pressure spikes (chimes) and release. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. The voice sustains tension without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean momentum; figurative language is controlled and mostly coherent across beats. Minimal scaffold or synonym loops; images often do double duty (storm as editor). A few stacked metaphors approach lushness but do not blur action or closure. Final lines are sharp and unencumbered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory + censored poet + darkroom timer synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Familiar metaphors (scars as maps) gain specificity through concrete staging (ink bleeding through a crack). The renunciation frame avoids safety and lands with conceptual bite. Bold but legible without gimmickry.</comment>
