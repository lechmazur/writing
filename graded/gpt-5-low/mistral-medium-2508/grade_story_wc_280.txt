<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lydia’s motive—an encore impulse recast as rescuing others—drives specific choices (following the path, giving the coin, pulling the “timeline” taut). Her interiority is vivid and embodied through synesthetic perception rather than labels. Elias is sketched efficiently yet credibly; his turn arises from pressure rather than a speech. The cost (he’ll forget; she remains the unseen hand) lands as an earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the orchard’s rules and the coin’s echoes accrete into a cadence shift when Elias stands and chooses life. Closure is on-page and costly: Lydia fades, the boy forgets, the coin will cycle back. The single-scene structure is tight with clear anchors early and one meaningful deepening (visions of possible futures) leading to the decisive act. No causality gaps; the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard/maze is not backdrop: it generates the path, obeys Lydia’s hand, and frames the rule “when the garden offered a way, you took it,” constraining choice. Sensory specificity is rich across modalities and filtered through synesthesia. The ghost light and hedge maze evolve the environment to the final image. Setting charges the ending and the recurring coin operates as micro‑setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interrupt a suicide) is clear and tightens via the path’s appearance, the coin’s echoes, and the future-visions. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the turn is Elias closing his hand on the coin and standing. The price—forgetting, Lydia’s continued liminality—registers. Slight softness: Elias offers minimal resistance on the page, so escalation is more lyrical than combative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (encore, coin, ghost light, orchard) refract the question of art’s afterlife and the quiet labor of unseen interventions. The final music “tastes like hope” reweights prior images without moralizing. Complexity remains: saving others costs Lydia anonymity and recurrence. A hair’s breadth from sentimentality, but earned through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The POV is singular and disciplined, with a distinct synesthetic lexicon and rhythmic control. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, carrying subtext (“You’re in the wrong act”). The narration refrains from omniscience beyond Lydia’s plausible perceptions. Voice modulates with pressure without leaking registers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images do multiple jobs and avoid muddle. A few stacked metaphors risk density, but cadence varies and momentum holds. No scaffold loops or template beats; syntax supports the emotional swell into closure. Final lines land cleanly without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stage ghost + hedge-maze orchard + tarot coin + synesthesia is an original synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The “timeline as thread” move is both fresh and functional. Risks (lyric density, quiet conflict) pay off in a singular aesthetic stance. The coin’s cyclical return promise adds distinctive mythic texture.</comment>
