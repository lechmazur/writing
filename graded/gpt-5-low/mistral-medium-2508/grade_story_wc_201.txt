<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Embodied interiority is vivid and character‑particular (“proprioception screaming,” tourniquet pain as anchor), with credible micro‑choices under pressure (kneeling, dipping fingers, holding the basin). Motivation coheres: survival and the recovered “mathematics of mercy” drive each move. Contradictory impulses—trauma reflexes versus a compulsion to face the shrine—operate simultaneously. The final steadiness and repurposed strap earn the change without tidy absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: waking pain → forest pull → shrine → basin vision → resonance → recalibration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: mercy as absence and echo, accepted at cost on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is promptly anchored, and each beat deepens options rather than resets them. The strap’s snap and the charged reprise at the end seal the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is specific, sensorial, and rule‑bound (black leaves drink invisible light), shaping action (roots “pull,” harmonics pressure him). The shrine, pillars, and basin integrate as lived objects rather than decor; the pewter strap functions as micro‑setting that charges the final image. Non‑visual senses (taste of burnt copper, pressure‑song) diversify texture. Environment constrains and guides choice, meeting the 9‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming self and stance toward mercy—tightens through one decisive turn: choosing to engage the basin’s ripping vision despite pain. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens: pressure intensifies from sensory overwhelm to ritual exposure (pillars singing “in pressure”). The cost is tangible (penance through pain, the strap snapping, a renunciation of “answers”). Resolution grows from Liran’s agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars (strap, basin, UV light) and culminates in a charged repricing: mercy as the absence/asking, then counting silences. Subtext rides images and sensory thresholds more than lecture. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“Because mercy wasn’t a variable,” “The math of mercy had no answer”) which trims subtlety, though they still arise from scene pressure. The final image reweights the premise without neat moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and distinctly filtered through Liran’s sensorium; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without breaking POV. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off at the shrine without opacity. Minimal dialogue is charged and non‑literal, fitting the piece’s mode. No head‑hopping or register drift undermines the stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images doing multiple jobs. Figurative language runs rich yet coherent to the world’s logic (ultraviolet, pressure‑song), with few if any mixed metaphors. A mild density of poetic assertions borders on purple in two lines, but momentum holds and clarity remains intact. Opening and final lines are charged and clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—ultraviolet ecology, proprioceptive sensitivity, and “math of mercy” as absence—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects and rules (strap, black‑leaf canopy, pressure harmonics) are not ornamental; they carry conceptual weight. The risk of a lyric‑ritual structure pays off with clarity and cost. Emotional truth grounds the novelty.</comment>
