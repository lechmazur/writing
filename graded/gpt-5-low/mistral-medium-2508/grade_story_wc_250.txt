<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The boy’s shame is embodied (trembling hands, hitching breath) and his micro‑choices (kneeling, touching water, staying to watch the light) register a credible internal shift. The guardian’s intent is legible through action, not speech, and the gift of the mirror implies cost and commitment. Relationship dynamics are spare but effective; her silence and his halting lines create subtext. The change (lighter steps, father’s later softening) feels earned rather than announced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the shutter‑weave and mirror reflections thicken into a pattern that reweights the boy’s shame. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—the guardian relinquishes the mirror, and the father’s coda demonstrates concrete consequence. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard structure coheres. Quiet stakes, but the on‑page cost is clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain, and canal are not postcard; they enable the light‑bending tactic and charge the final images. The mirror as object‑setting is central, transforming ambient light into action. Weather and water texture meaning and choice without stalling momentum. Specific sensory integration (sighing shutters, fogged breath) sustains tone and function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate and focused: can the boy’s shame be eased enough to change the father‑son stasis. Escalation is a density increase—the weaving accelerates, stars enter the water, and the boy engages—leading to the decisive act of letting the mirror go. The cost is subtle but present (relinquishing her tool, spending herself on others). Pressure remains coherent, though never harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image systems (stars reflected, darkness as space for light), and the father’s coda deepens resonance without over‑explaining. Subtext in silence does the heavy lifting. However, “He didn’t need absolution” and the final italic sentence state the thesis too plainly, slightly dulling the earned echo. The piece is moving, but a touch less telling would lift it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct—measured, lyrical, and consistent with a silent guardian’s gaze. Dialogue is spare, age‑appropriate, and subtextual. The free‑indirect stance never overreaches knowledge, and rhythmic modulation tracks pressure. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant with high information density; images often do double duty. Minor tell‑lines and occasional elevated aphorism nudge toward sentiment, but clarity and propulsion hold. Repetition patterns (click, sigh, click; star in water) feel taught and purposeful. Syntax varies; no visible scaffolding or loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dental mirror, shutter‑weaving, and canal guardian synthesize into a fresh, memorable conceit. The tactic of bending tavern light into a “trapped star” feels inventive and thematically integral. Risks (mute mediator, lyric accretion) pay off without obscuring sense. The result is distinctive rather than template‑lyric.</comment>
