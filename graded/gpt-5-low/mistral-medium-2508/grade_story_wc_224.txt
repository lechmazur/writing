<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and charged: he seeks the stone to resolve the pain of buried talent. Interiority is specific and embodied (mercury eyes, silver residue, hunger-frequency pull) with a credible contradiction between avoidance and acceptance. The final renunciation—accepting “Keeper of the Unsaid,” door sealing—forecloses the old stance. One mild neatness in the epiphany (“planting”) keeps it just shy of exemplary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density compacts toward a decisive reconfiguration (mirror → seed → door → ledger). Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality reads through action more than exposition. Closure lands on the page with cost (“The door behind him sealed shut”), establishing a before/after. The beat sequence tightens without outliney “and then” linking.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore is vivid and integral, not a backdrop: false wall, spiral stacks, lectern room shape options and the final image. World rules are learned through touch and response (the mountain exhales; a seed opens a door). Sensory selection fits POV and tone. The setting charges closure and constrains choice, clearing the high band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to claim the buried talent) tightens as discovery reframes the quest from key to mirror to planting. Agency drives the turns: tracing the feather-impression, folding the page into a seed, signing the ledger. Cost is legible in the sealed door and the implied end of avoidance. Internal pressure escalates coherently without requiring external antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: language as cultivation, home as verb, talent as seed rather than utterance. Recurring images (feather, mercury, maps) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final stance answers the question of silence vs. planted speech through action, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and possibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (book/body/mountain metaphors) and steady POV. Diction matches the uncanny register without slipping into academic gloss. Rhythm modulates at pressure points (“The stone wasn’t a key. It was a mirror.”) to good effect. No head-hopping or unearned certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High line-level control with purposeful repetition and image turn. Metaphor families stay coherent; sentences do multiple jobs with minimal scaffold. A few heightened phrasings flirt with purple but remain clear and propulsive. Closure beats are cleanly rendered without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain-as-bookstore with a language stone that plants rather than speaks feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The feather-as-texture clue and ledger consecration synthesize mythic and personal in a non-obvious way. Risk-taking in design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The vision reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
