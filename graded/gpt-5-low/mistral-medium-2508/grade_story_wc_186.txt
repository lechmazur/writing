<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (rekindling the beacon to test the meaning in fractures) with embodied loneliness and competence; micro‑choices (climb, set, trace, press the fracture) reveal a specific hierarchy of values. Contradictory impulses—grief-driven retrocognition versus present-tense endurance—coexist credibly. The acceptance at the end reads as an earned stance rather than a neat fix. Slightly limited by the absence of a direct interpersonal crucible on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through ritual action until the prism mends and the beacon sings, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing (“It had never been about bringing the past back”). Closure carries cost in continued solitude and ongoing labor, with a charged poise toward “tomorrow.” Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost is subtle rather than sharply dramatized, keeping it short of the absolute top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass pavilion, star‑carved floor, and humming architecture actively shape tactics and the final image; the prism functions as micro‑setting and tool that constrains choice. Sensory specificity (salt‑worn glass, teeth aching at the hush) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. World rules are learned through action (tracing star paths triggers ignition) with no dead description. Setting charges the ending (rain’s scent, beacon’s residual song).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and tight: rekindle the beacon to align meaning. Escalation arrives via a decisive intensification—the star paths lighting and the mending—to reweight options and knowledge. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional, not a concrete sacrifice, which slightly softens the felt squeeze. Still, the cadence shift at the flare is undeniable and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring images (fractures, hush, star paths) evolve into a resonant thesis about pattern and meaning, and the final “thistle‑blown” hope avoids sentimentality. The epiphany is earned by particulars—the beacon’s flare and constellational alignment. A touch of explicitness in “Of course it had never been about…” trims the mystery. Ambiguity about who might see the beacon deepens the lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent psychic distance; rhythm flexes with pressure (the flare quickens, the close breathes). Diction remains inside the character’s perceptual lexicon (ritual, echo, hush) and supports the world’s logic. No head‑hopping or stance wobbles. A couple of declarative theme lines slightly reduce the otherwise exquisite indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: images carry multiple jobs, and sentences propel rather than loop. Figurative density is high but coherent and pattern‑taught (sound/silence, breath/song), avoiding mixed metaphors. Minor repetition (“of course”) and a few abstract assertions are the only softness. The final line lands cleanly as image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shard of hush and retrocognition reframed as loneliness give the post‑collapse beacon trope fresh life. The mending‑not‑perfect turn and constellational mirror provide non‑obvious inevitability. Risks (quiet, accumulative structure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels singular and memorable.</comment>
