<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Liora’s drive—to understand the night-blooming jasmine and the silence around it—organizes her actions (pressing her palm to the glass, deciding not to paint, writing a final postcard, leaving). Interiority is embodied (cold seeping “like a confession,” breath fogging the pane). The renunciation feels earned, though the aphoristic line she writes edges toward tidy. Still, the cost—letting the murals fade and walking away—is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrete until the glass reveals living flowers and the premise is reweighted (they open when the world is still enough to hear). Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing with cost (she stops painting, departs, leaves the card). Orientation is clear from the outset. The on-page reveal (“the glass shivered… layers separate like pages”) anchors the turn cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The pavilion, garden, and cathedral window are vivid and functional; setting is not backdrop but mechanism and reliquary. The etched glass directly enables the discovery and charges the final image of leaving the card on the sill. Sensory texture spans sight, touch, scent, and season. The place constrains choices and shapes the ending’s poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure builds texturally toward a single deepening: the window’s hidden layer reframes the stake from “why night?” to “how to listen.” Agency is a renunciation (not painting, leaving) with a visible price, appropriate at this scale. Stakes remain internal but coherent and tighten at the shiver/reveal beat. No antagonist is needed under this lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres—attention, stillness, and the ethics of looking—through recurring objects and acts (postcards, breath on glass, moon-blooming jasmine). The final understanding reweights prior material: the pavilion “built to catch that moment.” Slight ding for the explicit aphorism she writes, which risks a stated moral; however, it’s character action, not authorial summary. The resonance lingers beyond tidy explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close-third voice with controlled rhythm and image choice. Diction fits the sensibility and modulates with pressure (cadence tightens around the shiver and loosens into the closing litany). No head-hopping or stance drift. Occasional patterned repetition feels intentional and earns its effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful imagery, and clean sequencing. The litany near the end (“The pavilion stood… The flowers listened…”) is rhythmic, not redundant. A few lines flirt with aphorism, but clarity and momentum hold. No significant artifact or figurative muddle undercuts the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reliquary-window holding centuries-old blooms and the “hush” as the operative force provide a fresh synthesis. The postcard device elegantly threads time and voice. Risks are taken in a quiet, accumulative design, landing with specificity. Only minor familiarity in the concluding aphorism tempers the sense of absolute newness.</comment>
