<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lior’s motives and temperament are vivid—he refuses the village’s “unlearning” and pursues meaning through making. His micro‑choices (pocketing the flake, beginning the mandala, plunging his hand in, drawing an unfinished path in the square) align with a coherent value system. Interiority feels embodied rather than labeled. The main limitation is a lack of strong contradictory impulses under pressure; he rarely wavers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whisper→mandala→void→chorus→public mural→return to grotto, culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing (“Always,” drawing the void again). Orientation is clear early and the throughline reads clean. Closure lands with a reweighted premise (remembering over unlearning) and a felt social cost implied by defying elders, though the price remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. No causality slips or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The whispering grotto, mist, glaze flake, sands, and acoustics are sensorially rich and functionally embedded. The environment constrains tactics (listening through the tile, using the mandala as the interface) and charges the final image when he returns to “draw the void.” Detail selection is purposeful and character‑filtered. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resist erasure and retrieve/embody meaning—tightens with the flake’s “Interject now” ultimatum and his plunge into the mandala. Pressure escalates organically via density and chorus rather than adversarial reversal, appropriate for the chosen lens. The public mural choice adds social risk, though consequences stay implied rather than confronted. Clear agency drives the turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: meaning arises from “the mess,” art as conduit for remembering, and communal participation (the child’s line). The motifs (eyes→windows, wings→bridges, lavender/mist) evolve with subtext. A slight knock for explicit thematic echo (“The mess is the map” is repeated and near‑moralistic), but it’s earned by action. The ending reweights prior images without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (sensory bias toward texture, sound, and color). Rhythm modulates well, and the sparse dialogue is precise and charged. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; elisions feel purposeful. Minor flourish risk is kept in check by clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and clean propulsion; images do multiple jobs. Figurative language is fresh and legible (“mist coiled… like a held breath,” “silence that wasn’t absence, but presence”) with only light purple risk. No significant loops or scaffold; syntax varies effectively. The final image lands cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Whispering architecture + sand mandala interface + “emergent hush” during an enforced cultural erasure feels original and integrated. Turns grow from established specifics (tile flake, acoustics, sands) rather than late rule changes. The public, unfinished path is a smart, character‑true twist. Strong synthesis without gimmickry.</comment>
