<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—she reframes inherited pain through curated images—and her micro‑choices (lingering, selecting light, tucking lavender) align with that aim. Interiority is largely shown through action and sensory bias rather than labels. The internal contradiction is subtle (burden vs. composure) and could press harder under stress. The final stance (case lighter; moving on) feels earned, if low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: waiting for the light, child/butterfly arrival, and the shadow’s stretch tighten into the shutter click. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the image reconfigures the town’s grief at a felt cost (her carried weight and long patience). Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence holds. The cost is quiet rather than acute, but it’s legible in the “weight changed” and town‑scale stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lavender field, rusted fence, and factory ruins are vivid and purpose‑driven, with scent and texture balancing visuals. Environment constrains choice: she waits for shadow, positions the fence and butterfly, layers the arcs—charging the final frame. Object‑as‑setting (map case, photographs) integrates with place to shape action. Tone and atmosphere deepen theme without feeling touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting communal pain) is signaled and coheres; pressure deepens through timed light, the butterfly’s perch, and the decisive shutter. The tightening is modest but clear, with her endurance and attention serving as agency. Costs are primarily emotional and temporal; no antagonist, but situational pressure suffices. The click is an earned culmination, not a coincidence‑driven solve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Images (hands, fence, shadow, butterfly) accumulate into a compelling argument about reframing pain; the bakery window coda extends resonance into community. A few thesis lines (“This was how you transmuted pain…,” “healing wasn’t subtraction…”) are on‑the‑nose, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the final constellation image and weight shift deliver an earned, non‑literal answer. The piece avoids false equivalence and holds authentic tenderness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close is stable with a confident, lyrical cadence that modulates as pressure builds toward the shutter. Diction fits the focalizer’s perceptual signature—sensory and precise, not clinical. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty; purposeful compression reads cleanly. Occasional aphorism edges toward generality but doesn’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, mood, and forward motion—without drag; rhythm varies and lands the ending cleanly. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; sensory detail is specific without purple excess. Minor aphoristic statements risk redundancy but don’t create loops or obscure causality. The final lines resolve by image with crisp cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “archivist of pain” using layered photographs of reaching hands against industrial ruin and lavender is a fresh synthesis. The method and setting feel singular rather than templated, and the bakery window ripple is quietly inventive. Risk lies in the high‑lyric approach; it pays off with clarity and resonance. Only small thematic explicitness keeps it shy of extraordinary.</comment>
