<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (dial adjustments, copper spoon, refusing to pry). The passenger’s embodied sorrow registers through gesture and staging rather than labels. Internal contradiction is minimal—Elias remains assured—which keeps the emotional range narrower than the prose invites. Still, endurance as vocation reads credible and earns the quiet renunciation at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern of silence management intensifies (vial blooms → darkens → hisses → clears) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the charged poise of the final drift with the vial clear, the terrace lighter, and the cost framed as ongoing stewardship rather than erasure. Orientation is clean from the outset and the single scene contains one meaningful tightening (child’s laughter intrusion handled by choice). The cost is subtle but legible in the commitment to teach noise how to move rather than suppress it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prism terrace, storm glass, brass dial, and canal operate as lived tools that constrain and enable choices (bending sound, dosing a droplet, reading absence). World rules feel consistent and learned through action; the environment directly charges the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑colored, avoiding tourist catalog. The setting’s specificity is inseparable from the story’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether silence can comfort rather than accuse, tightening with the vial’s darkening and the intrusion of distant laughter. Elias’s adjustments constitute agency that reshapes the sonic field and the passenger’s burden distribution. The price remains conceptual/ongoing rather than a sharp foreclosure, so escalation feels elegantly muted rather than gripping. Still, a clear mid‑scene deepen and a closing stance crystallization are present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece embodies the theme that silence is active, not absence, through recurring images and choices; the final image reweights that idea without sermonizing. A single explicit line (“You can’t stop the noise…”) risks stating thesis but is earned as craft knowledge in context. Subtext works through prisms, storm glass behavior, and redistributed weight. Resonance lingers as a lived ethic rather than a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature stays stable in distance and stance. Diction and rhythm suit Elias’s vocation and the story’s sonic attentiveness; dialogue is minimal, purposeful, and subtextual. No head‑hopping or register slips; psychic distance modulates cleanly at pressure points. The voice carries texture without explaining what the images already do.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing double duty (world rule + emotion) and strong rhythmic control. Figurative language is lush but largely coherent and pattern‑taught; repetition (“hush,” prisms, breath) reads as design, not loop. Minimal scaffold, clean sequencing, and a crisp final cadence. A hair from purple in places, but clarity holds throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storm‑glass acoustics, mirrored terrace, and mapping of absence synthesize into a fresh, cohesive system. Turns feel inevitable within this invented logic (droplet to vial → hiss → absorption). The concept risks strangeness and commits fully, creating memorable images with emotional truth. The ending’s reconfiguration feels both surprising and earned.</comment>
