<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct, competent adversaries with readable motives (answers vs destinations) and status play that shifts into partnership. Interiority is sparing but effective—Elias’s pulse quicken and the heron image show embodied pressure. Micro-choices (slapping the card, tracing light, choosing the notch) reveal hierarchy of values. Cost is mostly conceptual (defying the Council), not deeply felt emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: card placement → angle inference → light trace → notch → key → alliance. Single-scene window honors scope, and closure lands with a decisive change (partners over petitioners) with a plausible social cost (abandoning the Council’s verdict). Lens: Causal with a light conceptual repricing at the end; held consistently. Minor softness in explicit on-page cost prevents the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: glass refraction, sundial geometry, and the brook/heron calibrate pace and choices. Environment and objects constrain tactics (light through panes, needle shadow, dial notch) and charge the final image. Detail is purposeful and filtered through action. Occasional lyric flourish skirts purple but stays controlled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (win on their own terms vs await judgment) tightens through the duel-turned-puzzle. The meaningful deepening arrives with the reveal that Liora seeded the code, forcing Elias to match her method and choose partnership. Agency drives turns; coincidence does not resolve. The price is largely reputational/strategic rather than visceral on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (destination over answer; negotiation as ethics) emerges through action and image—shadow, sundial, brook’s “waiting,” fencing as treaty. The final renunciation of the verdict offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermonizing. A couple of near-tidy assertions (“The Council could keep their verdict”) shave subtlety slightly. Subtextual flirtation of rivalry-to-alliance works.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Confident, polished voice with crisp, subtext-rich dialogue; distinct idioms (Elias’s dry precision vs Liora’s calculated smirk) read cleanly. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure (the chime and click sequence lands). No head-hopping or stance slips. Elevated language matches the milieu without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with strong verbs and specific nouns; lines often do double duty (image plus tactic). A few lush metaphors (“shattered diamonds”) flirt with excess but don’t obscure action. Syntax varies and momentum holds; no paraphrase loops or template cadences. Final image resolves cleanly without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dueling-as-diplomacy via sundial code and a needle card feels fresh and coherent; the mechanical arm adds texture without gimmickry. The reveal that Liora planted the code twelve years ago reweights the frame in a non-obvious way. Risks are taken in tone and conceit but remain legible. Emotional cost could cut deeper to reach the highest echelon.</comment>
