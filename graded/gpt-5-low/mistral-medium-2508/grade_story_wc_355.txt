<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interior is particular and embodied—“collects silences,” stained fingers, tuning empathy—culminating in a credible turn from avoidance to action. The contradiction (pacifist tuning for quiet vs the need to break it) operates on the page and motivates the final choice. Cost is legible: he risks his defining stance to engage with the world. Minor hedge: the leap from private realization to public shop happens briskly but remains earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fireworks pressure + device hum + diary’s last entry tighten toward a charged decision. Closure lands with cost via Decisive Change into next morning’s action (“Silence repaired here”). Causality is coherent—because fireworks threaten to drown meaning, he acts now; because the device reacts to his silence, he reframes his ethic. A hair shy of 9+ only because the guild‑ruins visit is elided and the cost is primarily conceptual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposive: beeswax, copper, grimy window, fireworks cadence; the tool-as-setting (frequency device) constrains tactics and charges the final image. The fireworks’ soundscape functions as environmental pressure and thematic counterpoint to silence. Spatial and sensory anchors are seamless and POV‑filtered. Excellent economy without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around whether listening suffices when conflict erupts; pressure tightens as fireworks escalate and the device “reacts to his silence.” The meaningful turn is the shift from decoding to choosing to intervene, foreclosing his prior avoidance pattern. Costs are felt but largely internal; absence of a direct antagonist keeps escalation modest yet sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thematic spine—empathy as a frequency and the ethics of breaking silence—emerges through concrete images (clasp, vibrations, fireworks). The final action reframes the premise into practice with resonant subtext. Slight deduction for explicit thematic articulation (“Maybe empathy… when to break it”) which edges toward moralizing. Still, the diary’s “choice not made” reweights the ending effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; perceptions are filtered through craft and quietude. Rhythm modulates with pressure (crescendoing fireworks vs held-breath pauses), and diction stays character‑plausible. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. The sparse dialogue at the end wisely leans on implication.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean, high‑density lines with strong verbs and precise imagery; metaphors (silence as texture/frequency) are coherent and sustained. Minimal scaffolding and no cadence templates; momentum holds. Minor softness where theme is stated rather than entirely enacted. Overall, polished and publication‑ready prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a device that tunes silence, a diary written in vibrations, and fireworks as counter‑music to empathy. The reconfiguration from collecting silence to repairing it is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are purposeful and integrated, not ornamental. Slight familiarity in “burned guild” backdrop keeps it just short of exceptional.</comment>
