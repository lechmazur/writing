<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The worker’s motive (drawn to broken things; moonlit healer) is clear and consistent, and their micro‑choices (picking up the sextant; choosing to map dreams) align. However, interior conflict is minimal—there’s little simultaneous push‑pull beyond a “steady hum” of sorrow. The healing reads largely assured rather than contested, which limits felt cost. The late addition of “what the trees witnessed” widens motive without pressing the on‑page choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the sextant is whole and sorrow eases. Orientation is clear early (stormlit tower, observatory, sextant). The mapping action escalates toward the pin‑drop beat, delivering a cadence shift, but the cost at closure is soft, more benediction than price. Structure holds as one continuous scene with a clean descent coda.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and consistent: damp stone, ozone, torches, wind‑driven rain, and moonlight shaping the room’s feel. The sextant functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image. Weather and architecture apply light pressure (wind, storm), though they rarely constrain tactics. World rules (sorrow as measurable; moonlight healing) are coherent and shown in action without bulky exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deconstruct sorrow to restore what’s broken—remains largely internal and unthreatened. Escalation is mostly textural (storm syncs with heartbeat), with one meaningful tightening at the concentrated mapping and pin‑drop. Resolution arrives without a visible trade‑off or foreclosed option; the outcome feels guaranteed by gift rather than tested. The result is calming but low in pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of repair, measurable grief, and “mundane miracles” cohere through recurring images (moon, storm, sextant). Some lines state the thesis outright (“In this world, sorrow was not just a feeling”), edging into telling. The final movement widens to connection with trees/tower/moon, offering gentle resonance without a sharp reprice. The aftertaste is luminous but safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>A consistent, lucid third‑person with a lyrical bent; diction and cadence match the magical‑real tone. Rhythm sometimes flattens from repeated declaratives and “In this world” frames. No head‑hopping or stance slips; psychic distance stays steady. Voice is pleasant but could vary sentence music more under peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Strong image economy overall, yet there are paraphrase/echo loops (“The storm may have passed” repeats; several moonlight affirmations) that blunt momentum. Figurative density stays legible, but some lines explain what images already show. Sentence rhythms lean uniform in stretches, muting propulsion in the middle. The final third’s repetition slightly dulls the closing charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—labyrinth maintenance worker quantifying sorrow and healing via moonlight—is fresh and well synthesized. Repairing a sextant by mapping dreams has memorable specificity. The piece avoids gimmickry, though it doesn’t push into riskier moral or emotional ambiguity. Original, gentle, and coherent, if not breathtakingly daring.</comment>
