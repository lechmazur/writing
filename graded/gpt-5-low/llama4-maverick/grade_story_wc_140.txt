<question>1</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Clear motive (reconstruct erased histories) but little embodied interiority or contradictory impulse; the “nameless” stance reduces friction rather than creating it. Micro‑choices are minimal beyond taking the label and moving on. Emotional texture is summarized rather than dramatized. The end registers comprehension, not a costly change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is coherent, and the final image (label stored, survivor moving on) offers a soft resonance. However, escalation is thin and on‑page cost is not legible at closure. The “task complete” line forecloses without visible price, weakening the RR effect. Structure is linear and clear but low in consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth, faded labels, tides, and poison label create a consistent atmosphere. Specifics are mostly visual and recur, charging the final image lightly via the kept label. The environment rarely constrains action or alters options. Sensory range and tactical use of space are limited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is stated but never truly tested; no meaningful tightening or trade‑off occurs. The survivor’s agency is mostly attention and collection without pressure or loss. The “metronome” tide motif marks time but doesn’t force a choice. Resolution feels inevitable and low‑risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and recovery are coherent, with the poison label as emblem. Much of the thematic work is told in abstract terms (“texture of memories”) rather than earned through event. The ending’s resonance is gentle but not reweighting. Little subtext arises beyond the central metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stable third‑person distance and consistent, meditative diction. Rhythm is monotone with repeated openings (“The survivor…,” “As the…”), limiting dynamic control. Voice feels generic lyric rather than character‑particular. No dialogue to test modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Noticeable paraphrase loops and template stems depress momentum (“The survivor…,” “The labyrinth…,” “The tide…” recurring without added pressure). Abstract phrasing (“texture of memories”) substitutes for concrete action. Information density is low relative to repetition, especially in the final third. Clarity holds, but propulsion suffers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The conceit of a death‑record error survivor harvesting erased histories in a container maze has promise. Execution leans on familiar lyric tropes without a distinctive turn or cost. The poison label gives a mild fresh note, but the arc is safe and linear. Risk‑taking is minimal.</comment>
