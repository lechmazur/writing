<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The advisor’s motive—translating silence into music—is clear and consistent, and their attention to the old man’s signing provides a credible throughline. However, interiority is mostly summarized; we seldom feel contradictory impulses or embodied stress. Micro‑choices (beyond “watch, interpret, conduct”) are thin. The final endurance/renunciation cost is conceptual rather than felt, limiting character depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the crowd gathers, the signing becomes conducting, and the harbor is “retuned,” culminating in a charged final dawn image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the world is “tuned” and the advisor departs. Cost is more thematic than dramatized, which softens the cadence’s bite. Orientation is clean and the single scene stays coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is vividly rendered and sustained, with moonlight and water interwoven into the music/silence motif. The camera object recurs to charge the last image. The setting mostly supports tone rather than constraining tactics, so its functional pressure is limited. Still, specificity is consistent and purposeful for atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on giving voice to the unheard, but pressure is gentle; escalation comes via density (crowd gathers, music swells) rather than narrowing options. The “disruption” is framed as soothing, reducing friction. The advisor’s agency is present but rarely tested. The ending’s cost is conceptual, not a trade‑off with visible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of memory, translation, and connection are coherent and echoed through sign language and the empty camera. However, several lines articulate thesis directly (“it became clear… not just about sound but about connection”), edging into told moral. The final image reweights the premise effectively without fully escaping abstraction. The melancholic/joyful braid reads honest if a touch stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident, with a consistent lyrical distance. Diction is clean but leans on repeated stems (“The advisor…”) and generalized abstractions. Subtext in the signing is implied but mediated through summarizing narration. Rhythm is serviceable rather than distinctive under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clear, but repetition and scaffolded statements dilute momentum (“It became clear…”, “The advisor’s… gift was a reminder…”). Figurative texture tends to restate theme rather than discover new angles. The prose avoids muddle yet relies on generic modifiers and summary. The final third repeats motifs without fresh compression, softening impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Mapping silence” via sign language, with an empty camera as mnemonic counterpoint, is a fresh synthesis. The harbor as orchestra and the advisor as conductor feels distinctive, if somewhat abstracted. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; the piece favors safety over sharper turns. Still, the conceptual integration is memorable.</comment>
