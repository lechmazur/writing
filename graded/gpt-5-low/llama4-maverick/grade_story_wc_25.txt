<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear motive (prove whispers travel farther) and competence are established, but internal contradiction and cost are thin. She makes few pressured micro‑choices beyond steady exploration and approaching the stranger. Emotions are lightly embodied; excitement is told rather than dramatically conflicted. The ending stance shift feels mild rather than earned through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: motifs (storm, maps, coin, key, whispers) accrue to a quiet closure where the whisper “wins.” Orientation is clear, and the scene flows linearly. Closure lands as a charged poise rather than decisive change, with minimal on‑page cost. Setups (coin, key) don’t pay off causally, softening structural tightness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and consistent: salt, rust, flickering lights, echoing footsteps, and the storm’s interference on the compass. The container maze feels tactile and guides movement. However, environment rarely constrains a critical choice; it frames more than it forces. Strong specificity without a closing constraint keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prove whisper > shout) is signaled early and receives a test with the stranger, but pressure is modest and largely uncontested. The find‑objects beats (coin, key) don’t meaningfully raise cost or narrow options. The escalation is a gentle approach rather than a squeeze. Consequences are conceptual, not felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of quiet power accrues through setting and final whisper, but it is also stated outright (“sometimes it was the quietest voices...”), edging into moralizing. The maps/coin/key suggest secrecy and hidden orders, but their thematic integration is surface‑level. Resonance exists yet remains gentle and unsurprising. The final image reweights little beyond reaffirmation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and coherent with a measured, observant cadence. Diction fits the character’s practical gaze with occasional lyric lifts. Dialogue is minimal but functional. Minor generic phrasing blunts distinctiveness under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lines are clean and readable with some evocative images (“howling… like a chorus of restless spirits”). Repetition of “labyrinth” and explanatory phrasing add mild scaffold. Figurative density remains controlled but not uniquely sharp. Momentum is steady, with a few near‑echo sentences that could be tightened.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The container‑maze plus geomagnetic storm is a fresh frame; the whisper premise has charm. Coin/map/key elements trend familiar and underused, limiting ingenuity payoff. The synthesis feels competent rather than inevitable or daring. The piece avoids gimmicks but doesn’t take a decisive artistic risk that reconfigures meaning.</comment>
