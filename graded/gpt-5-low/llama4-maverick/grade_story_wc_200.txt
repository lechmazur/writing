<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The collector’s compassion and steadiness read clearly, with concrete micro-choices (following the light, humming a counterpoint) but little contradictory impulse under pressure. Interiority leans generic (“modestly fearless,” “sense of purpose fulfilled”) rather than character-particular. The young woman’s presence adds minimal relational friction. The final endurance—continuing the work—carries scant on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean single-scene arc: sound → discovery → confession → release → return to the path. Closure lands with the spirit’s passing and the charged, quiet continuation, but the price is mostly tonal (“weight of her task”) rather than dramatized cost. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds. No orientation debt; causality is simple but intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Echo Gorge, mist, waterfall, and the harp create a coherent, moody micro-ecology that supports tone and action (light behind the fall; sound guiding movement). Sensory detail is selective and steady, though mostly visual and aural. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain options beyond guiding approach. The final image recalls place effectively but doesn’t newly charge choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing a trapped soul) is clear, but pressure stays gentle; the main tightening is the harp’s insistence and the confession itself. The protagonist’s agency resolves the situation without a meaningful trade-off or visible loss. No real reversal tests her limits. The ending’s “burden” is asserted more than felt as paid cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Healing, listening, and the “luminous ache” cohere, and the release scene embodies them modestly. However, thematic claims (“integrate laughter into healing”) are told outright and arrive late, reducing subtext. The crocodile tooth hints at a richer repricing but remains underexploited. Resonance lingers but edges toward sentimentality by explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A consistent third-person lyric distance with stable focalization; diction matches the moody register. Rhythms are smooth, if occasionally uniform, and the elision around world rules is legible. Some phrasing feels stock or abstract, blunting distinctiveness. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean and readable with a steady cadence, but repeats images/phrases (“mist swirled,” harp’s notes) without added pressure. Occasional tell-y lines and abstractions (“sense of purpose,” “modestly fearless”) dilute density. Figurative choices are coherent, if safe. Momentum holds, though minor redundancies could be trimmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The soul‑collector frame is familiar; the misaligned harp and crocodile tooth offer fresh touches but are not fully transformed into necessity. Emotional truth is earnest yet risk-averse. The closure image is competent rather than inevitable or surprising. More specific cost or a bolder deployment of the tooth could elevate uniqueness.</comment>
