<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The dresser’s devotion and pragmatism read clearly, but internal contradiction and on‑page micro‑choices are minimal. Motivation is declared (“to prove that gardens know their gardeners”) rather than tested under pressure. The ritual of polishing marbles reveals character, yet no beat forces a costly choice. Change registers as endurance more than transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece layers ritual and care toward a quiet Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean (who/where/what by early lines). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—marbles polished and returned, the garden “knowing” the dresser—but cost is conceptual and light. No major causal turns, yet the cadence shift at sunset provides a satisfying close.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden maze is vivid and sensorially consistent, with marbles functioning as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. Scent, light, and seasonal textures are well integrated through the dresser’s attention. However, the maze rarely constrains choice or tactics; it’s more atmospheric than operative. Strong tone–setting fusion elevates despite limited functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely abstract (prove reciprocity between gardener and garden) and do not escalate. The measurable‑luck premise suggests external pressure, but it never forces a trade‑off or reversal. The polishing ritual repeats without tightening options. Resolution is an earned stasis rather than a tested decision with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres around reciprocity, care as dialogue, and the elegy of “withering beauty.” The marbles reprise reweights memory and labor without moralizing, producing a gentle after‑glow. Some lines tilt toward telling (“measurable luck,” “wisely pragmatic”), blunting subtext. Still, the final image credibly reframes earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable close third with a consistent lyrical cadence and controlled diction. The perceptual signature—ritual, reverence, and tactile care—feels unified. Minor syntactic repetition (“The dresser…”) creeps in, but rhythm remains legible and modulated. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clean sentences and purposeful imagery carry momentum, but redundancy appears in restated ideas and recycled stems. Abstract phrases (“mended deception,” “measurable luck”) are intriguing yet under‑specified, adding slight haze. Overall, density is respectable and the final line lands clearly. Trim loops to sharpen pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fusion of a garden’s reciprocity with a post‑“measurable luck” world is fresh, and the cracked marbles make a distinct emblem. Risk is moderate; the piece prefers safety in atmosphere over structural invention or surprising turns. The “mended deception” hint suggests a bolder backstory that isn’t exploited. Still, the synthesis feels personal and coherent.</comment>
