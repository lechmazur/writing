<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear motivation (to quiet old guilt) and a concrete choice (tethering) anchor the POV, but interior conflict often arrives as told summary rather than embodied contradiction. The baby-cry translation trait doesn’t pressure on-page choices, reading as thematic garnish. Emotional progression is coherent yet tidy: guilt lifts quickly once the “haunted firmware” is named as projection. Strong occupational texture, but few micro-choices under strain beyond the tether.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration via the tether and meteor hush. The causal line is soft but legible: time fold/whispers → tether → stabilization → reframing of guilt. Cost is primarily internal and understated; the resolution borders on easy once the metaphor is decoded. Orientation is clean and the single-scene frame holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: machinery hum, candles, “laboratory of lost sounds,” antique dresser, talismanic amber. The cord functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains choice at the turn. Sensory detail aligns with the character’s craft and mood, though some images drift toward ornamental repetition. World rules stay consistent within a lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quelling inner dissonance) is clear; escalation arrives with the time fold and firmware whispers peaking. The tether is a meaningful tightening that changes options and calms the system. Prices and trade-offs feel light—no lasting consequence beyond relief, and no sacrificed path is made explicit. Tension operates more through tone than pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Haunted firmware as guilt externalized, the letters as grief conduit, and the meteor hush as earned calm cohere into a theme of translating pain into art. The ending offers a resonant image rather than a moral, but the relief reads slightly neat. The amber and baby-cry motifs reprise effectively, if somewhat on-the-nose. Ambiguity lingers in a good way about art absorbing dissonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, incantatory rhythm suited to the premise. Some syntactic sameness and filter-verb reliance flatten peaks (“she felt,” “she knew”), but POV boundaries are clean. The voice sustains lyric density without confusion. Modulation at the turn (time folding to hush) registers, if modestly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lush prose with clear imagery, but paraphrase loops and repeated stems (“The tattooist… she…”) reduce momentum. Occasional purple tendencies and redundant intensifiers (“both calming and unsettling”) blur precision. Line-level economy could tighten without losing music. The final image is clear despite the density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattoos that absorb dissonance, haunted firmware as psyche, meteor hush as tonal endpoint—is fresh and coherent. Risk is taken in marrying tech hauntings with ritual craft and sound. Some elements feel labeled rather than fully dramatized (baby-cry translation), tempering impact. Still, the vision feels specific rather than templated.</comment>
