<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (“teach withering to bloom again”) and the maker’s tactics (origami coordinates, focused craft) align, but interiority stays generalized and largely told. Contradictory impulses under pressure are absent; grief and hope don’t collide on the page so much as alternate in summary. Embodied emotion appears (sandalwood, myrrh, deft fingers), yet the peak insight is asserted rather than earned in a fraught choice. The change feels gentle and credible but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres from ritual action → star alignment → curtain illumination → quiet reconfiguration. Orientation is strong early; the causal mantra (origami → alignment → glow) makes sense. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the final image of peace and renewed purpose, though the cost is muted and phrased declaratively. The brooch and curtains reprise cleanly but without a decisive narrowing or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory is vivid and sensorial (domed glass, sandalwood/myrrh), and objects like the curtains and stencil recur to charge images. Environmental logic holds and the setting participates via cosmic alignment and peak illumination. However, the space rarely constrains choices; it frames mood more than it forces tactics. Still, specificity and atmosphere are consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting grief into craft/illumination) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens—no real trade‑off or foreclosed option accompanies the glow. The “method” arrives and works smoothly; no setbacks or forced recalibration. The “peak illumination” reads as a volume increase, not a costly pivot. Resolution feels earned in tone, light in consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (grief transmuted into beauty; withering to bloom) is coherent, with the flower stencil and soft rekindling returning at the end. Subtext is diluted by direct statements (“Their craft… had become a means of healing”), edging into moralizing. The final image offers gentle resonance but little ambiguity or friction. The piece invites reflection, but not a re‑weighting that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A consistent, quiet lyric voice suits the material; diction is controlled and generally character‑plausible. Rhythm occasionally lapses into repetition (“stars shone bright” and parallel structures) and summary. POV remains stable and confident. The modulation toward a warmer cadence at the end works, though some lines explain what the images could carry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is fluent, but figurative density and synonymic loops create mild purple wash and momentum drag. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar sentiments (illumination, renewed purpose) rather than compounding pressure. Information density is moderate; more action‑grounded specifics would sharpen. The final third includes tell‑phrases that soften the closure’s force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>“Curtains of intention,” origami coordinates altering star positions, and the mourning jeweler frame a fresh constellation of ideas. The synthesis feels singular, if under‑pressurized in execution. Risks in concept and image are evident and coherent, but they stop short of transformative stakes or an inevitable turn. Novelty resides in texture more than causality.</comment>
