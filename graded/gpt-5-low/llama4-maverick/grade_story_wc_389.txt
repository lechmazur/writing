<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The visionary remains an archetype rather than an individual; her motives are stated but not tested in scene. Micro-choices are largely “to listen more” and “to guide,” with no embodied hesitation or contradiction. Emotional texture is told, not dramatized, so no felt cost at the end. The prophet functions off-stage, denying relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens fits: a summary arc from storm to “new dawn.” Closure lands as a conceptual completion (“her work…had helped to bring about a brighter future”), but there’s little on‑page cost or decisive narrowing. The because/therefore chain is generic (“she listened → learned of prophet → guided”) without a pressured turn. Orientation is clear early; the main deficit is low-stakes causal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>“Stormlit observatory” and “cobalt glass portico” create atmosphere and return in the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; it functions as a poetic backdrop rather than a pressure source. Weather subsides without affecting a choice. Sensory range is mostly visual and tonal, not tactile or situational.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (variant allegiance reshaping society) but never sharpen into a pressured choice; conflict stays abstract. No meaningful tightening or loss forces new tactics; escalation is summarized as growth and spread. The ending claims success without trade‑off. Without a concrete test of commitment, tension remains flat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Themes of hope/change and “ancient shadows → new dawn” are asserted rather than earned through particulars. Subtext is minimal; the piece often explains the message (“the people began to see the world in a new light”). The final paragraphs verge on moral summary. Without ambiguity or counterpressure, resonance is thin.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single, consistent lyrical register with occasional image freshness (“gritty whimsy,” “cobalt glass portico”). The distance is stable, but the voice leans generic and declarative, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. Repetitive stems (“the visionary…”) flatten rhythm. Still, the stance holds coherently to the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops and summary repetition (“the visionary knew,” “as the days passed,” “the prophet’s message”) slow momentum. Figurative diction is safe and sometimes vague, with stacked abstractions and few vivid particulars. Sentences often do one job and repeat content across adjacent lines. Line-level variety and compression are limited.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The radio-frequency mosaic and “variant allegiance” hint at originality, but execution stays broad and axiomatic. The prophet/visionary frame is familiar and risk-averse, with no surprising turn or cost. The final reweighting is expected rather than inevitable. Some image choices feel fresh but not transformative.</comment>
