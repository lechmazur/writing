<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (retrieve the codex, honor the unremembered), but interiority stays summarized and largely unconflicted. The “claustrophobic spelunker” tension is named without acting on the page to complicate choices. Her competence erases struggle; she meets no true resistance beyond the tide. The closing peace reads tidy rather than earned from a difficult internal trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/goal), and the causal chain holds: find codex → tide turns → return via cables. Closure lands with her surfacing and keeping the codex, but the cost is thin and largely asserted. The logbook/phase‑transition discovery is functional but resolves quickly without on‑page complications. The lens reads primarily causal with light accumulative texture in the “crashing hush.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vivid, economical images—steel walls “covered in anemones and coral,” the hum/crashing hush—establish atmosphere and place. Environment mildly constrains choices (tidal window, cable path), though few tactile obstacles act in scene. The logbook, devices, and secure chamber integrate setting with action. World rules (phase transitions via cables) are sketched cleanly enough for this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (retrieve and get out before the tide) is legible, but escalation is modest and largely timed rather than contested. The tide change provides the single tightening, yet Lyra encounters no setback or hard trade‑off. Return through cables works as a climax image more than a pressured decision with visible price. The resolution leans on competence and timing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, stewardship, and communion with “invisible things” are present, with the “crashing hush” motif tying concept to feeling. However, several thematic statements are told outright (“to stand by the unremembered”) rather than earned through friction. The ending’s peace is pleasant but risks sentimentality without a palpable loss or moral cost. Subtext lingers lightly but lacks a reweighting surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third‑person limited is steady and coherent; diction remains consistent and readable. Occasional lyric phrasing (“crashing hush”) adds texture without muddling clarity. Absence of dialogue avoids pitfalls but also limits dynamic modulation of voice. The narrative stance sometimes explains rather than lets perception do the work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clean, mostly concise lines carry momentum; sensory choices are apt. Some summary repetition (“determined to uncover its secrets,” reiterated motivations) and tell‑leaning scaffolds flatten peak beats. Figurative language stays controlled, though a few phrases recur without new charge. Final image is clear but not linguistically sharpened to elevate cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—spelunker in a drowned lab, cables as phase‑pathways, gold fleck illuminant—is fresh and cohesive. Execution remains safe: few risky structural or ethical turns, and obstacles are minimal. Still, the conceptual frame feels personal enough to stand out. A bolder price or twist on the phase‑travel would lift ingenuity.</comment>
