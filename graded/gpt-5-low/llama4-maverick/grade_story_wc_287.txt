<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gardener’s motive—tending and “reflecting light”—is consistent and embodied in pruning the rosebush, accepting cycles with a gentle cost. Interiority is steady but low‑friction; contradictory impulses are faint (nostalgia versus pragmatism). The lockmaster token hints at depth but doesn’t drive a pressured choice. The final stance feels earned but modest in intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images accrete toward a dawn‑closure (RR) where renewed purpose is affirmed. Orientation is clear early (harbor, fire escape, rosebush) and the scene holds unity. Closure lands softly; cost is implied (letting go of bloom, accepting cycles) rather than sharply felt. No causal missteps, but the decisive turn is subtle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: moonlit harbor, fire escape, boat rhythms—details filter through the gardener’s purpose. The environment influences mood and cadence more than tactics, yet the urban micro‑garden feels lived‑in. The lockmaster’s tooth adds object specificity but doesn’t constrain action. Atmosphere is cohesive and supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate: accept the rosebush’s cycle and instill purpose in tending the city’s “dark corners.” Pressure escalates minimally (hush → calm → dawn); the main tightening is the petal’s fall prompting pruning and renewed resolve. Costs remain abstract; no option is starkly foreclosed beyond seasonal acceptance. Quiet endurance resolves the piece credibly but gently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Resonances among flower/boat/tooth are evocative, and the final image reframes care as guardianship. However, theme is sometimes stated rather than earned (“goal… to reflect light into the dark corners”), damping subtext. The lockmaster parallel invites subtext but isn’t tested in scene. The aftereffect is tender but not surprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held voice with clean stance and steady rhythm. Repetitions (“quivering hush,” “rhythm of oars”) act as leitmotifs without confusion. No head‑hopping or register slips, and emotional texture matches the quiet stakes. Modulation is gentle rather than sharply dynamic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line craft is polished, with strong image economy and few mechanical issues. Some paraphrase/reiteration slightly slows momentum and skirts purple (“weaving a spell of protected vulnerability”). Overall clarity holds and sentences carry multiple jobs. The final cadence is clean if a bit plush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The “fire escape gardener” and “lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth” synthesis feels fresh and memorable. The boat’s rhythm as method of attention adds a nice, non‑obvious layer. Risk is modest but coherent; the piece commits to a quiet, accumulative design. The novelty rests in juxtaposition more than in a transformative turn.</comment>
