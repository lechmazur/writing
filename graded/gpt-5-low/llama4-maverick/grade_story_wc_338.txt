<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and method are clear, but interior contradiction and embodied cost are thin; she shivers, focuses, and feels reverence without confronting a real dilemma. Her “shielded openness” is named more than dramatized. Micro‑choices (e.g., how she risks belief versus skepticism) remain summarized rather than staged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: observation → pattern recognition → reverent repricing. Closure is a quiet RR/CR—she reframes the henge and herself—but cost is soft and largely asserted (“protecting herself from potential revelations”) rather than felt in a concrete trade‑off. Orientation is clean and the single scene holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and consistent (rain, mold, fresco vault, stone roof), filtered through a cartographer’s sensibility. However, environment rarely constrains tactics beyond mood; the rain and vault don’t alter choices. Strong textural work, limited functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover the henge’s secrets) remains mostly declarative; escalation is modest when the footage “begins to yield,” but no option is foreclosed and no price is paid. The piece sustains tone rather than tightening pressure. Resolution stems from recognition without a consequential turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Listening to silence, empathy, and reassembly of the “torn map” cohere and the final image reweights prior motifs. Repetitions (“whispered chapel,” “silence”) drift toward stated theme rather than subtextual accrual. Resonance lands, but borders on platitude in the last third.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stable close third with a measured, lyrical cadence suits the contemplative mode. Diction is consistent with a meticulous observer, though some generic formulations flatten texture. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; rhythm is even if somewhat uniform.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clean sentences and few errors, but paraphrase loops and abstract phrasing (“more than met the eye,” “secrets hidden in plain sight”) dilute intensity. Information density could tighten, and metaphor stacks repeat without new angles. Momentum is steady but not propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The map framer + silent video method + henge/whispered chapel is a fresh synthesis, though the arc is familiar (skeptic to reverent listener). Ingenuity shows in the occupational lens, but the piece avoids risk at the turn. The ending’s wonder feels earned but unsurprising.</comment>
