<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Ava’s motives are clear but largely told as labels (“culture shock absorber,” “orderly intuitive”) with little embodied interiority or contradictory impulse on the page. Her risk is asserted but not dramatized through specific choices that cost her. The most concrete action—encoding graffiti—reveals competence but not a pressured internal conflict. The arc resolves into communal readiness without testing Ava’s limits in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens fits: messages proliferate, unity accrues, the deadline looms. Closure lands as Charged Poise—residents stand ready as privatization nears—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Causality is clean (graffiti → spread → unity), though beats are summarized rather than dramatized. The foundation chip’s reprise at the end provides a coherent closing image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The raft city/carnival vibe is sketched vividly up front and returns via the chip and stalls, but it rarely constrains tactics beyond backdrop. Sensory detail is mostly visual and atmospheric; specificity fades into generalities as the piece leans on abstraction. The foundation stone chip does charge the final image. World rules remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes (gentrification vs. community) are clear, and urgency increases as the deadline approaches. However, escalation is summary-heavy with no on-page tightening that forecloses a live option or exacts a visible price. Authorities are mentioned but never pressure a scene; success accrues without reversals. The final readiness lacks a concrete trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Themes of communal resilience and anti-privatization are coherent but overexplained (“spirit that could not be bought or sold”). Subtext is light; symbolism around the foundation chip works yet remains declared rather than earned through scene. The ending’s hopefulness resonates, but sentiment skirts didacticism. Complexity and counter-pressure are underplayed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person distance is steady and legible; diction is clean but generic. Phrases like “redevelopment”/“modernization” in quotes do some tonal work but slide toward corporate register without a sharpened POV. Rhythm is competent, if uniform. Lack of dialogue limits texture and subtextual play.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear but repetitive, with paraphrase loops (“As the graffiti spread…,” “As the threat… drew closer”) and summary scaffolding. Limited variance in syntax and a reliance on abstract nouns dull momentum. Few lines do double duty with image and implication. No major grammatical faults, but density is low.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival and “culture shock absorber” profession are fresh, as is the graffiti-as-organizing method. Execution remains safe and expository, muting the ingenuity of the premise. The foundation chip motif gives a distinct touch, but the piece stops short of a surprising turn or non-obvious moral calculus. Overall, moderately original concept, conventional delivery.</comment>
