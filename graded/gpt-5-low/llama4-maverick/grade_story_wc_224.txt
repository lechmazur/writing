<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (find the stone; understand “the shape of home”), and key choices—touching the stone and deciding to seed a new reality—align. Interiority is lyrical but generalized; contradictory impulses (sorrow vs. purpose) appear, yet remain lightly tested. Embodied emotion is present in touches and textures, though stakes remain abstract. The final stance feels more serene than earned by struggle, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → vision → seeding → reconfigured space. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (bookstore becomes threshold) but the cost is conceptual and faint. Orientation is clean and the scene is continuous. A sharper, legible price at the end would raise the structural impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain‑scale labyrinth bookstore is vividly rendered and pervades the mood. Details are sensory and purposeful (parchment smell, vaulted shadows), with the stone and feather integrated. However, the space rarely constrains tactics beyond “wandering,” so its influence on decision-making is modest. Atmosphere excels; functional pressure is lighter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the stone to unlock truth/seed reality) is signaled early, but pressure is gentle and largely unopposed. The main tightening is the vision catalyzing the choice to seed a new reality. Consequences and costs remain abstract; no option is compellingly foreclosed. Tension hums but never bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Transformation, memory’s pain, and “home” cohere thematically, culminating in the bookstore-as-threshold image. The “buried talents” idea motivates but doesn’t complexly refract through conflict. Occasional telling (“For her, home was…”) blunts subtext. The final “hidden thunder” resonates, though the moral calculus remains soft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled third-person lyrical voice with steady diction and cadence. Sensory focus (touch, texture) creates a distinct perceptual signature. Minor purple flourish and repetition creep in but do not break legibility. The modulation at the end is measured and in tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is fluent but over-saturated with modifiers and abstractions, risking purple prose and slowing momentum. Some paraphrase/idea loops (e.g., repeating transformation and threshold notions) reduce density. When pressure should crest, metaphoric stacking diffuses force. Clarity survives, but propulsion is dampened.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The mercury‑glass seer, mountain bookstore, and feather-as-method are appealingly specific. The core moves are familiar mystic-quest tropes, refreshed by tactile emphasis. The closure image is pleasing but not surprising. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, yielding a memorable mood more than a novel turn.</comment>
