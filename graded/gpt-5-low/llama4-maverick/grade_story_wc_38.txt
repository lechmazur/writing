<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria’s motive—escape via decoding—reads clear and consistent, with the dice and journal revealing character. Interiority is present but skews declarative (“encrypt her vulnerability as strength”), limiting contradictory impulses under pressure. The dance impulse offers texture but rarely forces a trade‑off or mistake. The closing choice to leave feels earned but low on embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean (who, where, dominant stake), and closure lands with her encoded final message and literal exit (a modest Decisive Change). The because/therefore chain is thin; the spider‑web “clock” and dice patterning deepen cadence rather than tighten options. Cost is implied (time, isolation) but not sharply priced on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken lab’s salt, rust, and rot create a persuasive atmosphere; the spider web and dice recur to charge the final image. The setting functions primarily as prison and mood rather than a tactical constraint. Sensory specificity is steady and filtered through Aria’s intent. The final shimmer of the web reweights prior images effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape) is signaled early, but pressure escalates gently through motifs rather than concrete obstacles. The spider’s web suggests a clock without forcing on‑page trade‑offs. The decisive act (encoding then exiting) faces little immediate resistance. Stakes feel more conceptual than visceral, limiting turn intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of transformation and calm defiance accrue through dice, web, and coded entries. However, the text sometimes states its thesis (“encrypt her vulnerability as strength”) rather than letting subtext carry it. The final image reaffirms resilience and earned autonomy without moralizing. Resonance lingers, if quietly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lyrical with controlled focalization and stable distance. Patterned diction and refrain‑like motifs fit the accumulative mode. Some lines circle the same idea, softening edge and momentum. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clean mechanics and clarity, but there’s paraphrase and motif reiteration that create mild loops. Figurative density is steady and occasionally repetitive without new information. Rhythm is serviceable, with limited syntactic variation. The final beats are clear but not sharply cut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—lyric code breaker, hangman’s dice, spider‑clock—feels fresh and cohesive. Closure through an encoded message and quiet exit is familiar but tasteful. The piece risks a symbolic frame and largely sustains it, though it avoids harder tactical specificity. Memorable images outweigh conventional arc.</comment>
