<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elian’s motive (to blend probability into wonder) is clear, but he faces no real friction; his interiority remains serene and untested. The “lightly attentive” stance never constrains a choice under pressure. The bishop’s weight “as if it held secrets” hints at a deeper conflict but never forces a trade‑off. No visible cost accompanies his final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: imagery layers toward a calm cadence, but the ending is more continuation than reconfiguration. There’s no decisive change or earned stasis; applause and reset to “next act” read as status quo. The bishop’s charged reprise suggests potential, not on‑page cost. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal arcade under stars is vivid and consistent, with sound, light, and salt aroma woven through action. Setting supports tone and mirrors Elian’s preoccupations, though it rarely constrains choices. The bishop functions as a micro‑setting object lightly charging the final image. Strong atmosphere, modest functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (enchant the crowd through “orchestrated serendipity”) never tightens beyond setup. The performance succeeds without complication; no beat forecloses options or exacts a price. “He knew he had successfully harnessed…” softens any tension that might remain. The “between acts” clock never pressures tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Art/science and chance/design are coherent, but theme often arrives as statement rather than arising from conflict. The bishop’s heavier return edges toward a conceptual repricing, yet lacks a cost or reframed choice to resonate. Final lines restate possibility rather than deepen it. Subtext is thin because nothing is risked.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and diction controlled, with a lyrical tilt that suits the piece. However, repetition of set phrases (“orchestrated serendipity,” “lightly attentive”) flattens texture. Rhythm is competent but rarely surprises under peak beats. No dialogue to complicate voice or add subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clean sentences and sensory balance, but paraphrase loops and abstract lexis (“calculated wilderness,” “strategic randomness”) dilute immediacy. Figurative loading is safe rather than incisive; few lines do more than one job. The final third reiterates rather than sharpens, muting closure. Overall clear, seldom propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The math‑as‑magic angle with a bishop talisman is mildly fresh. Yet the execution stays comfortable, with little risk or transformation across beats. The final image promises possibilities without a non‑obvious turn. Ingenuity is present in premise, underused in structure and consequence.</comment>
