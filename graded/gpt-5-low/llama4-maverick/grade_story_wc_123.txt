<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Curiosity versus caution gives her a credible internal friction, and small micro‑choices (removing the tube, deciding to keep the discovery close) track with “meticulous” and solitary integrity. However, emotions are often summarized rather than embodied, and epiphany (“a sense of clarity washed over her”) arrives with little on‑page struggle. The “credibly curious” phrasing reads label‑like. The final resolve is believable but relatively low cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the pigeon → message → contemplation → decoded threat → charged resolve progression is coherent and oriented early. The decoding is summarized (“by progressing laterally”) rather than dramatized, softening causality and cost. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—she chooses to proceed carefully—with risk implied by being followed and the hidden lab. The lack of an on‑page test limits decisiveness, but the before/after stance is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard is sensorially vivid (rustle, scent, star‑silver) and coheres with her contemplative method. It frames solitude and charges the ending image, with the message tube as a small, recurring object. Still, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics beyond mood and privacy. Strong atmosphere, modest functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are sketched (illicit lab, being watched), but escalation occurs mostly in thought; no turn forces a concrete trade‑off on the page. “After being followed home” adds pressure yet yields no immediate tactical adaptation beyond vigilance. The tightening is primarily a realization leading to future action. Consequently, cost remains abstract.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nature’s calm versus clandestine harm threads through the images and her ethic of “integrity in solitude.” The message tube’s reprise and the night’s “layered tranquility” support a quiet moral stance without overt sermonizing, though one line states theme directly. The final resolve modestly reweights prior material but doesn’t deepen ambiguity or cost. Resonance lingers, if softly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent; the narrative distance suits a reflective, methodical mind. Diction sometimes tilts abstract or awkward (“progressing laterally,” “credibly curious”), nudging against the naturalness of thought. Rhythm is even, with few syntactic risks. No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clean, mostly clear prose with pleasant sensory lines, but redundancy and small errors drag (“poured” for “pored,” repeated “message tube still clutched in her hand”). Several sentences rephrase the same state (tranquility and resolve) without adding pressure. Elevated abstractions occasionally replace concrete action. Momentum softens in the midsection.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>“Storm recorder” as vocation and the pigeon‑borne clue feel fresh, and the quiet, reflective frame is a nice angle on conspiracy. The hidden lab/quarantine premise is familiar and left at inference. The piece plays it safe structurally, leaning on summary instead of dramatized turns. Still, the fusion of vocation, tone, and object offers a mild distinctive signature.</comment>
