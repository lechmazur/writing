<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motive (preserve the temple’s memories) is clear and consistent, but her interiority leans generic and repeats key phrases rather than exposing contradictory impulses under pressure. The brief nod to loved ones left behind offers a flicker of conflict that isn’t developed into choice. Micro-choices are mostly procedural (“unsnarl,” “focus”) rather than value-testing. The cost lands at the end (melancholy at the temple’s silence) but the earning feels light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—she succeeds, but the living whispers are lost, reweighting the premise with felt cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what/why), and the piece holds a single scene with one deepening (to the heart/orifice). Causality is simple but coherent; no teleports or unkept setups. The cost is on the page (“whispers fell silent,” “unsettling stillness”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vivid—salt, decay, blue pulse, labyrinth—filtered through goal-directed movement. The crystal vial functions as micro-setting and charges the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond guiding light; it’s more backdrop than obstacle. Rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (preserve memories before energy dies) and pressure tightens as she reaches the heart and time compresses. Escalation is primarily tonal and rhythmic rather than obstacle-based; there’s little on-page resistance or trade-off until the end’s loss. The final price (silence of the temple) is legible and reconfigures the gain. One meaningful tightening, not a reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Memory versus preservation’s cost resonates through the scent motif and the temple’s hush, culminating in a bittersweet repricing of success. Thematic statements stay mostly in image rather than moralizing. The reprise of the vial’s scent at the end delivers a durable emotional aftereffect. Some phrasing veers toward abstraction, softening the complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and coherent; voice is lyrical with consistent diction and stance. Rhythmic control is serviceable but trends toward uniform cadence and repeated constructions. No head-hopping or unjustified elision. Occasional elevated abstractions (“ephemeral energy,” “gathered hush”) create distance in peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft suffers from repetition and purple lean—phrases like “lonesome splendor,” “gathered hush,” and “as time runs short” recur without adding pressure. Sentences frequently restate content in near-synonym loops; cadence varies little. Imagery is clear but often generalized, diluting propulsion. Clean mechanics prevent deeper penalties.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The perfume vial as memory conduit in an underwater temple is a fresh inflection, and the final conceptual trade (preservation at the price of silence) feels earned. Still, many moves rely on familiar mystical tropes and diction. The piece commits to its premise but avoids bolder, scene-specific risks or surprising turns. Ingenuity is present more in texture than in conflict design.</comment>
