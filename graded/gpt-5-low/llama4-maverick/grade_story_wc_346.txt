<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The adjuster’s motive—guard the fragile balance of time—is clear and consistent, with tactile micro‑choices (minute adjustments, lullaby). However, interior contradiction is thin; “a burden of bruised awe” is asserted more than dramatized under pressure. The puppet head stirs feeling but doesn’t reveal a competing impulse or mistake. Emotional progression is steady rather than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: dusk deepens, work completes, lullaby releases a charged stasis. Orientation is clean (hidden lighthouse, lantern room, single POV) and closure lands with the hush “becoming a living, breathing thing.” Cost is mostly conceptual—weight of responsibility—rather than dramatized loss. The ending reconfigures atmosphere more than options, but it is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse at dusk and the glass pane create a strong, coherent atmosphere that filters perception. The puppet head functions as a recurring object that charges the final image (brought to the lips for the lullaby). While the setting rarely constrains choice, it decisively shapes tone and cadence. Sensory focus remains selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are declared high (time’s balance), but on‑page pressure is gentle and mostly static. Escalation is a soft deepening (daylight dying, hush thickening) rather than a tactical narrowing with cost. The sole meaningful turn is finishing the adjustment and choosing to sing; no option is foreclosed on the page. Tension stays textural rather than conflictual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fragility/beauty and care‑through‑brokenness resonate via the puppet head and “beautifully flawed” refrain. The lullaby across time offers a quiet, non‑literal answer about stewardship. Some lines drift toward thematic telling (“to preserve the beauty…”) instead of letting images carry it. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs with a gentle aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV and stance are stable; diction is lyrically consistent with controlled cadence. The perceptual signature favors hush, pattern, and minute craft, fitting the adjuster’s role. Repetition (“hush,” “fragile,” “balance”) edges toward monotony but does not break voice. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clean syntax and few mechanical errors, but redundancy dulls momentum (multiple near‑duplicate sentences about hush deepening and balance). Figurative language clusters without variation, risking purple overtones. Several paraphrase loops could be cut to tighten impact. Rhythm is pleasant yet uniform, with limited propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The conceit—doomsday clock adjuster in a hidden lighthouse using a broken puppet head and lullaby—is fresh and memorable. The “pane of hush” is an intriguing invention. Execution leans on familiar lyric diction that blunts the distinctiveness somewhat. Still, the synthesis holds together with a singular vibe.</comment>
