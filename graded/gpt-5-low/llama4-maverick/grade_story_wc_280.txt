<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Echo’s desire for an encore and peace is clear, and her actions (touching the coin, weaving echoes) align with that motive. However, interiority remains abstract and summarized, with few concrete micro‑choices under pressure. Emotional contradiction (longing vs. letting go) is implied but not dramatized in a specific beat. The ending’s acceptance reads earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs thicken to a calm reconfiguration as she “repairs” the timeline and attains peace. Orientation is solid early (garden at twilight; Echo; coin), and the single scene holds. Closure is stated rather than embodied—“she had succeeded”—and the felt cost is faint. The pattern holds but lands more as declaration than necessary on‑page turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard/maze glows, rearranges, and breathes; sensory selection is rich and consistent with Echo’s perception. The coin functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image. Still, the environment seldom constrains choice beyond symbolic path‑forming, so pressure from setting remains light. Vivid atmosphere carries the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reweaving a fractured timeline to find peace—is clear, but escalation is gentle and mostly tonal (echoes grow, garden shifts). There’s no significant narrowing of options or visible price beyond nostalgia’s weight. The “tightening” is a density swell rather than a pressured turn. Resolution arrives without a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes of nostalgia, redemption, and possibility accrue through repeated images (echoes, coin, garden). Final paragraphs tip into moralizing—“reminder of the power of nostalgia”—dulling subtext. The ending answers the question (peace vs. haunting) but with limited ambivalence or cost. Resonance lingers more by motif than by earned reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical third‑person with a gentle, elegiac rhythm suits the material. Diction is coherent and confident, with no POV leakage. Repetitive constructions and abstractions (“seemed,” “as if”) blunt sharpness in peak beats. Still, the perceptual signature (synesthetic glow) is steady and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lines are clean and mostly grammatical, but purple tendencies and synonym loops (“as if,” “seemed,” “the garden…”) recur. Several sentences restate outcome rather than showing it, reducing momentum. Rhythm leans uniform with many “As…” or cumulative clauses. The final image lands but is dulled by prior redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blend of stage ghost, hedge‑maze orchard, and tarot coin offers a fresh palette. Execution leans on familiar lyric moves and generalized mysticism, with unclear mechanics for the “fractured timeline.” The central conceit is attractive but plays safe, avoiding a surprising or costly turn. Memorable images, moderate risk.</comment>
