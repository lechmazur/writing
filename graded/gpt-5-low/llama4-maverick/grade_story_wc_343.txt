<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli’s curiosity and apprentice mindset motivate concrete actions (coaxing the light, decoding the hopscotch, mapping), and the choice to keep the discovery secret adds a minor complication. Interiority is present through tactile focuses (scratch of pen, glow) but contradictory impulses are light and never truly test their values. Emotional embodiment is steady if somewhat safe. The final readiness reads earned but cost (fatigue, secrecy) is modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece holds as a single accumulative scene: discovery → code → map → charged readiness at sunrise. Causality is gentle but coherent (noticing the luminance after turning the phrasebook page, then decoding the hopscotch patterns, then charting). Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Eli is ready to set course, with secrecy and spent night as price. The cost is felt but small, keeping this shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The antique airship, etched hopscotch board, charts, and starlings are vivid, filtered through Eli’s cartographic focus. The board materially shapes choice by supplying the code; the logbook and table embody the work. Atmosphere coheres and charges the final image of sunrise readiness onboard this “tiny, isolated community.” World rules stay consistent and integrated through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes (to make a discovery/map a hidden location) are clear and deepen via decoding and the luminance brightening in response. Pressure escalates in knowledge, not risk; no option is forcibly foreclosed beyond sleep and disclosure to crew. The secrecy and all-night labor provide a small, credible price. The ending resolves to intention, not a hard turn, so tension remains restrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: curiosity and solitude within a communal vessel, the ethics of withholding discovery, and the intimacy of attention creating connection. Recurring images (pen scratch, starlings’ murmuration, luminance) gather resonance without overt moralizing. The final readiness reweights the motif of “sociable isolation.” Depth is felt but not piercingly complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with a consistent lyric texture suited to Eli’s meticulous noticing. Cadence and diction are controlled, though there’s some repeated “As…” openings that create a mild drumbeat. No dialogue appears, appropriately avoiding false dramatics. Overall voice is coherent and character-filtered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are clean and sensorily specific, with purposeful repetition of motifs. Some scaffold and cadence loops (“As…” sentence starters; repeated “the scratch of their pen”) slightly dull propulsion. Figurative language remains legible; no muddled metaphors. Information density is decent, though a few sentences restate mood without adding pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Airship cartography + stranded luminance + hopscotch-code is a fresh synthesis that feels organically imagined. The piece risks a quiet, accumulative structure and mostly earns it. While the arc isn’t radical, the particulars (polyglot phrasebook, board aligning with constellations) feel distinct. The closure image is non-obvious yet fitting.</comment>
