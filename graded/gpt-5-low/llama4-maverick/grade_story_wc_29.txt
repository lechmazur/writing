<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s goal is clear and consistent, but she faces little credible resistance and shows almost no contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority leans on labels (“cautiously hopeful,” “sense of purpose”) rather than embodied, character‑specific struggle. Her decisive act (sending a counter‑signal) comes without visible cost or moral friction. The colleagues register as scenery rather than pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The sequence (tune → detect pattern → counter‑signal → disturbances fade) is clear, but the closure lacks an on‑page cost and resolves immediately, failing the cost‑proof test. The “cosmic tricksters” remain offstage, so opposition never becomes concrete. Orientation is solid; the structure is a single clean scene with a tidy, low‑friction win.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The radio station has a few tactile touches (console glow, static, dials), and the charts recur, building atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics beyond providing generic equipment. Sensory detail favors abstraction over specificity, with limited use of non‑visual senses besides “hiss” and “hum.” The setting supports tone more than choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (community disturbances), but pressure doesn’t tighten; there’s no complication or trade‑off before success. The decisive move meets no counterforce and forecloses no meaningful path. Without a felt price or credible escalation, tension remains low. The win reads procedural rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Themes of balance, harmony, and agency against “cosmic tricksters” are stated rather than emerging through subtext. The closing moral affirmations (“true calling,” “restore balance”) flatten ambiguity. No image reweights earlier material with cost; resonance relies on aspiration instead of dramatic payoff. The motifs (charts, frequencies) don’t deepen into thematic complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and modest, but diction is generic and repetitive, with many sentences starting “As she…” or leaning on abstract intensifiers. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to Lyra’s expertise beyond broad labels. Rhythm is uniform, muting pressure. No dialogue to diversify texture or reveal subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold (“she felt,” “sense of,” “as”) that dilute momentum. Abstract phrasing and stock formulations (“restore balance,” “electric with possibility”) crowd out concrete action. The climactic beat is summarized rather than dramatized, dulling impact. Syntax and openings repeat, producing drumbeat monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The radio‑astronomy premise has promise, but the execution leans on familiar beats (instant deciphering, effortless counter‑signal) and generic language. The “cosmic trickster” antagonist remains a vague trope. There’s little risk‑taking in structure or stance, and no surprising reweighting at the end. Freshness peeks through in the subsonic focus but isn’t meaningfully exploited.</comment>
