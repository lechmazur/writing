<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear motive (to witness without judgment) and one decisive act (setting aside the quill to burrow) give minimal arc, but internal contradiction is lightly dramatized rather than embodied. “Grips reality loosely” is asserted more than tested, yielding low-tension choices. Emotional texture skews declarative and detached, muting cost. The endurance at the end reads, but the price (losing the above-world tie) is mostly told.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: contemplation → burrowing → earned stasis as guardian. Orientation is clean early; one meaningful tightening occurs as the connection to the surface thins. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, though the cost is soft-focus. The structure is cohesive but lacks a sharper cadence shift to heighten the final reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and sustained: damp earth, aged parchment, crystals, and the “obsidian refuge” create a cohesive, tactile world. Details are filtered through the keeper’s bias toward quiet and decay. The environment nudges action (burrowing, absorption into catacombs) without overtly constraining a hard choice. Strong tone synergy, if a touch reiterative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal—seeking regenerative silence versus the duty to witness—yet escalation is modest and largely descriptive. The turn to burrow narrows options, but tension is low and consequences feel gentle. No antagonistic pressure or loss forces a tradeoff beyond abstraction. The final endurance registers but without a clear, felt price on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silence as balm, beauty in decay, and purpose through stillness emerge organically via recurring images (origami swan, obsidian refuge, seasons). The ending’s stasis answers the thematic question with a quiet acceptance. Some thematic lines are stated outright, dulling subtext. Nonetheless, resonance lingers through image more than moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent, lyric third-person with controlled diction and a distinct meditative cadence. No dialogue to test, but the narrative distance matches the piece’s aims. Occasional repetition flattens rhythm, yet voice remains coherent and character-specific. Elision is purposeful and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clean syntax and evocative phrasing, but paraphrase loops and near-duplicate sentiments recur (“across the drift of untold seasons,” “crumbling peace,” “regenerative silence”). Information density dips as lines restate mood rather than advance pressure. Imagery is clear without metaphor muddle, yet momentum drags. Final third repeats motifs, dulling the closure image’s impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The origami-swan divination and “regenerative silence” inflect a fresh metaphysic within a classic subterranean archive. The choice to burrow into silence as vocation reframes witnesshood intriguingly. Still, the overall arc hews to familiar lyric stasis, avoiding bolder structural risk or sharper costs. The synthesis feels coherent and particular, if not singular.</comment>
