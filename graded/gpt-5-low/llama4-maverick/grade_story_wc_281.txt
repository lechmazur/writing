<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Luna’s drive—to replace recalled telepathy pills with a somatic/geode method—reads consistent and particular, with a credible pull between fascination and intimidation. Embodied cues (tingling skin, scents, dancing with light sources) root her interiority. However, conflict is gentle and largely unopposed, yielding few pressured micro‑choices. The final stance feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and pattern build from meditation to kinetic light painting to a dawn image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the recall reframed as catalyst, the painting as proof. Cost is implied (risk, psychic exposure, exhaustion) rather than concretely tested, keeping the ending quiet. Orientation is clear early (studio, geode, recall), and the single scene coherence is intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The studio is vivid and functional: linseed oil, turpentine, light sources, and static charge shape action and perception. The geode operates as object‑as‑setting, inflecting choices and charging the final image. Spatial and sensory throughlines stay consistent and POV‑filtered. While not deeply constraining, the environment palpably steers process and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking a safer, personal conduit to the collective unconscious) is clear, and the static shock provides a meaningful tightening beat. Yet pressure remains low, with minimal narrowing of options or visible trade‑offs. The path forward isn’t contested; Luna’s commitment is affirmed rather than tested. Escalation is tonal and textural more than stakes‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: art/science fusion, embodied intuition over pharmacology, and a fragile “willowglass” hope that reframes setback as opening. The geode’s recurrence anchors meaning without heavy symbolism. Some lines slip into telling (“Her motivation was clear”) which blunts subtext. Still, the dawn image and charged poise offer a modest, resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is steady, diction consistent, and the perceptual signature (sensorial, process‑minded) feels character‑bound. Rhythms suit a lyric‑accumulative mode. Occasional abstraction and repeated phrasing (“muscovite geode sliver”) flatten texture slightly. No dialogue is needed, and the stance remains legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful images (scented air, tingling skin) and workable cadence. Redundancies and on‑the‑nose scaffolding (“Her motivation was clear”) slow momentum. Repetition of key nouns without variation and some generalized abstractions create mild density bloat. The final sentence lands, though the lead‑up could be tighter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Conceptual blend—light painting, somatic markers, a muscovite shard as conduit post‑recall—feels fresh and coherent. The risk is aesthetic rather than structural, but it pays off in a particularized final image. Stakes remain modest, limiting transformative impact. Still, the synthesis reads memorable and not template‑driven.</comment>
