<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to “preserve the weight of unspoken words” is clear and drives the choice to open and then close the box, but contradictory impulses are faint beyond generic sorrow and trembling. Interiority leans on repeated gaze/tears rather than distinct, character‑particular thinking. The visible cost lands as endurance (sleeplessness, heaviness) rather than a sharpened trade‑off. Still, the micro‑choices around the box read consistent and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density grows from approach → opening → reading → closure with a charged final image. Closure registers as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when the recluse closes the box and accepts the burden. Cost is emotional and conceptual, not tactical, but it does land on the page. Escalation is modest; the “tangled covenant” remains background and never alters options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The oasis/beekeeping ruins and stained glass box are vivid and consistently filtered through the recluse’s perception. Sensory choices (ash, grime, hum, honeycomb) suit tone and charge the final image of the glowing box. World rules (ghosts visible) are stable and integrated without exposition dumps. Setting rarely constrains action beyond mood, keeping it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safeguard memory) is legible, but pressure remains gentle; the ghosts’ stirring adds atmosphere more than force. The meaningful tightening is the act of opening the box and becoming conduit, then re‑sealing it, but no option is truly foreclosed beyond internal burden. Stakes are felt in sorrow, not in hard choices or reversals. The “covenant” does not surface as a live pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Remembrance versus desolation coheres through bees/letters/ghosts, culminating in a quiet guardianship. The stained glass box functions as a returning image whose glow reweights the premise. Some lines nudge toward abstraction (“tangled covenant,” “power of remembrance”) without on‑page complication, tempering depth. The ending’s resonance is earned if subdued.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is steady and appropriate; focalization stays consistent. Diction occasionally lapses into repetitive stems (“The recluse’s gaze…”) and elevated abstraction. Rhythm mostly supports mood but lacks modulation at peak beats. No dialogue to test; narrative certainty remains within what the recluse perceives.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and readable, but paraphrase loops and template stems recur (“The recluse…,” “their gaze…,” “the box…”), dulling momentum. Figurative density stays manageable, yet some phrasing leans purple or generic. Information density could tighten by pruning near‑duplicates. The final cadence lands, though sentence variety could better charge it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ghostly wasteland + beekeeping archive + stained glass reliquary offers a fresh synthesis. The guardianship ending avoids moralizing and fits the premise. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; the “tangled covenant” remains underused, limiting singularity. Still, the image system feels personal and memorable.</comment>
