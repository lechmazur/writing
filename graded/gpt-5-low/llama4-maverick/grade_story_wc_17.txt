<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (to decode the estate’s secrets) but little embodied struggle or contradictory impulse on the page. Interiority is generalized rather than character-particular, with minimal micro-choices under pressure. The “sensitively perceptive” trait is told more than dramatized. The closing acceptance reads as an earned stance shift but without visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is evident, with a gentle pattern of discovery (film → diaries → mapping) culminating in a conceptual repricing: the cartographer becomes part of the legacy. However, the beats are summarized rather than dramatized, and the cost at closure is faint. Causality exists but is soft, with “and then” sequencing rather than tightening turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere is steady and pleasingly gothic (ivy-veiled passage, crumbling plaster, cold hearth). Yet the environment rarely constrains behavior or tactics; it’s largely backdrop. Recurring objects (film, diaries) color the mood but do not press choices. Sensory range leans visual; integration into action is limited.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract (“legacy’s burden,” “what walls dream about”) with no pressured test or narrowing of options. The “glimpse” and diary finds don’t produce a consequential choice or loss. The ending offers a stance, not a price. As a result, escalation is minimal and tension flatlines.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, memory, and stewardship are coherent but over-articulated (“The legacy’s burden… was not just a weight to be carried, but a story to be told”). The resonance is asserted rather than earned through concrete conflict. Some lyrical images carry feeling, but final-paragraph moralizing blunts subtext. The walls’ “dreams” remain conceptual more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent; the voice is gently lyrical and unified. Repetition patterns create cadence but also sameness, with limited modulation at peak beats. Distance control is steady, if a bit summary-heavy. No dialogue means the voice must carry more weight than it does.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Noticeable paraphrase loops and template phrases (“It was said…,” “The estate, it seemed…”) reduce momentum and density. Figurative language is safe rather than fresh; several sentences restate prior content without adding pressure. Syntax and rhythm remain uniform, dulling propulsion. Line-level economy could be sharply improved.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>“Corridor echo cartographer” and the film-negative motif offer a fresh inflection on haunted-estate tropes. The diaries and climate-shift backdrop are familiar, used competently but not transformed into surprising turns. The final reweighting is conceptually neat but not startling. Overall, modest originality with unrealized potential.</comment>
