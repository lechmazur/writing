<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Aria’s motive—to “cradle empathy in arms of steel” and reclaim the plaza—reads clear, but her interiority leans declarative over dramatized conflict. The retrocognitive memory adds texture yet doesn’t force a contradictory impulse or a costly compromise. Micro‑choices (excavating the tessera, choosing to rename) reveal character but face little active resistance. The “gentle radical” identity is stated more than tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the sequence (find tessera → memory → naming act) coheres and closes in a conceptual repricing of the plaza. Orientation is clean and the single scene holds. The closure—renaming with a declaration—lands on the page, though cost is low and largely conceptual. Tightening is modest but present via the vision prompting the decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The “ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky” and charred stalls create a vivid, consistent atmosphere with tactile details (cracked pavement, chipped mosaics). The tessera functions as a charged object within the setting, returning at the end. While the environment shapes tone and memory, it rarely constrains action beyond mood and discovery. Strong specificity without becoming a postcard tour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stakes center on reclaiming meaning from devastation, but pressure escalates gently rather than through a narrowing field of options. The key turn is the choice to rename, driven by the vision and mission; opposition is ambient rather than active. Cost remains conceptual (commitment to a new narrative) rather than felt loss or risk. The piece earns a cadence shift, not a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rebirth and “aberrant mercy” are thematically coherent, yet the text often states its thesis (“The act of renaming was not simply…”, “a testament to the transformative power…”) instead of letting images bear the weight. The final paragraphs tilt into moralizing, dulling subtext. The tessera and renaming could carry resonance if more was left unsaid. Emotional aftereffect persists but feels guided rather than earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A stable, lyric third‑person POV with consistent diction and measured cadence suits the meditative mode. The perceptual signature (attention to mosaics, ash, echo) is coherent if somewhat generic-lyric. No head‑hopping or stance slips occur. Recurrent phrasing (“As she…”, “her footsteps echoed…”) flattens rhythm at points.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft shows fluency but slides into redundancy and purple abstractions (“warm coldness,” “beacon of warmth,” restated hope), with paraphrase loops across adjacent lines. Figurative density is high without always advancing the moment, and several sentences state what the image already implies. Momentum softens in the final third due to explanatory moralizing. Clean mechanics, but tighter compression and specificity would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The naming-as-reclamation frame amid ruins has a fresh inflection via the tessera and “aberrant mercy,” though the execution hews to familiar post‑catastrophe hope tropes. The retrocognitive trigger adds a small, original hinge. Risks are modest and controlled rather than bold. The piece feels sincere, with glimpses of distinctiveness that don’t fully transform the template.</comment>
