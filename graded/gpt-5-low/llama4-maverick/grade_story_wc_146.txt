<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tuner’s motive—restore balance—is clear and aligned with action, but interiority stays archetypal and conflict‑light. There’s little contradictory impulse or costed choice beyond patient endurance. The piece favors ritual over psychology, leaving character change minimal. The endurance through the night hints at cost but doesn’t foreground a pressured decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: footsteps and vibration build toward a dawn reweighting where the town faintly responds. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the ritual pattern teaches itself. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise, but the cost is soft and largely inferred (time, stamina), limiting impact. The single‑scene flow is coherent without causal turns beyond intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful—cobblestones, twilight, and the humming fork work as a tactile micro‑setting. Sensory detail supports the premise and sustains tone without world‑tour excess. The ebony fork meaningfully charges the final image, though the archway frames rather than constrains choice. Environmental pressure is evocative but not tactically determinative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes (revival) remain abstract, and escalation is modest: rhythm grows, the town quivers, dawn resumes. The key tightening is the sensed stirring, which deepens the pattern but doesn’t force a trade‑off or foreclose options. The endurance agency is present but low‑pressure. Cost is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Harmony/balance and the power of sound arise organically from the ritual, with a credible final reweighting at dawn. However, thematic statements (“The tuner’s motivation… to restore a shared balance”) tilt toward telling. The resonance is gentle and coherent but avoids friction or counter‑pressure that could complicate meaning. The ending answers quietly without a sharp reframe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent, third‑person lyric voice with controlled cadence and image patterns. Repetition supports the ritual feel, though some lines echo concept without adding pressure. Diction is steady and apt for the mode. No POV leakage or unearned certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clean sentences and a steady cadence, but there’s paraphrase/reiteration (“The rhythm…,” “The pattern…”) that loops without new pressure. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, though some abstractions dilute impact. Information density is fair; a leaner pass could tighten momentum. Final image is clear despite minor redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—tuning a town back to life via footsteps and a fork—is fresh and committed. The accumulative ritual feels singular rather than templated. Risk level is moderate: concept-forward with safe emotional stakes. Stronger on-page cost or a bolder pressure point would elevate ingenuity toward inevitability.</comment>
