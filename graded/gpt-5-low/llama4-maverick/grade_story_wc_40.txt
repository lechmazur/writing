<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scholar’s reticence versus duty is credible and embodied (ink‑stained fingers, red‑rimmed eyes), and the micro‑choice to rise and go lands with felt cost. Interiority is specific enough to avoid stock abstraction. The visitor applies direct pressure, sharpening the ambivalence. The ultimate resolve is earned but remains quiet, with limited contradiction under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, one scene with a clean transition outside; causality is coherent: footsteps → summons → decision to testify. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: leaving isolation to risk unraveling research. Cost is on the page (exposing fragile patterns), though still mostly conceptual. The inferred lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative, held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: shadowed stacks, grimy windows, morning damp, and the crystal recur and charge the final image. The “hush” and acoustics evolve (crystal’s click) to mirror internal shifts. While the setting doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, it meaningfully frames the stakes and cadence. Specific, selective detail stays POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect work vs testify—is clear, with a single tightening when the visitor arrives. The click and retrieval of the crystal function as a small reversal, breaking the hush and committing the scholar to movement. Escalation remains modest; the cost is implied rather than tested on the page. Still, the decision forecloses the safety of isolation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of silence, knowledge, and emergence accrue through image (suspended hush → disrupted → possibility). The crystal’s reprise subtly reweights meaning. A slightly declarative line (“The world, it seemed, was ready to listen”) edges toward moralizing but doesn’t overwhelm the subtext. The final cadence resonates without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical texture; diction matches the contemplative scholar. Rhythm modulates well from stillness to measured resolve. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. A few repeated constructions and elevated terms (“sonically reflective”) brush mannerism but remain coherent to voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with strong sensory economy and minimal scaffolding. A few near‑loops and adjective echoes (silence/hush reiterated; “sonically reflective” repeated) slightly blunt momentum. Syntax varies, and images carry multiple jobs. The final image is clear and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The “after the last dictionary” world and the chandelier crystal as acoustic talisman feel fresh. The summons‑to‑testify frame gives a distinctive tilt to a library vignette. While not radical, the synthesis is specific and cohesive. The risk remains more tonal than structural, keeping it short of standout originality.</comment>
