<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clear desire and vocation shift (revolutionary to chronicler) are legible, with small micro-choices (retrieving the shard, working through the storm). Internal conflict is muted; “burnished sorrow” is declared more than dramatized, and contradictory impulses rarely operate simultaneously. The final renunciation of the fighter identity reads, but its cost is conceptual rather than felt in a pressured moment. Overall motivated, but low struggle on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: motif density builds (shard, storm, covered mirrors, time’s shimmer), closing in an RR where she claims a new role. Closure lands with a before/after—she is “reborn” as chronicler—yet the cost is mostly stated sorrow, not pressed by a decisive on‑page beat. Orientation is clear; sceneing is continuous. The shard’s promise provides light causality, but escalation remains gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and visible time create a distinct atmosphere; details like flickering lights, galleries, and the shard integrate with the voice. Environment seldom constrains tactics beyond covering mirrors, so pressure from place stays light. Still, the setting inflects perception and charges the final image with the shard-as-talisman. Specificity is selective and coherent to the POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the asteroid’s truth/reimagining a civilization—is clear, but on‑page pressure barely tightens. The storm and “time made visible” promise risk, yet no turn forecloses options or extracts a clear price beyond mood. The meaningful shift is internal and reflective; the shard’s “secrets yielding” happens off‑pressure. Tension simmers rather than escalates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Themes of ritual in uncertainty, identity remade through attention, and history’s partial recoverability emerge via recurring images. However, the ending leans on explicit thesis statements (“in the end… not just the civilization… but herself”), sliding toward moralizing and reducing resonance. Subtext exists (mirrors, shard, storm), but overt summarizing blunts it. The final image is evocative, if somewhat told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person with consistent distance and diction; the perceptual signature (poet‑archaeologist) is coherent. No head‑hopping or stance slips; rhythm varies enough to sustain the mode. Occasionally abstract formulations flatten immediacy, but not fatally. The voice carries the atmosphere even when conflict thins.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clean sentences and controlled rhythm with some strong images (“time… a mantle,” shard as talisman). Minor redundancy (“burnished sorrow,” “words flowing like a river”) and a few summarizing lines dampen momentum. Figurative language stays legible; no major mixed metaphors. Overall polished, if slightly over-declared in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, visible time, and ritual of covered mirrors feel fresh and synthesized into a distinctive mood. The arc (activist-to-archaeologist/poet) is less novel and plays safely. Still, the imagery net and conceptual ecology cohere. More risk in dramatized consequence would elevate.</comment>
