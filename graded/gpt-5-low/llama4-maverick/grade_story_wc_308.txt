<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The skimmer’s motive—learning to “navigate without moving”—is clear and consistent, and its endurance reads as an earned stance. Interiority is present but abstract, with few micro‑choices beyond attention and appraisal. The centuries of waiting register as a cost and align with its temperament. However, embodied contradiction and pressure‑specific reactions remain muted by the meditative mode.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: attention → appraisal → pattern recognition → synchronization of the wandering pulse. Orientation is clean from the start (canyon, bone towers, skimmer, arrowhead) and the motif pattern is taught early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the pulse synchronizes, transforming the frame of stillness into earned navigation. Cost is legible conceptually as centuries of dust and endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon of echoes and bone towers are vivid and sensorial across sight, sound, and vibration, integrated with the skimmer’s method. Environment constrains action (stillness, resonance) and charges the final image of harmonic alignment. The recurring dust and echoes evolve from atmosphere to consequence. Strong specificity without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (mastery through stillness); escalation is a deepening: birds’ patterns unlock the arrowhead’s tale, culminating in pulse‑synchrony. The price is patience/time rather than a sharp turn, but the cadence tightens meaningfully. Lack of a concrete reversal keeps tension soft, yet the reweighting is clear. The skimmer’s agency is attention and appraisal, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Harmony, reverence, and stillness‑as‑movement emerge organically through image chains (echoes, birds, pulse). The ending’s repricing—movement found in stillness—resonates without a stated moral. A few lines tilt toward declarative abstraction (“secrets of the universe”), softening the edge. Overall, the thematic arc coheres and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person voice maintains a stable distance and perceptual signature (vibration, hums, dust). Diction is coherent and suits the meditative frame. Minor rhythmic sameness appears in repeated sentence patterns, but clarity never slips. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Imagery is strong and purposeful, but paraphrase loops and repeated scaffolds (“As the dust continued to fall…”, “a reminder…”) sap momentum. Some abstractions (“secrets of the universe”) blur sharpness at peak beats. Syntax is mostly clean with good sensory density. A trim for repetition would lift line‑level propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer, bone towers, and “navigation without moving” synthesize into a fresh, memorable conceit. Risk‑taking in a quiet, accumulative mode pays off with a distinct final reconfiguration. While a few phrases edge toward the generic, the core images and method (reading birds’ patterns) feel original. The piece commits to its premise without hedging.</comment>
