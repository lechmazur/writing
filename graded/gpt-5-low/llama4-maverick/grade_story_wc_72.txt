<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The statue’s gentleness and curiosity motivate its outreach to the parrotfish and the catching of the ampoule, but interior conflict and micro‑choices under pressure are minimal. Emotions are mostly summarized (“incisively kind”) rather than embodied. The “comforting” and “sharing” scenes assert motive without dramatizing cost. Change feels earned conceptually, not through on‑page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens: the ampoule triggers a perception shift, culminating in a repriced understanding of the garden and the statue’s role. Orientation is clear early and the pattern holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing, but cost is soft and the path relies on summary rather than dramatized beats. The “therefore” chain is present but gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Underwater city garden is vivid and consistent: coral/anemones, filtered light, drifting ampoule. Details are filtered through the statue’s attention and recur to charge the final image (empty ampoule at its feet). While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it sustains tone and coheres with the story’s transformation. Sensory economy is good, especially visual texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract: understanding replaces decay with renewal, but there’s little pressure, narrowing of options, or visible price. The ampoule’s arrival reads as convenient rather than earned escalation. The “series of small, structural weaknesses” insight deepens knowledge without testing it. Conflict is largely absent; tension operates more as mood than causality.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Themes of nuance over certainty and resilience emerge, but they are often stated directly (“symbol of the power of nuance and understanding”). Subtext is thin; symbolism (ampoule) is functional but explained. The ending’s hope lands, yet it edges toward sermonizing rather than resonance earned through scene pressure. Thematic complexity is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice is gently lyrical, with consistent diction and rhythm. Distance control is clean; no head‑hopping. Some repetitive constructions and declarative cadence flatten intensity. The lack of dialogue keeps the voice coherent but limits textural variation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clear and readable, with a few pleasing images (“coral and anemones swayed like ballerinas”). However, paraphrase loops and template stems (“The statue…”) recur, and key beats are told rather than shown. Figurative density occasionally veers toward generic uplift. Momentum is steady but seldom propelled by syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>A telepathic living statue in a submerged city with a foxglove‑stained ampoule is a fresh tableau. The “cascading revelations” concept reframes decay into adaptation compellingly. Yet the arc follows a familiar healing‑vision template with low risk and few idiosyncratic decisions. Ingenuity sits mainly in the imagery rather than in turn design.</comment>
