<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Aurora’s motive—to unlock a locked dimension through shadow work—is clear and consistent, and her calm, ritual action aligns with a pacifist’s tactics. Interiority is present but largely declarative (“undanted,” “steadfast”), with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. Micro‑choices are constrained to stitching and attending to photographs; we don’t see a hard trade‑off or visible cost chosen in the moment. The implied fading at the end suggests a cost but is not meaningfully struggled with on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres as Aurora stitches toward a cadence shift where the dimension opens—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (recycled spaceship, storage bay, single POV), and the recurring object and act pattern her progress. The cost at closure is soft—her presence “seemed to fade”—but legible enough to qualify. Escalation is modest yet consistent with the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship and storage bay are vivid and sensorial (aged paper, faded wires), and the photographs function as a micro‑setting tethered to action. The Kwan Yin’s Tear charges the atmosphere and final image, though the environment rarely constrains choices. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. Strong mood, medium tactical relevance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock the dimension) is signaled early, but pressure largely accrues lyrically rather than through a narrowing of options. The key turn is completing the final stitch; we do not see a genuine alternative or risk that forces a trade‑off beyond tone. The peril of “shadow work” is told rather than dramatized. Cost lands more as aura than consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of compassion, memory, and transformation emerge through recurring images (photographs, stitching, the Tear). The ending offers a resonant answer—healing past wounds to open possibility—without a hard moral. Some lines tilt toward overt statement (“testament to the enduring power”), softening subtext. Still, the motif work broadly supports the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident in a close third with a lyrical register that suits the meditative mode. Diction is cohesive; patterning (stitching, glimmer, weight) is controlled. Minor repetition and abstraction creep in at peaks, but clarity holds. Rhythm is generally well‑modulated for a quiet piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clear and often musical, but paraphrase loops and purple echoes appear (“faint shimmer of long‑dried tears” recurs; “felt the weight… settling” repeats). Several sentences do similar work without new pressure, slowing momentum. Figurative density occasionally dilutes precision, especially near the climax. The final cadence is clean, if a touch ornate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—stitching photographs to unlock a dimension via shadow work on a derelict ship after the last human—feels fresh and coherent. The object with mood‑linked gravity is a striking inflection, and the lyric closure image has individuality. Execution leans on familiar spiritual diction in places, limiting distinctiveness. Still, the concept’s integration is thoughtful and memorable.</comment>
