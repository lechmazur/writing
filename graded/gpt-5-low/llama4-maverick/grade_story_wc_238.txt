<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive (to apologize to Astra) is clear and consistent, with embodied touches (her handling of the bottle, the archive’s tactility). Internal contradiction is light: we feel guilt and urgency but not a vivid push‑pull under pressure. Her action—sending the apology via music—aligns with her identity, though the “gossip-column” facet doesn’t actively complicate choices. The change at the end (relief/hope) is credible but carries a soft, mostly conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (archive, task, Astra), and the piece sustains a single scene that densifies into the humming/glow and then a release. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the message is sent and her stance shifts to hope, with the orchard’s looming loss shading the cost. The causality is gentle and largely declarative; obstacles are minimal, but the texture coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archive is sensorially vivid and functionally used—sheet music as transmission medium, the bottle as focus—and the orchard’s hush charges tone and consequence. Details feel filtered through her profession and belief system. The final image reuses place‑charged elements to sustain resonance. While the setting doesn’t overtly constrain options, it substantively aids tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (reconnection), but pressure is low: no on‑page resistance tests her commitment beyond mood and memory. The tightening is primarily a cadence shift (hum → glow → deciphering → stillness) rather than option foreclosure. Costs are implied (estrangement, impending orchard loss) more than enacted. The resolution leans on process completion rather than a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Redemption via “imperfect miracles” coheres with her method and the chosen objects, and the orchard motif counterpoints loss/repair. Several theme statements are overt (“true power lay not in grand gestures”), edging toward telling over implication. The ending provides a quiet, resonant answer—hope earned through a humble act—without a neat moral. Subtext exists but is not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is stable and textured, with a consistent lyric register suited to the material. Occasional elevated abstractions and repeated constructions tip toward over‑ornate, slightly diluting immediacy. POV modesty holds; no head‑hopping or unjustified certainty. Rhythm modulates at the climax (hum → stillness) effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evocative lines and clean mechanics, but purple drift and conceptual redundancy appear (“imperfect miracles” restated, similar cadences), softening propulsion. Figurative density is high without always adding new information, and some abstractions could be compressed. Still, the crucial beats read clearly and the final cadence lands. Minor scaffold remains but doesn’t obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—gossip‑column exorcist decoding apologies via induced currents in a sheet‑music archive, focalized through an antique perfume bottle—feels fresh. The “gossip” angle is underexploited in the actual turn, keeping the piece from a higher tier. The orchard hush as temporal pressure is a nice, specific touch. Overall, originality is solid, with room to sharpen consequence.</comment>
