<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (guard the library; “make friends with uncertainty”) and a coherent inner state, but conflict is mostly abstract. Micro-choices exist (closing her eyes, inviting the mist in) yet lack sharp counter-impulse or visible risk. “Dimensional homesickness” reads label-first rather than dramatized constraint. The ending shift to peace is plausible but pays a light cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: mist → reverie → whispers → repriced pendant → calm vigil. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (acceptance and a reweighted pendant) but the cost is soft. Orientation is clean early and the pattern is taught and kept. Absence of a concrete turning point or test keeps it out of higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vivid, sensorial garden and mist that evolve (coalescing, then clearing) and charge the final image. The pendant operates as a micro-setting object that returns meaningfully. However, the environment mostly colors interior process rather than constraining choices. Strong atmosphere, selectively purposeful, but not yet tactic-shaping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling duty with uncertainty—is clear, but pressure escalates gently without a concrete test or foreclosed option. The main tightening is a tonal deepening into reverie, not a tough trade. Resolution arrives via reception (whispers/revelation) more than earned adaptation under pressure. Cost and consequence remain largely conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of knowledge’s light versus ignorance’s dark and acceptance of uncertainty recur and culminate in a repriced pendant and peaceful vigil. Some lines state insights directly (“grasp the true nature…”) rather than letting subtext carry them. The final image resonates but skirts moral neatness. Strong coherence, modest overtness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third-person close with a distinct, mist-suffused diction. Rhythm holds, with a controlled, incantatory cadence. Occasional pseudo-abstract phrasing (“interiorize exteriors,” “dimensional harmonics”) edges toward register bloat but remains legible. No head-hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is evocative but leans purple and repetitive (mist/statues motifs recur without new pressure). Several near-duplicate assertions slow momentum and dilute impact. Syntax is clean and readable, yet density sometimes becomes decorative rather than propulsive. A tighter verb economy and fresher figurative range would lift it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The “feral library guardian” amid dimensional malaise is a fresh inflection, and the pendant-as-key is a nice reprise. The revelation-via-whispers and acceptance arc feel familiar. Inventive phrases and the fog-as-conduit add texture, but the turn remains expected. Good synthesis without a surprising reweighting.</comment>
