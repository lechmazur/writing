<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eli’s motive (“the physics of letting go”) is clear and consistently enacted through tactile micro‑choices (shaking the globe, untangling the net, transcribing). Interiority is particular and embodied (salt, decay, red‑rimmed eyes), though insights occasionally verge on thesis. Internal contradiction (seeking answers vs. accepting reframing) is present but soft. The final acceptance carries a felt, if quiet, cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece deepens through linked images and artifacts toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is prompt and clean (sunken library, Eli, purpose). Closure lands as the “last transmission” reconfigures from external mystery to an interior whisper, with cost registered in the melancholy and renunciation. The tightening is modest but coherent for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken library is vivid and selective (luminescent fish, salt rot, broken mirror) and details are filtered through Eli’s analytic bias. Objects recur with evolving charge, especially the snow globe. While the environment rarely constrains tactics, it consistently inflects perception and the final image. Atmosphere and specificity are strong without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are internal—understanding/reframing letting go—and pressure coheres via accumulative discoveries (logbook line, net‑message, lectures) toward acceptance. Escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than narrowing options; one cadence shift occurs when the “last transmission” redefines source and meaning. Costs are emotional and credible but restrained. No sharp reversal, yet agency is present in sustained attention and the decision to leave changed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of release vs. reframing is integrated through objects and actions, culminating in the still snow globe and ascent. Occasional explicit statements (“To let go is not to release, but to reframe”) edge into didacticism, slightly dulling subtext. The “last transmission” reweights prior material effectively. Emotional aftertaste is earned, sophisticated, and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The first‑person reflective voice is consistent, textured, and plausibly analytic without slipping registers. Rhythm varies well between image and thought; no head‑hopping or stance breaches. Compression supports lyric accumulation. A few aphoristic phrasings skim the edge of abstraction but the voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear, sensory‑dense, and mostly economical; images do more than one job. Minor repetition and aphoristic turns create slight drag in places, but momentum largely holds. Figurative language is controlled and not muddled. The final lines resolve via charged image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of a sunken ship library with an inquiry into the physics of release feels fresh and purposeful. The knot‑code and “last transmission” reframing are thoughtful turns grounded in character. Amelia Earhart functions more as color than load‑bearing logic. Overall, an original synthesis with authentic emotional texture.</comment>
