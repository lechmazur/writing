<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motive (restore a diverted watershed to preserve beauty) is clear and consistent, and the egg gives her a specific, embodied tether. The “amoral but secretly sentimental” contradiction is present but mostly told rather than dramatized under pressure. Micro‑choices exist (walking into the flat, raising the egg, triggering the release) but face little resistance, so the internal cost reads light. The closing endurance/stance feels earned but not deeply paid-for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lens: Hybrid tending Causal at closure. Orientation is clean, and the decisive act—“she released the waters”—lands on the page with a consequent transformation. However, the cost of achieving it (political risk, physical danger, or moral trade‑off) is asserted offstage (“navigate the complex web of interests”) and not felt at the moment of action, muting closure weight. The map‑by‑cracks provides a causal bridge but the resolution arrives too easily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The salt flat, thunder, and dry‑earth textures are vivid and purposeful; the cracked earth functions as both atmosphere and tool by becoming a map. Weather pressure and the terrain’s brittleness color movement and urgency. The egg as a recurring object charges the final image in the same landscape. World rules hold, and detail is filtered through her mission-driven gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (restore water), and thunder builds urgency, but escalation is mostly tonal rather than obstacle-based. The plan is stated and then executed without a meaningful turn that forecloses options or exacts a price. The climax (“released the waters”) lacks friction, so tension crests softly. Internal and external strands align but do not meaningfully tighten.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Resonance emerges through the egg and the “echo of extinct birds,” but thematic statements like “testament to the destructive power of greed” tilt toward telling. The final image reweights earlier motifs (egg, water, birds) into a gentle repricing of loss and renewal. Moral complexity is hinted by “amoral philanthropist,” yet not substantively tested. The piece invites reflection but avoids real ambiguity or cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence fits the piece. Diction and rhythm are controlled, though some phrasing repeats (“salt flat,” “echo”) and edges toward pattern monotony. No head‑hopping or stance drift occurs. Psychic distance is stable, modulating toward lyric intensity at the climax without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clean sentences with clear sequencing, but line‑level redundancy and paraphrase loops (“barren, cracked expanse”; repeated thesis phrases) slow momentum. Some abstract labels (“destructive power of greed”) substitute for image under peak stakes. The rhythm is pleasant yet uniform, dampening propulsion. Overall clarity holds, but density could be higher.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—amoral benefactor, extinct egg, cracked‑riverbed map, engineered drought—feels fresh and coherent. The release as ritualized act against manufactured scarcity is compelling, but the ease of success reduces ingenuity at the peak. Images and premise show originality without gimmickry. A bolder complication or price would elevate the distinctiveness.</comment>
