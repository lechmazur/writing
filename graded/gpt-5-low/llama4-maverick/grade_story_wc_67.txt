<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Lena’s vocation and reverent temperament are clear, and her choice to proceed with scattering offers a modest on‑page turn. However, conflicting impulses (duty vs. reluctance) are largely told rather than dramatized, so pressure never sharpens into a costly choice. Interiority leans generic and declarative, with minimal embodied contradiction. Eli’s presence doesn’t materially pressure her decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scene builds from observation to conversation to the act of dispersal, closing on a conceptual repricing of “safety.” Closure lands via the ash‑scattering and the final reframe (impermanence) with a light, conceptual cost. Orientation is clean and the pattern is consistent, but turns are soft and the cost is primarily thematic rather than dramatized. No major causal missteps, just limited tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The gallery, frame, charcoal, and porcelain mask provide purposeful, cohesive atmosphere filtered through Lena’s professional eye. Specifics like the powder‑coated frame and ash dispersal integrate setting with action. The environment does not constrain tactics, but it charges the final image credibly. Sensory range skews visual and thematic but stays coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal (how to regard the illusion of safety), yet escalation is slight and largely discussed rather than tested. The only meaningful tightening is the move from contemplation to scattering, with little resistance or reversal. Agency exists but with low cost; consequences remain abstract. Pressure stays steady instead of rising.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme is coherent but over‑stated; “mirage of safety” and impermanence are repeatedly named, and Eli articulates the thesis outright in the final exchange, blunting subtext. The strongest resonance comes from the ash release aligned with impermanence, but insights often arrive as commentary. The ending offers a conceptual answer yet skews didactic. Subtextual opportunities in the mask and job are under-exploited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and serviceable, with modest texture from Lena’s occupational lens. Dialogue is functional but expository, lacking subtextual pressure. Diction sometimes drifts into awkward constructions (“seems to weaves”), flattening voice. Rhythm is even but rarely charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Repetition (“mirage of safety,” “somber,” “powder”) and paraphrase loops reduce momentum, and several clunky phrases/typos dent polish. Figurative language is safe and sometimes mixed or generic; moralizing in the final third dulls the closing image’s charge. Sentences often restate similar points rather than layering new pressure. Readable but not distilled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise of a “charcoal portrait ash scatterer” and the vanishing‑point/powder motif feel fresh. Execution leans conventional in its thematic handling, relying on stated ideas rather than structural risk. The closure image is apt but not surprising. Ingenuity shows in the profession and object set, less so in turn design.</comment>
