<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (decipher tile, seal covenant), but interior conflict remains abstract and tidy; the “empirically ironic” stance never creates on‑page friction. Micro‑choices are thin beyond raising the tile and “deciphering.” Emotions are told rather than embodied, and the final surrender reads as unopposed fulfillment rather than a costly trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmosphere intensifies toward a closure where the covenant is sealed and perspective reconfigured. Orientation is stable and the object recurs to charge the final image. However, cost at closure is light—the surrender of skepticism is declared but not felt through consequence, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The palace and tile are vividly evoked and the tile charges the ending image. Yet the environment rarely constrains action or alters tactics; it functions mostly as a lyrical backdrop. Strong tone control, limited functional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain lofty and abstract; pressure accrues as mood rather than through narrowing options. The key turn (lifting the tile, sealing the covenant) arrives without a tested alternative or visible price. Escalation is a cadence swell, not a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of devotion, pattern, and unity are coherent and recur via the tile and sky. Yet the ending over‑asserts (“life’s work was complete,” “universe would forever be changed”), tipping into told significance rather than earned resonance. Subtext is thin where declaration dominates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is consistent and lyric, but diction trends generic‑elevated with repeated constructions (“As the…,” “The astronomer…”). The voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature beyond reverent awe. Control is steady, not memorable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Noticeable paraphrase loops and cadence sameness (“As…” openings, cosmic abstractions) flatten momentum. Figurative language leans purple without sharpening action; many sentences restate expectancy and harmony. Clean mechanics, but density-to-advance ratio is low in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The Babylonian magic square and “encrypted devotion” offer a fresh angle conceptually. Execution hews to familiar cosmic‑awe tropes, with few surprising turns or grounded particularities to individuate the piece. Some originality in synthesis; risk remains modest.</comment>
