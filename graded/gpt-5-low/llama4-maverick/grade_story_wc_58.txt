<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear desire—to “understand the geography of healing”—and a consistent vocation anchor the POV, with tactile micro‑choices (touching the weft, choosing to write, deciding to leave). Internal contradiction is mild: melancholy vs. a need to connect, not strongly dramatized under pressure. The ending acceptance reads earned through the act of writing, but the personal cost remains soft. Embodied emotion is present but leans generalized rather than idiosyncratically revealing flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the silence/dusk pattern intensifies, writing becomes the middle turn, and the thread’s snap closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early; single scene, single POV, one dominant stake. The cost—letting go, accepting absence—is implied but not deeply priced. Closure lands on the page via the final image but with modest consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden and palace carpet are rendered vividly across senses (damp earth, decaying leaves, lunar glow). The weft thread recurs and charges the final image, giving the setting object‑specific force. Environmental pressure on choices is minimal, but the atmosphere meaningfully shapes perception and cadence. Strong POV filtering keeps details purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure accrues more by mood than by concrete stakes; the key tightening is dusk → writing → revaluation of silence. The dominant stake (bridge the absences, find healing) remains largely internal and unopposed, so escalation feels gentle. The thread’s snap provides a small felt price, but no option is forcefully foreclosed. Effective for lyric mode, limited for conflict intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Absence, connection, and memorialization converge through the living‑obituary conceit and the thread motif. Thematic emergence is mostly image‑led, though a few lines verge on direct statement (“I felt a sense of understanding”). The final repricing of silence (from oppressive to musical) resonates without a tidy moral. Subtext operates through handling the thread and the transformed light.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A stable, lyrical first‑person with controlled diction and rhythmic modulation suits the accumulative design. Perceptual signature—craftsmanship, scent, hush—stays consistent and character‑specific. Occasional abstraction (“geography of healing”) risks register drift but remains anchored by tactile beats. No head‑hopping; stance and tense are steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid, musical lines with good sensory density, though some redundancy and adjective stacking slow momentum (“vividly descriptive,” “morbid perfume,” reiterations of silence/shadow). A few paraphrase loops summarize feelings already embodied. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat, and the final image is clean. Trim could heighten propulsion without sacrificing lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Obituaries for the living” plus the weft thread as emblem of fragile connection is a fresh angle within a familiar elegiac mode. The garden’s transformation and the thread’s snap create a distinct closing gesture. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; the piece stays safe in conflict. Memorable, if not boldly reimagining stakes or form.</comment>
