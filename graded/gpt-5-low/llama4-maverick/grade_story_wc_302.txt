<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and steady (to find the library of unspoken words), and actions align (opening the tome, measuring whispers, stepping through the doorway). However, interior conflict is light; contradictory impulses rarely co‑act on the page. Emotional texture leans generalized (reverence, anticipation) over embodied specificity. The closing realization feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coherently accretes images and methods (watch, whispers, cipher) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the library is a state of being. Orientation is clean from the start; the final doorway and return provide a legible cadence shift. Cost is subtle rather than undeniable, tempering the impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and consistent (mist‑shrouded city, glowing stacks, silken veil), integrated with action (fingers on spines, whispers as data). The confidence man’s watch and mist recur to charge the final image. Yet the environment rarely constrains choices; it colors them, keeping this just shy of the top band. Sensory balance favors visual/aural but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening (decoding → doorway → step through). Escalation reads as density rather than increased cost; opposition is diffuse, with no real foreclosed option shown. The step through is a choice, but its price is abstract. Tension hums but rarely bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (cipher, watch, whispers) support a theme of translating the unspoken into lived awareness. The ending’s explicit line—“not a destination, but a state of being”—states the thesis rather than letting the final image carry it, dulling resonance. Still, the reweighting from quest to stance lands. Ambiguity is gentle rather than generative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is stable, with controlled cadence and diction that match the dream‑logic atmosphere. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful. Some phrasing recurs (“cautious exuberance,” “forever changed”), slightly flattening texture. Overall, confident and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line craft is clean and rhythmic, but purple tendencies and paraphrase loops appear (“forever changed,” echoing mist/fade beats). Several sentences restate similar insights, reducing momentum. Figurative density is high yet mostly coherent; information load per line could be tightened. The final third remains clear but not razor‑economical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The watch‑as‑instrument for “propagation delays” offers a fresh scientific inflection within a mystic frame; the “library of unspoken words” is a strong conceit. The core turn (destination → state) is familiar but well staged. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; ingenuity shows more in conceit than in conflict design. Memorable, if not transformative.</comment>
