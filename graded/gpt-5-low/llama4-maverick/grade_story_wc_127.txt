<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dealer’s motives (precision, empathy without immersion) are clear and consistent, and her “affectionate detachment” is a credible operating stance. However, internal contradiction is stated more than dramatized; she “subsume[s] her own emotions” without a felt struggle on the page. Micro-choices under pressure are minimal, and no relationship crucible appears. The ending’s endurance feels earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and stable; the single-scene accumulative design is coherent. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a gentle cadence shift at departure. Closure is a soft Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—she finishes, leaves, and keeps the petal—but the cost is mostly conceptual, not felt. No decisive turn narrows options, so the closure lands quietly rather than compellingly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber grotto and luminescent stones are vivid, sensorial, and recur to charge the final image. Details (warmth, crackle, aged amber) are purposeful and filtered through the dealer’s professional attention. Still, the environment rarely constrains choices; it sanctifies mood more than it pressures action. Strong atmosphere, limited tactical impact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crafting believable half-truth emotions for a discerning client—is clear but remains low-pressure. Escalation is minimal; completion arrives without complication or trade-off beyond the stated detachment. No meaningful reversal or narrowing of options occurs. The result is poised but static tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of authenticity versus fabrication and empathy tempered by distance arise organically from the work and setting. The “half truths” motif is integrated and reprises at the end with the petal as emblem. Some lines tip into telling (“not lies, exactly”) rather than letting subtext do the work. The final sanctuary image resonates but doesn’t reprice the premise with new cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV and distance are stable, with a consistent, controlled lyric voice. Diction suits the character’s meticulous temperament and the sensory milieu. Rhythm risks sameness in sentence openings and constructions but remains legible and intentional. No dialogue to test naturalism or subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and imagistic, with purposeful sensory layering. There is some paraphrase and scaffold repetition (“As…”/“The dealer…”/“The grotto…”) that slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is restrained enough to avoid muddle, but line-by-line propulsion is modest. The final lines land clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—an emotion counterfeiter in an amber grotto for a fragrance chemist—feels fresh and coherent. The static-electricity sensing is intriguing even if underused. The piece favors mood over invention in turns, limiting ingenuity at the level of escalation. Still, the synthesis of craft, scent, and counterfeit feeling is memorable.</comment>
