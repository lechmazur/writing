<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The titan‑gear librarian has a clear desire and distinctive sensibility, but rarely faces on‑page pressure that compels choice. Interiority is evocative yet generalized, with minimal contradictory impulses enacted in scene. Most actions are ritual description rather than micro‑choices with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear; the piece coheres as a lyric meditation. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—continuing to “preserve wonder in routine.” However, the ending’s cost is faint and largely asserted, with no decisive turn or constraint tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium and sea‑salt atmosphere are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the librarian’s sensibility; the creel offers a grounded object. Sensory detail supports tone without white‑room effects. Yet the setting seldom constrains behavior or tactics beyond mood, limiting functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract (preserving wonder) and never face a concrete obstacle. Pressure doesn’t tighten; moon phases and identity flux are explained rather than tested. The final stance is a continuation rather than a hard trade‑off with visible cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (fluid identity, wonder in routine) resonates through images like the creel and the tidal cadence. However, key theses are stated outright (“motivation became clear”), blunting subtext. The final image is gentle but offers limited reweighting or ambivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent third‑person lyric voice with controlled cadence; diction suits the contemplative mode. No head‑hopping and stance remains stable. Some abstraction and repeated constructions slightly flatten the dynamic range.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Polished sentences and pleasant rhythm, but redundancy and generalized phrasing recur (“gentle, relentless passage of time”; reiterated mission statements). Figurative language trends uniform, with little propulsion. Line‑level remains clear but not particularly taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The hybrid of mechanical/organic librarian in a tidal atrium is fresh and memorable. The “after tomorrow disappears” conceit adds intrigue, though it’s underexploited structurally. Overall, the piece favors mood over novel pressure uses, tempering ingenuity’s impact.</comment>
