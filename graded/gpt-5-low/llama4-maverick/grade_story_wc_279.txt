<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear inner drive (“to discover meaning in the mess”) and a consistent practice (mandala‑making) give her agency, with small but present micro‑choices (two “interject” moments). Interiority is mostly credible if abstract, leaning on repeated phrases (“inner world,” “unlearning”) rather than idiosyncratic embodiment. The contradictory pull—comfort versus warning in the “emergent hush”—is felt, though not deeply conflictual. The final stance (peace with lingering unease) reads earned, if soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the whispers intensify, the mist encroaches, density rises toward a final mandala change and hush resolving to lilac light. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a priced endurance (she keeps unease, revalued). Causality is gentle but coherent—tile → “listen deeply” → pattern reading → final interjection. Cost is present but understated, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto, mist, whispering gallery, and sand tools are vivid and integrated; sensory textures recur and evolve (mist seeping, hum growing, lilac light). The tile flake functions as a recurring object that charges the final image. Setting guides attention and tone more than constraining options, but it does shape the method (mandala) and the listening act. Strong specificity, if occasionally leaning into symbolic echo.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: whether she can reframe turmoil through making and listening. Escalation is a density increase (hush grows, whispers coalesce) and culminates in a final, deliberate alteration of the pattern. The price—accepting lingering unease—is conceptually legible but not viscerally costly on the page; no option is sharply foreclosed. Tension is steady but rarely tightens into a consequential trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around unlearning and radical attention (“listen deeply”) realized through image rather than lecture, with a quiet repricing at the end. The lilac unease modulates from threat to companion, offering a nuanced, non‑moralized answer. Some phrasing veers toward abstraction, softening subtextual bite. Still, the closing image reweights prior motifs without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person close is consistent, with a measured, incantatory rhythm suited to accumulation. The perceptual signature favors atmosphere over analysis and remains coherent. However, repetitive constructions (“The [noun]…”) and recycled phrases dull the voice’s edge under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft shows control but suffers from paraphrase loops and repeated sentences (e.g., “The sand mandala was a reflection of her own inner world” appears twice). Figurative density at times edges purple (“lilac unease” reiterated), reducing propulsion. Syntax patterns recur without purposeful escalation, flattening momentum. Clarity holds, but economy and variation would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of mandala‑making, a whispering gallery, and “unlearning” yields a distinctive if gentle design; the lilac tonality is a fresh touch. The tile’s “listen deeply” avoids gimmickry and meaningfully reframes her practice. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and the piece favors mood over hard choice. Originality is solid but not transformative.</comment>
