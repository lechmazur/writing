<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (document the last flora) is clear and steady, but internal contradiction and micro‑choices under pressure are thin. Her curiosity about the sand grain gives a small, revealing beat, yet no real cost accrues from it. Emotional texture leans generic (“fragility,” “preciousness”) rather than character‑particular. The endurance at the end reads more told than lived, reducing the felt change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear and the piece closes with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (she captures the images and restores the grain), but escalation is modest. The warning message tightens time slightly, yet obstacles never meaningfully alter options. Cost at closure is primarily emotional, landing softly but legibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid and selective, with a strong lunar mood and charged small objects. However, physical plausibility slips (“breeze” and swaying petals on an airless moon) undercut world integrity. The summit and tools don’t much constrain tactics beyond implying harshness. The hourglass grain returns to charge the final image effectively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get the last photographs before disappearance—is stated but meets little resistance. The timed message adds a light clock, yet there’s no on‑page setback, adaptation, or trade‑off beyond endurance. Success arrives without a narrowing choice that exacts a visible price. Tension remains more atmospheric than structural.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Time and transience cohere through the flora, dawn, and hourglass grain, and the final return of the grain reweights the imagery. Some lines veer toward sentimentality and explicit statement, but the motif‑driven resonance mostly carries. The melancholy afterimage is earned by particulars rather than a stated moral. Depth is modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical cadence suits the meditative aim. Occasional redundancies and elevated diction dull compression and edge toward purple. No head‑hopping or stance slips; POV modesty stays plausible. Rhythm could tighten under peak beats to avoid blur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line craft shows evocative moments, but repetition and paraphrase loops (“stillness… almost palpable,” “dawning hush” reappears) reduce density. Some modifiers blur rather than sharpen, and a few mixed or strained images sap momentum. The final image is clear though not razor‑cut. Overall readable but over‑embroidered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hourglass grain on the Moon and chemical timed messaging are fresh touches within a familiar “last of its kind” elegy. Emotional truth lands, but the arc is conventional and low‑risk, with limited transformation of trope. World implications aren’t fully exploited. Ingenuity is present in image, less in structure or turn.</comment>
