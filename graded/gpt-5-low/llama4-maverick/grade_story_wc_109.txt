<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear want (to “draw a map of the endless night”) and a method-driven temperament (“mildly obsessed with listening to the silence”) read consistently, but pressure is low and contradictory impulses are thin. Agency centers on attention rather than contested choice. The walk into darkness is a choice, yet it carries little felt cost or internal friction. Interiority is atmospheric rather than revealing layered, character-specific conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: listening → narrating → deepening hush → charged darkness → reconfigured world → return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the shadows’ “new and mysterious pattern” and the world’s reweighted hush). Orientation is solid from the start; the on-page cost is more suggested than legible. The causal thread is lyric but coherent, with one cadence intensification at the last star’s extinguishing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ridge fort, storm, candles, and the gold-leaf booklet create a tactile locus that supports tone and action; the storm’s recession mirrors the deepening hush. The booklet recurs as a charged object that seems to unlock secrets and returns transformed. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it consistently inflects perception and momentum. Sensory choices (sandalwood, candle glow, textured darkness) are selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract; escalation reads as density and hush intensifying rather than options narrowing. The key tightening is the last star’s extinction, yet there’s little visible price or trade-off. The protagonist’s agency is contemplative, and no credible loss forces adaptation. The outcome (world reconfigured) arrives without on-page sacrifice or risk test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of narrative shaping reality and silence as generative force accrue through recurring images (“ambered hush,” dying star, rearranged shadows). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: attention can rewrite the night. However, lack of counterpressure or moral calculus limits depth. Coherence is strong; complexity is modest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (listening as craft; silence “speaks”). Rhythm modulates softly at the climax without head-hopping or register slips. No dialogue, but the narrative voice carries subtext through image. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean and mostly purposeful, but figurative density is high and sometimes redundant (“hush,” “silence,” “darkness” recur with near-synonymous modifiers). Some paraphrase echoes and intensifier stacking slow momentum. Still, syntax varies, images are largely coherent, and the final cadence lands. Minimal scaffolding; a trim could heighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Conceptually fresh: mapping night by “summarizing silence” gives an original method and image system. Oracle tropes are renewed through attentive, textural craft rather than plot novelty. The reconfiguration of shadows is a satisfying, non-obvious turn seeded by the method. Risk lies in the quiet, lyric design; it pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
