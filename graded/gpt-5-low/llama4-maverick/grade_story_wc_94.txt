<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motive (to map her scars) and a consistent interior lens, with the envelope choice as the key action. However, conflict is largely abstract and contradictory impulses are muted; she moves from poised waiting to reading with little on‑page resistance. Emotional texture leans on atmospheric mirroring rather than embodied friction. The “censored” facet is named but not dramatized in her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm → urge → talisman → envelope → reading → repriced calm. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—her vigil ends with understanding—on the page. Cost is implied (confronting hidden truths), though not sharply dramatized. Orientation is clean from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective storm-and-observatory imagery filtered through her sensibility; the darkroom timer functions as micro‑setting and charges the final image. Weather and altitude shape tone and attention, if not concrete options. The setting integrates with theme without feeling like a postcard. Constraint on action is light, keeping it below the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: will she face what she hid and accept its cost. Escalation is a measured tightening toward opening the envelope; the timer’s ticking and storm density help. The price reads as an inward exposure rather than a tangible loss, limiting felt jeopardy. Still, the final stance crystallizes credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motifs (light/dark, masks, cartography, timer) accrue meaning and the ending reweights them without overt moralizing. A few phrases edge toward thesis‑statement territory (“cartography of scars,” repeated), but image work mostly carries the theme. The final calm earns its resonance via particulars. Complexity is present but safely framed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, lyrical cadence suited to the piece. Diction is largely controlled and character‑specific, with rhythm modulating at the inspiration/reading turn. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Slight purple tendencies appear but don’t break control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong, musical lines with purposeful repetition and a clean final cadence. Some synonym loops and abstraction (“cartography of scars,” “hidden patterns”) recur without adding new pressure. Figurative density skews high but remains coherent. Readability and momentum hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fusion of a storm‑top observatory, a darkroom timer, and a self‑addressed letter offers a fresh inflection on interior reckoning. The “storm mirrors turmoil” trope is familiar, but the talismanic bus timetable method adds specificity. Risks are tasteful rather than bold. Closure feels earned if not surprising.</comment>
