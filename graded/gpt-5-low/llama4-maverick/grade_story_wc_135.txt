<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clear motive (compile fragments; hearten community) and a consistent worldview, but interiority stays abstract and mostly told. Little contradictory impulse under pressure; the plan unfolds without meaningful friction. The shopkeeper’s brief presence does not create relational pressure. Actions align, but cost and embodied emotion are thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: relics → plan → installations → communal recollection → symbolic closure with the valve. Orientation is clean and the closure image is legible, but the decisive turn happens off-page via summary and lacks a felt cost. The healing arc reads inevitable rather than pressured. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, softly earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ivory harbor after rain, the musty shop, and maritime artifacts create a coherent mood and specificity. The herald’s valve functions as a micro-setting object charging the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mainly colors tone. Sensory detail is selective but skews visual and declarative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes (restore communal identity) are declared, yet escalation is gentle and summary-driven. No hard narrowing of options or on-page trade-off; success arrives without a visible price. The “staggered intervals” sequence implies progression but not tightening pressure. Conflict remains largely conceptual and unopposed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, resilience, and communal narrative coalescence are clear and coherent. Yet the piece leans on explicit moralizing (“beacon of hope,” “power of remembrance”) rather than subtextual turns. The valve’s reprise provides resonance, but complexity and counterpressure are limited. The ending’s insights feel stated more than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stable third-person with a calm, slightly lyrical register; distance control is consistent and readable. Diction fits the reflective mode, though it trends generic at peaks. Minimal dialogue avoids pitfalls but offers little subtext. Voice carries atmosphere but lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic signature under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clean, grammatical lines with steady cadence; few mechanical errors. Some paraphrase and conceptual repetition (“beacon,” “remembrance,” “fragments”) dull momentum. Telling dominates pivotal beats, limiting density and propulsion. Imagery is competent but rarely surprising.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The “ocean-spray archivist” and the trumpet valve as communal totem are mildly fresh. The overall redemption-by-art installation arc is familiar and safe. No bold structural risks; ingenuity arises mainly from object choice and maritime texture. Emotional truth is gentle, not probing.</comment>
