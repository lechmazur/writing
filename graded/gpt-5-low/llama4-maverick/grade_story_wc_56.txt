<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (seek the sundial to decode “the architecture of lies”), but internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized; the late realization about self‑lies isn’t earned through on‑page contradictory impulses. Competence feels frictionless, minimizing felt cost. Micro‑choices are present (following subtle cues) but never pinch her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: atmosphere builds toward a resonant reconfiguration when she uncovers the sundial and reframes her pursuit. Closure lands as a quiet internal repricing, but the cost is faint. Orientation is clean; structure is one continuous scene with a soft cadence shift at the end. Escalation remains shallow, relying on lyric density rather than turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is vividly rendered with scent, texture, and the silted hiding place; the setting coheres with mood and discovery. However, the environment seldom constrains choices or forces tactics beyond ambience and a gentle search pattern. The sundial as object charges the final image effectively. Strong atmosphere, modest functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the sundial to gain truth) is clear but faces little resistance; clues appear and yield without counter‑pressure. The meaningful tightening is minimal, and no option is foreclosed or traded. The ending does not demand a costly decision, reading more as receipt than test. Tension stays lyrical rather than situational or causal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. self‑deception aligns with the sundial’s “hindsight clarity,” and the final image offers a gentle repricing. Some phrasing edges toward abstractions (“architecture of lies,” “thoughtfully clear”) that state rather than embody. Resonance exists but lacks ambiguity or friction that would deepen it. The insight feels earned enough for a quiet close, not profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence; sensory focus matches the contemplative mode. Lexicon stays coherent, though repeated signature phrases flatten variation. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm occasionally lulls due to recurrence but remains legible and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clean mechanics, but repetition (“serene upheaval,” “silence of the morning radio,” “thoughtfully clear,” “hindsight clarity”) creates paraphrase loops and slight purple tilt. Information density is adequate; some lines restate mood without adding pressure. Momentum drags in mid‑beats where imagery clusters without new consequence. Final image is clear despite the over‑lyric sheen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pocket sundial as a key to “hindsight” is a neat angle, and “morning radio” as silence gives a fresh detail. Yet the quest‑epiphany arc leans familiar, with low‑risk choices. The originality lies more in texture than in turn. Solid synthesis without a surprising reweighting.</comment>
