<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Akira’s desire to understand the digital ghost is clear and consistent, and her renunciation at dawn registers as a modest change. However, interiority leans abstract, with limited contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Much of the emotion is told rather than dramatized through pressured micro‑choices. The final relinquishment of the shard suggests cost but lands softly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: snow, ink, radio static clearing, and the ghost’s coalescence build toward a conceptual repricing. Closure arrives in a resonant reconfiguration—accepting wisdom from failure rather than extracting truth—capped by the shard’s release. Orientation is steady and the single scene coheres. The cost is present but understated, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory, snow hush, and tactile ink work are vivid and consistently filtered through Akira’s gaze. The porcelain shard functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices, it saturates tone and purpose. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily internal and textural; the clearing radio static and ink‑reading mark a single meaningful tightening. Stakes (understanding the ghost) remain abstract, with limited visible trade‑off beyond acceptance. The ghost’s coalescence deepens the inquiry but doesn’t force a difficult choice. The final renunciation reads earned but low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motifs (ink, snow, shard, heartbeat) align to a theme of gleaning wisdom from fracture and failure, culminating in a gentle repricing at dawn. However, the line “She realized that her journey was not about…” veers into thesis‑statement territory, diluting subtext. The ending image carries resonance but skirts sentimentality. Ambiguity is present without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and consistent, with a lucid, meditative cadence that suits the accumulative design. Some syntactic repetition (“As…” openings, parallel structures) reduces rhythmic variety. No head‑hopping; psychic distance stays stable. Diction remains coherent and within a plausible lyrical register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean and often graceful, but leans into ornamental repetition and near‑duplicates that could be tightened. Figurative density occasionally flattens into synonyms for “mystery/solace” without adding new information. Several sentences restate the same emotional state, softening momentum. Final image lands but with mild purple overcast.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a “digital ghost” with ink divination in a snow‑bound observatory is fresh and coherent. The shard’s charged reprise adds a memorable note. Risk‑taking is present but safe; the piece avoids bolder structural or cost escalations that might have sharpened inevitability. Still, the vision feels specific rather than templated.</comment>
