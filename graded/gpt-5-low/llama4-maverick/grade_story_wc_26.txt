<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (preserve hope, study the collective unconscious), and a few micro-choices occur (follow the thread; decide to share findings). However, internal conflict is muted; contradictory impulses rarely act simultaneously. Emotions trend abstract rather than embodied under pressure. The final stance feels earned but low-cost and largely declarative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → pattern recognition → conceptual naming of the shadow → charged resolve. Orientation is clear early (blooming library above clouds, stone, footage), and the closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise. Cost is present as “luminous regret” and the weight of task, but it’s soft and not sharply dramatized. Still, the ending image reweights the premise coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming library and luminescent orbs are vivid and consistent, with selective sensory details that shape tone. The micro-setting of the river stone helps charge the final image. Environment does not strongly constrain choices or tactics, but it meaningfully frames the thematic stakes. World rules (shareable dreams) integrate smoothly through observation rather than exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain mostly conceptual (hope vs. encroaching shadow) and escalate gently through recognition rather than pressure. The meaningful tightening is her resolve to act after naming the shadow, but no option is truly foreclosed on the page. There’s limited cost beyond a felt burden. Tension operates more by mood than by conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres around collective fear, shared dreams, and guarding hope, with recurring images (stone, orbs, library) supporting it. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“Her motivation was… to preserve the shape of hope,” “the shadow… a manifestation of humanity’s deepest fears”), dampening subtext. The final image does resonate, if gently. Insights arise more from assertion than struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical register suits the premise. The perceptual signature (soft, deliberate noticing) is coherent. Some repetitive diction and filter-y constructions flatten momentum (“As she… she began…”), but stance and distance are stable. No head‑hopping or register jolts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and clear but edges into redundancy (recurrent “luminescent orbs,” “softly deliberate,” and parallel sentence stems). Abstractions occasionally substitute for concrete pressure, softening propulsion. Rhythm remains readable yet uniform in places, with paraphrase loops that could be cut for density. Figurative language is coherent but sometimes safe.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cloud‑borne library, shareable dreams, and an unbound shadow is appealing and mostly fresh. The investigation via silent decades‑apart footage is a distinctive method. The arc leans familiar (naming the darkness, resolving to bear hope) with limited risk at the level of consequence. Still, the worldbuilding touches and final image have memorable texture.</comment>
