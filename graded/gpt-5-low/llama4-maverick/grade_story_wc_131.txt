<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dweller’s gentle, methodical care and desire to be seen are clear and embodied through tactile work, smell-triggered memory, and curated caches. The internal tension—wanting visibility yet choosing concealment—registers but remains low-pressure. Micro-choices (pocketing the tape, arranging a “world of wonder,” melting back) align with motive. The cost of continued invisibility is implied rather than dramatized under strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the outage’s flicker → return of light creates a cadence shift and urgency that leads to a charged final tableau. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the dweller recommits to being “hidden in plain sight,” leaving evidence to be found. The price (remaining unseen while seeking to be seen) lands, albeit softly. Orientation is clean from the outset and the pattern holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library, pipe chases, generator hum, and dust/oxidation palette are vivid and POV-filtered, guiding action and tone. The environment constrains and enables tactics (crawling, uncovering, hiding shelves). Objects-as-setting (tape reel, book, map) charge the final image. Sensory economy is strong without museum-tour breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (to be seen by those who need them) and tighten when the lights return, prompting urgency. The meaningful turn is a recommitment to indirect visibility via curated traces. However, pressure remains gentle; no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond continued self-erasure. Cost is felt but not acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of visibility/care, memory as compass, and quiet guardianship emerge from images and actions (scent-triggered history → renewed purpose → caches). Subtext generally carries the load, though the ending edges toward assertion (“there was always hope”). The final “sapphire hush” reframes prior texture with modest resonance. Complexity is present but not deeply contested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person with a distinct observational texture; diction is consistent and character-inflected through material detail. Rhythm modulates with the light’s return, adding urgency without losing control. No head-hopping or register drift. Occasional repeated constructions (“The dweller…”) nibble at variety but do not break flow.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean, with purposeful imagery and concrete verbs; sensory specificity often does double duty. Minor redundancies and favored phrases (“sapphire hush,” “hidden”) recur, risking slight purple tint but not muddling clarity. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density. No major scaffold or metaphor collisions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hidden caretaker in a post-outage library with ferromagnetic-scented memory feels fresh in its particulars and object-work. The “being seen by those who need” ambition approached via caches offers a non-obvious angle. Risks are quiet and integrated rather than flashy, yielding a memorable mood. The conceptual leap is solid but not transformative.</comment>
