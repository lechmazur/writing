<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motive (to shape identity and guard memory) and a few micro‑choices (descend, touch crystal, accept the flood) register, but internal contradiction is minimal. Emotions skew abstract (“weight of her task,” “sense of peace”) rather than embodied under pressure. The shift from burden to peace is asserted more than dramatized, softening felt cost. Still, the POV remains coherent and character‑particular in noticing storms, stone, and shadow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm → descent → contact → reweighting. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she accepts the role—yet the cost on the page is faint. Orientation is strong from the first line; single scene continuity is clean. Lacks a decisive tightening that materially narrows options beyond mood and resolve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and sensorial (wet stone, ozone, lightning refracted in crystal), filtered through a professional gaze. The crystal and observatory recur and charge the final image, though they rarely constrain action. Spatial coherence is steady, and details evolve with the storm clearing. Strong texture; not quite instrumental in shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is identity/guardianship, but pressure barely tightens; the storm clears as she decides to proceed, so external pressure abates. The meaningful turn is the touch of the crystal, which deepens experience rather than forcing a trade‑off. No path is clearly foreclosed or price paid beyond bearing weight abstractly. Tension operates mostly as tone, not as escalating consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory, inheritance, and self‑making emerge organically from image patterns (storm → hush → moon → crystal). Some lines overstate thesis (“not just preserving the past, but also shaping the future”), trimming subtext. The final acceptance resonates, if quietly, with a conceptual repricing of her role. Ambiguity remains thoughtful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Controlled, consistent lyric third with a distinct observational bias toward weather, stone, and light. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat, though diction can loop (“collective memory,” “crystal whispering forecourt”). POV modesty is sound; no head‑hopping. The voice holds under the soft pressure but seldom sharpens in syntax when stakes peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clean sentences and evocative images, but repetition (“crystal whispering forecourt,” “collective memory”) and near‑duplicate sentiments blunt momentum. Occasional purple phrasing and summary declarations supplant scene pressure in key beats. Information density is decent, yet several lines could be cut without loss. Final image lands, though the line‑level music does not intensify it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>“Summer‑quill archivist,” storm observatory, and shadow‑length method offer fresh veneers on memory‑keeper tropes. The piece commits to a singular mood and image‑logic without gimmickry. However, the arc (mystic communion → acceptance) is familiar and risk‑light. Ingenuity sits more in texture than in turn or consequence.</comment>
