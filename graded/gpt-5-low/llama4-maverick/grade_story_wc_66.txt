<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s goal and professional specificity (copyist transcribing under pressure) are clear and consistent, and her obsession reads plausibly. However, interior contradiction is thin: the piece favors rapture over competing impulses, so the peak never tests her values beyond attention and endurance. Embodied beats (dial twirling, pencil scratching, cloak) reveal character but not a hard trade‑off. The closing self‑appointment as “guardian” feels earned in tone, not via a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tuning → melody → flicker/presence → crescendo → cessation forms a clean density build. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she captures the broadcast’s essence; the alcove becomes a portal and a charged poise endures. Cost is implied (solitude/obsessive vigilance) rather than concretely paid, keeping it shy of higher bands. Orientation is solid early, with a single scene cohesion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and filtered through task: ember alcove, mist, dust motes, and the radio’s glow integrate with action and culminate in the “beacon” image. The radio dial functions as micro‑setting/object charging the final moment. Environmental effects (swirling dust, flickering lights) evolve with events rather than sitting as postcard detail. While tone-true and specific, the space rarely constrains choice beyond atmosphere, so it stays below 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deciphering the pirate broadcast to catalyze dust‑stories—is clear and escalates once via the crescendo and flicker/presence beat. Agency is attentional and artisanal (tuning, transcription) rather than decisional under risk; the cloak gesture hints at danger without altering tactics. The cessation of the broadcast imposes a soft deadline that works, yet no option is visibly foreclosed with cost. The tension remains felt but low‑stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of scarcity, clandestine art, and transforming matter into narrative accrue through the pirate signal and dust’s activation. The final “beacon” and guardian stance offer a resonant, non‑literal answer—story as smuggled ember—without overt moralizing for most of the piece. Some explicitness creeps in (“tasked with keeping the flame”), trimming ambiguity. Subtext lives in images more than conflict, keeping it strong but not piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyric third‑person close tracks Emilia’s sensory priorities (sound, light, particulate movement). Rhythm modulates with the broadcast’s intensification and settles into a charged calm at the end. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; elision is purposeful. Recurrent diction approaches sameness at times but serves the mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished and mostly efficient, with good verb choice and sensory layering. There is some paraphrase/redundancy (mist, “thistled calm,” glow/dial) and a slight purple tendency in stacked modifiers. The crescendo scene stays clear and uncluttered. Overall momentum holds, but tighter cuts would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pirate radio as seed for animating dust into storyforms is a fresh synthesis, and the radio‑as‑beacon reprise is memorable. Risks are taken in committing to a quiet, accumulative ritual rather than plot pyrotechnics. The cloak/presence hint at another vector of originality that isn’t fully developed. The vision coheres and stands apart without feeling gimmicky.</comment>
