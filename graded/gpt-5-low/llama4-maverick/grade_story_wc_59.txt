<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (restore beauty), and the prince’s actions (handling the egg, assembling the device) align with it. Interiority leans abstract (“bitterly sweet nostalgia,” “sense of wonder”) rather than character‑particular. Contradictory impulses (hope/trepidation) are present but lightly dramatized, with minimal embodied cost. The final shift feels felt but not earned through difficult micro‑choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: imagery and tension build to the device’s crescendo and the world’s partial rebirth (Charged Poise/CR). Orientation is strong early, and the single scene coheres. The closure lands, but the on‑page cost remains soft—no sacrifice or irreversible loss beyond fear/tears. The beat chain is clean but low on concrete pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace, stalactites, and mechanical heartbeat create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Details are filtered through the prince’s focus on beauty and machinery, and the egg serves as a charged object. The environment mirrors and amplifies mood but rarely constrains choices or tactics. Strong specificity without the 9‑band constraint link.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (reawaken beauty), and escalation occurs via the device’s assembly and the palace’s shuddering. Opposition remains largely atmospheric; there’s little narrowing of options or a felt price. The climax functions as intensification rather than a pressured trade‑off. Resolution leans on mood over tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of flawed genesis, loss, and restoration emerge through recurring images (egg, mechanical heartbeat) and culminate in a reweighted final image. Some thematic assertions are told rather than earned (“he knew that the world was flawed”). The ending’s repricing is resonant but safe, skirting sentimentality without a hard counterpoint. It lingers, but not sharply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and steady in psychic distance. Diction trends generalized at peaks, with repeated sentence stems (“The prince…”) and abstract nouns. No POV leakage or head‑hopping; stance remains controlled. Rhythm could use more variation to heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clean mechanics, but line‑level shows repetition and overwriting (“quaking reverie,” “mechanical heartbeat” reiterated). Template cadence and paraphrase loops slow momentum, especially in the middle. Figurative density occasionally blurs freshness rather than sharpening specifics. Readable, yet not lean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The suspended palace/egg/mechanical‑rebirth synthesis is appealing and moderately fresh. Execution leans on familiar melancholic tropes and abstract diction, limiting singularity. The final reweighting feels apt but not surprising. Solid originality without bold risk.</comment>
