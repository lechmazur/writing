<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s motive (honor an ancestor) and trait (“nervously confident”) are clear, but we don’t see distinct micro‑choices under pressure beyond “continue researching.” Interiority is largely summarized and iterative rather than dramatized. No earned change or credible renunciation lands on the page by the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Single‑POV and orientation are clear, but the accumulative drive doesn’t culminate in a decisive Charged Poise or Conceptual Repricing with cost. The final line promises a future revelation rather than reconfiguring stakes now. Escalation reads as repetition of mood and intent, leaving closure underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dome, hum of automated systems, and storm outside build atmosphere credibly. However, the setting rarely constrains options or forces a tactical choice. Details serve tone more than action, keeping the effect solid but not integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (uncover hidden truth; honor bravery) but pressure doesn’t tighten through a concrete turn. The “spongey dread” intensifies tonally without narrowing options or forcing a trade‑off. Conflict remains internal and abstract, with no visible price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, pattern‑seeking, and “reversible exile” are evocative, yet handled mostly through assertion. Subtext glints around the nail and coded stanzas but doesn’t transform meaning at closure. The ending gestures at profundity without earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is steady and plausible; diction is consistent. Cadence tends toward repetitive sentence openings and parallel constructions, but the voice remains legible. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Noticeable paraphrase loops (“As the night wore on…”, “The copper nail…”) and reiterations drain momentum. Figurative language is serviceable but generic, with occasional purple phrasing. Information density is modest and propulsion weak in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The blend of meteorology, coded stanzas, and a coffin‑nail talisman is intriguing. Execution leans familiar in its brooding, promise‑of‑revelation mode and avoids bold structural risk. Fresh specifics don’t yet cohere into an indispensable, surprising turn.</comment>
