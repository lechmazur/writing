<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motive (to mend what’s broken) and a credible contradictory impulse (trepidation vs. “prudently daring”) drive her micro‑choices to search, follow, and face the figure. Embodied detail (burned skin’s weight, cold air) lands, but much emotion is abstracted into generalized phrasing. The self‑encounter reads as internal but is not deeply particularized in psychology beyond stated courage. Change is earned if quiet, yet the cost is lightly felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the mist, snow‑codes, and path accrete toward a resonant reconfiguration: embracing the other self. Orientation is clean and the throughline (seek unused courage → follow path → meet self) coheres. Closure lands, but the price of that reconciliation is implied rather than dramatized, lowering impact. The snow‑code device is under‑specified, softening causal tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff, mist, wet earth, and deep snow are vivid and consistent, shaping discovery (path revealed as mist clears, snow as code). The engraved pillbox functions as micro‑setting/object that charges the ending image. Sensory balance leans visual but remains effective. The environment influences access and mood more than it constrains a hard choice, keeping it below the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: summon courage to face what burned her; escalation is a gentle tightening from search to confrontation. The key turn is choosing to approach the figure; consequences remain soft and largely symbolic. There’s little visible cost or foreclosed alternative beyond anxiety. Tension is steady but rarely sharpens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of mending, courage, and self‑reconciliation recur via mist, burn scars, pillbox, and seasonal tilt. The final image offers hope, but several lines verge on direct statement (“world was full of possibility”), dulling subtext. The “unused courage” motif reweights earlier beats, though with a tidy uplift that risks sentimentality. Resonance is present but not layered with counter‑pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and diction coherent, with a controlled, gentle lyric register. Repetitive constructions (“The mist swirled…”, “She felt…”) and familiar idioms flatten distinctiveness. Rhythm is smooth but uniform, particularly near the ending’s uplift. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clean grammar and readable flow, but paraphrase loops and stock formulations dampen momentum (“a sense of…,” “The mist swirled…” repeats). Figurative density is safe rather than surprising; some modifiers feel generic. Information density could be higher with tighter cuts around repeated sentiments. Final third retains clarity but leans on summary cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spy/self confrontation in mist with snow‑codes and a pillbox is a pleasing synthesis, yet the mirror‑self redemption arc is familiar. The snow‑code idea hints at freshness but isn’t exploited tactically. Emotional truth is sincere but not idiosyncratic. Risks are modest and land safely.</comment>
