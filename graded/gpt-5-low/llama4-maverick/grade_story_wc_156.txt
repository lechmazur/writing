<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motive—trading the stifling certainty of mastery for curiosity—is clear and embodied in her micro‑choices (repositioning mirrors, trusting the nickel’s “pulse”). Interiority is grounded in tactile details (humming, pigment, mirrors) rather than labels. However, the cost of her shift is faint; the change lands but feels largely triumphant. A deeper contradiction under pressure (risking the mural’s integrity) would sharpen character stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; escalation builds via sound/mirror density into a crescendo. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the mural animates as she relinquishes certainty. Orientation is clean early; causality holds (mirrors → feedback → transformation). Cost is implied (certainty crumbling) but underweighted, preventing a higher tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and mirrors are vivid and functional, shaping tactics (redirecting waves) and charging the final image (a living mural). Sensory selection supports the premise (hum, water, reflective surfaces). World rules stay consistent enough for the fable‑physics at play. It stops short of 9+ because environmental constraint doesn’t exact a distinct price.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—will she risk destabilizing her controlled craft to pursue awe—and pressure accumulates through the feedback vortex. The tightening is present but gentle; little is truly foreclosed or lost. Resolution is earned by her agency in arranging mirrors, yet the conflict feels low‑risk success‑leaning. A visible consequence to the mural or her role would raise tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of curiosity vs. certainty and art’s permeability emerge from action and recurring objects (hobo nickel as inquiry talisman, mirrors). The final image reweights her premise credibly. Some moralizing intrudes (“she had exchanged certainty for curiosity”), muting subtext. A more oblique close would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical cadence suited to the accumulative design; perceptual bias (sound/color interplay) is distinct. Rhythm swells appropriately toward the crescendo. Minor diction flatness and repetition appear but do not distort POV. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Evocative lines and images carry momentum, but paraphrase loops and intensifiers recur (noise/color vortex described in similar terms). A noticeable copy slip (“had bewitch the mural”) breaks polish. Some purple phrasing blurs edges at peak beats. Tighter cutting and varied syntax would lift the line‑level quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of sound‑reactive pigments, mirror‑redirected waves, and a hobo nickel as inquiry talisman feels fresh. The accumulative “awakening” crescendo is imaginative and coherent. Emotional stakes are familiar, but the method and sensory palette distinguish it. Bolder cost or a sharper rule implication would elevate ingenuity.</comment>
