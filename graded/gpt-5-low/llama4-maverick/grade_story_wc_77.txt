<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear curiosity-versus-fear drive with small micro-choices (examining the clasp, flipping the dictionary, facing the mirror), but interiority relies on generic formulations and repeated phrasing. The “whispering advisor” externalizes pressure, leaving the protagonist’s contradictory impulses underdeveloped. Embodied emotion skews toward clichés (“black as coal,” “siren’s call”) rather than character‑specific textures. The final endurance/renunciation (leaving, haunted) lands but feels lightly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single‑POV accumulative structure holds: movement deeper → mirror → blackout → aftermath. Closure reads as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the narrator exits changed, paying an ongoing cost (haunted echo). Some causal links feel soft (dream dictionary’s mechanics and “resuscitation” mention are under-motivated), but the thread remains legible. The cost is present yet conceptual rather than decisively dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong and specific (fog, must, cracked mirror, faded poster), integrated through action rather than static cataloging. The funhouse and mirror charge the final image, though the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond “go deeper/leave.” Recurring objects (poster, clasp) help texture and tone. Sensory range leans visual but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pursue the mystery/harness luminance vs. safety/sanity) is present, and pressure escalates to the mirror apparition. Agency is mostly “press on” under the advisor’s prodding; the blackout removes decisive choice at peak. The cost (haunted aftereffect) lands but the narrowing of options and a true trade‑off are faint. Stakes stay abstract rather than viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of seductive dread, art/image entrapment, and the cost of looking accrue through objects and recurrence (poster → mirror → final echo). The advisor’s last line risks thematic tag‑lining rather than emerging solely from image. The resonance is genuine but not reweighted by a sharp moral calculus or non‑literal turn. Insight arises, but more through trope echo than singular lived particular.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and readable; the voice achieves a coherent gothic cadence. Repetition of constructions (“The whispering advisor’s voice…”) and elevated diction drift toward purple, flattening rhythm. Few surprises in syntax or lexis; the perceptual signature is serviceable but not distinct. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line level shows redundancy and cliché (“siren’s call,” “black as coal,” “gentle breeze”), plus paraphrase loops that don’t add pressure. Figurative density sometimes muddies rather than sharpens. Mechanics are clean, but momentum stalls under repeated stems and intensifiers. The climax image is clear but not cutting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Core ingredients lean familiar (abandoned funhouse, cursed model, whispering voice). The “dream dictionary with paradoxical notes” and “lingering luminance” add flavor but don’t transform the frame. Turns feel expected rather than inevitable-and-surprising. Risk-taking is modest; conceptual freshness is partial.</comment>
