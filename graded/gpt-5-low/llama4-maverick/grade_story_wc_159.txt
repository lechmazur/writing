<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (preserving forgotten names) and actions align (tending, singing), but interior conflict is limited and largely summarized as “foxglove regret.” The piece rarely forces contradictory impulses into contact on the page. Loneliness and devotion register as cost, yet no micro‑choice truly tests her values. The ending’s endurance reads earned but low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the song and ensuing light create a cadence shift that reweights the stake, landing as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is firm from the opening; the scene holds single‑POV coherence. Cost is felt but soft, tied to ongoing duty and solitude rather than a narrowed option set. Closure is present but modest in consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal library, glass orchids, and cracked bamboo wind chime are vivid and sensorially specific, integrated through action (tending, singing, illumination). The environment consistently mirrors and carries the emotional charge. While it charges the final image, it rarely constrains choice tactically. Still, the setting is memorable and coherently rules the piece’s atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract (“preserve forgotten names”), with minimal pressure escalation. The song briefly intensifies the moment but doesn’t foreclose options or present a trade‑off. There’s no palpable reversal; the conflict is largely maintenance versus entropy. The cost (loneliness, ongoing vigilance) is acknowledged but not stressed to a decisive test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Memory, loss, and custodianship cohere through recurring images (orchids, chime, song). The ending’s quiet endurance offers resonance without moralizing. Some thematic statements verge on telling rather than arising entirely from action. Nevertheless, the final illumination reweights the premise effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person with stable psychic distance suits the piece. Diction is elevated but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; rhythm generally supports the mood. Occasional ornate phrasing skirts purple but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clear but leans into repetition and ornamental phrasing (“deserted marvels,” “foxglove regret”) without always adding new pressure. Some paraphrase loops and redundant image restatements slow momentum. Figurative density is high in calm beats without a patterned payoff. The final third remains legible but could be tighter and less repetitious.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Imagery like “museum of extinct feelings,” glass orchids, and the cracked bamboo chime feels fresh and coheres. The premise risks lyric abstraction but follows through with a specific ritual (song) and charged objects. The arc is familiar (caretaker preserving memory) yet authentically rendered. Ingenuity is solid, though not transformative at the level of stakes.</comment>
