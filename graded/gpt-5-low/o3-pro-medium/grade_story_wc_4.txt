<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive and method are precise and embodied—she arranges photographs by smile‑arcs and invites reconfiguration—but internal conflict is muted and resistance minimal. Her “perceptively calm” stance enables others’ revelations credibly. The micro‑choices (pinning, sequencing, inviting the crowd to rearrange, then sketching the mural) track cleanly with motive. The cost is soft—more held risk than jeopardy—tempering peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images, scent, and song thicken into a communal rearrangement that results in a charged plan (RR). Closure lands in the mural decision and the town’s quiet “yes,” with a conceptual cost of owning grief and committing labor. Orientation is clear from the outset; the beats link smoothly without outline-y “and then.” Cost is present but gentle, keeping it just below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lavender–factory ruin is vivid, sensorially layered, and tactically used (beams as laundry lines; lavender scent drawing townsfolk; walls as mural site). The lantern’s lilac cast and the lavender’s final glow charge the ending image. Details are filtered through Lyra’s archivist eye, avoiding tourist cataloging. Strong environmental agency supports theme and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes—communal ache vs. a viable practice of healing—are evident early and deepen as townsfolk engage, rearrange, and sing. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through direct opposition; “hands shook at first” is the only resistance. The decisive narrowing is the group’s consent to a shared mural, which forecloses solitary grief. Lack of sharper friction keeps the tension moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts—rearranging photos by arcs, shared song, and a plan to paint—without sermonizing, though a couple of lines edge close to thesis (“Collective healing was not a slogan”). The final image reweights prior motifs (lavender glow as guide) with earned hope, not sentimentality. Subtext in the lilac tint “coaxing dormant stories” is deft. Resonance lingers with the quiet, communal “yes.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with Lyra’s sensibility. Patterned imagery is taught early (lavender, arcs, lilac light) and sustained. No head-hopping or stance leakage; elision is purposeful. The voice modulates subtly from hush to communal shimmer at the song beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line work is polished, image-dense, and varied in rhythm; metaphors remain coherent to scent/light/music. Minor risk of purple excess is kept in check by concrete action (pinning, stringing, sketching). No noticeable loops or scaffolding; sentences often carry multiple jobs. The closing cadence lands cleanly without blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist-as-conductor of communal memory via smile‑arcs is fresh, with lavender-industrial juxtaposition providing a distinctive frame. The communal rearrangement and lullaby pivot avoid cliché and feel earned. Risk lies in high-lyric mode, which holds together. Quiet, specific ingenuity over clever twist.</comment>
