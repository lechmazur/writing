<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear—arrive to barter stolen time—then reoriented by the “Listen” cue into an earned renunciation with felt cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific (“shadows sharpened and people grew careless with their faces”; “heart answered each whistle”). The crucial choice to open the jar and forgo trade reads as a credible shift grounded in her savvy pattern‑reading. The boy-as-younger-self reveal deepens identity without breaking motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the flower‑code, sketch sigils, and reinterpreted announcements build to the decision to open the jar here. Closure lands on the page with cost (“jar… now empty”) and a reconfigured future (the argent door). Causality is coherent within the mythic logic; the boy emerges as past‑self rather than a random fix. One continuous scene with a single dominant stake maintains structural clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station is vividly rendered and functionally constraining: emerald lights, announcements as prophecy, rails humming—environment actively instructs and compels the opening of the jar. The jar and station serve as micro‑settings that charge the final image (argent door). Sensory selection feels lived, not touristic, and the world rules are discovered in action. The setting’s transformation is integral to the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to trade with Miratone or obey the station’s demand; reinterpretation tightens options decisively. The price—relinquishing hoarded moments—is unmistakable and changes her status and future. While there’s no adversarial force, internal and situational pressures interlock convincingly. The step through the door reads as a committed choice, not a drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of theft vs. gift, attention as agency, and time’s ethical custody arise organically from particulars (moonbeam jar, returned wishes, the “Listen” bouquet). The ending reweights the premise: true value is in restoring light and stepping with one’s younger self toward possibility. No moralizing; resonance lingers via image rather than thesis. The conceptual repricing of “stealing” moments is elegant and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice filters the world through Mara’s perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are consistent under pressure. Limited dialogue is purposeful and charged (“Hold this against the jar”). Psychic distance is stable and apt; no head‑hopping. Lushness remains legible and supports rather than blurs action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme) with minimal scaffold; rhythm varies well. Figurative density is high but coherent—no mixed metaphors that muddy key beats. Phrasing like “contraband constellations” and “rails hum… like vocal cords” is vivid and purposeful. Minor purple tendencies never slow momentum or obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: a portrait thief stealing histories, moonbeams as currency, flower‑coded broker, station announcements as prophecy. The younger‑self guide and station‑as‑buyer twist feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and concept pay off, heightening stakes without confusion. The final door image authentically reimagines closure rather than leaning on genre templates.</comment>
