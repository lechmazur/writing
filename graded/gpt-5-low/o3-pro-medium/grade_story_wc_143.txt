<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Halina’s motive—capture the last natural plume before engineers end eruptions—drives every micro‑choice (stealing the vial, programming flares, enduring the cold). Interiority is concrete and embodied (fogged visor, mineral smell, static on her tongue). The internal tension (historian vs. “not a saboteur”) adds nuance without stealing focus. Change at the end is an earned endurance/renunciation: she accepts the loss and commits to preserving memory with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when and intent by ~120 words), and cause flows cleanly from set‑ups (vial trigger → flares → phased photography). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the hush lifts, drones intrude, and she descends carrying the grain’s “silence,” with the conceptual cost of a final unmanufactured morning made explicit on the page. The live clock (sunrise and “heaters tomorrow”) shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit, wind, Earthlight, and the observation pod are specific and lived‑in, filtered through a crater inspector’s priorities. Tools (tripod, camera, vial, flares) and environment constrain tactics and stage the visuals; the hush and rising sun modulate perception and options. World rules (heaters ending eruptions; low gravity implied) stay consistent. The final image is inseparable from place: dawn, drones, thinning plume, and silence carried down the slope.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake: witness/document before the irreversible change. Escalation is a quiet tightening consistent with the lens—tremor → plume → timed flares → sun’s rim → drones’ chatter; the hush deepens, then breaks. The cost is clear (the end of natural mornings and her complicity by witnessing rather than resisting), though external jeopardy remains low. Agency is steady endurance and precise timing rather than a reversal, which fits but limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory vs. manufactured progress; witnessing as resistance—emerges through particulars (stolen grain, phased flares, “last unmanufactured morning”). Subtext is carried in the hush, the cracked vial, and the drones’ practical voices cutting the vigil. Insights are earned, not moralized, with the final cadence repricing what “space age” means. A hair of explicitness in the archival frame is present but does not flatten the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with a distinct perceptual signature (geologic benedictions, isotope readings alongside sensory minutiae). Psychic distance is stable; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythmic control under pressure (shortening around the eruption and flare‑lighting) supports the scene. Minimal dialogue functions as texture and contrast without breaking stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, varied, and propulsive; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, and action). Figurative language is vivid but controlled; images like “dragon‑scale shadows” and “ghostly banner” are coherent and setting‑true. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter slow momentum. A few stacked metaphors approach richness but stop short of purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a lunar crater inspector staging chemical flares with a mythic hourglass grain to photograph a last plume under a “dawning hush.” Risks (quiet conflict, lyric cadence, talismanic object) pay off without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from seeded particulars rather than gimmickry. The final carry of “the nightwatch’s grain and the mountain’s goodbye” is memorable and distinct.</comment>
