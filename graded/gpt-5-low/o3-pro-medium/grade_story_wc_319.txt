<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority: a “feral library guardian” torn between stray impulse and custodial duty. Micro‑choices (waiting, pocketing the pendant, declining to step through) align with the desire to “make friends with uncertainty.” Embodied emotion comes via tactile images (breath trade, ache behind ribs) rather than labels. The cost—refusing the doorway—is subtle but felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pendant discovery → spiral as handle → radiance/images → chosen stance produces a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis close. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the first lines). Closure cost is legible in the refusal to pass through, accepting an ongoing guard’s burden. The final image reweights prior motifs (sundial shadow, margins, boundaries of light) without mechanical explain‑all.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is rich and active: frozen garden, mist, sundial, and rime directly shape action (finding the pendant, placing it on the sundial’s absent shadow). The environment charges the final image (stitched light/frost, traveling threshold) and constrains options to the garden-stage now. Sensory specificity is consistent and POV‑driven. World rules cue through observation, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—engage the threshold or remain with uncertainty—is signaled early and tightened by the pendant warming and door‑handle realization. The meaningful trade‑off is presence over passage; friendship with uncertainty requires refusal now. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the textural lens. Stakes remain internal yet consequential to the role and future pages guarded.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around thresholds, waiting, and “potential” cults; subtext arrives via margins, sundial shadow, and dawn held in rumor. The explicit line “I want to make friends with uncertainty” risks on‑the‑nose but is supported by enacted choice and imagery. The ending offers a resonant answer: thresholds travel with listeners; Earned Stasis over decisive conquest. No sermonizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent first‑person focalization; perceptual signature is memorable (“interiorizing exteriors”). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and brief dialogue is integrated as action. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; uncertainty is rendered as perception, not authorial gloss. Diction is elevated but character‑coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet purposeful; images multitask (sundial shadow as time and absence). Minimal redundancy; cadence varies; sentences carry information density without muddle. A high figurative quotient skirts purple but remains coherent and scene‑advancing. Final images are crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: feral librarian, hoarfrost garden, pendant as spiral-door, and “interiorizing exteriors” feel singular. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The reweighting at the end reads inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth—choosing charged poise over answer—grounds the originality.</comment>
