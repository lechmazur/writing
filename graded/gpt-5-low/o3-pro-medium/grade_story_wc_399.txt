<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation to preserve rather than proclaim is clear and coherently embodied through ritual choices (conjuring stillness, delaying the opening). Interiority is particular and sensory-driven (“reading a library” of sand), though internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely doubts or strains. The renunciation cost (anonymity, carrying the weight without speaking) lands but could sharpen with one moment of temptation. Actions align with a disciplined temperament, yielding a credible Earned Stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: quiet, ritualized steps cohere toward a charged consecration and departure. Causality is clean—clearings enable opening; parapet extends to reflect light; the ripple compresses into a burden carried. Closure arrives on the page with a felt price (to carry and not speak), and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation is firm from the first lines; no causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The desert, pavilion, and kinetic parapet are vivid and functional, not decorative—the environment literally supplies the tactic (light via parapet) that achieves consecration. Sensory detail is purposeful, modulating from hush to deeper hush to the sunlight strike. World rules are learned through action and remain consistent. The setting charges the final image and constrains choice, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: safeguard the echo without leakage. Escalation is a soft but meaningful tightening—she must build stillness, then risk unsealing, then commit the echo to her body. The cost is internal and vocational, not combative; no antagonist, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens. A single deepening turn (consecration compressing history into her chest) narrows options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—preservation over utterance—emerges through concrete ritual, the hush architecture, and Lira’s renunciatory stance. However, the explicit aphorism “Wisdom, once spoken, scatters; preserved, it walks” states the thesis, undercutting subtext at the finish. Subtext otherwise works in images (weight like a harmless stone; anonymity accepted) that could stand without the moral. The piece invites reflection but trims its own ambiguity with that final line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature tuned to balance and hush. Diction and rhythm suit the world’s logic; compression is purposeful and legible. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the voice modulates subtly at the consecration beat without breaking tone. Elevated language remains within the story’s idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet controlled; metaphors cohere (sand as library, parapet as spine) and perform multiple jobs. Few redundancies; momentum carries through ritual beats. Density of figurative language is high but not muddled, with clear sequencing around the ramp, light, and compression. Minor repetition of “hush” serves motif rather than padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—kinetic parapet, conjured clearings, a wisdom ripple archived in a body—feels singular and earned. Risks in tone and worldbuilding cohere without gimmickry, and the final reconfiguration is inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is quiet but specific. Slight safety in conflict keeps it short of revelatory, but it’s distinctly fresh.</comment>
