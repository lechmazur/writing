<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corvin’s motives (preserve method over myth) drive concrete choices—leaving the sewer, engaging Mara, choosing the descent. His abrasive calm wavers (“doubt seep in”), revealing contradiction and cost before a tempered acceptance. The relationship with Mara functions as a crucible that reframes his stance without erasing his flaw. Embodied details (low-tide climb, wire-hung cog) root interiority in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: cog → ascent → debate → descent through sediment → cog in sextant → star chart → joint decision as custodians. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: he reframes “story vs data” into verifiable narrative and accepts co‑custodianship. Minor neatness in the cog fitting a corroded socket flirts with convenience but doesn’t undercut the earned payoff. Orientation is crisp and maintained across the two‑shard structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drowned city is vividly functional: low tide dictates timing; lagoon, mud, and collapsed halls constrain movement and tactics. Details are POV‑filtered (“algae‑filtered dusk,” “lotus sprouting from shattered figureheads”) and evolve with action. The micro‑setting of the museum/vault materially enables the closure. Specificity serves pressure rather than postcard effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evidence vs myth) is established early and tightens via Mara’s counterclaim and the decision to test sedimentary proof. The descent is an escalation that risks safety and worldview; the price lands in Corvin’s tempered admission and shared custodianship. Stakes skew conceptual over visceral, but the scene still narrows options credibly. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; their agency does.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through event and image: gears, sediment, tides, and star maps turn “story vs proof” into a synthesis (“the stars were a narrative too, but one that tolerated verification”). The final agreement reframes truth as method‑backed narrative without sermonizing. A slightly on‑the‑nose line brushes the edge of telling but is justified by the moment’s verification. Resonance lingers through the custodianship choice and dawn image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, textured, and character‑specific, balancing lyric density with clarity; diction fits Corvin’s philosophical bent without academic drift. Dialogue carries subtextual clash and advances action (“let the archives decide”). Psychic distance tightens at pressure points without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well between thought and motion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do multiple jobs and momentum rarely sags. Figurative language is vivid yet coherent (“roofs became reefs”) and doesn’t swamp sense during peak beats. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; syntax varies to match tension. A few lush phrases flirt with purple but stay purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Flood‑ruin plus sedimentary epistemology and a cog‑triggered sextant create a fresh synthesis; the museum planetarium reveal feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece risks a conceptual debate in a short form and grounds it in tactile action. The originality is organic to character and world, not gimmick. Emotional truth (doubt, concession) keeps the novelty honest.</comment>
