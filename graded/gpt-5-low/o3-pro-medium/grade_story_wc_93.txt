<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Aikan’s motive—honoring a childhood promise and deciphering eel‑logic—is clear and drives concrete, ritualized choices. The precognitive curse adds pressure and texture to his micro‑moves (dust against temples, eel lullabies), with embodied detail (tears orbiting). Internal contradiction is present but mild: fear of misalignment versus serene devotion. The final acceptance trades torment for guidance in a way that feels earned, if a touch low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats stack cleanly: arrival under aurora → stone sequences → star dust activation → revelation → final stone → eel bargain → friction returns. Orientation is strong early, and closure lands on the page with a decisive change (friction restored, curse reconfigured). Cost is more conceptual/emotional than punishing, but the risk of “snarling” future and the covenant weight provide sufficient pressure. No causality breaks; the pattern teaching pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly particular (tidal bluff under aurora, soundless surf) and directly constrains tactics (no friction forces desire‑anchoring). Environmental rules stay consistent and charge the final image when friction returns. Objects-as-setting (star dust, painted stones) are integrated as lived tools rather than décor. Sensory selection and tone are purposeful and character-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate storm-logic to restore balance) is signaled early, with a meaningful tightening when the dust outlines one precise missing number. The choice to place the final glyph-stone and accept the eels’ offer functions as the climactic act. The hinted catastrophic alternative (“future … snarling”) sharpens stakes, though the resolution arrives smoothly with limited visible loss. Pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for this length and lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: covenant over abstraction, translation as care, miracles restoring the mundane. The final cadence (“raspy, deliciously ordinary”) reweights the luminous ritual with a grounded ethic. The eel chorus and circular dance recast “understanding sacred patterns” as a lived promise kept. Resonance lingers without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (mathematical sequences, eel‑lullaby sensibility). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure and remain legible; no head‑hopping. The brief collective-voice “dialogue” lands as image-driven action rather than expository speech. Slight lushness never tips into confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density; images often do double duty (star dust as tool and cosmology). A few metaphors cluster, but coherence holds and momentum rarely stalls. Sentence rhythm varies well, with clean syntax and minimal scaffold. The ending image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elusive eel herder + vanished friction + math‑ritual stones + auroral negotiation is a striking, specific synthesis. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (migration map revelation; miracles restore the mundane) rather than gimmicky. Risks in worldbuilding and diction pay off with coherence and fresh emotional truth. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
