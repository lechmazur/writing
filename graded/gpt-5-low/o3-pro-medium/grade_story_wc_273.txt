<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sulin’s motivation is clear and character-specific, with the “serene anger” and “consciously wild” tension giving him a distinctive interior engine. His need for measurement against instinct lands in the micro-choice to spill the ink and declare a motive. The decision to descend rather than immediately free the campers forecloses an easier path and reads as a costed commitment. Minor note: internal contradiction is present but could bite harder at the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: camp investigation → ink grammar → door → revelation of harvested crisis-time → decision to descend. The closure is a Charged Poise with cost: he chooses pursuit of architects over immediate rescue, risking self and delaying the campers’ release. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the pattern (ink grammar as gateway) is taught and paid off. Only slight openness on the mechanics of cost prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: wind, dust, eclipse dark, and especially the ink as micro‑setting that constrains choices and becomes the floor, mirror, and well. The hummingbird drone and vortex-trimmed air add tactile specificity and tool-pressure. World rules are learned via action (ink grammar) and charged in the final image. The environment consistently shapes tactics rather than acting as décor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused and escalates: from mystery at the encampment to a metaphysical engine beneath the scene. The meaningful tightening arrives when the chamber’s purpose is revealed, forcing Sulin to choose between immediate aid and deeper pursuit. Cost is legible as delay and peril, with his promise to return sharpening the tension. A single on‑page reversal is sufficient at this length and lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of crisis-time, fear as harvested energy, and the ethics of conversion into power resonate through concrete beats (ink code, suspended campers, archival order). The final choice offers a non‑literal answer: justice requires entering the engine that commodifies fear, not simply escaping it. The “serene anger” reframes measurement vs. wildness as a moral stance rather than a temperament. No moralizing undercuts the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherently filtered through Sulin’s perceptual bias (“every breeze tasted of interrupted questions”). Elevated diction matches the speculative tone and maintains POV modesty. Rhythmic modulation accompanies pressure increases (from observation to entry to descent). No head-hopping or gratuitous elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense but purposeful, with images doing multiple jobs (ink as image, system, and portal). Figurative language is consistent and rarely mixed; momentum rarely stalls. Minimal scaffold or repetition, and sentences vary in length and cadence. The high-poetic register stays clear and avoids purple excess at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: disappearing ink as fluid-math grammar, a fear-time harvest chamber, and a microblade hummingbird drone cohere around a moral and procedural puzzle. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the code is recognized. Risk-taking in conceit and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final commitment image feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
