<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Marlo’s motive (direction through bargaining with his ghost) is clear and sustained, and his hesitation at “contaminating the cavity” with regret shows a live contradiction resolved by choosing to surrender the stolen fragments. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (boots unsure of chronology; rust on notebooks). The final change—carrying stories rather than stealing—feels earned by prior beats. Slight thematic baldness in lines stating the bargain prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal dominance: because he seeks recognition, he braves the lily pads, retrieves the camera wheel, confronts the ghost, and must fill the cavity under time pressure. Closure lands on‑page with cost—he gives up curated fragments to animate the ghost’s compass and reconfigure his path. Orientation is clear early and maintained; no teleports or resets. The carousel’s restart provides a crisp cadence shift tied to the bargain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, erasing lily pads, misted voices, and carousel‑horse pier are vivid and rule‑consistent, discovered through action. Setting constrains choices (memory‑erasing pads, time acceleration) and charges the final image (carousel reanimates to launch him). Objects/tools (camera wheel) function as micro‑setting and shape tactics. Sensory detail is rich yet purpose‑driven across the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the outset, with escalation via the lagoon’s acceleration and the ghost’s demand to “fill this.” The meaningful tightening comes when he must choose what to give, risking contaminating the cavity, under a live temporal threat (“before chronology tears completely”). The resolution proceeds from his agency, not luck. Cost is felt in relinquishing stolen voices to alter his mode of moving through time.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of authorship versus theft, regret as currency, and ethical stewardship of stories arise organically from concrete acts (releasing giggle, sigh, curse). The final image reweights the premise without sermon, though “he understands the bargain” approaches a thesis statement. Subtext in the chosen fragments maps beginnings/endings/motion elegantly. Resonance lingers as a reorientation rather than a neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—mechanics, clouds, and time noticed through a scavenger’s bias. Diction and rhythm remain controlled under pressure; brief dialogue is spare and charged. No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty; the ghost’s voice is artfully spliced from fragments. A couple aphoristic sentences slightly flatten the otherwise singular voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and varied cadence aligned to pressure shifts. A few elevated formulations (“Recognition is the first step…,” “he understands the bargain”) brush against tell and faint purple, but clarity and propulsion remain intact. No paraphrase loops or mechanical scaffolding. Final image is sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—kinetic lagoon, carousel‑horse pier, disposable camera wheel, and story‑fragments as heart‑fuel—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in world logic and tone pay off with coherence and closure. Turns arise from established rules and character choice rather than late conveniences. Emotional truth (transforming theft into stewardship) grounds the novelty.</comment>
