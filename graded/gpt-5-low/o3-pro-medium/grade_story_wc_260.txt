<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Calder’s motive (admiration vs. truth) is explicit and his micro-choices (trimming adjectives, stitching pauses, burning the dyed lining) embody inner conflict with tactile specificity. The admission “I wanted admiration more than truth” lands as earned rather than proclaimed. The tenderness with creatures counterweights his fraud credibly, giving the change a felt cost. Slight neatness—little active resistance to change—keeps it shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: ritual actions intensify toward dawn’s forced stance. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he renounces trickery and steps toward judgment with a repaired sign, accepting ridicule as price. Stakes and cost are on the page (“awaiting verdict,” exile pressure). Minor softness in external opposition presence prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The misty workshop, brazier, bone knife, and tail tip create a tactile micro-setting that shapes tactics (burning deceit, sewing truth) and charges the final image (mist-parted path). Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven across sight, smell, and touch. The liminal location (between village and wilderness) mirrors and pressures the choice. Fully integrated without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrity vs. banishment—tightens via ritual purges and the approaching dawn; the decision to return with honest demonstrations forecloses the path of deceit. Cost is legible: social risk and loss of comfort in applause. External pressure is mostly offstage but coherently present. The brazier sequences function as escalating tests of commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of adaptation through shedding layers is threaded through recurring images (tail tip, burning lining, stitched pauses) and reweighted at the end. The piece earns its insight by concrete action rather than sermon; the owl and mist supply subtextual acceptance. One explicit thematic line risks overstatement but remains grounded in scene. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person maintains steady psychic distance with clean focalization; diction and rhythm match Calder’s tenderness and guilt. Patterned imagery (“silver,” “shimmering,” “mist”) is consistent without monotone. The single spoken admission breaks the hush effectively. No head‑hopping, no register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with varied sentence rhythm and purposeful figurative language; images do double duty (brazier as tool and judgment). Minimal redundancy; metaphors cohere to the shedding/adaptation motif. A few lush lines flirt with purple but never blur sense. Syntax and punctuation are clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ritual of literally unmaking deceit (cutting adjectives, sewing pauses) around a chameleon’s tail feels fresh and specific. The liminal workshop and dawn verdict avoid cliché through craft. Not radical in premise, but the synthesis is memorable and sincere. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off.</comment>
