<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are clear and consistently rooted in “decisive kindness,” and her micro‑choices (borrowing the shard, building the track, approaching Mateo silently) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is shown through sensory attention rather than abstract labels, with embodied perception guiding action. The weakness is limited internal contradiction—Mara rarely falters—yet the hospice time pressure supplies credible stakes. Hector and Mateo’s brief on‑page presence still shifts status dynamics credibly at the bedside.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the layering of mundane sounds culminates in a charged hand‑over that reconfigures the estranged relationship. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “decades of regret began to loosen,” with the felt cost of imminent death and time’s narrowing window. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and each move is a motivated “therefore” within the lyric frame. The final image (“waiting to be called for the final verse”) seals the cost and cadence rather than soft‑resetting it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and particular (“anchored ship in milk,” “vapor roses”) and integrated through action, not postcard description. The vinyl shard functions as a micro‑setting/tool that constrains choices and charges the final image. The above‑clouds hospice inflects tone and tactics (protecting “pulsing stillness”) even if it doesn’t force hard logistical choices. Sensory selection is purposeful across sound, smell, and touch with consistent world rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (a flawless goodbye via reunification) is signaled early and tightens once hours are confirmed. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: composing, testing with Hector, then risking entry to Mateo’s room, each step narrowing options under the ticking clock. The price—exposure of grief and the last chance to repair—reads on the page in Mateo’s breakdown and Hector’s spent vitality. The quiet form maintains pressure without deflation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around transforming menace into music and grief into connection; subtext works through gesture and sound rather than thesis. The “scent of hope” and the vinyl shard reweight earlier material at the end, avoiding moral summary. The piece resists sentimentality by keeping costs live (the death is imminent; “final verse” is not euphemized). The resonance lingers as a humane, craft‑driven answer: art can midwife a goodbye, not cancel loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is stable, lyrical, and filtered through a music therapist’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and distinctive. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful, with indirection serving subtext. The voice modulates with pressure—lusher during composition, tauter in the bedside sequence—without leakage. No head‑hopping or unnatural register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density; figurative language is vivid and largely coherent (“ship in milk,” “lightning air”). A few metaphors flirt with lushness, but momentum holds and sentences do multiple jobs. Variations in sentence length manage cadence across turns, and paraphrase loops are minimal. Mechanics are clean and unintrusive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transforming hospital machinery into a bolero‑inflected farewell via a broken record shard is a fresh, organic synthesis. The risks—lyric mode, quiet stakes, minimal dialogue—pay off with clarity and emotional truth. Specifics (lipstick ghost on the label, IV/oxygen/monitor orchestrated) make the concept irreplaceable. The final charged poise feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
