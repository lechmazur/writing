<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orielle’s motive—protecting fragile, memory‑orchids—reads cleanly and intensifies into a choice to descend, not just maintain. The “foxglove regret” provides a credible contradiction that softens, not vanishes, at the end. Agency is strong in the repair, descent, and name‑rescue beats. Slight ding: her competence faces little friction, so struggle costs feel mostly conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine. Repairing the cracked chime via song opens the forbidden corridor, descent awakens names, and the return reconfigures the library into archive‑garden—a resonant reconfiguration with a visible ongoing cost (endless remaining names, lingering regret). Orientation is immediate and stable. The closure lands on page without hand‑waving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The opal library, bamboo chime, mirrors, and glass orchids are vivid and tactically involved: the space and tools constrain choices and power the fix and descent. World rules are learned via action (crystalline grooves, gramophone, mirror mouths) rather than exposition. The chime as lantern and mirror‑garden charge the final image. Economy stays focused while maintaining sensuous texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names/memories) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as a deepening from maintenance to transgressive descent. The meaningful tightening is the corridor opening and choosing to go down, with the repayment in awakened names. Cost is more conceptual/missionary than perilous; no strong resistance meets her in scene. Still, escalation reads as a decisive intensification under the lyric lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of language death, custodianship, and transforming regret into purpose emerge organically through concrete acts (mending by song; giving mouths back). The final image reweights the premise: the library as archive‑garden with a charged duty ahead, not a neat fix. No moralizing; resonance lingers via the “trace of foxglove regret.” The motifs (song, chime, orchids, mirrors) evolve rather than repeat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistent, lyric third‑person close voice carries distinctive diction (“opal,” “cloudbone,” “museum of extinct feelings”) without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well across beats; compression is purposeful and legible. No dialogue needed; perception feels character‑filtered by vocation and regret. Minor lushness never breaks control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and sensuous with high information density; images usually do multiple jobs. Repetition functions as motif rather than loop, and syntax varies to keep momentum. A few stacked metaphors flirt with purple, but coherence holds and closures stay clear. No copy or logic errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise and image system feel singular: repairing memory‑orchids via fossilized farewells, mirrors regaining mouths through timbre. Turns are earned from established rules; nothing reads like a late bolt‑on. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
