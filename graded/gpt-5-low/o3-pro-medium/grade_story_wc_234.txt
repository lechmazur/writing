<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cressida’s motive (bottle the “density of presence”) is concrete and drives choices; her renunciation is earned by the shell’s tests and Roan’s whispered injunction. Interiority is sensorial and particular (salt, star-dust; equations reshelving), with credible contradiction between ambition and ethical caution. Roan’s “scientifically romantic” pressure lands via his attempted capture and consequent burn, sharpening their dynamic. The final choice forecloses mastery with a felt cost (she gives up the powerful, city-healing path for principled uncertainty).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: arrival → experiment → shattering/injury → visionary fork → renunciation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “revalue success” leads to scattering the colors and sealing the shell, with cost legible in the deferred cure and surrendered control. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within the opening lines and stays coherent. Causal links within the lyric mode are clear enough; set-ups (shell, instruction) pay off in the final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ember nexus is vivid and functional: heat shimmer, slagglass pools, basalt slab, and the shell-as-lighthouse constrain method and mood. Environmental rules emerge via action (colors bending gravity; space sagging; burn from shard) and charge the ending (nexus sighs; shell pulsing). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a professional gaze. The setting shapes tactics (camp on basalt, lenses laid out) and the final image wouldn’t land without this place’s physics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to capture presence and how to value “success”—tightens through the experiment’s failure and the injury, then spikes with the ethical visions. The decisive turn is Cressida’s renunciation: scattering the colors and sealing the shell. Cost is explicit (forgoing immediate world-healing power while averting weaponization), and agency drives the outcome. Tension layers internally and externally without needing an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of revaluation and ethical restraint arises from particulars: the shell’s song, the burn, gravity-bending colors, and the forked futures. Subtext runs through tactile choices (pressing shell to wound; scattering color), and the final image reweights the premise without sermonizing. A few aphoristic lines (“We revalue success…”) flirt with explicit statement, but are grounded by action and cost. The ending’s charged poise invites reflection without closing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lush, and consistent with a technical-lyric sensibility; POV remains stable around Cressida with clean access to Roan only via observable action and speech. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure (from hushed wonder to sharper, ethical clarity). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying weight by implication (“Revalue everything”). No head-hopping or register drift undermines the stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet disciplined; images (pocket-sun threads, slagglass pools, chorus of presence) are fresh and carry multiple jobs. Syntax varies and momentum holds; no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors blunt the closure. A consistently high figurative register risks excess but remains legible and purposeful, especially in the climax and denouement. The final lines compress image and theme cleanly without bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemy of “presence,” a nautilus columella singing equations, and an ethic of revaluation—feels singular and inevitable by the end. Risks (lyric science, accumulative structure, conceptual closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule-drops, and the worldbuilding is idiosyncratic yet coherent. The shell’s pain-drink and the choice to scatter unresolved colors are notably original inflections.</comment>
