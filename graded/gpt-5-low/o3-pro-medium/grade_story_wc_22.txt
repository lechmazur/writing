<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular: to restore the battlefield without chemicals and to honor a lapsed treaty. Interiority is embodied through action (reading foam, refusing to move during the “fragile congress”) rather than label‑speak. Internal contradiction is subtler than ideal—he reads as serenely competent, with little on‑page self‑conflict—but the endurance and renunciation of former work (passengers) land. The final choice to become an itinerant storyteller‑gardener credibly extends his established values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from seed prep to avian liturgy to tidal/mist response, culminating in sprouts and a reweighted world. Closure arrives on the page with cost and change: war ground becomes garden, “battle lines…redrawn by chlorophyll,” and he commits to an ongoing circuit. Orientation is clean from the opening; the reef’s prior death coherently motivates tactics. The cost is more conceptual and elegiac than visceral, but it’s felt and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and consequential: the dead reef’s iron‑flat water, the jetty, the blasted meadow, and bird routes all constrain tactics. Environmental rules (treaty, silt clauses, bacterial spray, brackish sheets) are learned through action and shape the ritual. The final images (sprouts in ranks; new reefs budding) are charged by earlier spatial specifics. Sensory selection is disciplined and POV‑filtered, avoiding cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield in harmony with sea—tightens via the bird‑convened congress and his tactical stillness to avoid disruption. The avian clauses escalating to mist and seed‑kiss reads as a decisive deepening under the chosen lens. Cost is gentle but legible: he forgoes speed and certainty for ritual, patience, and the risk of failure. Resolution grows from his agency and renunciation rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of reciprocity, stewardship, and language as ecology emerge organically from acts (translation, liturgy, planting). The submerged concord concept reweights the ending without didactic moralizing; “battle lines…redrawn by chlorophyll” is a strong non‑literal answer. One line edges toward authorial statement (“memory is best fertilized with story”), but it’s enacted immediately by his coastal tour. The final petals “reciting the dead languages of peace” offers resonant, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with coherent focalization; diction and metaphor feel native to this mind. Rhythm varies with pressure, and the patterned mythic registers (reef‑Latin, barnacle‑Greek) are taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or register drift; the accumulative mode stays legible. The prose modulates cleanly from ritual stillness to expansive touring without losing signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet purposeful; images do multiple jobs (reef eye, cartridges, coin rubbings) without muddle. Momentum rarely stalls despite density; scaffolding and loops are minimal. A few stacked metaphors flirt with excess, but clarity holds and the closure image is sharp. Syntax and paragraphing breathe in step with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis: avian jurisprudence, coral treaties, and dead‑language agronomy cohere in character and world logic. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (bird clauses prompting tide; seeds as passengers by the end). Risks in mythopoetic world‑building heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration is both surprising and earned.</comment>
