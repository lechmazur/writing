<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Milo’s motive (to “puzzle out new equations for hope”) is clear and enacted through concrete, expert micro‑choices. His steadied “stoic wonder” resists easy uplift, and the moment he orients planters by sextant shows character revealed under pressure. Internal contradiction (neither hopeful nor cynical) is credible but lightly pressed, so the felt cost is modest. Actions and reactions consistently spring from his engineer’s mindset without safety‑hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: discovers blockage → reroutes greywater → reanimates pumps → orienting planters → recorded “equation.” Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: hope as flow × orientation ÷ distance between was and might be. Cost is present but subtle (foregoing certainty, labor, and a hand‑off to the next person), keeping it shy of a more decisive turn. Lens: Hybrid with accumulative dominance at the end holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terminal is tactile and functional: vents, greywater lines, atrium, skylight, and long‑dormant pumps shape tactics and the ending image. The sextant as tool‑object charges the final choice (orienting planters) and the locker hand‑off. Sensory economy is purposeful (popcorn/ion oil bouquet; caramel vapor) and filtered through an engineer’s priorities. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving the atrium/building’s spirit) tightens when the clogged runoff threatens waste into salt flats, prompting the reroute. Escalation is quiet but coherent: shutting gates, cutting into corroded junctions, and committing to a new pathway with limited resources and light. The price is effort, risk, and relinquishing triumph for stewardship; still, jeopardy remains low, keeping pressure strong rather than fierce. The sextant‑guided orientation provides a meaningful late deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from flows and orientation; systems “remembering themselves” reweights hope without sermonizing. The explicit equation risks didacticism but stays character‑particular and earned by prior beats. Final gestures (locker note; lanterns off) resist tidy triumph, giving a resonant, open‑handed answer. Motifs (rivers, sextant, skylight) accrue rather than repeat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, confident third‑person close voice, technical yet lyric, with steady focalization through Milo’s perceptual bias. Diction and rhythm modulate cleanly as pressure rises (from diagnostic noticing to tactile labor). No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference reads as inference. Patterned images are taught early and pay off in the closing cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffolding; imagery is vivid but controlled, avoiding figurative muddle. Syntax varies, pacing breathes, and key turns land in concrete action (“caramel sigh,” “pumps… coughed awake”). Minor lushness never clogs clarity, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Final image is crisp and recharged by prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: civil engineering as poetics of hope, carnival residue as hydraulic medium, a broken sextant repurposed for horticultural orientation. The turn toward a quietly radical closure (stewardship, hand‑off, darkness given back to stars) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (explicit equation; hybrid lyric/technical register) pay off without obscuring clarity. Specificity and concept cohere into a singular stance.</comment>
