<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Haleh’s motive (capture a runaway dream) is clear and embodied through her craft; her micro‑choices with the broken sextant reveal competence and a calm, idiosyncratic spirituality. Internal contradiction (grounded body vs. boundary‑erasing vision) is present but lightly pressured. The piece leans toward mastery over struggle, so we get fewer frictive moments where contradictory impulses clash on the page. Still, the final acceptance of fracture as “essential contour” feels earned by prior perception and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story tightens from approach → instrument rigging → coaxing → completion, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dream becomes “fellow traveler” and the fog recasts as panes. Causality is clear within the lyric logic, but the felt cost is conceptual rather than acute, keeping the closure powerful yet gentle. Orientation is immediate and stable; the ending’s cadence shift lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard/fog, ice, and reflective surfaces are vivid and tool‑linked; the environment actively shapes tactic (luring a dream drawn to surfaces, using frost, moon‑shard angles). The sextant and mirror operate as micro‑setting objects that charge the final image (windows in fog, glass mountains). The world rules (breath syncing, reflection logic) stay consistent through action. A strong, integrated atmosphere enriches every beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture the dream) is clear, with one meaningful deepening when the mirror shows alternate times and the dream tries to flee. Escalation remains coherent but largely smooth; the opposition never truly bites, so options don’t narrow with visible price. Haleh’s agency drives each step, and the “completion” requirement provides structure. The cost reads as philosophical (relinquishing a repair mentality) rather than jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of porous boundaries, naming/reflecting as capture, and wholeness through fracture accumulate via concrete images (breath as gear; frost as panes; footprints as windows). The final stance—grounded body aiming infinity—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively about the ethics of capture versus companionship. It’s resonant and integrated, if gentler morally than it might be.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lucid lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (craft, breath, reflection) holds steady; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; the narrative certainty matches what this focalizer plausibly infers. Patterned elision (breath powering mechanisms) is taught early and paid off. Lines often carry action and image simultaneously.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prose is lush yet legible; metaphors stay within a coherent glass/ice/reflective field and rarely conflict. Information density is high with minimal scaffold, and syntactic variety sustains momentum. A few high‑ornament moments flirt with purple but remain purposeful and clear, especially in the closing pane imagery. The final cadence lands cleanly without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mirror maker + broken sextant + synchronized breathing as mechanism for capturing a dream is striking and specific. The acceptance of fracture as completion feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off in image and method. Slightly softer stakes prevent it from feeling absolutely singular at the topmost tier.</comment>
