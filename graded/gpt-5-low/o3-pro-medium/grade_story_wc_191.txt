<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kestrel’s motives and values are clear and consistent, and her renunciation at the sigil feels earned by prior images (murals “crowned with clarity”). Interiority is filtered through concrete perception (“futuristic nostalgia” in her chest), but contradictory impulses under peak pressure are light; the choice reads calm more than contested. Palim adds texture, not pressure. The visible cost—relinquishing sovereignty—is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: rumor → ruby flake → waterfall puzzle → orchard → sigil choice → shard‑seeding staircase. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses personal rule to open access, reweighting the throne’s meaning with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the lens holds. Minor softness: the clock (“until sunrise”) doesn’t materially squeeze tactics beyond the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective worldbuilding integrated with action: waterfall as gate, solvent sprayer as tool, orchard as responsive machine. The environment constrains choices and charges the final image (water resets, staircase remains). Sensory balance is excellent (apple/cedar/ozone; ionic haze). A couple lyric flourishes verge on ornamental but don’t stall momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused and escalates: reach site → decode facade → partial stair with ultimatum → ethical renunciation. The sigil’s choice tightens the pressure meaningfully and the price is legible. External peril is low, so tension leans moral/philosophical; it works but lacks abrasion. The seed‑splitting solution arises from prior setup, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of decentralization and stewardship over sovereignty emerge organically through murals, the sigil, and the final staircase shared with future climbers. “Crowns were questions, not answers” skews a shade explicit but coheres with the imagery. The last image (waterfall resets; stair remains) reweights the premise elegantly. Ambiguity lingers productively around future climbers and costs to Kestrel.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyric SF voice with controlled neologisms and a distinct perceptual signature (“phosphor mist,” “spectral cartography”). POV remains tight to Kestrel; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well across discovery and choice, with only mild uniformity in sentence texture near the middle. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (Palim’s emoji cue) and advances action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density and clean sequencing; most lines do multiple jobs. Occasional purple phrasing and stacked metaphors flirt with excess but do not blur causality. Minimal scaffolding or loops; transitions are efficient. Final cadence is crisp and image‑driven without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lore keeper in a desert megacity, solvent‑revealed murals, an orchard that engineers a communal ascension. The democratized “unclaimed throne” turn feels inevitable in hindsight and charges the world’s ethics. Visual ingenuity is high and purposeful, not mere ornament. A touch more friction or unforeseen cost could push it into rarer air.</comment>
