<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motive (silence the prophecy) with embodied stakes and a tactile relationship to his instrument and the grotto. Interiority is specific (mother’s clarinet, “vested hush”) and actions align with values. Internal contradiction is light—he never seriously wavers—which softens the felt price. Still, the final renunciation of recognition (“absence was the truest report”) lands credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural with strong causal threading: rehearsal → corridor of notes → prism refraction → dissolution. Orientation is crisp early; the mechanics of the glasshouse and code are learned through action. Closure occurs on‑page with a tangible before/after (prophecy dissolved, silence “vested”) and a modest cost (exertion, chosen secrecy). The pressure arc is clean and unbroken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The grotto, fog, and prism atrium are not wallpaper; they dictate tactics (sound refracted, corridor carved) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is lush yet purpose‑driven across senses (drips, fog, vibration) filtered through a musician’s bias. World rules stay consistent and are discovered via use. The saxophone functions as a micro‑setting that constrains choice and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is sharp and early: contain the prophecy before it reaches human tongues at dawn. Escalation tightens as the echo “seeks throats,” Kieran answers by constructing sonic scaffolds, and the final whisper commits to the risked method. The cost is present but subdued (physical strain, ethical bet on silence). A single meaningful tightening (drawing it into the prism) suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, the ethics of secrecy, and absence as a crafted presence arise organically from action. “Vested hush” and the mother’s lullaby refract into a final answer: purpose can sound like music even when unheard. No sermonizing; resonance is achieved through image and choice. The ending reweights prior motifs without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with stable close third filters everything through a musician’s perception. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with purposeful cadence shifts at pressure points (the last whisper). No head‑hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off. The perceptual signature is memorable and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; most lines do double duty in image and action. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and task‑linked, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minor risk of purple in places (“lilies,” “letters tucked in attic boxes”) but clarity and propulsion hold. Final images land cleanly without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a saxophonist guiding a coded prophecy into a glasshouse that refracts sound via negative space. The “vested hush” concept is inventive and thematically integrated. Risks in worldbuilding and lyric tone heighten meaning without obscuring stakes. The solution feels inevitable in hindsight given the setup.</comment>
