<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orrin’s motive—decode growth before language ossifies—drives concrete choices (unwrapping the crystal, inviting the tribunal to hold it). Interiority is embodied through sensory focus (hush as pressure, chimes in facets) rather than label-speak. The reticence vs. public demand for “clear prose” provides a believable tension. The one soft spot is limited internal contradiction at the peak; his calm feels a touch untested given the tribunal’s threat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Orrin refuses linear testimony and reorients the council through demonstration; the hush returns “busy” and the directive to continue reframes the world’s “final dictionary” as a false finish. Cost is present though understated: social peril and professional alienation remain live. Orientation is clean from the opening and pattern teaching (fractured sequences) pays off in the projection beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library at dawn and the sonically responsive crystal are purposive and tactile; stillness as a spatial rule constrains tactics. Light and hush actively shape choices and charge the final image (moving roots on the ceiling). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding touristic cataloguing. The world rule about language germination is consistently learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres: the needed hush tightens, snaps with the tribunal’s entry, and Orrin must answer under their demand to testify. He escalates by refusing prose and using the crystal, converting skepticism into unsettled recognition. Stakes remain largely conceptual/social, so the price feels more like poised risk than immediate harm. Still, the single tightening is meaningful and reweights options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of language as living growth and authorship as witness rather than ownership emerge through image and action rather than sermon. The line “I cannot testify in lines that march… but in rings that spread” sits close to thesis yet is dramatized and earns its place. The final charged poise (listening to futures’ breathing) reweights prior imagery without a moral. Ambiguity—celebrate or fear—lingers in a productive way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent third-person focalization; diction aligns with a scholar’s sensibility without drifting into sterile academic register. Dialogue is sparse but subtextual, functioning as action (the demand for clear prose vs. Orrin’s rings). Rhythm modulates with pressure; the projection scene tightens cadence effectively. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (hush as physics and theme). Figurative language is rich yet coherent; minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. A few heightened metaphors cluster, but they support rather than blur the closure beat. Line rhythm carries momentum into the final image without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—post-dictionary botany of language, a sonically reflective crystal, a tribunal of publishers—feels singular and integrated. Turns arise from established logic (fractured sequences projected, hush recharacterized). Risks in style and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Only the tribunal’s swift recalibration keeps it from feeling fully audacious at 9+.</comment>
