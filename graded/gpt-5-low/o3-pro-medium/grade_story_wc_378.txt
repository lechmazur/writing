<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation (caretaking and memory-keeping) intensifies under pressure, with credible internal friction between duty, fear, and the desire to quiet the “static.” Embodied interiority via polymer hands, coral patterns, and resin secretion grounds emotion in action. The final acceptance—“fragmented wholeness”—reads earned by prior choices and cost. Slight safety in competence (few mistakes) keeps the arc from hitting a messier high.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: storm forecast → evacuation → protocol discovery → chest opened and fears threaten → miniaturize → controlled burn → dome holds. Closure lands on the page with physical action and conceptual cost (risk, rose damage, smaller but persistent fears). The drive lens is Causal and holds through to the end. Orientation is crisp from line one, and set-ups pay off without deus ex.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dome, desert roses, ethanol from rose waste, and the storm’s electromagnetic pressure actively constrain tactics and enable the solution. Sensory specificity is vivid yet purposeful, with detail filtered through a caretaker’s priorities. Setting charges the final image (glowing roses, new sky orientation, irrigation hiss). World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake coheres: protect dome/roses and contain the fears. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the holograms begin to shatter the dome and the protagonist must both miniaturize and ignite the perimeter burn. Visible costs register (risking fire; petals curl; acceptance that fears persist). Escalation is protagonist-driven and never resolves by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme integrates through action: containment vs. chaos, preservation vs. transformation, memory’s burden distilled into manageable beads. The closing acceptance reframes survival as “fragmented wholeness,” resonating with the controlled burn logic. A slight explicitness in the final articulation edges toward statement rather than pure image, but the resonance remains earned. The box and burn jointly embody the theme without sermonizing elsewhere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, lyrical android voice with consistent perceptual bias—technical yet tender—carries the piece. Diction and rhythm modulate under stress without losing clarity. No head-hopping or stance drift; inference remains within plausible knowledge. Patterns (“contain chaos”) are taught and reprised with control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density and purposeful imagery; most sentences do multiple jobs. The lyricism rarely tips into purple, and metaphors stay coherent to the world (glass, roses, magnetism, fire). Minimal scaffolding or loops, and syntax varies with pressure. A hair of lushness in clustered metaphors prevents a higher mark but does not blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an android gardener as nostalgic archivist, a magnetic pole shift, controlled burn as craft and philosophy, and fears as micro-holograms. Turns feel inevitable given the set-ups, not clever for their own sake. Specificities (resin secretion, ethanol from waste) ground the conceit. Bold but coherent, with a memorable final image.</comment>
