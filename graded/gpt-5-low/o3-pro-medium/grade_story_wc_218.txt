<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—use her remaining months to wire an orchard into interspecies speech—is precise and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (climbing, soldering, logging). Her “brazen calm” against a ticking death clock yields credible endurance with cost. Interiority stays embodied via tool use, breath pacing, and tide‑synced movement. The priest beat offers a light relational crucible, though opposition is gentle rather than testing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear and held: work accrues (wiring → humming canopy → dolphins) to the charged listening where runes surface and meaning reconfigures. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the village perceives shared branching math while Mara lies among roots, her pulse braided outward—cost and before/after are legible. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/why). No causal breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The island temple‑orchard, basalt causeway, and tidal circuitry are vivid and purposeful; the sea completes the circuit and the pillars reveal runes at climax. Tools (copper, lens) and environment constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail balances sound (hum, chord), sight (glow, runes), and touch (tingle). World rules stay consistent and learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear: achieve a cross‑species “listening” before death. Escalation is textural—density of signals and participants increases to the communal listening and revelation; the priest’s doubt and time pressure add modest friction. The cost is unmistakable (her dwindling time/energy and implied death). Pressure could tighten once more through a sharper on‑page obstacle, but the accumulative design still holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interconnection and reverent reciprocity emerge organically via actions (kids’ inclusive song, priest’s tactile blessing) and culminate in the runes reframing root, reef, and rib cage. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing: recognition as respect. Recurring images (copper lattice, breath, tide) deepen the theme. Ambiguity remains purposeful and generative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks Mara’s perceptual signature—botanical and tidal lexicon, measured cadence matching her “gently systematic” method. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from work‑fugue to ceremonial chord). No head‑hopping or register drift; elision patterns are taught and paid off. Dialogue is sparse and effective, functioning as action (the blessing reads as permission).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet controlled; metaphors (radio canopy, amphibious fugue) are coherent and advancing. Minimal scaffold, strong verb choices, and purposeful repetitions build propulsion. A few ornate phrases flirt with purple but remain disciplined by POV and task. The final line recharges motifs cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The copper‑wired orchard translating sap pressure, dolphins syncing clicks, and runes revealing shared branching math feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and tone coheres with character and place. The synthesis of ritual, botany, and improvised technology is distinctive and grounded. Closure grows from those particulars rather than twist mechanics.</comment>
