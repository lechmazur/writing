<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (“to learn the language of old buildings”) drives concrete choices—moving in under a polite lie, committing to midnight lessons, accepting the burden at the end. The narrator’s contradictions (truth-seeking via lies) are dramatized, not told. Selin’s courteous secrecy and draining cost under pressure read as lived. A slight limit: the narrator’s inner conflict at the accusation beat could push further before the final acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative texture leading to causal turns: the meteors/lessons accrue until the seal cracks, triggering revelation, penance, and Selin’s dissolution. Orientation is crisp by the opening lines (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost: Selin disappears and the narrator assumes duty beyond brick-reach. Setups (lies, seal, treaties) pay off in the climax and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden under a meteor shower is vivid and functional: meteors “sketch grammar,” thunder smothers stars, rainwater becomes substitute wax. Objects and weather shape tactics at peak beats (pressing the cracked seal into rainwater). Sensory choices are filtered through the narrator’s obsessions (bricks, herbs, punctuation of teacups). World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: gaining/building-language and the ethical cost of that pursuit. Tightening arrives when the seal cracks—panic, accusation, and the murder reveal increase pressure, then Selin forces a charged choice. The narrator’s acceptance forecloses the prior arrangement of silence and tutelage. Stakes are felt through loss (teacher dissolves) and obligation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Agreed upon lies” entwines with treaties, guilt, and language as covenant; the murder/penance reveal reframes the tea ritual. The final image (“syllables of sorrowful masonry” and a city listening) reweights everything without moralizing. Subtext works in gesture and object (desk seal as First Lie), avoiding thesis statements. The complexity of truth/translation/penance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical first-person maintains a distinct perceptual signature—syntax and metaphor mirror a mind trained on structure, grammar, and stone. Dialogue is minimal but charged, especially Selin’s limestone vowels and Polina’s tears. Distance and stance remain stable; patterned elision (weeks of lessons) is taught and paid off in the storm-night climax. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines do multiple jobs (world rule, mood, theme). Metaphors are controlled and coherent to the premise (teacups as punctuation, chrysanthemums correcting pronunciation). Rhythm varies and accelerates cleanly into the crack/accusation sequence. No noticeable loops or purple excess dulling the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Ghost tutor of dead languages + buildings’ speech + treaties with rain via a cuneiform seal feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The seal’s “First Lie” binds theme and plot with risk (murder/penance reveal) that elevates rather than gimmicks. Final act of sealing a promise in rainwater is an inventive, earned turn. The piece commits fully to its strange logic.</comment>
