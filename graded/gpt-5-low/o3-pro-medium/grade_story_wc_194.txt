<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (retrieve proof) evolves into a morally charged renunciation. Interiority is textured and embodied (listening to the room, “bridge of intuition”), with contradictory impulses shown in the hesitation before pocketing the cylinder. Micro-choices track: detect, retrieve, wind, listen, stop, conceal, restore. The cost is felt in her refusal—earned stasis with credible ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: sensory patterning → missing crank → fresco clue → winding → sonic confession → decision to suppress. Closure lands as an earned refusal with conceptual cost made legible in the bells, the pocketed cylinder, and the resealed fresco. The hybrid but dominantly causal drive holds throughout. Stakes and cost are on the page at the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: the sepia reading room, gramophone, and fresco directly constrain tactics and charge the final image (returning the handle, sealing pigment). Multi-sensory details serve action rather than stall it. The environment’s rules stay consistent and are learned through use. The room’s silence and objects become instruments of choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (dynasty-toppling proof before curfew), and pressure tightens from search to ethical decision. The decisive turn—lifting the needle and pocketing the cylinder—clearly forecloses a public path. The cost is present conceptually and ethically, though not dramatized through external consequence on the page. Internal and external stakes interlace effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of knowledge as music, power, and responsibility accrue through objects and action rather than moralizing. The final image (revolution spinning in silence; truth carried “in bone”) reweights the premise with lingering complexity. Subtext (lawyer’s revolution vs. archivist’s restraint) is embedded, not told. Resonance persists without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature; diction and rhythm fit a meticulous archivist under pressure. No head‑hopping, and the cadence modulates at turns (from lush observation to tense precision). Purposeful elision (the “rumored dynasty ender”) enriches without obscuring. The voice sustains intensity without excess explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is elegant and purposeful; images carry multiple jobs and propel meaning. A high density of figurative language skirts purple but remains coherent and legible, with minimal redundancy. Rhythm varies and supports escalation, and the final lines land cleanly. Minor repeaters (“eloquently silent”) are motif, not loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival caper meets acoustics‑coded confession; the fresco‑hidden crank and musician‑forged charter feel new and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in tone and method (standing waves as decoding) heightens stakes without gimmickry. The moral calculus is specific to this character and place. The final silent‑revolution image is striking and memorable.</comment>
