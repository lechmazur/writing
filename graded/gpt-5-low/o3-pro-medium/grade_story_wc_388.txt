<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motivation (debunker seeking truth) deepens into a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority is specific to her skills and worldview (cataloging dust, hum, and papers) and her choice to protect rather than publish lands as earned. Minor aphoristic lines verge on thesis, but they fit her professional bias. The final endurance—taking Hollis’s watch—forecloses an alternate future for her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal throughline is tight: arrival → investigation → reconstruction → discovery → ethical decision. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she burns the letters, posts a warning, and assumes stewardship, with a visible cost. Orientation is immediate and clean, and all set‑ups (diamond, rumor, audit) pay off. The corporate backstory is brisk and integrated via concrete action (reassembling letters).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-dust and the stillpoint physically constrain action and charge the final image; the two‑meter calm literalizes the theme. Specific, vivid details (coppery dust, silent Geiger meter, busted pump) are filtered through her professional gaze. Weather and radiation shape choices (respirator, warning sign). The setting evolves with plot, culminating in the quiet circle that frames the ethical pivot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose truth vs. protect a fragile sanctuary—is signaled early and tightened by the discovery. The letters and diamond escalate pressure by narrowing options; the decision to keep the secret exacts a moral/identity cost. No antagonist is needed; the storm and potential scavengers supply ambient threat. The resolution is driven by her agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship vs. sensationalism emerges from her profession colliding with the stillpoint’s fragility. Recurring images (dust vs. untouched leaves; hum vs. silence) reweight in the final choice. A few lines verge on aphorism (“People preferred curses...”), but the closing acts keep it from sermonizing. The last image holds complexity: a lie as shelter, with ethical tension intact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a crisp, professional lexicon and controlled lyricism. Dialogue is minimal yet functional (“only believe what you taste”) and carries subtext. The voice modulates smoothly from investigative precision to charged quiet at the stillpoint. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient; most lines do double duty (world and character). A few aphoristic cadences flirt with overstatement but don’t stall momentum. Imagery stays coherent and grounded; rhythm varies well. The final paragraph images are clean and resonant without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The stillpoint via a flawed diamond and a debunker choosing concealment feels fresh and consequential. The corporate liquidation cover‑story (curse as diversion) smartly reframes trope into ethical calculus. Turns arise from her skills, not contrivance, and the final reconfiguration is non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risk is measured and purposeful.</comment>
