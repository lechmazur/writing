<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Briony’s motivation is precise and consistent (orderly decoding for the herbarium), and her choices drive each turn (following the silver leaf, sealing the mound, accepting the caretaker role). Interiority is particular to her temperament (“patient as lichen,” exacting rituals) with embodied actions rather than labels. Internal contradiction is light; she pivots from skepticism to acceptance without much friction. The felt cost is conceptual—accepting ongoing duty and time pressure—rather than emotionally bruising.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: silver leaf → verse → hidden mound → sealing act → staircase → first seed → repriced ending. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: she gains the primordial seed and resumes work under a new charge. Cost is legible in the “tender weight of destiny” and the limiting clock (“lasts but a night”), though it’s quiet rather than acute. Orientation is clear early; the hybrid lyric mode stays coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor is vivid and functional: falling leaves dictate tactics, cloudwood planks ground action, and the environment literally fabricates the staircase. Recurring objects (leaves, specks, trunks) constrain pathways and charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (leaflight, chiming pollen) and consistently filtered through Briony’s professional gaze. World rules feel stable and learned via action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to read and act on the leaves’ message—tightens when the silver leaf introduces a rule-bending verse. The key escalation is her decision to place the leaf on the mound, trading caution for commitment and triggering irreversible transformation. Pressure remains coherent but in a hushed register; antagonism is atmospheric rather than oppositional. The cost is more duty than danger, tempering intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through enacted particulars: folklore and systematizing science reconcile in stewardship, memory, and care for “forgotten things.” The “emerges transformed always” line is reweighted by the ending, which reframes prophecy as ongoing labor rather than spectacle. The tiny monuments motif matures into green, humming candleflowers, giving a resonant, non‑literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity remains fertile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice matches Briony’s orderly sensibility and botanical lexicon without drift. Psychic distance is steady and apt; inference reads as inference. Rhythm modulates with pressure (hush → staircase ascent → charged return) and never slips into expository scaffolding. No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet purposeful; images (moonstone dust, leaflight, chiming pollen) carry multiple jobs without looped redundancy. Figurative language is consistent with the world’s logic; mixed metaphor is avoided. Minor lushness never obscures action or causality. Sentence rhythm and paragraphing sustain momentum and clarity through the climax and repose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor, moon‑remembering specks, and archival monuments synthesize into a fresh, coherent myth‑botanical fable. Turns feel earned and specific to this world and protagonist. The final reconfiguration (first seed becoming a husk/charge) is elegant and non‑obvious. Risk is high in tone and concept, executed without gimmick.</comment>
