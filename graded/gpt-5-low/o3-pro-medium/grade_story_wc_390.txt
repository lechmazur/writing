<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (protect the relic) is clear and embodied through precise, profession‑tinted choices (wiring the beacon, plotting resonance paths). Her “logically emotional” contradiction is dramatized rather than told—she trusts evidence yet feels frequencies reading her ribs. The relationship with Callix functions as a crucible, prompting adaptation and a belief shift without sentimentality. The primary cost lands more on Callix than Mara, slightly limiting depth of her personal price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. Setups (key, lattice, marina) pay off cleanly: they build the barricade; raiders arrive; the key completes the circuit; the relic is secured. Closure lands on the page with cost (Callix’s collapse, a returned key, a reweighted stance on belief), and the final lighthouse image coheres the system. Orientation is immediate and consistent. Minor limitation: the protagonists face little risk of failure once the system engages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and tactically integral: ice floes, moored hulls, and the lighthouse structure become instruments in the protection scheme. Environmental elements constrain and enable choices (forks “kissing” rime, wires to the beacon, the cutter threading floes). World rules for sound and ice are learned through action, not exposition. The final image fuses lantern pulses with lingering chords, charging the environment in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit from the start and tightens when the cutter arrives, forcing activation via the key. The reversal—raiders hitting an “invisible wall” and being turned by amplified greed—earns the outcome from prior setup. Cost is legible (Callix’s collapse; moral pain reflected back on the raiders). Slight softness: protagonists encounter limited counter‑pressure once the barricade initiates.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fusion of engineering and contrition, asking whether intention can be audited and protected. “Sonic absolution” is not mere rhetoric; it dictates who passes, extracts a price, and reframes belief as evidence. The final ascent with lantern rhythms delivers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity remains humane (absolution costs; forgiveness isn’t free).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person aligns with Mara’s perceptual signature (gear-and-beam metaphors, structural thinking) while accommodating Callix’s sonic lexicon. Rhythm is controlled and modulates under pressure, with clean, purposeful dialogue. There’s occasional elevated diction that edges toward omniscient lyricism, but it remains coherent and earned by mode. No head‑hopping or stance confusion under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; images often do double duty (lantern pulses as both setting and thematic closure). Figurative density is high but largely coherent and grounded in tactile action. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing keep momentum intact. A few purple flourishes flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustics, moral filtration, and lighthouse engineering feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Tuning forks on rime and a key completing a sonic circuit are imaginative and structurally necessary. The risk—leaning into a “contrite hearts can pass” mechanic—pays off with earned cost rather than convenience. Fresh details and a distinct stance elevate beyond trope.</comment>
