<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s ambivalence about leaking the specs versus years of conditioned secrecy reads specific and embodied (“each exhale tasted larger”). Jun’s motivation is stated but feels lived via his method and history with the narrator. The relationship dynamic creates pressure without theatrics, and the final renunciation (“pockets were emptier now”) lands as a cost. A slight softness remains—the choice faces little direct resistance beyond conscience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the build from note → ascent → assembly → broadcast holds and culminates in a concrete act that reweights meaning. Closure lands with conceptual cost and a lived forfeiture (“carry nothing heavier than memory”; former life drifted out with the tide). Orientation is clear by 120 words and every step coheres causally. The switch-flip and sky-writing are earned and reconfigure the premise as an “open secret.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse “Throat,” wind, iron stairs, dismantled lens, and sea pressure are integrated into tactics and the final image. The environment literally enables the leak and charges the key-change ending. Sensory choices are purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding catalogue description. World rules remain consistent while feeling uncanny but plausible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to expose the specs—tightens through preparation into an irreversible broadcast. The escalation is internal-ethical and procedural, culminating in the committed flip, with the cost of burning secrecy and identity. Lack of an active counterforce keeps pressure quieter than it might be, but the narrowing of options is clear. The time cue (“after last orders”) provides a subtle ticking cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, revelation, and cost integrate through recurring “open secret,” music/key metaphors, and the broadcast-as-aurora image. The final “key change” reweights prior material without didactic closure. One explicit thesis line (“secrets are only cages we pretend are keys”) edges toward on-the-nose, but surrounding images earn it. The aftereffect is reflective and specific rather than generic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice merges spy-craft precision with sensuous perception (“moonlight wrung through glass”). Dialogue is sparse, idiosyncratic, and goal-driven; Jun’s lines carry subtext. Psychic distance modulates cleanly under pressure without leakage or head-hopping. Patterned diction (music/light) is consistent and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean rhythm; metaphors mostly cohere to light, music, and sea without muddle. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; syntax varies to manage momentum. A few lush images flirt with purple, but they deepen mood and action instead of stalling it. Copy is clean and the final line crystallizes prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>A fortune-cookie oracle orchestrating a lighthouse to leak microdot specs as “open secrets” is strikingly fresh, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. The risks are aesthetic and conceptual rather than plot-twist gimmicks, and they pay off. The “directing flow” method and key-change end are inventive and coherent. Emotional truth rides the conceit rather than the other way around.</comment>
