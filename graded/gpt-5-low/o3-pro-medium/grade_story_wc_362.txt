<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ilara’s motive (to prove objects absorb emotion) is clear and drives every micro‑choice, from choosing predawn to reading frost and addressing the prism with “truthful lies.” Her interior conflict—mediator vs. confessor—surfaces at the shame/joy swell and culminates in accepting responsibility. Embodiment (“toes gripping the quartz”) grounds emotion credibly. The cost is conceptual but legible: she’ll carry peril and proof back to the guild.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual steps build density (mist hush → frost mapping → prism flare → emotional transference) to a CR where the premise re‑prices—objects transform emotion like soil. Closure lands in the final images (wrapped prism; lantern rhythm “neither lie nor truth”) with cost (ethical peril for future handlers, duty accepted). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the causal weave is coherent within the ritual logic. The single‑scene arc tightens through the reconciliation image that alters Ilara’s stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and prism are deeply integrated; environment and object constrain tactics (silence, cold surface, refracted light) and charge the final image (lantern rhythm inside stone). Sensory detail is specific and POV‑filtered, avoiding touristic catalog. The setting evolves with action (ringing arbor, shifting hush, silvered frost). The place’s rules (silence, resonance) remain consistent and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proof through communion—tightens as shame turns to joy and resolves into reconciliation, forcing Ilara to choose duty with acknowledged peril. The meaningful deepening is the realization that absorption entails transfer risk, which reweights her mission. Pressure remains coherent and grows through ritual intensification rather than external threat. The cost is felt, if conceptual, at the decision to take the prism back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: mirror vs. absorption becomes “soil” transformation, with ethical freight. Recurring images (prism, frost, hush, truthful lies) reweight meaning at the close without sermonizing. The final ambivalence (“neither lie nor truth”) offers a resonant non‑literal answer. A few explicit statements (“Objects…absorb emotions…”) are direct but earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; imagery and cadence modulate with pressure (from poised ritual to flaring revelation to quiet withdrawal). No head‑hopping; certainty matches Ilara’s sensory inferences. The “truthful lies” register stays coherent and character‑plausible. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, precise metaphors that mostly serve action and theme; rhythm varies well. Minor lushness never slips into muddle, and there are no paraphrase loops. Syntax and diction are clean, with purposeful repetition that pays off. The peak beats remain clear despite lyric density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a mystic reading frost on a sedan to draw lighthouse‑prism emotions, with mist’s “shifted hush” as operative constraint, feels singular. The reconciliation image and soil metaphor reframe the premise non‑obviously. Risks in form and diction heighten coherence rather than obscure it. The final ambivalence is memorable and earned.</comment>
