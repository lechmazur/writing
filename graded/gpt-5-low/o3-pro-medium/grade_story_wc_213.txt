<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives and contradictions are clear: a creed of “listening over noise” vs. the urgent risk of inaction. Interiority is concrete and embodied (rope in her hand, skin prickling, ladders, quartz petals). Her decisive override of the programmed margin feels earned by prior curiosity and field readings. Slightly low cost after validation by hail keeps it from the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean Causal lens: observation → interpretation → device signal → conflicting pressure graph → choice → consequence. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when). Closure lands in an on‑page decisive change (the switch) with a legible risk cost, then is validated without undercutting causality. The quick storm validation softens the lingering price but not the structural integrity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary, bell rope, frost, ladder, ridge speakers, and the anemometer are all tactile and purpose-driven. Environment constrains choice (no bells unless sirens fail; exposure on the crown) and charges the final image (single ceremonial chime). Sensory details track urgency and profession-specific noticing. The setting’s logic remains consistent and integral to the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tight: warn early and risk commerce vs. stay silent and endanger towns. Escalation intensifies through conflicting signals (1400 green vs. plunging pressure) and the storm’s approach. The meaningful tightening is the moment she defies her own “safe margin,” paying a credibility risk. The external cost is validated quickly, tempering the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of mindful sound vs. alarmism accumulates through object choices and the tuned warning tone. The final bell as thanksgiving reframes “listening” as an ethic rather than a binary. One line edges toward explicit moralizing (“curiosity, properly tuned, could save lives”), slightly reducing subtextual elegance. Overall, resonance is earned via concrete actions and images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled third-person limited with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature rooted in profession and place. Diction is consistent and modulates with pressure; no head-hopping or stance drift. Compression is purposeful and legible without withholding. The voice remains specific and confident through peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are crisp, image-dense, and multi-tasking; rhythm breathes with the scene. Figurative language is vivid but mostly disciplined; little to no paraphrase looping or scaffold. Technical terms serve character and stakes. Minor lushness never muddies causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blend of sanctum-meets-instrument science, tuned sirens, and the ethic of listening feels fresh. The bell rope’s ritual versus the balanced chord gives a non-obvious reconfiguration of warning. Turns arise from established particulars rather than gimmicks. Not radical, but confidently singular and thoughtfully integrated.</comment>
