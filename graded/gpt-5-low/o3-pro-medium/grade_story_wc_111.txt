<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orlan’s motive—proving the garden knows its gardener to step out of a legacy of “mended deception”—is clear and enacted through tactile, specific choices. His pragmatic, care‑based tactics (dew counts, deliberate polishing, speaking half‑successes) reveal character under pressure. The internal conflict (despising his father’s craft yet “mending” a crack) is present but remains restrained, with little on‑page hesitation at the peak. The closing acceptance reads earned, though the struggle feels more contemplative than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: polishing → maze reconfiguration → sundial corridor → sealing the crack → needle shifts to “Gardener.” Orientation is firm from the misted maze entrance and holds through a single continuous scene. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and conceptual repricing (a new register, redistribution of luck). The cost is legible though primarily conceptual/social rather than personal pain, keeping it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden maze is vivid and operative: hedges lean, passages open, roots clutch the sundial; environment literally gates options and unlocks the climax. Sensory detail is precise (roses “blooming while withering,” sap sealing the crack) and POV‑filtered by a vine dresser’s eye. The setting charges the final image (the sundial’s new register; the scent of blooming withering). World rules—luck as measurable—are embedded via setting objects rather than explained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—validation through the garden—tightens as the maze actively responds and funnels him to the sundial. The decisive act (pressing the polished marble into the root) narrows options and triggers a visible reweighting for the town. Pressure escalates coherently under the causal lens but remains relatively smooth, with limited jeopardy or failure risk on the page. The price (ceded luck/visibility) is felt conceptually more than viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme integrates beautifully: cracked inheritance versus transparent care; measured luck versus unmeasurable faith; bloom/rot as twin tutors. The final repricing (“Gardener” register; redistribution) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Recurring images (cracked marbles, roses blooming/withering) shift meaning at the end. The father’s “mended deception” reappears as an honest mending, tying ethics to practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Orlan’s perceptual signature (plant arithmetic, craft metaphors). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; the lyric pattern is taught early and sustained. A few high‑register flourishes approach purple but remain purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: images carry multiple jobs and momentum rarely stalls. Figurative density is high but coherent and character‑motivated; minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. The peak beats (“reducing planets to axioms,” sap sealing the seam) are vivid without muddle. Minor lushness slightly cushions urgency but does not blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis is striking: a measurable‑luck world, a gardener’s counter‑economy of care, and cracked marbles as a praxis of honest mending. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the pedestal, sundial, and roots are aligned by his method of commemorating small victories. Risks in concept and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. The “Gardener” register is a fresh, memorable reweighting.</comment>
