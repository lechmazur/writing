<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maeve’s deliberateness and embodied craft under pressure feel lived-in, with a credible flicker of doubt (“uncertainty wedge”) complicating competence. Arden’s gentled urgency and vocation-specific bearing create a clear relational dynamic that shapes choices. Micro‑choices (accepting the risky repair; offering her own “second opinion”) reveal a hierarchy of values. The only limitation is that Maeve’s internal conflict is subtle rather than sharply contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: the repair and counsel accrue toward a charged poise ending. Closure lands through the repaired heart (decisive change) and a reweighted mandate for action (conceptual repricing) with felt cost. Orientation is clean; single continuous scene holds. The price is more ethical/emotional than material, but it’s legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shop’s cedar, tools, and tiny gears are specific and purposeful, woven into action rather than postcarding. The environment constrains/permits tactics (tweezers, solder, lamplight) and charges the final image (brass shavings as “shy stars”). Sensory range is rich without disorienting. Strong integration; merely shy of 9+ because the space shapes action more as enabler than obstacle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore and deliver a penitential melody with integrity—tightens through the risk of ruining Ellis’s etchings and the moral escalation to “action beyond music.” The meaningful turn is Maeve’s counsel that reframes success criteria, narrowing easy closure. The cost is the burden shifted onto Ellis and the chaplain, with Maeve accepting uncertainty. Stakes remain intimate but clear and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres around apology versus action, craft as moral labor, and the insufficiency of words alone; subtext blooms in the etched names and “balance wheel.” The final counsel reweights the premise without didactic overreach, though a line or two toes moralizing (“first beat of the sentence he must compose”). Recurring images (heart, hush, light) earn resonance. Quiet ambiguity remains: the victims’ agency is honored without forced pardon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature tied to tools, light, and sound. Dialogue reads goal‑driven and vocation‑true, especially the chaplain’s measured cadence. No head‑hopping; psychic distance modulates smoothly around pressure. A few figurative flights skate close to purple but stay coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with varied rhythm; images usually do double duty. Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and pattern‑taught; only minor risk of saturation (“prayer candles seeking glass ceilings”). No loops or scaffolding drag momentum. Line clarity holds at the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The clockwork‑apology premise, penitentiary chaplain, and “second opinion” reframing feel fresh and synthesized with integrity. The repair shop as moral confessional is inventive without gimmickry. The closing reconfiguration—music as insufficient without acted contrition—lands as non‑obvious yet inevitable. Boldness is measured rather than flashy, but memorable.</comment>
