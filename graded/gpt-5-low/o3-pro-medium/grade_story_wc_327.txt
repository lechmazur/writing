<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (“translate texture into sound”) drives concrete choices—buying the diamond despite warnings, reading birds, embedding the stone, and reciting textures. Competence is vivid without feeling frictionless, and urgency surfaces as the language “dies” with his steps. Internal contradiction is lightly sketched (belief that madness is misheard music vs. the tunnel’s danger) but not deeply dramatized. The final endurance—accepting the sealed passage to save the language—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: causal links (birds → route, diamond flaw → resonance, speaking textures → revival) accrue toward a charged closure. Closure lands with visible cost: the diamond cracks and the passage seals as he escapes with the shadow‑ink language. Orientation is crisp early; set‑ups (storm swifts, cursed spiral) pay off at the climax. No major causality breaks or late conveniences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is integral and constraining: the bone towers, echo‑canyon acoustics, and narrowing tunnel directly shape tactics and outcome. The flawed diamond as micro‑setting interfaces with the limestone to unlock language, charging the final image. Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered through an acoustician’s bias. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage a dying language without succumbing to madness—tightens as echoes “argue” and vowels “collapse,” forcing accelerated tactics. The siphon glyph and constriction produce a meaningful pressure turn that narrows options. The price (sacrificing the diamond, sealing the passage) is legible and tied to his choice. Tension is more textural than adversarial but remains coherent and rising.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of preservation vs. erasure, curse vs. cure, and how texture births sound emerge organically through concrete acts. The line “why curse and cure share almost the same letters” flirts with aphorism but is earned by what precedes it. Final images—night swifts’ calmer glyphs, shadow‑ink phonemes—offer a resonant, non‑literal answer: survival through transformation and cost. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice matches the protagonist’s sensory intelligence; diction stays coherent and character‑plausible. Compression and patterned imagery are taught early and maintained. POV distance is stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates under pressure without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphor; most lines do multiple jobs. A few lush constructions risk purple but remain coherent and scene‑advancing. No notable loops, scaffolding, or cadence templates. The closure image is clean and unblurred by figurative excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Unusually fresh synthesis: acoustical linguistics via a cursed diamond, avian glyph‑reading, and ossuary geography. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight from seeded particulars (spiral fracture → amphitheater acoustics). Bold, textural risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept feels singular rather than a dressed‑up template.</comment>
