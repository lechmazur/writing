<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are clear and character‑particular: a scientist applying patient observation to salvage rather than raze. Interiority is embodied through tactile action (sampling dust, reading rivulets) and a steady ethic rather than self‑explanation. The Jonah dynamic supplies credible pressure and a status shift as he yields. The only soft spot is limited internal contradiction; she rarely wavers, so cost is more procedural than deeply personal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative texture + causal pivot) holds: motifs accrue until the dust‑to‑trench inference triggers the decision to clear. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the scene stays continuous. Closure lands on the page via the trench clearing, waterline recession, seedlings revealed, and Jonah’s signed reversal. Cost is present (risking time against mold/insurance protocol), though it’s modest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The storm‑damaged greenhouse and its tools (trench, broken panes, silt, solar backup) actively shape options and the final image. Sensory specificity is strong across modalities (powdered scales, brackish morse, tomato stalk scent) and filtered through a scientist’s gaze. Environment constrains tactics (drainage vs demolition) and charges closure with seedlings unfurling under backup lights. Details evolve with action; no postcard static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—salvage through patience vs raze through procedure—is signaled early and tightens when dust maps to the trench, forcing a choice. The escalation is a deepening of knowledge that converts observation into labor, narrowing options against a ticking mold/insurance pressure. The visible price is time, effort, and a deviation from protocol; it’s felt but not dire. Resolution is earned by protagonist agency rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of gradual change, directionality of decay, and listening to “whispers” emerge from the dust‑reading and trench‑clearing, not merely assertion. The final image reweights the premise—quiet attention as the antidote to drama—without a neat moral. A few lines verge on thesis (“Gradual change… negotiating peace with entropy”) but are grounded by action. Subtext in Jonah’s signature and pocketed form lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A lyric, science‑tuned perceptual signature stays consistent; diction like “light curve,” “fractal signature,” and “capillary action” fits Mara. Dialogue carries subtext and pressure, distinguishing voices (Jonah’s procedural urgency vs Mara’s observational calm). Narrative confidence matches what Mara can observe and infer. Slightly elevated aphorisms appear but read as her idiom, not authorial leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and efficient, doing double duty for image and theme; rhythm varies and momentum holds. Figurative density is high but coherent within the dust/water/stars lattice. Minor purple edges (“preprocesses reality,” “breathable tarp”) flirt with excess without blurring sense. No looped scaffolding or cadence drags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of neutron‑star crust physics with butterfly scales mapping capillary action in a flooded greenhouse feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The method turn (dust → trench) is inventive, character‑driven, and thematically integrated. Risk‑taking in tone and concept heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Familiar disaster‑cleanup stakes are transformed by the scientific lens.</comment>
