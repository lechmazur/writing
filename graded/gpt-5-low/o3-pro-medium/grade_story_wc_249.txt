<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ira’s grief and “quiet rebellion” are embodied in concrete choices—signing with lemon‑juice annotations, defying protocol by tapping, and ultimately sacrificing private memory. Her motive (shared dream over money) is clear and consistent, and contradictory impulses (obedience vs. revolt; privacy vs. offering) operate simultaneously. The cost registers when she releases her sister’s memory into the collective. Secondary figures stay peripheral, but the single‑POV focus feels intentional and effective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early (rhythmic garden, calibration, glyphs) and escalates through Ira’s syncopations that trigger a collective break from protocol. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the experiment escapes ownership, the lagoon settles under a reweighted rule (“dreams breathed together cannot be owned”), with the price of personal memory surrendered. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and cause/effect remains legible within the lyric mode. The tightening beat is the machine‑stopping hush and release, which cleanly divides before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden, crystalline stump, speakers, and auric lagoon are specific, multi‑sensory, and filter through Ira’s perceptions. Crucially, the environment constrains choices: her tapping on the stump alters the sonic field, and the garden’s acoustics enable the collective turn. The final image is charged by setting—the lagoon reflecting brightened auroras. World rules (entanglement via resonance) are consistently learned through action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stakes—autonomy and the ethical ownership of shared memory—are signaled early and deepen as Ira disrupts synchronization. Pressure coheres as her micro‑choice (tapping) catalyzes others, forcing a trade‑off between control and communal authorship. The felt cost is the relinquishment of private grief to the collective and the risk of defying the Institute mid‑procedure. Escalation is cleanly protagonist‑driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory versus institutional control and grief transmuted by collective will emerge organically from actions and evolving images (tapestry, auroras). The final act reweights the premise with a humane stance, and the sister’s laughter recast feels earned. However, the explicit line “dreams breathed together cannot be owned” edges into stated moral, slightly reducing subtextual power at the finish. The piece still lingers with a resonant afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is consistent, with a distinctive sensory lexicon and rhythmic control that intensifies at peak beats. POV modesty holds; no head‑hopping or retroactive omniscience. Patterned diction (sound/respiration motifs) is taught early and pays off at closure. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful; the voice carries pressure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and economical for a lyric piece; images carry multiple jobs (world‑rule, emotion, theme). Occasional density skirts purple but remains coherent and purposeful, with no notable loops or mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies and accelerates appropriately into the hush/stop beat. The final cadence cleanly recharges earlier motifs without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of acoustics, entangled memory tech, and a grassroots rhythmic revolt feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Specifics like lemon‑juice annotations, a crystalline stump, and auroral sorrow elevate beyond trope. The turn—desire encoded in rhythm outmaneuvering computation—shows conceptual integrity and risk without gimmickry. The closure’s communal repricing is bold and earned.</comment>
