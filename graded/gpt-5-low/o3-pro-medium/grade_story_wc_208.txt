<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Iona’s motives (deliver a commission; then accept emissary duty) are legible and escalate into concrete choices (entering the projection, committing days to build the gate). Fear and curiosity coexist on the page, with embodied perception (“tasting salt like punctuation”) grounding interiority. The credo “scaffold complexity with simplicity” meaningfully informs design choices rather than staying a label. Minor shortfall: conflict is gentle; deeper cost to abandoning the original errand remains implied rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: lost at sea → archway threshold → lantern projection → emissary acceptance → gate completion → communal passage. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: a harbor “larger than longitude” and villagers stepping through a charged artifact; cost appears as renunciation of the initial delivery and days of labor. Orientation is clear early (skiff, fog, GPS fail), and motifs are paid off. A hairline gap: the emissary pact’s obligations are conceptual rather than tested on-page under pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the basalt arch functions as threshold and later alignment; the lighthouse and lantern are tool and shrine; driftwood and kelp constrain materials and tactics. The environment consistently charges choices and the final image (dawn pouring through both apertures). Sensory balance (sound, light, texture) is deft and filtered through a sculptor’s priorities. World rules, while magical, are taught via action (rotating the slide; entering projection) and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens once the lantern “demands more,” forcing Iona to choose participation and then to pay with time and craft—an escalation from being lost to bearing communal responsibility. The emissary acceptance forecloses a path (simple delivery/return), and the long build amplifies commitment. Stakes remain personal and conceptual (meaning/time), not survival-level, but they are felt at closure through villagers’ experience. The price is present but not punishing; it reads earned for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of art as diplomacy and simplicity scaffolding complexity emerge from concrete acts (layering brig and freighter; inlaying panes as semaphores). The ending offers a non-literal answer—community passes through an artifact that reweights time—without moralizing. A few direct statements (“understood the phrase timewoven alliances”) brush against on-the-nose. Overall resonance lingers through image rather than thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third’s diction and rhythm suit a sculptor’s perceptual bias, with confident, musical syntax that modulates under pressure (from sea-lost to work-trance to communal dawn). No head-hopping; certainty tracks what she can infer. Lyric compression is taught early and sustained; whispers and layered speech maintain subtext rather than exposition. Minor risk of elevated register is controlled by consistency of voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful; images often do double duty (salt as punctuation; glass as “scattered codes”). Rhythm varies and propels; paragraphs earn their place. Figurative density skirts purple but stays coherent with few, if any, mixed metaphors; no looped scaffolding evident. Micro-reductions (“turbine-hum reverie”) repeat as motif rather than redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magic lantern mediating “timewoven alliances,” translated into driftwood-and-glass civic infrastructure, feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The basalt arch alignment and emissary-craft pact synthesize mythic threshold with contemporary materiality without gimmickry. Risks (lyric compression; conceptual stakes) heighten resonance while remaining legible. The final harbor image is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
