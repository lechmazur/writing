<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inyara’s motives are precise (retrieve the seed and face what “no mirror reflects”) and her guilt over abandoning her sister drives contradictory impulses that act in scene. Micro‑choices under pressure—praising the apples, promising to bleed honesty, tracing circles while naming lost truths—reveal hierarchy of values. The final stance (unbend vs. break) is earned with a visible cost: releasing self‑punishment into the lake. Slight softening comes from the late vision of the sister alive, which eases—but does not erase—the price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: summon circles → corridor → thorns negotiated → ice mirror manifests failure → truth‑naming breaks it → seed yields vision. Orientation is immediate (dawn at a cursed lake; druid task), and lens holds Causal through closure. Closure lands on the page with cost: she surrenders the “frozen confession” to the deep memory and thereby changes options and knowledge. No teleports or outline beats; each move narrows options or deepens pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The environment is specific and operative: glowing rings bear weight, mist branches create a constrained corridor, apple thorns demand a negotiated passage, and the ice mirror physically bars the goal. World rules are learned through action with no dump. The setting charges the final image (circles widen homeward; seed in hand) and constrains tactics twice via the circles motif. Vivid sensory selection stays character‑filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and tightens at the ice mirror, where self‑punishment actively resists progress. The negotiation with the apples adds a credible external check that forces a values articulation. Escalation peaks with the naming of truths, a costed tactic that breaks the barrier. Slight limitation: external danger recedes quickly after that peak, keeping the conflict primarily internal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete acts: truth versus reflection, guilt’s carapace versus unbending courage. The circles motif and “frozen confession” reweight at the end into a hopeful repricing without moralizing. The seed’s property (devours lies) integrates concept and theme, culminating in the sister’s vision that reframes prior shame. Resonance lingers through the final cadence of widening rings and “warlike serenity.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is controlled, with consistent diction calibrated to a druidic sensibility. Rhythmic modulation fits pressure: spare at choice points, lush in corridor imagery. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; implied speech to the apples carries subtext and function. Occasional high lyric density skirts purple but remains legible and voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images do multiple jobs, and sentence rhythms vary with momentum. The figurative web (circles, orchard, frost, surrendering sword) is coherent and not contradictory. Minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; instructions and ritual are efficient. A few high‑ornament lines push density but do not blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard vortex, lie‑eating seed, and “frozen confession” literalized as an ice mirror feel freshly synthesized. The “finder of lost things” angle (king’s sigh, child’s laugh) personalizes trope into specific lived texture. The ending’s repricing (hope via a truth‑seed rather than a tidy absolution) feels both inevitable and surprising. Bold but coherent risks in imagery and ritual mechanics elevate without gimmickry.</comment>
