<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Emil’s motive—discovering the color of sound—drives each choice, and his flaw (“hides behind truth”) is dramatized when his steps remain gray until he vows. Interiority is concrete (skeletal key tag, number seven door) and embodied through sensory synesthesia. The final vow marks a credible change with a felt cost: public vulnerability and surrender of secrecy. Minor note: his fear could tighten one earlier beat to heighten struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clean (pier, festival night, low tide), and causal steps link smoothly: tip from Sorensen → tide/lantern cover → door seven → ledger → vow → auroras. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: color belongs to resonance/hope, earned by Emil’s spoken vow, with cost visible in the reconfigured world. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with light, tide, and vows building to a cadence break. No plot amnesia or convenience patches undermine the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor, lantern festival, and scuttled Narwhal are vividly particular and filtered through Emil’s aim. Setting constrains choice (extreme low tide access, hidden door), and the library’s rule-set (vows made visible) charges the finale. Recurring objects (pilings, lanterns, key tag) are integrated, not postcard. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear: earn the answer to “the color of sound” by risking honesty. Pressure coheres and tightens once: discovery and reading of the ledger force a vow that forecloses hiding. The price is vulnerability and a public, irreversible manifestation. Tension is lyric rather than adversarial; one additional friction beat earlier could amplify squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: lamps, vows, and synesthetic ripples converge on honesty as the medium that renders sound visible. The insight is earned on the page via the ledger and the ensuing auroras rather than told. One line edges toward thesis (“Resonance… possessed hope”), but it’s grounded by immediate consequence. The final image resounds without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, maritime-lyric and consistently focalized through Emil’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well from hush to surge at the vow and auroras. No head-hopping or register drift; diction fits the world and emotional pressure. Elision is purposeful and paid off by image-driven closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is dense yet clear; metaphors stay within a coherent light/water register. Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, motive, theme) without redundancy. No scaffold loops or filter stacks; momentum holds through the descent and vow. A few high-level abstractions occur but do not blur the peak image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A lamplighter seeking the color of sound via a sunken library of vows is an original synthesis, and the “honesty makes sound visible” turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Recurring motifs (number seven, lanterns, hush) integrate concept and character. The risk of a quiet, accumulative design pays off with a charged public reconfiguration. The final lampposts lighting “in grateful reply” is a fresh, memorable cap.</comment>
