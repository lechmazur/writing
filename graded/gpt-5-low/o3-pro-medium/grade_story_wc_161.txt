<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marietta’s contradictory impulses—compulsion to safeguard the meteorite’s song versus terror of repeating past betrayals—are dramatized through concrete actions (training birds, strapping the capsule on, burning old papers). The courier past is not a label; it informs present tactics and fear. The culminating choice to release the pigeon reads earned and paid for. A slight hedge: the internal struggle is largely lyric rather than resisted by an on‑page interlocutor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust → notation → pigeons → release, with a clear cadence shift at the skylight opening. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (she chooses to send the stone despite interception risk) with visible cost (burning names/diagrams). Orientation is clean early; the meteorite and attic rules remain consistent. The final image reweights prior motifs into a new stasis charged by risk.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The attic, skylight, rafters, and stove aren’t backdrop; they enable tactics (dust mapping, mini‑aerodrome, skylight as launch gate, stove for renunciation). Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered through a musician‑trainer’s eye. The environment charges the ending as papers ride the pigeon’s wings and the stove seals the cost. No museum‑tour bloat; details evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking trust again—is signaled early and tightens at the moment of sending the bird. The meteorite and past indictment sharpen the fear of interception, and the release forecloses the safety of secrecy. The price is legible (loss of control, burned records). Escalation is mostly internal and textural rather than adversarial, but it coheres and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: paper trails reframed from condemnation to becoming; trust as release rather than ledger balance. The “blooming withering” motif returns in the final line without moralizing, reweighting earlier images (pressed flowers, ash snow). The graduate’s plea and the meteorite’s “older than oceans” song enlarge the inquiry into stewardship and risk. Resonance lingers beyond plot without tidy certainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, supple lyric voice with a controlled perceptual signature (notation metaphors, aviary lexicon) remains steady under pressure. Distance and stance are consistent; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. The rhythm tightens into terser beats around the release and burn. Elision is purposeful and paid off by the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet disciplined; images do double duty (dust as music, papers as trails and ash as snow). Minimal scaffold and no significant loops; momentum builds cleanly to the release. A few stacked metaphors flirt with lushness, but they stay legible and voice‑true. Syntax varies to match emotional tempo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—pigeon couriering of music, a whistling Martian chip, dust‑notation in a rare‑book attic—feels startling yet inevitable in how it bears the theme. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established particulars, not late rule changes. The final reconfiguration is fresh and memorable.</comment>
