<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—to conduct unheard symphonies—is clear and consistently pursued through specific micro‑choices (pressing the nautilus to the glass, climbing, conducting, then choosing to stop). Interiority is particular (chronological homesickness) and fused to action, not label‑only. The visible cost is leaving at the moment of thinning echoes, which reads as an Earned Stasis choice. Slight softness: contradictory impulses are present but gentle; he rarely wavers under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: sound, glass, wind, and mirrored horizon stack toward the hum, then thin. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he gathers the hush and descends, with a new measure forming—a future‑tilted cost/boon. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp within the opening lines; beats sequence cleanly. The consequence is conceptual and temporal more than plot‑decisive, but it’s felt and on‑page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake are not backdrop; they shape tactics (balcony, panes as harp, wind as conduit) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered, with world rules learned in action (frost tracing the spiral, bubbles as staves). Environment constrains and enables the performance, satisfying the 9‑band gate. No static postcard; the setting evolves with dawn, aurora, and snow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can he call and hold the unheard symphony before inspiration/exhaustion collapses?) is clear and tightens as echoes thin. Escalation is a density build—pane resonance to lake hum to aurora and snow—then a pressured renunciation. The cost is leaving while the auditorium of eras is alive, foregoing further risk to protect the hush. Pressure is coherent but remains lyrical rather than bruising.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory, time’s grammar, and art as summoning ritual accrue through particulars (fortunes as rehearsal marks; nautilus lullaby; mirrored horizon as undecided light). The ending reweighs the premise: creation is cyclical and perishable, with a new measure waiting—a resonant, non‑literal answer. No moralizing; complexity lingers in his chosen departure and promise to return. The conceptual repricing is strong without overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with a coherent perceptual signature (sound‑first noticing) stays steady under pressure. Diction is elevated yet character‑consistent, and the psychic distance is controlled. Purposeful compression is taught and remains legible through closure. Minor risk of purple never tips into opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and images that also advance action. Figurative language remains coherent to the sonic/glass motif; few, if any, mixed metaphors. Momentum holds through sentence rhythm with minimal scaffold or loops. A couple lush lines flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: fortune cookies as rehearsal cues, mirrored horizon physics, nautilus as memory‑instrument, and a conductor of unheard symphonies. Risks feel integral rather than ornamental, and turns arise from established rules (wind through shell, panes as harp). The final reconfiguration (costly leaving + new measure forming) reads inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its singular logic without hedging.</comment>
