<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motives are clear (restore the drones/solve the riddle), and the POV’s sensory‑driven interiority feels character‑specific. Bram’s involuntary truth adds live pressure and distinct status dynamics without overexplaining. Internal conflict is light—solving arrives smoothly—so the final choice lacks a layered tug‑of‑war. Still, actions align with values and the earned ritual moment reveals character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal throughline: approach tower → riddle → descent → box → alarm → compelled truthful reveal → reboot. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (city relit) and a conceptual reweighting via ritual truth. The cost is present (alarms, the tower’s refusal without a spoken truth), though it’s modest and swiftly resolved. Orientation is immediate and stable; the Causal lens holds start to finish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tower, coils, hive chamber, and “nectar dusk” textures are vivid and integrated through action, not postcarding. Objects-as-setting (matchbox, lacquer box, ampoule) constrain choice and charge the final image. World rules (ritualized truth, bottled lightning) stay consistent and legible. A touch more environmental constraint at the peak could have heightened the cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (restore power by waking the swarm) with one effective tightening when alarms force the spoken reveal. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; the reveal is a meaningful hurdle tied to theme. Escalation is elegant but gentle; the puzzle resolves without a hard trade‑off beyond ritual compliance. Still, the narrowing of options is unmistakable at the intercom ultimatum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—utility versus wonder, truth as ritual—emerges organically via riddle, duty, and the swarm’s reawakening. Subtext in Bram’s compulsion and the architect’s design resonates without heavy exposition. The final line edges toward explicit moral (“mystery could light hearts”), slightly flattening ambiguity. Nonetheless, the ending reweights prior images with a felt conceptual charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical first‑person voice with consistent diction and a palpable perceptual signature (“nectar dusk,” copper air). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Bram’s lines carry subtext and pressure. Psychic distance stays steady and plausible. Rhythm modulates well from ascent to ritual climax without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, economical figures, sensory specificity, and minimal scaffolding. Metaphor density is high but controlled; images rarely collide. No visible loops or cadence templates; momentum stays taut through the descent and reveal. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple, but clarity never suffers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bees-as-drones, a truth‑bound toll keeper, and a riddle ritual inside a lightning tower synthesize into a fresh, coherent myth‑tech fable. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (riddle → ritual → acceptance), not gimmicked. The conceptual risk (mystery as operational requirement) pays off cleanly. Slightly higher stakes or a costlier reveal could have pushed this into rarer territory.</comment>
