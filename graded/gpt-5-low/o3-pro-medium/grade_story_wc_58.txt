<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Holt’s vocation and hunger are specific and consistent, and his agreement to bind his craft to Selene’s secrecy is a credible, values‑revealing choice. The princess’s desire “to be seen entire” under a regime of disappearance gives the dialogue quiet pressure. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—curiosity versus professional detachment could be sharper under strain. Still, micro‑choices (composing aloud, accepting the thread, reframing his task) land cleanly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres from garden summons to charged parting, culminating in a conceptual repricing: obituary as compass. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the winter/last‑ships clock supplies ambient cost. The closure’s cost is felt—Holt takes on a binding, risky charge before roads close—though it remains quiet rather than confrontational. The beats tighten meaningfully when Selene gives the thread and when she “projects presence” away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The autumn garden, frost, harbor, and skeletal oak are vivid, filtered through Holt’s sensibility, and the weather/time subtly press urgency. The carpet thread functions as a recurring, charged object that shapes tactics (weaving into lines) and the final image (warm against his wrist). World rules (explained absences, projecting presence) are integrated through observed detail rather than dump. Sensory specificity is high without losing legibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate on preserving Selene’s self in memory before winter severs access; the handoff of the thread is the central tightening. Pressure escalates through time (midnight, frost) and the demand to “pull this through every line,” which forecloses distance between subject and writer. The conflict remains interior and relational, not combative, but the price of complicity and responsibility is clear. A sharper on‑page risk would elevate further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of disappearance, witnessing, and healing emerge organically through image and action—the thread as pulse, obituary as compass, ghost hours as “explained absences.” Subtext works in the way Selene chooses presence over projection at the meeting and then back again on departure. One line edges toward thesis (“She believed words could stitch...”), but the closing reprices the premise without sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect is quiet, poignant, and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The first‑person voice is controlled and character‑specific—elegiac, observant, with consistent diction; Selene’s speech contrasts in austere urgency. Psychic distance stays steady, with purposeful lyric compression at turns. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, carrying subtext and stakes. No head‑hopping or unmotivated register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with varied syntax and image density that mostly propels rather than clogs. A few metaphors stack (“sorrow must border hope the way cliffs border sea”) alongside other figurals, flirting with over‑richness, but clarity holds. Minimal scaffolding and no loops; images do more than one job. The closing cadence is clean and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—a traveler writing living obituaries in a realm where explained absence is currency—feels fresh, and “projecting presence” is an evocative, integrated twist. The thread as tactile conduit between secrecy and remembrance is a memorable, specific device. Risks are taken in tone and concept without obscuring clarity. The synthesis of vocation, polity, and intimate plea reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
