<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is clear and sustained—answer the foam’s question and restore vanished paths—and her actions align with that drive. Interiority is specific (tea left too long in sorrow; copper on the tongue), but internal contradiction is mild and she rarely struggles. Competence dominates; success comes without a hard trade‑off beyond one dissolving glyph. The final stance shift is earned but lightly priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: seeded images (foam, seeds, glyphs, pool) accrete toward a resonance where emotions restore roads. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the map brightens and a path is re-lit, with the conceptual cost that unspoken feeling erases ways. Orientation is clean from the outset and the single transition is smooth. The cost is subtle rather than sharply felt, keeping it just below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The geode cave and mirror pool are vividly realized and actively shape tactics (following seed‑sound into the geode; using the pool’s reflections to place glyphs). Recurring objects (crater glass, seeds, pool) charge the final image. Sensory specificity is balanced across sight, sound, and scent, filtered through Mira’s vocation. Strong integration without overdetailing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres (the missing pieces persist; one glyph fails; time‑sensitivity of fading memory) and tightens once at the pool where she must risk a new hypothesis and act. The dominant stake—recover the paths—remains clear, and the shift from conjecture to application is the meaningful deepening. Still, resistance is low and the price of the attempt feels modest. The escalation reads more contemplative than fraught.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The piece offers an earned, non‑literal answer: silenced emotion consumes routes; restoring feeling restores wayfinding. Thematic images recur and reweight (foam → seeds → glyphs → map), and the ending respects loss while allowing elation. No sermonizing; the counter‑taste of sorrow remains. Complexity is present though not morally thorny.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature runs through, with controlled metaphors and a stable close third. Diction matches the mythic register of the world; no head‑hopping or stance leaks. Rhythm modulates well, especially in the cave. A few lush lines flirt with purple, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images do multiple jobs, verbs are strong, and transitions are clean. A high metaphor density is sustained but mostly coherent; only a couple of stacked images risk excess. No scaffolding loops or cadence templates drag momentum. The final image reprises motifs with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original premises—sea‑foam recollectionist, crystal geode archives, emotion‑glyphs—combine into a coherent, memorable system. The bird‑seed method and crater glass specificity feel fresh rather than ornamental. The turn from “paths vanish” to “emotion restores path” is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is high without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
