<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority—curiosity as a “decaying directive”—drives concrete choices (pressing the seal to her forehead, dancing instead of analyzing). The internal contradiction (analysis vs. motion) resolves through earned action prompted by the riddle. Embodied perception is specific (“air tastes of copper,” spores like “moonlight and ground glass”), revealing temperament under pressure. The commitment to walk with cost (seal will shatter) reads as an authentic stance shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts via storm, riddle, and dance, culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—purpose as living vine needing dancers. Orientation is clean by 120 words; single POV and one contiguous scene fit scope. The cost is legible on page (“I know it will shatter eventually”), and the final image reweights the premise without mechanical tie‑ups. Beat‑to‑beat cohesion is strong, though the turn is more tonal than decisively causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bunker, storm, vines, and bioluminescent corridor constrain movement and tactics (siege rain, bramble exit, mast collapse guiding egress). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the narrator’s bias. The environment directly charges the final image (procession into storm; elk on rooftop orchards). World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving/obeying a decaying directive—tightens when the storm besieges and the riddle demands dance over analysis. The dance functions as a decisive intensification that changes options and commits the narrator to action. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral; external opposition is atmospheric, not antagonistic. Still, the cadence shift is unmistakable and earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: purpose survives through enacted motion; directives die unless “danced.” The wafer seal, the engineer’s laugh, and the storm braid into a non‑literal answer about agency and lineage across time. Subtext arrives through image (elk procession, seal warming) rather than moralizing. The closing reprices earlier motifs with lingering, confident ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; metaphoric texture modulates with pressure. No dialogue needed; diction remains character‑plausible and patterned without drift. The foresight/hindsight conceit is integrated without head‑hopping or timeline confusion. Rhythm tightens effectively at the dance and storm beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; few to no scaffold lines or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is abundant but disciplined and legible; metaphors extend a coherent register (vines, storm, mirrors). Syntax varies, and momentum rarely stalls. Minor risk of lushness is offset by clarity at key turns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—defective “now” vision, rewilded tech ruin, a playful‑precise relic testing whether purpose outlives memory—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The riddle‑to‑dance turn is surprising yet grounded by prior setup. Object and ecology entwine in a singular stance rather than a checklist of tropes. Risk‑taking elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>
