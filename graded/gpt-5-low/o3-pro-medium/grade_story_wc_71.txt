<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (placing the orris, moving the swan, speaking “sanctify”) reveal a specific ethic of attention. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“creeping normality noticer,” “shard of hush”), with competence displayed without smugness. However, there’s little simultaneous contradiction or real cost; she rarely wavers, so pressure on her values remains gentle. The earned shift is credible but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who, where, when), and the pattern of object placement teaches its rules cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the house “not lonely but mute,” and “Displacement…illness, placement the cure,” with the room’s warmth and door’s repose as on‑page consequence. Cost is subtle (risking the hush’s warning and ceding agency to the house), but sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail across senses (sawdust breath, iris/cold earth, streetlight “daydream”), all filtered through Mara’s bias. The house and objects aren’t décor; they constrain tactics and charge the final image (orris warming, swan’s tilt, wishbone gateway). Spatial choreography is coherent and evolving (dust affront, tremor, paint chips aligning). The bay frame brackets tone and time without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure accrues via pattern intensification: initial non‑response to displacement, then the spoken sanctification triggers exhalation, scent, object animation, and the wishbone’s arrival. The meaningful tightening is the move from listening house to communicative house, which reweights the stake from diagnosis to translation. The price is primarily conceptual and risk‑of‑awakening, not visceral, keeping the tension refined rather than gripping. Still, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres through action and image: placement versus displacement, attention as sanctification, translation of mute spaces. The recurring objects reweight meaning at the end (swan, wishbone, orris) without needing a moral. The sentence “Displacement was the illness, placement the cure” edges toward thesis‑statement explicitness, slightly dulling the subtext’s mystery. Overall resonance lingers via the door’s “lungs returning to repose.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and fresh diction (“streetlights daydream,” “hushed blaze”) holds steady and modulates at turns. Psychic distance remains stable and plausibly bound to Mara; inference reads as inference. Figurative texture is purposeful and taught early, avoiding head‑hopping or register slips. Dialogue is minimal but charged, functioning as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with little scaffolding; sentences do multiple jobs and the rhythm flexes with the scene’s pulse. Metaphors are vivid yet coherent to the established physics and motif; no significant mixed‑vehicle drift. No looped paraphrase or template cadence runs; line‑level clarity holds through the closure image. One near‑overt statement of theme is the only slight flattening.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise feels fresh: diagnosing houses through displacement, an orris shard as memory compass, a “shard of hush” as wound/warning. Turns arise from established method rather than late rule drops, and the wishbone’s descent reframes prior details elegantly. The risk‑taking is measured, not showy, and the synthesis feels singular. A deeper cost or contradiction could have pushed it into rarer air.</comment>
