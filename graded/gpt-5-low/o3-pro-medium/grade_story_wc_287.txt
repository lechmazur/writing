<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Milo’s motive—restoring light for Nara—drives every choice, and his “wistfully pragmatic” nature is dramatized in the quiet, competent repair work and the risky decision to bring her. Contradictory impulses (caution vs. necessary risk) surface in “protected vulnerability” as he guides her down the fire escapes. Interiority remains embodied and particular (objects, light, harbor mechanics), avoiding generic labels. The final stewardship choice credibly forecloses comfort for responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: rose dies → tooth unlocks tower → prism failing → ad hoc fix → need for living steward → bringing Nara → on‑page repair. Closure lands with cost as they assume stewardship and risk Nara’s fragile health to seal the crack. The hybrid but dominantly causal drive holds throughout, with set‑ups paid off cleanly (tooth, rumor of luminescence). The final image reconfigures options for the city and the siblings without deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor, tower, mirrored chamber, and prism are tactile and constraint‑bearing; the brass tooth, algae ladder, and conduits shape tactics. Moonlight is not postcard filler: it is the story’s resource, captured and redirected. Spatial choreography remains legible from balcony to skiff to tower depths. The environment decisively charges the ending as Nara channels light within that engineered space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bringing light/hope for Nara) tightens from symbolic loss (rose) to mechanical trial (lock/prism) to ethical risk (move Nara). The key turn—his refusal to be sole savior and to involve Nara—narrows options and carries visible cost. Pressure coheres and rises without an antagonist, driven by his agency. The brief temporary stabilization only to face the widening fissure is an earned deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stewardship, shared resilience, and the ethics of care arise from concrete acts rather than stated morals. Recurring images (oars’ rhythm, hush, light as sap) accrue meaning and reprice the world at the end. Sentiment is present but anchored in risk and labor, avoiding syrup. The final rosebush in the heart of the floodgate reframes the balcony garden as communal duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is controlled, with patterned diction taught early (“rhythm of oars,” “quivering hush”) and paid off. Distance and certainty stay within Milo’s plausible perceptions; no head‑hopping or withholding. Rhythm modulates at pressure points (unlocking, fissure widening, guiding Nara) with confident syntax. Elevated lexicon suits the sensibility without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry multi‑valent work—image, action, and emotional charge—without slack. Refrains are purposeful rather than looped scaffolding; momentum remains clean. A few lush metaphors push toward purple but remain coherent and context‑true. Final lines deliver a crisp, earned image without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floodgate light‑harvesting chamber and the lockmaster’s tooth are fresh inflections on urban‑fantastic motifs. The gardener‑as‑steward synthesis, with Nara as the living prism, feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and lyric density pay off with clarity and consequence. Specific, tactile problem‑solving grounds the wonder.</comment>
