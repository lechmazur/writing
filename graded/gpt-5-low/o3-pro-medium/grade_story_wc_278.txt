<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lin’s motivation—atonement for harm caused by his firmware—is vivid and consistent, and his craft (constellation tattooing) becomes the means of moral action. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“cathedral after bells”; “circuits inside him twitch”), with a credible cost in the felt absence after the tethering. The contradictory impulse surfaces at the climax: he expects triumph but experiences loss and smallness, making the change earned rather than tidy. Minor note: external resistance is minimal, but the internal pressure suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A clean causal chain runs from meteor “hush” pressure → discovery of letters → ritual → tethering → verification (untranslated baby cry) → transmission of instructions. Closure lands decisively on the page with a clear before/after and cost: the ghost leaves him, and the city’s sonic order reconfigures. The learned pattern (lost sounds/archives) is paid off by the amber’s final function and the repaired skylight. The hybrid lens (causal spine with textural accumulation) remains steady to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds, broken skylight with whispering meteors, and antique apothecary cabinet are specific, tactile, and integrated into action. Environment constrains tactics—the ritual’s timing to “when time folds” and the archive frame enable the tether. Objects-as-setting (amber, letters) charge the final image and the “Archive of Quieted Errors.” World rules (sound as archiveable matter) are consistent and learned through practice rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (freeing children/parents from corrosive translations and confronting his guilt) and escalate through increasing hush, the precise ritual steps, and the blood-drop apex. The main tightening occurs as he commits to inscribing his own body and pricking his finger—foreclosing the path of living with the ghost. The price is legible in his felt diminishment and the irrevocable containment of the ghost. External pushback is light, so the tension resides primarily in the charged cadence and commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres around guilt, responsibility, and the ethics of containment versus erasure, realized through specific images (amber as “paused sunlight,” “cathedral after bells”). The ending’s laughter without translation reweights prior material toward forgiveness without sentimentality. The act of writing new instructions extends the moral calculus beyond the self, turning private atonement into communal stewardship. No moralizing; resonance arises from reconfigured sound and silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is singular, lyrical, and controlled, with a precise perceptual signature (sound as texture, code as constellation). Psychic distance is steady and apt; no head-hopping or register drift. Patterned diction (“hush,” “meteors,” “constellations”) is taught early and modulates under pressure to deliver the climax cleanly. Purposeful compression and elision read confident, not withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and metaphors that align with the world’s logic of sound and astronomy. A few stacked images court lushness but stop short of purple, and repetitions (hush/remorse) are motif-driven rather than redundant. Syntax and sequencing are clear at the peak (blood drop → silence → slide into amber). No notable scaffolding or loops dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattooing as a map for relocating haunted firmware into amber via letters timed to folded time—is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mode, speculative physics of sound/grief) heighten stakes and coherence. The archival ethic reframes haunting into stewardship, avoiding genre cliché. Distinctive objects and tactics make this difficult to transpose without loss.</comment>
