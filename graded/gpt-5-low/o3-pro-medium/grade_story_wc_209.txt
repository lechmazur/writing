<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maris’s drive is clear and consistent, rooted in her inherited question and artistic temperament, and her choices (seeking the window, decoding, painting) align. Interiority is vivid through sensory bias rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wrestles with competing impulses, so the cost reads gentle. The felt price is mostly elegiac (the mural fades; her grandfather’s unfinished quest) rather than a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: promise → cathedral access → microfiligree discovery → applied mural and unveiling. Orientation is firm early, and the linkage is motivated without shortcuts. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and resonant reconfiguration: night redefined as presence and communion, enacted by the mural’s awakening. The cost is soft but legible (ephemeral art; carrying forward an inherited quest).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and POV-filtered—cathedral hush, etched glass, spiral stair, brass key—and it shapes the method and discovery. The hidden window literally enables the turn, and the final image of “silence layered itself like glass upon glass” recharges the environment. Spatial and sensory choreography stay coherent. Economy of proper nouns is strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlocking and embodying the night-bloom secret) is signaled and deepens through the cathedral discovery into the mural’s revelation. Escalation is primarily knowledge/intensity, not opposition; the tightening comes from the dawning deadline and the key+stair access to the chamber. The price is gentle and conceptual, yet the choice to paint with ephemeral glow forecloses permanence. One strong turn suffices at this length, though pressure remains low-conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: night as communion, legacy as continuity, and art as translation between mediums. The answer to the posed question is enacted, not preached, and reweights dawn/night expectations. Recurring images (hush, glass layers, nocturnal blossoms) evolve meaningfully by the end. The piece resists tidy moralizing while offering a lucid, resonant stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely held voice is steady, with controlled diction and a distinct perceptual signature. Brief dialogue (Brother Ellion) fits tone and advances plot without exposition. Rhythm modulates well between description and action, and elisions are purposeful. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prose is lush yet largely disciplined, with images doing multiple jobs; syntax varies and carries momentum. A few density spikes flirt with purple, and one repeated phrase (“hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window”) risks ornamental echo, but the reprise is thematically functional. Minimal scaffold or loops; clarity holds at the climax. Line-level craft supports cadence without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: micro-etched cathedral glass as botanical cipher, postcards as intergenerational quest, and a night-activated mural. The “dawning hush” inversion and lunar-phosphor method innovate within a lyric mode. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule changes. The risks in tone and concept heighten coherence and land cleanly.</comment>
