<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Samara’s face-blind, hyper‑methodical mind is distinct and embodied (textures over faces, numbering breaths), and her micro‑choices (graphite tracing, summoning both suspects) align with her flaw. The internal shift—“a new sense arranging itself”—lands, though it skews tidy and low‑friction. Mercado adds light pressure but rarely forces a hard trade‑off. The emotional cost is mostly felt, not contested, keeping this just shy of high‑band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: quarry → envelope’s rule → oil‑film tracing → decade‑old pattern → dusk confrontation → confession and reopened case. The time skip to dusk is clean and serves the plan; closure lands both externally (confession) and internally (empathy awakening). Slight convenience in the suspects’ quick capitulation softens cost. Lens: Causal with a lyric overlay is held through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The quarry and mist are active: the pool’s film yields the heart image; the mist separates suspects; dawn’s ember reweights the final moment. Sensory texture is purposeful (violet perfume, sea salt on inland crates) and POV‑filtered. Environment constrains tactics at the climax. Strong, integrated atmosphere without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the truth/awaken empathy—is clear, with a meaningful tightening when she commits to bringing both suspects and asserts “together.” Escalation is steady but low‑resistance; the confession arrives quickly, minimizing felt price. The internal/external conflicts interweave, though the ethical calculus faces little pushback. Effective but not pressing hard enough for higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Unifying opposites” and dormant empathy are dramatized through concrete images (single heart between silhouettes; mist‑separated suspects, dawn’s ember). The final image reweights the premise toward shared humanity without overt moralizing. A printed instruction sheet edges theme toward didactic, slightly flattening ambiguity. Still, resonance lingers via the ribbon touch and hush.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a tactile, sensory‑biased perceptual signature suits a face‑blind artist. Lyrical diction modulates under pressure and dialogue is spare, functional, and status‑legible. No head‑hopping or register drift, and the elisions (time to dusk) are clean. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (image, clue, mood) with strong rhythm and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is frequent but coherent (“furrowed hush,” “time lanced the surface”) and seldom clutters clarity. No significant loops or template cadences; momentum holds through the reveal and confrontation. Slight lushness in spots keeps it just below the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—face‑blind portraitist solving by emotional geometry and “unifying opposites” in a mist‑veiled quarry—feels fresh. The oil‑film tracing into a heart silhouette is inventive and thematically functional. The rapid confession leans on genre convenience, trimming surprise. Overall, distinctive voice and concept deliver a memorable turn.</comment>
