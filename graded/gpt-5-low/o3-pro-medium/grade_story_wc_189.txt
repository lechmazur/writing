<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marella’s interiority is specific and embodied—her tactile reading of stone and surf—and her contradiction (righteous anger vs measured tact) drives the choice. The final renunciation (gentle tide, not storm surge) feels earned by the cicada‑enabled foresight. Relationship dynamic with Quillon is quiet but functional, supplying pressure without stealing focus. Slightly soft cost embodiment (we feel the renunciation, less the strain of holding it) keeps this from higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: ritual → song → foresight → stance crystallization. Orientation is clean; the cicada’s activation causally gates the vision that narrows options. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with a legible cost (foreclosing cathartic confrontation). The causal thread is spare but coherent and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto’s acoustics and tidal hinge are not mere backdrop; they enable the tangential song and structure the final cadence (timing steps to hush between waves). Sensory detail is vivid and POV‑filtered, with bioluminescence and stone texture doing character work. The recurring object (cicada) and environment charge the final image. Economy is high; no museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to speak to save the reefs—is clear and tightens when the vision shows two branches, one catastrophic, one viable. The meaningful turn is Marella’s deliberate recalibration of tone, paying the price of tempering anger. External antagonists are offstage, slightly softening felt pressure, but the internal/external weave holds. Escalation is quiet yet definite under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: hinge moments, oblique coaxing, speech tuned to time’s corrugations. The ending’s image (stars leaning; the night’s discourse) reweights prior motifs without overexplaining. One near‑didactic line (“perhaps our task is simply to listen…”) brushes close to stating a moral, trimming peak resonance. Overall, subtext and image carry the load.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with marine‑tuned perception; diction and rhythm are consistent with POV and scene pressure. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (Quillon’s need and Marella’s hesitance). No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elision is taught and paid off in the ritual. Elevated register fits the fable‑like frame without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet precise; images cohere within a marine/astral palette, avoiding mixed‑metaphor fuzz. Momentum holds; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere, agency, or theme. Minor risk of purple accretion is managed by clean syntax and purposeful beats. No loops or scaffolding artifacts visible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—tidal‑pool chronicler, tangential song to wake a jade cicada, foresight as cadence‑tuning—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (mythic object, lyric diction) are integrated and pay off at closure. Emotional truth (trading righteous surge for effective gentleness) grounds the conceit. Specificity and conceptual integrity lift it above template.</comment>
