<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quillan’s meticulousness motivates every action, from calipers and tuning forks to the final inscription, and his internal conflict (oath to preserve vs. fear of volatile memory/guilt) sharpens under pressure. Recognition of Lyra and the omitted vow creates a credible fracture that drives the peak choice. Emotions are embodied (breath like ground diamonds, lungs turning to shards) without therapy-speak. The Earned Stasis at the end—archiving the vow with cost—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Structure is clean: vault → summons → test → revelation → inscription → release. Causality holds (runes indicate a void; therefore he tests; therefore he confronts the vow; therefore he measures and archives). Closure lands on the page with cost—the vow is retrieved and sealed, and the price of guilt is acknowledged and reshaped. Orientation is crisp early; the single-scene arc maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen library, dawn window, and projection chamber are richly specific and functionally constraining (cold breath, snow sift, illusions fading press urgency). Objects-as-setting (eidograph, slide, ledger, tuning fork) shape tactics and charge the final image. Environmental rules remain consistent and discovered through action. The setting’s texture mirrors interior stakes without over-declaring symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve truth vs. risk volatile memory and self-implication) is signaled early and tightens decisively when the silhouettes reveal Lyra. The key turn is his choice to measure and record the vow despite the pain, foreclosing denial. The cost (acknowledged omission and guilt) is unmistakable in the inscription beat and the softened yet persistent weight. No false reversals; pressure coheres to the final sealing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme integrates through action: measurement as liturgy versus the unmeasured vow; preservation as love’s difficult form. “Luminous vows” reprice memory’s ethics without moralizing, landing in the charged final image of a promise archived with cost. Ambiguity remains (memory vs. illusion; truth vs. necessary record) but coherence holds. The resonance lingers beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close carries a distinct perceptual signature (measurement metaphors, crystalline diction) that remains stable under stress. Elision patterns are taught early and paid off (silence frequencies → light waveform). No head-hopping or register slips; modulation tightens appropriately at the peak. A hairline risk of lushness never breaks POV plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and propulsive; images often do double duty (breath, snow, light as memory). Occasional density flirts with purple, but metaphor control and variety prevent muddle. No evident loops or scaffold, and the final line precisely recharges earlier motifs. Syntax and rhythm shift to suit pressure without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—archival cosmology, measuring silence/light, a lantern that projects unspoken promises—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and conceit heighten stakes rather than obscure clarity. Turns grow organically from the premise and Quillan’s trait set. The piece avoids template beats and offers a memorable conceptual frame.</comment>
