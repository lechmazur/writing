<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Naram-ben’s thrift versus hunger for discovery is dramatized in micro-choices, culminating in sacrificing his astrolabe. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“thrifty even with his awe”), and his fear never vanishes as he proceeds. The sacrifice forecloses a path with real cost and coheres with his flaw. A slight hedge is that he masters the tile with little visible struggle before the cost scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene, clean anchors (who/where/when) within the opening lines, with coherent because/therefore sequencing from alignment to activation to sacrifice. Closure lands on the page: the covenant is acknowledged, the astrolabe is lost, and the tile’s extra row reweights the rule-set. The lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative cadence that resolves through a decisive act. No loose set-ups or retroactive patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The reimagined Babylonian palace is tactile and charged, and it constrains action (roofless court for Polaris, empty palace “between regimes”). Recurring objects (tile, fountain, banners, lions) evolve with events and charge the final image. World rules are learned through observation and use, not dump. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics and the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seal the covenant—tightens through activation, the sigil doorway, and the costly choice to surrender the astrolabe. Pressure coheres: his method works, but the price escalates to a meaningful trade. Internal and external conflicts interweave without overcomplication. Minor note: the leap from deciphering to portal acceptance is swift but still earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme—devotion to discovery over deity—emerges organically through image and act, and the ending reweights earlier material (mystery can expand without losing equilibrium). The “He understood then…” line borders on explicit statement, slightly reducing subtextual charge. Still, the final cadence is resonant and avoids a moral. The costed sacrifice anchors the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person closely held to Naram-ben sustains a distinct perceptual signature (“dusky harmony,” “liquid thought”). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue needed; voice carries action and implication. Elevated register fits the protagonist’s vocation and the ritual’s gravity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: images do double duty for setting and tension (“numbers into cuneiform light”). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; it rarely muddies causality. Varied syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum through the ritual’s beats. A few heightened phrases skirt purple but remain purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of Babylonian magic square, astronomy, and a covenant to discovery feels fresh and inevitable by the end. The empiricism-meets-sorcery approach risks lyric excess but pays off with conceptual repricing tied to a concrete cost. Recurrences (lions, banners, fountain) are reweighted, not decorative. It’s bold without gimmickry.</comment>
