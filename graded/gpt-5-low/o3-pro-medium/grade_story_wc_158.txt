<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (turning insomnia and pain into art) drives concrete choices: leaving the shell, trusting the postcard, and planting it despite trembling. Contradictory impulses (war in her chest vs. the lullaby’s pull) are embodied and sustained. The cost—risking the identity built around anguish and the fortress of the shell—reads, though it’s gentle. Interiority is vivid and particular without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: postcard arrival → guided ascent → elder encounter → garden → planting → lullaby harmonizes → sleep. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: the inner war ceases and sleep becomes possible with poems “dreaming on their own.” The cost is the relinquishment of a long-held posture of suffering and the safety of the labyrinth. Orientation is clean from the first lines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell, reef light, and garden of wound-flowers are specific, tactile, and POV-filtered. Environment shapes options (the shell’s echoes fuel insomnia; spiral ramps dictate egress; the garden enables the decision and its outcome). Recurring objects (postcard, vines) charge the final image of lit corridors. World rules are consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform torment/find rest) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at the planting choice. Pressure coheres through the lullaby’s guidance and the elder’s presence, culminating in a decisive act that forecloses the old pattern. The price is legible: surrendering the old refuge and singular reliance on anguish as fuel. No antagonist needed; internal vs external weave cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: bartering despair for color via a “blossom armistice.” The elder’s explanation flirts with on-the-nose but is redeemed by the concrete ritual of planting and the reweighted final images (vines lighting corridors, seeds abroad). The ending offers a resonant answer: beauty requires reconciliation, not erasure, of hurt. Ambiguity lingers productively (cost of identity shift, future wanderers).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature remains controlled and consistent; diction fits the fable-like, marine cosmos logic. Psychic distance is steady; elisions are taught and paid off (off-key wind, lullaby, elder-self). No head-hopping; the elder’s voice is sparing and textured. Rhythm modulates from restless density to a softer cadence at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is rich and propulsive; metaphors interlink (algae, chlorophyll, ink) with minimal muddle. A few dense flights edge purple, but clarity holds and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. Syntax varies; final cadence earns its hush. Information density is high without blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shell-as-home, galaxy postcard planted to grow singing poems, and elder-self of starlight/barnacles synthesize into a fresh myth. The turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the images seeded early (spirals, lullabies, algae). Risk-taking is coherent and thematically integral, not ornamental. Final reconfiguration (poems dream on their own; seeds broadcast) is striking and memorable.</comment>
