<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dreya’s motives are vivid and particular—translate the astronomer’s grief via her press—and her micro‑choices (mirrors instead of type; the final ambiguous line; flinging the sheet) reveal values under pressure. The internal contradiction (yearning to “solve” emotion vs fear that quantification kills empathy) culminates in an earned renunciation. Embodied feeling (“numbers that smelled of pine and grief,” bruised ribs) keeps her from abstraction. Slight softness: her high competence faces little resistance beyond the vanishing‑stars clock.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern density builds (press → halo → primes → ambiguity) and pays off in a CR/RR closure where ambiguity restores stars and Dreya refuses full solution. Orientation is clean early (press at midnight; commission; vanishing‑stars window), and each beat coherently intensifies. Cost is legible on the page: “dared not finish” and the kept feathers as residual price. The final image reweights the premise without an explain‑all wrap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop, press, and open roof are tactile and integral—tools become the method and the launch vector for action. Physical details evolve with events (halo dust into ink; paper as “bright, silent shout” that lights the sky). Setting constrains tactics and charges the ending image. Atmosphere (“topaz workshop under stars”) aligns with theme without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (render the astronomer’s feeling-math before the stars vanish) tightens with the “narrow hour” and the clocks stuttering. The reversal/deepening arrives when Dreya chooses deliberate ambiguity—then risks a second pull and throws it skyward, foreclosing clarity for effect. The cost is her refusal to complete the equation, keeping only feathers. World‑scale consequence is funneled credibly through the intimate act of printing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres: only ambiguity sustains empathy’s motion; some truths are true because they never resolve. Motifs (primes as sorrows, feathers as variables) accrue and shift meaning at the end. The final charged poise—silence “like being understood”—offers a non‑literal answer without moralizing. Occasional declaratives (“Only in the gash…”) serve the lyric argument rather than flatten it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with a precise perceptual signature (mathematics sensorially inflected) stays within Dreya’s plausible noticing. Rhythm modulates under pressure—denser around pulls, easing into the final hush—without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off. No dialogue needed; narration carries subtext cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (equations as wedding rings; primes whispering sorrow). Figurative language is lush but coherent; few, if any, mixed metaphors. Momentum never stalls; sentences vary and propel. Minor risk of saturation is managed by the clarifying cadence shift at the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Printing grief with halo dust via ambiguity to relight stars is a fresh synthesis; primes-as-sorrows and “mathematics of yearning” feel singular. Turns arise from character choice, not gimmick. The refusal to solve entirely is an elegant, non‑obvious cost that feels inevitable in hindsight. Boldness heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
