<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liora’s reluctance and hidden vow create a credible contradiction that drives choice. Her agency is clear in assembling the model, using light to redirect birds, and choosing quiet anonymity at the end. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“salt and rust,” “sweat”), not abstract. Minor softness: intuition finds the socket a bit conveniently, reducing felt struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain from nut → blueprint → model → labyrinth insertion under a frost clock. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change: the maze reconfigures and miners are guided out. Cost exists (time pressure, physical risk), though it’s relatively light, and the miners’ arrival is a touch convenient. The hybrid causal/lyric flow stays coherent and oriented throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cliff, orchard, labyrinth, and birds are vividly integrated and constrain tactics (amber glare signals, rails aligning, frost locking joints). Sensory specificity is strong and POV-filtered; details evolve with action. The environment charges the finale (birds alight, terraces open). World rules are learned through doing rather than told.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open a safe path before frost) is signaled early and tightens with the birds’ hostility and the approaching freeze. The decisive turn—model insertion—reconfigures options with a clear on-page result. The pressure arc is steady, though hazards resolve smoothly with little personal loss. The frost deadline and courtyard access requirement sharpen choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of caretaking vs. power, assembling guidance from fragments, and reorienting guardianship are earned through images (amber, birds, blueprint). Final images reweight the premise (safety as harvest, not glory). Slight thematic overstatement in “Caretakers should leave only a harvest of safety, never the taste of power” edges toward moralizing, tempering the score. Subtext otherwise holds in gesture and restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent psychic distance; diction like “offhandedly exact” becomes a meaningful motif. No head-hopping or register slips; rhythm modulates well under pressure. Purposeful elision (intuition, dream) is taught and paid off. The voice remains character-bound and confident without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with crisp, musical lines; images often do double duty for world and mood. Figurative texture is rich but mostly disciplined and clear under action. Minor risk of lushness in clusters, yet momentum holds and no paraphrase loops drag. Final sentences land cleanly with charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mechanical birds, amber resin, a nut-shelled blueprint assembled by touchless impressions—these synthesize into a fresh, coherent vision. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the seeded objects and rules. The piece risks a hybrid lyric-engineered mode and sustains clarity. Emotional truth of quiet service anchors the novelty.</comment>
