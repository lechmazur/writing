<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive and worldview (“encrypt vulnerability as strength”) are specific and consistently enacted, and her micro‑choices (dice on plinth, dance‑firmware of mercy, sparing Vane with a die) reveal values under pressure. The interiority is tactile and character‑particular, though conflict skews toward high competence with minimal friction. The brief Vane encounter adds status history but resolves quickly, limiting relational crucible depth. A small note of doubt (“whispered… remain silent”) helps, yet contradiction remains light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal dominance holds: descent → vault dance → dice authorization → defenses → upload → sabotage/flood → Vane → escape/broadcast. Orientation is clean from the opening and the closure lands on the page with cost: the lab collapses and Lira burns the bridge with her former masters while releasing the secrets. The “eternal gamble” lock and broadcast image provide a decisive before/after. Turns are earned; a few obstacles resolve a touch easily, but causality remains tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken lab is richly embodied and constrains choices: algae stairs, barnacled sensors that require dance, magnetic drives, brine‑clogged turrets, and flood‑pressure shaping the exit. Environmental evolution (plankton constellations guiding ascent; moonlit breach) charges the final image. Details are filtered through Lira’s professional gaze with purposeful specificity. World rules stay consistent and learnable through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate the archives) is clear and the pressure tightens once meaningfully via defenses stirring and the sabotage‑driven flood clock. Agency drives every advance, and the Vane beat refracts the moral calculus. Costs land (destruction, risk, irrevocable exposure), though turrets and vault recognition yield quickly, softening resistance and trade‑off texture. Still, the escalation remains coherent and culminates in a charged choice set.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme integrates through action: vulnerability rendered as code, dance teaching mercy, and the spider/web motif reframing liberation as patient, networked revolt. The final float‑and‑broadcast image reweights prior images without sermonizing. A few explicit statements (“vulnerability is strongest when encrypted”) verge on on‑the‑nose but are mostly earned by scene. Ambiguity around Vane’s fate and the ethics of destruction adds resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The first‑person voice is distinctive, lyric, and technically controlled; diction and rhythm match Lira’s sensibility and maintain coherence under pressure. Purposeful elision and metaphor are taught early and sustained without head‑hopping. Dialogue is minimal but the one exchange carries subtext and status. No register drift; the narrative certainty matches plausible knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid images and clean sequencing; verbs and nouns do the work. Occasional motif reiterations (“as a spider spins its web,” applause images) risk minor redundancy but do not stall momentum. Figurative texture is lush yet coherent; few mixed metaphors and no template cadences interfere with clarity. Rhythm varies appropriately through pressure shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: dance‑based ciphering, hangman’s dice as exec override, firmware “mercy” taught via choreography, and an underwater heist collapsing into a public‑facing repricing. Turns arise from established methods rather than late rule changes, and the allegorical layer deepens rather than decorates. Bold stylistic risk serves coherence and stakes. The piece commits fully to its premise with memorable particulars.</comment>
