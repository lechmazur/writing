<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and embodied perception (“glass sliding between heartbeats,” “struck quartz”) ground Mara’s choices. Competence is compelling, and the sacrifice of the artifact reveals values under pressure. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or missteps, so tension skews external. Still, her method and sacrifices feel character‑specific rather than generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, each move links cleanly: signal → vision of the fragment → descent → repurpose → environmental revival. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost: the fragment spends its charge and becomes inert, and Mara accepts continuing cycles of endings. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the lunar deadline narrows options. The chain lacks any deus ex machina; the decisive act is hers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is vivid and tactically constraining: no power forces the handcrank glider, the pylon and fissure channel discovery and ritual setup. Sensory specificity (“fog pulsed in squares,” “canvas patched with station blueprints”) feels POV‑filtered and purposeful. Environment directly charges the final image as lights return across the city. World rules remain consistent within the piece’s magic‑tech logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harvesting a beginning to avert silence) is signaled early, with time pressure from perigee and dead lifts. The tightening occurs in the descent and the repurposing ritual, culminating in the artifact’s expenditure; a real price is paid. Conflict remains mostly frictionless—few setbacks beyond logistics and the clock—but agency drives every turn. The piece earns its resolution through action rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Finding the beginning in every ending” shifts from credo to enacted ethic via the sacrificial use of the fragment; the city’s revival and the “brand‑new overture” resonate. The moon’s supervisory retreat reframes the labor’s dignity without a tidy moral. Slight on‑the‑nose repetition of the theme phrase softens subtlety but stays earned by scene work. The aftertaste is imagistic and reflective rather than didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature and modulates with pressure. Diction (“serenely electric,” “prismatic syllables”) is consistent with the character’s vocation and mindset. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; elisions are purposeful and legible. Rhythm varies effectively, with image density controlled enough to maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with lines often doing multiple jobs; figurative choices feel calibrated and coherent. Minimal scaffolding and no notable paraphrase loops; momentum stays forward. A few ornate images cluster but do not blur causality in peak beats. Syntax variety and clean sequencing support the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a celestial interpreter in a suspended radio city, a “shard of hush,” and a Hollywood star fragment used as sacrificial tech. The resolution feels both inevitable and surprising given the established method of “discarding assumptions.” Risks in tone and worldbuilding cohere and heighten meaning without gimmickry. The piece reads as a singular vision rather than a template remix.</comment>
