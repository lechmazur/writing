<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rowan’s “hard softness” is embodied through ritual competence, tenderness with Juniper, and the costly choice to chip the heirloom box. Interiority is specific (breath, scent of charcoal, ropey scars) and contradictions persist credibly. The relationship pressure with Juniper sharpens his values without tidy absolution. A touch more on his resisting impulse before breaking the shard could heighten the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual gathers charge until Juniper’s arrival forces an outward turn, culminating in a Charged Poise/RR as he reassigns stewardship of “innocence.” Closure cost is on‑page (damaging the relic, leaving space for her sketches, shared descent). Orientation is clean early; no causality slips; the ending reweights prior material without mechanical tying off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, wind‑bent pine, and needle bed are tactile, profession‑filtered, and the moonlight’s glaze “glow” charges the porcelain’s function. The setting constrains tone and choice (quiet ritual away from camp) and returns in the final descent image. Environmental specificity is disciplined and purposeful across senses (scent of needles, charcoal). The box also acts as micro‑setting, integral to the last beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating pain—tightens when Juniper appears, shifting the ritual from private to shared and forcing a costly action (breaking the box, reconfiguring the bargain). The escalation is modest but clear under the accumulative lens. The final stance forecloses solitary custody of grief in favor of shared stewardship. Stakes stay personal and legible without dilation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and act: ash as first draft, shard as memory/possibility, stewardship of innocence, and translation as communal practice. Subtext hums in the shard exchange and the “space for future sketches,” avoiding moralizing. A couple of explicit thesis lines (“Pain, he believed, could be translated...”) slightly blunt subtlety. The final duet of footfalls delivers a resonant non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is controlled and consistent, with cadence modulating around the ritual and the visitor’s entrance. Dialogue is spare, intent‑driven, and age‑credible, carrying subtext without speechifying. Diction is elevated yet coherent with a reflective, ritual frame rather than implausible omniscience. No POV leakage or mechanical slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush but precise; metaphors align with established motifs (fire, ash, porcelain, celestial motion) and rarely overreach. Rhythm varies well; no paraphrase loops or template cadence clusters. A high density of figurative language skirts purple but maintains clarity and propulsion. Opening and closing images are clean and echo each other without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bargain with wildfire and the porcelain‑shard bequest feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The piece risks a meditative, accumulative mode and lands it with a concrete, surprising action (damaging the heirloom). Imagery choices cohere into a singular vision rather than a motif checklist. The synthesis of occupation, ritual, and generational stewardship stands out.</comment>
