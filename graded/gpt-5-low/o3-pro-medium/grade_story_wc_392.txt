<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear and steadily intensifies: expose Havel to reclaim agency. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“wet iron,” measured water depth), and the curiosity-vs‑protocol conflict lives in action. She adapts under pressure (crawling under the gate, leveraging the jack) without becoming superhuman. The final stance—carrying the memories forward—reads as earned endurance with a modest but felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant causal chain holds: lantern → guidance → rescue/confession → surge/lost lantern → hidden chamber → ledgers → public exposure. Orientation is crisp early; single scene with one clean uptick in stakes. Closure lands on the page with social cost: Havel’s downfall begins and Mara accepts the burden of the memories. The only softness is the convenience of the perfectly incriminating cache, but it’s seeded by the lantern’s rule-set and doesn’t undercut the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel’s wet iron, hesitant electricity, water depth, and sagging mesh tangibly constrain choices and tactics. The lantern functions as a charged micro‑setting that shapes movement and the final image. Spatial choreography (blocked shaft, low arch, dry chamber) stays coherent as pressure evolves. Atmosphere and specificity are purposeful rather than scenic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (preventable deaths vs. institutional cover‑up) are signaled early and escalate through one meaningful tightening: aid the trapped worker and risk deeper pursuit to secure proof. Agency drives the critical turns; the surge/water loss of the lantern exacts price and alters tactics. Resolution is earned via exposure rather than convenient accident. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than bodily but registers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Freedom vs. bureaucratic erasure resonates through the Underground Railroad lantern and the ledgers-as-chains image. The final acceptance to “carry them upward” reweights prevention as an ethical lineage, not a slogan. One line edges toward aphorism (“Freedom, prevention, and truth share a corridor”) but is supported by concrete particulars. Subtext—debts paid forward—emerges from image rather than lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, disciplined first-person with a measured investigative lexicon braided with lyric inflection. Diction stays within a plausible register for a competent investigator under stress; micro‑choices and perceptions stay character-bound. Dialogue is spare but functional and credibly voiced (the worker’s rasped confession). Rhythm modulates well between observation and urgency without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; little scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is vivid and mostly controlled (“ink gleam like bruises”), with occasional lushness that still supports sense. Syntax varies to match pressure spikes (surge, crawl, levering). Copy is clean; no artifacts that blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—preventable death investigation meets a sentient abolitionist artifact—feels fresh and thematically inevitable. The lantern’s entangled memories transform a corruption exposé into a lineage-of-care narrative without gimmickry. Turns are grounded in prior pattern rather than late rule changes. Risk-taking in tone and premise heightens stakes while preserving clarity.</comment>
