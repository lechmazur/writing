<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hai-rin’s motive—to seek hidden patterns and honor hidden effort—drives concrete micro‑choices (answering the whistle, descending, reading tea foam, proposing the water‑net). The “demure audacity” provides a credible contradiction (modesty vs. bold initiative). Emotional embodiment is present but the felt cost of his stance remains gentle rather than pressurized. Relationship dynamics with Zhen are clear, though largely collaborative rather than crucible‑tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The causal thread is soft but coherent (whistle → inquiry → tea‑foam insight → harbor experiment → reweighted understanding). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “The sky is changing because we are listening,” with cost encoded as collective labor, vigilance, and a relinquished night’s rest. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard flow holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is lush and purposeful: rain‑slick parapet, moon paths, harbor silk net, and fireflies all filter through Hai‑rin’s craft‑mind. Environment constrains tactics (still oars, thin net, water wide enough to mirror) and charges the final image with droplets gathered as narrative residue. Spatial choreography is precise, and recurring objects evolve with function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates quietly from curiosity to collective experiment, with a single decisive deepening when the net translates the moon’s drift into “trembling calligraphy.” Stakes are primarily epistemic and thematic; visible cost is modest (discipline, strain of holding the net), limiting intensity. The resolution is earned by Hai‑rin’s initiative rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hidden effort/patterns integrates through nets, rain traces, tea foam, and laboring fishermen; the ending reweights attention as agency. The final line edges toward explicit thesis, but it’s anchored in character and image (gathering droplets) rather than summary. Subtext flows in the reciprocity of observing and being changed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and character‑specific, marrying tactile craft language with lyric attention. Dialogue is purposeful and indirect, carrying subtext and propelling action. Diction is elevated but coherent with a contemplative artisan; rhythm modulates effectively without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is musical and dense without succumbing to muddle; images like “trembling calligraphy” and “parapet remembering the rain” earn their keep. Occasional flourish (“scintillatingly somber”) risks purple but remains legible and voice‑true. Momentum holds; no obvious loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a net‑mender philosopher decoding the moon via a silk mirror is striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric tone and conceptual closure pay off with coherence. The pattern logic (whisk foam to harbor silk) feels freshly motivated and specific.</comment>
