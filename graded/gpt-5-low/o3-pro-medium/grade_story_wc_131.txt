<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular: a hidden caretaker wants to become visible to those in need, tested when the child requires both calm and sight. Interiority is embodied through technical, tactile acts (muslin bags, shortwave magnet, copper wire). The internal contradiction—cherishing invisibility yet choosing exposure—surfaces in the induced silhouette beat. Slightly muted cost keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with strong causal spine: outage → cache → tape fragment guidance → discovery of child → induced visibility → addition to cache. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he becomes partially seen and recommits to waiting, with a charged addition to the cache. Orientation is clean early; world rules (sense memory through materials) are taught and held. The cost is present but understated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: ducts, copper mains, thermostat wire, and emergency lighting constrain tactics and enable the induced charge solution. Sensory specificity is vivid across modalities without losing spatial coherence. The library-at-dawn atmosphere charges the final image and the cache’s meaning. World texture evolves with action, not static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (becoming visible to help) tightens when the child appears and needs both calm and a literal glimpse. The key tactical turn—jury‑rigged induction using tape shard, wire, and phone coil—narrows options and risks exposure. The price is partial visibility and relinquishing notes to the cache as ongoing duty. Pressure is coherent and escalates once, appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, visibility, and stewardship accrue through concrete acts (cache, oxide flaking, hum through copper) rather than abstraction. The “remembrance is circuitry” line edges toward thesis‑statement explicitness, slightly blunting the otherwise resonant subtext. The final charged poise reweights the premise without tidy moralizing. The motifs (magnetism, hum, light) return with altered meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with technical lexicon that fits the character (“shortwave magnet,” “coil,” “thermostat”). Dialogue fragments feel natural and carry subtext under pressure. The perceptual signature—synesthetic smell and sound—stays consistent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well across calm observation and tense aid.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images tend to cohere and multi‑task. A few high‑density metaphor clusters flirt with purple but remain controlled and character‑true. No noticeable loops or scaffolding slow momentum, and syntax varies with scene needs. Final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—an unseen library caretaker using magnetism and memory to become briefly visible—is fresh and confidently executed. The tape fragment as both relic and tool is an inventive, character‑specific turn. Risks in diction and world texture pay off without obscuring clarity. Minor familiarity in “invisible helper” trope is transformed by tactile, technical choices.</comment>
