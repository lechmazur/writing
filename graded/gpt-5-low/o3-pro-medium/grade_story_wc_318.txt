<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orren’s motive—coaxing back laughter—drives clear, tactic‑level choices (sequencing blowers, scattering leaves, selecting lullabies). Interiority is economical yet specific (“mournfully eager,” converses with the unspoken), though contradictions are implied more by diction than dramatized in choice. The upstairs family is off‑page pressure rather than a relationship crucible, fitting the scope. The final renunciation of noise into earned silence reads as a credible, paid stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density builds through the tunnel and vents to a charged reconfiguration upstairs, with emotional cost legible in the parents’ reactions and the reweighted silence. Orientation is clean from the hourglass to the tunnel; the leaf blower ritual is coherent and causally linked to upstairs effects. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: silence returns altered, with the coil of the pull cord and bow sealing the afterstate. The persistent constraint (tunnel acoustics, blowers’ mechanics) shapes tactics and the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tunnel’s echoing geometry and floor vents materially shape tactics and outcome; the blowers and leaves function as a micro‑setting that constrains action. Sensory specifics (mildew, gasoline, chlorophyll mist) are vivid and purpose‑driven. World rules remain consistent, discovered through action. The recurring objects (pull cords/leaves) charge the final image without feeling ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is precise: restore laughter. Escalation is a controlled intensification (engines from cough to roar to whisper) culminating in upstairs micro‑turns (mother’s tears, father’s blade‑song) that make cost felt. While not a hard either/or choice, the cadence shift from wail to whisper is a committed renunciation that closes a path. Agency sits firmly with Orren’s method and modulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of tending to the unspoken emerges through concrete action (lullabies in wind, leaf mist) rather than statement, with grief and joy interleaving. The final repricing of silence—no longer “overdressed”—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. The leafy child‑outline skirts sentimentality by remaining mute, charging absence with presence. Ambiguity remains purposeful and charged, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person voice sustains control with consistent focalization and taught patterning; omniscient glances upstairs feel of a piece. Diction remains purposeful and character‑tuned (gasoline, frayed cords) while accommodating heightened metaphor. Rhythm modulates well across escalation and denouement. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet largely precise, with images doing multiple jobs (“sound… macerate the very cobwebs” marries atmosphere to action). Minor density risks are managed; metaphor chains stay coherent and avoid muddle. No evident loops or scaffolding; propulsion aligns with scene needs. Final line returns motifs cleanly without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>The conceit—a leaf blower symphony as grief ritual—is striking and followed through with integrity. Fresh object work (pull cord as baton, leaves as communion) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in tone and method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The reconfiguration of “haunting” into reclaimed mirth is a non‑obvious, memorable turn.</comment>
