<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority (“empirically whimsical and gravely serious”) drives concrete choices: sleeping at waypoints, planting the seed, testing visions, and finally choosing to sail. The luminous doubt functions as a live contradiction that complicates each proof. Micro‑choices under pressure (chewing orchid, listening “without ears,” pressing palm to ask about futures) reveal values in action. The only limitation is how little pushback the world gives her competence; the struggle stays mostly internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned waypoints (dream → verification) tighten into the dawn listening, then the seed’s emergence, then the eastward sign and departure plan. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: carving a mast and committing to sail before monsoon with the seedling as “captain, logbook, and compass.” Cost is legible—risking the voyage and leaving the ridge’s protections under a live clock. Causality reads coherent within the magical logic; no dangling set‑ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is lush and purpose‑driven: jacaranda, tide pools, orchid suns, and the “library built of rain” are not postcards but sites of tactic and test. Environment constrains choices (waypoints, alkaloids to induce dreams) and supplies resources (driftwood for a mast). The monsoon horizon and ridge topography shape timing and movement. The final image is charged by place and weather, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove and protect collective memory before monsoon) is announced early and tightened through escalating proofs that feel increasingly costly to doubt. The decisive deepening—listening “without ears” to let the island choose—reconfigures options, then the eastbound petal‑boat forces a commitment to sail. The price (risk, departure, surrender of verification control) is clear without overstatement. A single antagonist is absent, but pressure coheres from clock and calling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory as living commons, verification versus faith, and guidance through remembrance arise organically from acts and images (marbles, driftwood, ear‑fruit). The final realization that “memory, once wakened, also steers” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext blooms in the tension between curated proofs and doubt. Resonance lingers in the charged decision to be midwife rather than auditor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV and plausible certainty; inference reads as inference. Diction modulates with pressure (from observational to incantatory) while staying coherent. Minimal dialogue is functional and in‑character. No leakage or gratuitous register shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with clean momentum; images do double duty without scaffolding. Figurative language is rich but largely disciplined (“library built of rain,” “embryo fruit shaped like an ear”) and stays legible. Minor luxuriance never muddies causality or the closure image. Syntax varies and supports cadence shifts at turns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The role of “reality checker,” the knowledge‑fruit that listens, and the rain‑library synthesize into a fresh, inevitable‑feeling concept. Risks in tone and structure pay off, with dream‑tests and tactile verifications interlocking. The eastbound petal omen elegantly reframes memory as navigation. Specificity and coherence elevate beyond trope.</comment>
