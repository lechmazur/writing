<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caron’s motives (seeking a script larger than war) are clear and embodied through concrete micro‑choices: unfolding the program, improvising the duel internally, hesitating at the torn page, and finally surrendering fear. Contradictory impulses—self‑protective coldness versus risky hope—play simultaneously at the missing‑page beat. The price (relinquishing wars, titles, lonely certainty) is legible at the end. Interiority stays character‑particular and avoids therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern early and tightens via the missing‑page void → mercury apple → surrender/name. Closure lands on the page as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: naming the place “Possibility” after relinquishing identity. Costs are explicit and felt; prior beats set up each move cleanly within the mythic logic. Single scene, single POV, and one cadence shift are held with coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse/orchard is vivid and functional; endless night constrains Scene Two, forcing internalization of the duel. Recurring objects (unsnapped hinges, glass, strings) are integrated into action and the closing image. World rules stay consistent (“factually mystical” oils, moon‑darkness, letters as cosmos). Setting pressures choice and charges the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“finish the play/find a larger script”) escalates through a credible tightening: promise of protection → missing page setback → risky surrender. The mercury apple provides a turn but does not solve the problem without his choice; agency remains central. The cost—renouncing identity and fear—is on the page and alters options. Tension interweaves internal and external beats without clutter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: imagination over institution, authorship of reality through risk, transformation from knight to poet. The final naming reweights prior motifs without moralizing and produces a resonant aftereffect. A couple of lines verge on thesis (“imagine truer horizons”), slightly telegraphing intent. Overall, subtext and image do the heavy lifting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third‑person close maintains a consistent, textured diction aligned with Caron’s sensibility (theater, hinges, glass). Rhythm modulates under pressure; the lyric pattern is taught early, then intensifies at the climax without losing legibility. No head‑hopping or register drift; the voice remains singular and controlled. Purposeful elision is paid off by concrete turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphor; repeated motifs (unsnap, strings, glass) stay coherent rather than mixed. The prose largely avoids loops and scaffolding; line rhythm supports momentum. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple but remain within the established register. The closure image is clean and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Original synthesis—alchemical greenhouse, dream‑burned map, “factually mystical” oils, and hinge/puppetry lexicon—serves character and stakes. The mercury apple reveal risks convenience but is integrated via the orchard’s agency and prior chorus allegiance. The “unsnap” motif ties physical and conceptual change elegantly. Bold, cohesive vision without gimmickry.</comment>
