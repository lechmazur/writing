<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marisol’s motivation—to atone for a past harm and free Dulio—is clear, specific, and consistently enacted through risky, tactile choices (perfume, coil, playing the piano). Interiority is vivid and character‑particular, with guilt and nerve in tension. The admission that she printed the rumor gives her flaw teeth and informs the morning’s “imperfect miracle.” If there’s a limit, her internal conflict is elegantly handled but not stress‑fractured into a truly painful on‑page dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp by the first lines: who (Marisol), where (municipal sheet music archive, orchard), when (pre‑dawn under a noon deadline). Causality holds: lilac + coil → summoning → performance → public delay → partial release → final offering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: apology carried but incomplete, with a tangible cost (no column, Dulio not whole) and a charged final image (bottle on stump). The hybrid drive leans causal at the end and remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive and orchard are sensorially concrete and functionally integral: the archive provides the tether (piano, shelves), the orchard supplies the live clock and public witness. The perfume bottle and Tesla coil act as micro‑settings/tools that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Environmental details (lilac, ozone, sparks) evolve with action. The final stump‑placed bottle fulfills the 9+ gate by reweighting space with cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carry an apology before the orchard falls—tightens under a visible clock and a public test (workers, mayor). Marisol’s agency drives the escalation: bait, induction, possession, performance, and a final offering. The price is partial relief and the acknowledgment of limits, not a clean win. The tension is strong, though the opposition remains largely atmospheric rather than actively adversarial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around absolution’s limits and gossip as a paradoxical conduit; “imperfect miracles” reframes both outcome and method. The bottle’s reprise and the delayed axes embody redemption’s partial reach without neat closure. One explicit line (“sometimes gossip is just a fragile channel…”) edges toward statement but is earned by scene work. The ending invites reflection without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The first‑person voice is distinct—lyric, wry, and materially grounded (Tesla coil, lilac) without head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, maintaining clarity during the possession/performance. Dialogue with the ghost carries subtext and history efficiently. The perceptual bias (gossip columnist as exorcist) gives the prose a memorable signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight and musical, with strong image economy and propulsion; figurative language is rich but largely controlled. Recurrent motifs (hush, lilac, electricity) are coherent rather than redundant. Minor density spikes flirt with purple but don’t blur sense or causality. The final line resolves on a clean, charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—gossip‑column exorcism via perfume and a Tesla coil to deliver an apology that postpones an axe—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (genre braid, lyric voice under a causal frame) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Tools, tone, and stakes interlock in a singular vision. The partial, public miracle sold through craft rather than gimmick elevates it.</comment>
