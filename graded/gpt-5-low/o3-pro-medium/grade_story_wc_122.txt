<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maris’s motive—defeating emotional numbness—is clear and embodied through her deafness and tactile listening. Contradictions surface (competence vs fear of “merely technical success”), and she makes micro‑choices that reveal values (bowing to the hush, tuning by vibration, deciding to share). The renunciation at the end (sealing the needle, leaving a note for the next seeker) carries cost and feels earned. Interiority remains character‑specific without therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each step (box → needle → record played backward → drums tuned → communal sharing) coheres and deepens the central stake. Orientation is clean from the outset and props/payoffs align (note’s instruction delivers a functional sequence). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses to share and then relinquish, with cost on the page. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cavern and its tools constrain and enable choices: acoustics, unfinished drums, and the gramophone shape tactics and the ending image. Sensory detail is filtered through her embodied perception (vibration, “thunderous within her bones”). The environment charges the final image (leaves’ whisper echoing within the drums). World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure tightens in a quiet, accumulative way: finding the record, the needle’s hush covenant, the realization of missing percussion, and the decision to share. The felt price—rejecting perfectionism/hoarding and relinquishing the needle—clarifies stakes. While conflict is gentle, the narrowing of options reads cleanly under the chosen lens. No coincidence resolves the core problem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as instrument, communal feeling over virtuosity, and the ethics of sharing art. The hush’s imperative reweights the premise without sermonizing, and the final images recast “hearing” as corporeal and communal. Resonance lingers via the baton‑like heart and seasonal echo. Complexity remains, avoiding tidy moral closures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in vibration and tactility. Diction is controlled and modulates with pressure, avoiding explanatory scaffolding. No dialogue is needed; voice carries subtext through image and action. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and economical; images often do double duty (e.g., “audibly muted” as world logic and theme). Figurative density is high but coherent and pattern‑taught, with minimal redundancy. Rhythm varies and supports momentum through the sequence. Minor purple edges never obscure clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—deaf teacher, filament of hush, backward record in a drum maker’s cavern—feels singular and inevitable by the end. Fresh tactical turns (teaching drums to “speak,” sharing silence to awaken) avoid generic solutions. Risky lyric mode heightens stakes without losing legibility. The final renunciation reframes magic as ethical practice rather than spectacle.</comment>
