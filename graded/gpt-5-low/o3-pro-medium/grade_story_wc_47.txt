<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s “quietly proactive” ethos drives concrete choices—mapping icicle dots, summoning Rowan, harvesting resin, proffering the pendant—revealing values under pressure. Rowan’s tremor-to-action shift via work reads embodied and credible. Contradictory impulses (Mara’s watchfulness vs. intervention; Rowan’s shame vs. participation) coexist. The cost—risking exposure and relinquishing the pendant—lands without moral tidying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: the garden’s patterning, resin work, and pendant reprise build to a charged poise closure. Orientation is clean early; causality (message → arrival → shared labor → plan) supports the accrual. The ending’s cost—public scrutiny approaching, emotional toll, and a quiet plan that scales against harm—feels paid-in-advance. The closure is resonant rather than decisive, but legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The data-center-turned-moss-garden tangibly shapes tactics: resin used as adhesive, tile constellations as planting map, lingering LEDs as ghostly atmosphere. Sensory specificity (electrolyte and loam, amberish resin) is purposeful and filtered through Mara’s mindset. The environment charges the final image (dew rehearsing constellations; seeds to be anchored). World rules remain consistent without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around sanctuary vs. exposure and transforming harm into quiet repair. The pressure tightens when Rowan arrives and the plan to face cameras via proof-of-healing crystallizes. Costs are emotional and reputational more than physical; the escalation is intentionally gentle but cumulative. Agency (work instead of words; gifting the pendant) earns the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motifs (amber, gnat, icicle constellations, “honeyed hush”) evolve to articulate a theme: repair through small, deliberate acts that scale against thunderous harm. Subtext is carried by labor and objects rather than moralizing, with a clean late reweighting (“healing scaled as quietly as harm had thundered”). The ending resists neat closure while offering a resonant answer. No sermonizing undercuts the effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close focuses through Mara’s perceptions; diction is consistent with her sensibility. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, carrying subtext (work steadies more than comfort). Rhythmic control supports the hush-to-cadence arc without head-hopping. No unearned omniscience or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: vivid images do multiple jobs and momentum rarely stalls. Occasional lushness (“gauze over a bruise,” “slow circuitry”) skirts purple but remains controlled and character-filtered. Syntax and paragraphing vary to modulate pace. No noticeable loops or scaffolding mar the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a dead data center repurposed as a moss garden with a whistleblower’s fallout feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tactics (resin harvest, icicle-map) avoid tropey symbolism by being materially useful. The amber-gnat pendant reframes endurance without platitude. Risk-taking in tone and imagery heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
