<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Janus’s spiritual curiosity vs. protocol creates credible internal conflict that drives concrete choices (watching first, mapping, then ritual repair). Interiority is specific and embodied (broom as conductor, lantern shards as “shy eyes”). The change—finding strength in vulnerability—is earned by the empathic labor and risk. A slightly easy success softens the felt cost, but motivation remains coherent and active.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the alarm → investigation → mapping → ritual repair → release forms a clean progression toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page: repairing the glass/starlet and reconfiguring Janus’s role (“silent abbot”). Cost is implied (deferring protocol, risk in opening the hatch) rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of exceptional. Orientation is clear early and the throughline holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station, vault, hatch to vacuum, and tools (quill-laser, broom) are vivid and integral; environment and objects constrain tactics (mapping in the dome, catching stellar wind at the hatch). The lantern glass and broom charge the final image. Sensory and procedural detail is selective and POV-shaped. World rules feel consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mend the shard/sky and, by extension, the self—is signaled and tightens through alarm, protocol pressure, and the risky hatch ritual. The decisive turn is Janus choosing wonder-guided action over sealing procedure. Escalation is felt more as density and poise than as sharp reversals, appropriate to the lens but with limited concrete price. The earned resolution stems from his agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of strength-through-vulnerability arises organically from empathic repair and the re-seeing of cleaning as sacred labor. The final images reweight prior motifs (broom rhythms, lantern glass, monastery orbiting mystery). A near-moralizing line (“strength is sometimes a patch of vulnerability polished to brilliance”) states the thesis too explicitly, trimming subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric, cosmic-domestic voice is consistent, character-specific, and modulates with pressure (alarm to ritual cadence). POV control is steady; no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Diction and rhythm feel intentional and support the accumulative design. No dialogue is needed for this mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are polished with strong image-economy; many sentences do double duty (world + psyche). Occasional density flirts with purple, but metaphorical logic remains coherent and scene-advancing. Minimal scaffolding or loops; rhythm breathes with the action. Slight overwriting in a few adjacent metaphors keeps it below top tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor premise, lantern-glass repair, and broom-as-conductor ritual feel fresh and integrated. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late conveniences. The synthesis of menial labor with cosmic stewardship reads singular and memorable. Risk-taking in tone and imagery heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
