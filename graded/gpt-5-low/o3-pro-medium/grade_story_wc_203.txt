<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlen’s professional acuity and private compulsion (“to discover what ceilings hide”) drive clear, motivated choices (breaker panel, dust analysis, bypassing ladder for panel crawl). Interiority is specific and embodied (“heart drumming like a calliope”). Internal conflict is muted—he encounters little resistance beyond eerie atmosphere—so the emotional cost feels light. Still, the final renunciation (donating the device) credibly reflects his values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the opening (who, where, when), and the causal chain is clean: power → observation → inference → crawl → retrieval → ghosts at rest. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost: extracting the mainspring reconfigures the space and its spirits. The price is primarily emotional rather than tactical, keeping the stakes modest. Hybrid drive leans causal at the end and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The circus ticket office is textured and integral: posters, breaker panel, vent, crawl space all shape choices and discovery. The environment constrains tactics (panel crawl route over ladder) and charges the final image (“elevator rising and falling like slow applause”). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered through an elevator tech’s eye. World rules remain consistent, including the spectral logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens through a single meaningful deepening: the dust‑pattern inference forces a more committed approach (crawl, retrieval). Stakes are personal and spiritual—laying ghosts to rest and fulfilling a compulsion—yet danger is low, so cost feels gentle. The mid‑scene choice (ladder vs. ceiling panel) is a real narrowing of options. Resolution is earned by action, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Time, concealment, and façades accrue into a resonant thematic weave; the mainspring reframes the circus’s decay into a private metronome of denial and greed. The “weightless burden” motif evolves to meaningful release in the end. No sermonizing; the insight arises from concrete particulars (watch cannibalized, velvet clown hat). Complexity is maintained with quiet ambiguity around reverence and theft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled and distinctive, with mechanical and spectral lexicons blended (“calliope,” “counterweights”) in a steady register. Rhythm varies with pressure, and the single phantom line carries subtext without overexplanation. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Lyric tendencies remain tethered to Marlen’s perceptual bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and largely economical; images do double duty (sawdust hand, “rusted spider”) without muddle. A few metaphors skate toward lushness but retain coherence and momentum. Reprises (“overhead fluorescent buzz dies off”) are purposeful, not looped scaffold. Syntax and paragraphing provide propulsion through the discovery sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>An elevator tech communing with ghosts in an abandoned circus, solving a mystery via dust‑pattern forensics and a hidden mainspring, feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis of mechanical intimacy and elegiac haunt is singular. The final “slow applause” image transforms genre expectations. Risks in tone and metaphor pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
