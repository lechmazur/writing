<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, competent motivation (“cultivate foresight in action”) drives concrete choices, and her occupational lens colors perception. Interiority is specific but cool; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal, which softens the felt cost. The micro‑choices (climbing, bagging, deploying fans, sealing the site) align with character. Emotional embodiment is restrained but coherent with her disciplined temperament.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: investigation → clues (patches, vortices) → diagnosis (extraction) → tactic (randomized gusts) → on‑page release (thunderclap) → stabilized models. Closure reads as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (risking herself to break a convergent system; foreclosing the siphon’s return for “a thousand hours”). Orientation is crisp early, and the lens holds through the end. The price is felt more as procedural and risk than as a deep personal loss, keeping it just shy of the 9s.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains airflow, dictates tactics, and charges the final image; she exploits its canyons and junction boxes to reconfigure pressure. Tools (anemometer, visor, fans) are inseparable from place and process. World rules (geometry channels energy) are learned through action. The star‑implosion cavity and sealed chair function as a charged micro‑setting for closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent another extraction) is signaled early and tightens with the body, the star‑collapse, and the beacons. The key turn is her decision to scramble winds, forcing a system‑level reversal (thunderclap). Cost reads as danger and the need to alter the environment quickly; the internal trade‑off is muted. Pressure remains coherent and grows to a single decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of foresight vs hindsight, listening to environments, and geometry as ethics emerge through particulars (spiral patches, organ‑pipe corridors, “air remembered accidents”). The final image (“silence she had saved”) reweights prior silence from ominous to earned stasis. No moralizing; resonance arises from the reconfigured wind. Slightly limited by the protagonist’s emotional flatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined perceptual signature blends lyric imagery with technical diction (“null spot,” “vectors,” “rapidly adapting models”). POV control and stance are steady; certainty matches what she can infer. Rhythm modulates with pressure (climb, discovery, action, release) without over‑explaining. The voice is memorable and coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, with vivid but controlled imagery (“organ pipes,” “arrested pendulums”) that advances plot and atmosphere. Minimal scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum. Figurative density stays legible; no loops or muddle at the peak. A few intensifiers approach lyric saturation but do not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—an accident investigator countering a momentum‑harvesting convergence by rewriting wind pathways—is fresh and integral. Recurring objects (patch spirals) and tools transform trope expectations. Turns feel earned via specific world logic rather than a gimmick. Bold without opacity, and the closure image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
