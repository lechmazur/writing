<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is vivid and particular, and her micro-choices under pressure (inviting guests, mapping confessions, and especially cutting her own keystone thread) align with a rigorous, idiosyncratic mindset. The embodied calm (“patient beast deciding whether to breathe”) keeps her human and flawed. Internal contradiction (devotion to connection vs. risking harm) is present but could be sharpened at the moment of near-collapse. Still, the sacrifice registers as earned with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causality is clean: setup of rules and stakes → guests’ emotions feed the system → over-tightening threatens eruption → keystone cut relieves pressure at cost. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a clear price (inverting her earliest memory). Orientation is strong from the first lines; the drive lens remains causal with textural support. The afterimage (“forgiving light”) reweights the premise without soft-resetting consequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The planetarium-turned-illusion gallery is intensely tactile (chalk like “quiet lightning,” sinew threads that “sing”) and functionally constrains choice. The dome’s geometry and threading directly create the crisis and shape the action (ladder, anchor points, knot-cutting). World rules are taught through action and hold consistently. The final humming threads charge the last image and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (“math of wonder” must “stand upright”), and pressure coheres as guests’ released pain tightens threads toward catastrophic eruption. The pivotal tightening results from the very tactic meant to heal, forcing a costly trade: Mara sacrifices her own keystone memory. Tension scales sentence-to-scene without contrivance. The only slight limit is that external counterpressure (sirens) remains atmospheric rather than complicating tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece meaningfully explores connection as mutable vibration and the ethics of altering memory to heal. Thematic answer arrives via image and action, not sermon, though “emotion is circuitry” edges toward explicitness. The final recognition among strangers (“song remembered from a previous dream”) resonates without tidy moralizing. The conceptual repricing of memory as living weave holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lucid and distinctive, with controlled lyricism that matches POV and premise. Psychic distance is steady; no head-hopping; the brief dialogue is functional and in-character. Patterned diction is consistent and legible under stress. High lyric density is managed without smudging causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is strong: vivid verbs, layered images that carry load, minimal scaffolding. A few metaphors flirt with saturation but avoid muddle, and rhythm modulates effectively across turns. No loops or syntactic templates drag momentum. The final cadence is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—planetarium, bio-threads, chalked equations, and a healing method that demands memory distortion—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The keystone-cut solution is both logical and surprising. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without gimmickry. The vision reads authentic and high-stakes.</comment>
