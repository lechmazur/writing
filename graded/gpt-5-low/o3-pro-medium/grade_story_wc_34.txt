<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—he “must build a mouth for silence”—and actions align with this duty under a ticking window. Interiority is embodied via tool‑use and color lexicon rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (yearning to be heard vs. choosing invisibility), but conflict remains mostly principled rather than pressured. The ending’s renunciation (sealing the song, leaving unrecognized) lands as earned stasis with a felt, if quiet, cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density builds (color‑code, storm pulses, pivot plate) toward a cadence shift as thunder closes the gap. Closure is on‑page: he encodes, seals the ghost, and departs—conceptual cost is that the work is audible only in the brief hush, invisible to the city. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the storm window constrains tactics. The final image reweights prior material without retrofitting rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the courtyard above clouds and the lightning‑thunder gap directly constrain timing and method. Tools (spray cans, stencils, bolt plate) are integrated into action, not ornament. Weather and altitude shape sensation and options, charging the final hum with consequence. The environment’s logic remains consistent and learned through doing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (encode before the gap closes) is legible early and tightens as lightning pulses and thunder approaches. The ghost’s passage through him escalates pressure, deepening intent rather than adding new threads. Cost is quiet but present: he forgoes audience/recognition, and the song’s access is constrained to the perilous interval. One decisive tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: art as a mouth for silence; technology as repository of longing; translation across mediums. Recurring images (violet/sorrow, gold/yearning, teal/deferred hope) shift meaning at the end when “something new” is whistled—an earned repricing rather than a thesis. Subtext (unheard apologies, orphaned drafts) informs the ethical duty without sermonizing. The final charged poise answers the question of how we honor the unsaid.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is steady, close, and sensorial, with a controlled lyric register that matches the character’s craft‑devotion. Rhythmic variation suits pressure, and the accumulative pattern is taught early and kept legible. No dialogue is needed; voice carries action and subtext through diction and image. Confidence holds without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet disciplined; images are coherent and purposeful (“oscilloscope,” “miniature lightning” on droplets). Minimal scaffolding or loops, and syntax varies to maintain propulsion. A few lush flourishes flirt with purple but never muddy causality or closure. Word choice stays specific to tools and weather, keeping momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Graffiti as code‑choir within a storm’s breath is a striking synthesis, not a template. The flower‑press pivot and color lexicon are idiosyncratic, grounding wonder in tactile method. The closure reconfigures the premise with grace (public vandalism as secret chorus), risking quiet stakes with high conceptual payoff. Freshness feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
