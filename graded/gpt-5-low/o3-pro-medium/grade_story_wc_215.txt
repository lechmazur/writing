<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orin’s motives and contradictions are vivid: an exile who craves purpose, mute yet attuned to “unsaid verses.” His micro-choices (refusing to speak, reading echoes, waiting for hours, pressing the wax to his chest) align with temperament and escalate commitment. The visible cost—bearing a vow “like a hive filled at midsummer”—reads as Earned Stasis. Slight limitation: internal conflict stays cool and assured; doubt (“invitation or trap”) never meaningfully destabilizes tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: search → discovery → patience test → covenant deciphered → acceptance and hum that reconfigures the world. Closure is on-page and costly, with Orin foreclosing ordinary solitude to serve as resonant steward. Orientation is clear early; set-ups (iron vines snapping at haste, contextual clues) pay off. Only minor: the “hours, or perhaps a drift of moons” blurs temporal pressure but doesn’t harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The oasis and hives are sensorially specific and materially constrain action (iron vines punish haste; echo-mapping guides tactics). Recurring objects (hives, drums, jelly, box) charge the final image and the world-rule of “ghosts as frequency” is learned through action. The setting itself is reconfigured by the hum, proving it’s integral, not postcard. Balance across senses (sound, scent, tactility, light) is exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (becoming steward of a covenant) are signaled and tighten through the patience trial and deciphering method, culminating in an acceptance that carries a palpable weight. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the main turn is his endurance-driven unlocking and vow-taking. The price—surrendering solitary neutrality to carry others’ unspoken words—is legible at the peak. Slight softness: external jeopardy is low, so tension leans almost entirely on ritual gravity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of mute stewardship and the ethics of keeping others’ vows emerges organically from image and action, not statement. The final hum recasts bees as “frequency rather than flesh,” a conceptual repricing of voice, duty, and presence. The stained glass reprise (his aged likeness) deepens responsibility over time without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and duration of service.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close with a distinctive, serene lyric register remains consistent and character-bound. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (quicker breaths around unlocking; expansive cadence at the hum). No head-hopping or unearned omniscience; inferences are clearly Orin’s. The prose trusts subtext, especially around speechlessness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful; metaphors (organs, pottery, pollen fall) cohere to the beekeeping lexicon and avoid muddle. Information density is high with minimal scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically. One risk: figurative saturation nears purple in spots, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at closure. No loops or copy artifacts detected.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost beekeepers, a stained-glass covenant, and a mute steward as resonant instrument synthesize into a singular vision. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (patience test → unlocking → hum-world reprice) and not templated. Risks in tone and concept heighten stakes without obscuring legibility. The final image is fresh and memorable.</comment>
