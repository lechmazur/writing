<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to translate silence and break the town’s hush before dawn) is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices—tracing glyphs, knocking posts, arranging “twelve hushes.” Her “joyful sorrow” complicates the drive, visible in frightened tears and endurance as Harlan fades. The relationship with Harlan applies active pressure (time, technique) rather than comfort. Minor shortfall: interior contradiction is mostly tonal rather than decision‑forked.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of silence‑mapping builds to a cadence shift where color‑music erupts. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: Harlan dissolves at dawn and the town forgets Mara’s face even as the music endures. Orientation is clean early (harbor, midnight rule, camera, aim), and the time constraint shapes tactics. The through‑line from gathering hushes to the silent choir to synesthetic payoff is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor is not postcard décor—it functions as ink, mirror, and resonator; pier posts become doors to “submerged rooms” she must knock, changing options. Dawn’s light and moonlit water constrain time and method, charging the final image of color‑music over masts and rooftops. The vintage camera and water act as micro‑settings that shape and close the arc. Sensory specificity is rich without losing spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive music before sunrise) tightens under the live clock and the need to assemble a choir from silence. The mid‑scene tactic shift—collecting twelve hushes, then arranging them—narrows options and forces bolder signing. Cost is legible: Harlan’s vanishing and Mara’s erasure from memory against communal gain. Slight softness: opposition is atmospheric rather than actively resisting, but pressure still coheres and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: authorship vs. communal memory, grief transmuted into shared, unhearable music, and the ethics of translation. The final repricing—town remembers color‑melodies but not Mara—lands as a resonant answer without moralizing. Recurring images (camera, water as ink, pauses as map) reweight meaning at closure. Ambiguity lingers productively around what is kept and what is lost in making art.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close maintains a consistent perceptual signature—syntax modulates with stakes, and elision is purposeful. No head‑hopping; Harlan’s “voice” reads as external pressure filtered through Mara. Diction is elevated but character‑coherent for a “translator of forgotten languages.” Occasional flourishes brush purple but remain legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and efficient; images often do double duty (rings on water as both silence and score). Rhythm varies and carries momentum toward the cadence break. A few stacked metaphors flirt with saturation but do not blur sense or the closure image. No scaffolding loops or register slips evident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—mapping silence, a film‑less camera as memory‑engine, a liminal advisor heard only when forgotten, music manifesting as color—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in method and tone elevate stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration honors cost over spectacle. Freshness resides in tactic‑level specifics, not just veneer.</comment>
