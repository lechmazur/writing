<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—renegotiating the covenant without erasing memory—and his contradictory impulses (“anxious elation” vs. hesitation before cutting) act in-scene. Micro‑choices (unwrapping, asking the question, deciding to carve the spiral) align with a plant‑listening worldview. The visible cost (pain, new scarring) earns the change. A slight mythic distance in diction keeps us a fraction removed from raw vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: glade arrival → communion via scars → received mandate → self‑inscription → maze transforms. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence (pain, permanent marks, world reconfiguration), consistent with a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when). The single scene holds tight focus with no dropped setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glade, roots, and sap‑stained clipping are sensorially vivid and functionally integrated; the environment constrains and supports tactics (roots bind/steady, air “tastes,” hedges respond). The setting charges the final image (glade deepens to night; spiral glimmers forward). World rules are learned through action, not exposition. Detail feels filtered through a plant‑tuned sensibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—undo coercive labyrinths while preserving memory—is present early and tightens at the cut decision. The escalation is protagonist‑driven; the price is unmistakable (blood, scarring, surrender to unknown consequences). Internal and external conflicts interlock; the spiral redesign is both tactical and ethical. Pressure is coherent and crescendos cleanly without coincidence rescue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: consent and liberation versus control, negotiated kinship across species, and redesign as ethical repair. The spiral reweights prior material, offering a non‑literal answer to “How may we unweave the maze without uprooting memory?” without moralizing. Recurring images (roots, scars, eclipse) shift meaning at the end. The resonance lingers with conceptual and emotional cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (botanical, covenant‑minded) holds steady. Psychic distance and tense remain stable; no head‑hopping. Elevated diction mostly serves tone under pressure. A few ornate phrasings verge on purple but do not blur sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful images; lines typically do more than one job. Rhythm varies and momentum rarely stalls. Occasional lushness (“tungsten‑tinged light,” “dateless twilight”) approaches excess but maintains coherence and clarity. No loops or scaffold, and syntax supports the climactic beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: covenant ecology, scar‑based communion, and a maze becoming a spiral through sympathetic wound. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the premises. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration is memorable and specific.</comment>
