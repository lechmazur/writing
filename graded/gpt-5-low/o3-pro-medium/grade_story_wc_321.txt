<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Milo’s motive and worldview are clear, embodied through tactile habits (polishing cleats, knot logic) and a decisive act (turning the hourglass). His resilient optimism reads as a functional flaw/strength, though internal contradiction is mild and he’s almost preternaturally competent under pressure. The moment of choosing alignments carries character specificity (“Knots teach you bridges between ends”). Some emotional costs surface (Rowan’s reconfigured past; passengers’ flicker), but Milo’s personal cost remains soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural with a causal pivot: dense lyric accrual culminates in the hourglass turn that reconfigures reality and returns the ferry. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and set‑ups (hourglass, vanishing ferry) pay off on the page. Closure lands via Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration; the felt cost is conceptual (lives re‑selected, forfeited paths). The price is more implied than dramatized, keeping it short of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor, fog, and spectral grotto are vivid and filtered through Milo’s professional gaze; the environment and the hourglass object constrain and enable choice. The grotto pressures tactics (Milo must navigate patterns; speech creates motes), and the hourglass charges the final image. World rules are taught by observation (shuffled constellations, motes) rather than dump. Spatial and sensory choreography is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (return/merge timelines) is signaled early and tightens as the ferry slips into the grotto. The key escalation is Milo claiming agency by turning the hourglass and actively guiding alignment, not passively waiting. Prices are suggested (some identities foreclosed, Rowan altered) but not strongly cashed on the page. Still, pressure coheres and deepens in step with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (tides, knots, maps, hourglass) braid into a theme of impermanence as arrival and interconnection. Subtext generally carries meaning, but explicit thesis lines—“We are not lost… we are being woven together” and “impermanence is another form of arrival”—edge toward moralizing, especially in the final third. The ending reweights prior images without a cloying wrap‑up, yet some stated wisdom dulls the afterglow. Complexity is present but could risk more ambiguity in the last beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent in third‑person close; perception is distinctly Milo’s (tools, knots, tides). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext (Rowan’s dread). The lyric stance holds without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are polished with strong cadence and high information density; images often do double duty. Figurative saturation is heavy across peak beats (“stars… rethreading,” “voices produced visible motes”), occasionally flirting with purple, but clarity remains intact. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies. A slight deduction for metaphor density at climax and a couple of aphoristic statements near the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a commuter ferry as a temporal loom, the hourglass as a tide clock, and knot logic guiding multiversal alignment. The grotto’s mechanics (motes, rethreaded constellations) feel inventive and grounded in character. Risks in lyricism and concept pay off without confusion. Only the soft cost and occasional thesis lines keep it from the 9+ tier.</comment>
