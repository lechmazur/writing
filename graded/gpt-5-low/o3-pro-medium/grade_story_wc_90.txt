<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Griffin’s pacifism, grief, and buoyancy manifest in concrete micro‑choices (reciting names, inviting soldiers, refusing to hoard liberation). His final self‑forgiveness is earned by prior Action and object work, with a legible emotional cost. Minor softness comes from how smoothly success follows the chime; struggle feels intense but seldom resists him on the page. Still, interiority is specific and embodied, not generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: patterned ritual escalates to the frost gate resisting until a final inner renunciation triggers passage. Orientation is clean from the first lines; causal joins (tear at gate → refracted silhouettes → self‑forgiveness → opening) read precise. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with cost and reweighted options. No teleports or dangling set‑ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The recycled ship is tactile and pressure‑bearing: misreading mass dims lights, the hull “confronts” its wars, and the airlock petals function as a gate. Sensory breadth (sound, touch, scent) and object micro‑setting (the tear, frost blossoms) charge the ending image. The environment constrains and enables rather than serving as a postcard. A slight cap because constraints aid tone more than force hard tactical trade‑offs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—opening the nonviolent dimension—tightens when the gate shivers “unwilling,” forcing the costlier choice of self‑forgiveness. The decision not to hoard liberation further clarifies values under pressure. The escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens and culminates in a decisive turn. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential without inflationary rhetoric.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: nonviolence as active transmutation of collective harm, the cost and grace of survival, and refusal to weaponize liberation. Recurring images (tears, stitching, frost petals) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final garden‑like corridor offers a resonant answer rather than a thesis. Ambiguity is purposeful and generative, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and singular—lyric yet legible, with imagery that reflects character bias and state. Rhythm modulates with pressure (bells, groan, petals), keeping close focalization consistent. No head‑hopping or register slips; elisions are pattern‑taught. Diction and cadence support the piece’s spiritual‑sci/fi mood without strain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush but purposeful; most metaphors align and carry multiple jobs. Momentum persists with minimal scaffolding or loops, and the final image lands cleanly. Density occasionally edges toward saturation, but the pattern is taught early and paid off, avoiding purple drift. Mechanics are clean and sequencing is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—pacifist buoyancy physics, Kwan Yin’s Tear as key, recycled war‑hulls confronting memory—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and spiritual tech are integrated, not ornamental. The turn (self‑forgiveness as the missing mechanic) is non‑obvious yet grounded. Vision reads singular and confident.</comment>
