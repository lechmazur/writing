<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Edda’s motive (to seek beauty in the incomplete) drives concrete choices—entering the lagoon, inviting the boy to mend, and sacrificing the feather. Interiority is specific and embodied (silt ghosts, woven dawns) with a credible contradiction (storm-chasing vs. patient tending). The relationship with the boy becomes the crucible where her stance is tested and enacted. The visible cost—giving up the feather—earns the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a coherent accumulative/textural drive toward a resonant reconfiguration. The decisive on‑page shift occurs when the feather becomes the kite’s spine, reweighting the premise with a tangible price. The pattern (harmonizing discord) is taught early and pays off in the village softening and the kite’s flight. Closure lands quietly but undeniably with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lagoon and shore are vividly rendered and functionally used: reeds and snail‑shell glue become tools, and water becomes a medium for the harmonizing method. Environment shapes tactics and charges the final image (kite over copper water). Specific sensory detail consistently reflects Edda’s priorities. World rules remain steady and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether discord can be tended without perfectionism, tightened by the boy’s broken kite and his storm‑forged expectation. The meaningful narrowing is the feather’s sacrifice—an irreversible choice that forecloses keeping her talisman. Escalation is gentle but present through accumulating harmonies (village, lagoon, gulls) culminating in the launch. The stakes remain small‑scale but legible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of “beauty in the incomplete” arises from specific actions (mending, harmonizing) and the feather’s relinquishment, not just assertion. The closing images reprice earlier motifs (ripples, glass, stained glass kite) with emotional lift. Minor explicit statements (“By harmonizing discord…”, “the most perfect thing of all”) edge toward moralizing, slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance remains strong and honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature sustains across the piece; diction and rhythm feel controlled and aligned with Edda’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (boy’s dragon‑fire wish vs. her acceptance of fracture). Psychic distance shifts are smooth and purposeful. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density; images often do double duty for setting and theme. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but stays coherent and legible; momentum rarely stalls. Figurative language is consistent and largely unmixed, especially at the close. No scaffold loops or cadence templates dull the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The feather‑as‑spine turn and the harmonizing method feel fresh within a familiar coastal lyric frame. Emotional specificity (boy’s lightning/dragon‑fire misbelief; Edda’s tempest habit) personalizes the trope of mending. Risks in tone and motif integration pay off without gimmickry. Not radical, but executed with distinctive coherence.</comment>
