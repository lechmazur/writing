<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive (find where deleted files go; give closure) is clear and consistent, sharpening under pressure when policy threatens her choice. The internal conflict—duty to corporate preservation vs forbidden curiosity/justice—registers, though it isn’t deeply layered. Embodied beats (heart pounding, gloves/visor work) reveal character through action. The final renunciation (broadcasting despite legal risk) feels earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: numbers → Echo gate lie → patch-as-key → realization of metadata capture → restoration attempt → corporate threat → broadcast → agents arrive. Closure lands as a decisive act with cost and a conceptual repricing of “deletion” as “home.” Orientation is clean from the first lines; no lens ambiguity. A single quick leap (patch becomes key) is motivated by the visor overlay and earlier number logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The social network archive is tactile and operationally specific (gate daemon, Echo sector, cooling reroutes), constraining tactics and charging the final image. Environmental rules stay consistent and evolve under stress (indices loop, shelves flicker, servers thunder). The micro-setting (patch/visor/daemon) functions as tools shaping choices. Atmosphere coheres with stakes, culminating in the singing archive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake escalates coherently: recover the missing at the price of policy, system stability, and personal risk. Key tightening beats—corporate warning and system buckling—foreclose safer paths and force Lyra’s public broadcast. Cost is legible (legal consequences, collapsing indices, unleashed suppressed content). The protagonist’s agency drives each turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory, corporate control, and digital afterlife emerge through particulars (numbers as breadcrumbs; Echo sector; “the system wore their weight”). The ending reweights “deletion” and “home” without tidy moralizing, though one line explicitly indicts the company. Subtext in tones of absence becoming song sustains resonance. The astronauts’ lullaby threads an earned, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled close-third voice with crisp, lyrical diction that modulates under pressure. Brief dialogue snippets feel natural and plot-serving. Register shifts into corporate/technical terms are motivated by setting and do not jar. No head-hopping; perspective remains consistent and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid, economical, and forward-driving, with strong verbs and charged images. Figurative language is present but not muddy; rhythms vary with momentum. Minimal scaffold or loops; clarity survives peak beats. A few high-level assertions edge toward on-the-nose, but they don’t dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: missing astronauts as dispersed metadata inside a corporate archive, numbers as insurgent breadcrumbs, and a memory keeper turning whistleblower. Risks (techno-mystic logic; lyric compression) pay off cleanly. Turns feel earned from seeded elements. The final image transforms the premise without gimmickry.</comment>
