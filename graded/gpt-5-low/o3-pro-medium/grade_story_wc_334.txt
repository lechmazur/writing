<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear want (recover memories) meets a concrete obstacle and prompts a credible risk shift (“when habits break” → barehand touch). Interiority is vivid and embodied (“prickle… like static”), and the final reciprocity choice reveals values with cost. Minor neatness in the near-total success of the recovery keeps it shy of top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: ritual setup → failed attempt → rule reinterpretation → touch → reciprocal offering. Closure lands on the page with cost (she gives her own freshest recollections) and a reconfigured future stance. Orientation is clean, props track, and the lens holds through the ending’s promised return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the greenhouse’s glass rafters enable the star‑projection method; shipwrecks and orchard artifacts charge tone and action. The mushroom functions as object‑as‑setting/librarian, constraining the decisive touch. Sensory specificity is rich without excess and consistently filtered through Mara’s professional eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and steady; escalation arrives via failed detection and the rule‑breaking touch with visible risk and a reciprocal price. Pressure coheres internally (protocol vs. need) and culminates in an earned reweighting. Slight softness in external counter‑pressure prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory as communal archive, reciprocity, and habit‑breaking emerge through acts, not dicta; the final image reprices the premise (“new stars” from spores). The orchard as everyone’s archive complicates ownership and anchors an ethical cost. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature (“ocean had never tired of feeding her questions”). Lyric cadence modulates under pressure and never breaks POV modesty. A few high‑lyric lines flirt with purple but stay earned by voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled, image‑dense, and purposeful; little scaffold or repetition. Metaphors align (water/sky/constellations/library) and support clarity. Minor lushness in clusters is balanced by momentum and clean syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse + bioluminescent “librarian” mushroom + mirrored‑sky detection feels original and inevitable in hindsight. The “when habits break” reinterpretation is a fresh engine for the turn. High‑concept imagery is welded to character stakes rather than ornament.</comment>
