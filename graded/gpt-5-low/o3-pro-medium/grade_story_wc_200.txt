<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eluan’s motive—soothing lost souls by integrating genuine laughter—is clear and drives micro‑choices (tavern‑joke progression, self‑deprecation, then choosing to guide rather than merely amuse). The “price of half‑measures” realization credibly compels him to uncork the vial. Interiority is mostly embedded in action and image, with embodied cost in tears and “luminous ache.” Internal contradiction is light but present (soft chuckle as invitation vs. awareness of cost).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single, coherent causal arc: find the harp → coax whispers → recognize inadequacy → deploy the tooth → lattice → release → reconfiguration. Closure lands decisively with object and world change (tooth turns clear, harp snaps into tune, gorge “hums with beginnings”). Cost is legible (“absorbing pain,” tear‑through, the tooth’s spent clarity). The hybrid drive (lyric accumulation supported by clear causal turns) holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is vivid and functionally charged: acoustics shape tactic (harp’s bent notes reveal hiding places), and the sunrise light catalyzes the tooth’s radiance. The misaligned harp and the tooth operate as micro‑settings/tools constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. The environment evolves with events (harp retunes; gorge’s echo reconfigured).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing unattended spirits through authentic laughter—is signaled early and tightens when the tooth rattles, forcing a higher‑cost path. The decisive escalation is Eluan’s move from entertainment to guidance, with the lattice inviting pursuit under risk. Price shows via absorption of pain and the tooth’s spent state. Pressure is coherent if quiet; there’s no antagonist, but the moral/ritual demand supplies credible resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of authentic laughter vs. rehearsed joy arise organically through confessions and Eluan’s tactics. The ending reweights the world—Echo Gorge becomes a site of beginnings—without sermonizing. Recurring objects (tooth/harp) and the “luminous ache” thread deepen the moral texture. Ambiguity remains humane (who pays the cost of healing), inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third‑person with consistent distance and perceptual signature; diction fits the mythic‑ritual frame. Rhythm modulates well from hush to radiant crescendo, with spectral lines punctuating the flow. No head‑hopping or stance drift, and elision is purposeful. The voice remains specific rather than generically poetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (the tooth as key and meter of pain). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and rarely purple; minimal repetition and no scaffolding loops. Syntax varies and momentum holds through turns. A few lush phrases flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blend of a “lost soul collector,” crocodile tooth key, and misaligned harp as divining instrument feels striking and sui generis. Turns arise from established logic rather than late rule drops. The final reconfiguration reads inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in tone and conceit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
