<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—grief sublimated into stewardship—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (placing the ring, waiting, breathing with him, pressing palm to spine). Contradictory impulses (careful endings vs. clinging) surface in her refusal “to encroach” and the ultimate letting‑go. The cost—solitude reaffirmed—reads on the page. Slightly idealized competence is the only minor limitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single scene, tight arc, and a clean accumulative/casual weave: ritual → shimmer → breath sphere → threshold → passage. Closure lands as Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: Declin crosses and the sanctuary “learns lungcraft,” with Mara accepting the cost. Orientation is immediate and stable. No teleports or unkept setups; the ring’s wind‑tap and oculus fire pay off causally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary is tactile and operative: ash, oculus starlight, wind tapping the ring, and the doorless threshold shape tactics and the final image. The doorknocker functions as micro‑setting, literally becoming a river mouth. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Mara’s vocation. The environment constrains choice and charges closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teach breath/let him cross—is signaled early and coherently tightens via failed attempts (brittle mist) to the held sphere and threshold decision. The key pressure point is Mara’s restraint (not encroaching) followed by contact through scars that enables the turn. Cost is legible: she releases him and recommits to solitude. Opposition is gentle rather than combative, but escalation still registers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief‑as‑care and thresholds is earned through particulars, not stated morals: bridges burned “carefully,” silence as co‑teacher, breath shaped into a sphere, river mouth opening. The final repricing—darkness that now “inhaled easily”—reweights earlier images with emotional truth. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent, distinctive lyric POV with controlled cadence; metaphoric texture matches Mara’s mind and task. Dialogue is minimal yet charged (“Show me” mouthed), with subtext carried by image. No head‑hopping or register drift; psychic distance modulates cleanly at peaks. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High‑density prose largely pulls double duty—image and action fused—with few redundancies and clean sequencing. Metaphors cohere (ash/soot/breath/river) and rarely clash; rhythm varies with pressure. A couple flourishes flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion hold through closure. Copy is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a doorknocker as river mouth, “teaching suffocating to breathe,” and “bridges burned carefully” feel singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and imagery heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The liminal‑ritual frame avoids template beats through specific, lived detail. Closure leverages the story’s own invented logic elegantly.</comment>
