<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marrow’s purpose (to make grief bearable under coercion) and Ithica’s split between fear of penalties and need to mourn are dramatized through concrete choices. Interiority is mostly externalized but specific: “mocked and comforted,” panic at sirens, and the careful painted smile. Their actions (hosting, narrating, offering the bouquet, carving/accepting the lamp) align with motives and reveal value hierarchies under pressure. The final endurance—opting for compliant poise that preserves grief—reads as an earned stasis with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Situational with accumulative texture; pressure coheres around the mandate and inspectors. Closure lands on the page: the lamp’s glow creates Charged Poise and a Conceptual Repricing—compliance reconfigured to include space for grief—with the social cost of living by subterfuge. Orientation is clear early (farmhouse under turbines; mandate) and the inspector incursion tests the declared stakes. Persistent constraint (mandate/inspection) directly shapes tactics at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: turbines impose literal shadow and history (wife’s death), grid maintenance creates a lull that frames the hush/lamp beat, and inspectors patrol in this world. The cedar block and lamp function as micro‑setting tools that channel options at closure. Sensory specifics (tin roof rain, cedar curls, pale gold shimmer) are purposeful and POV‑filtered. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—avoiding punitive enforcement while honoring grief—is present early and tightens decisively at sirens/entrance. Escalation is driven by Marrow’s agency (carving, lighting the lamp) rather than coincidence; the midnight grid lull complicates but does not resolve by itself. The price is compliance optics and reliance on ambiguity under surveillance. The resolution is earned without soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of coerced happiness versus truthful sorrow is embodied, not lectured; the lamp reweights the world’s rule‑set. Subtext runs strong in silence, narration of mundane ritual, and the “remade hush” that persists internally after turbines roar back. A single line—“Your grief is heavier because the world demands you float”—risks explicitness but is anchored in action and pays off in the final image. The ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prose voice is controlled, lyric, and consistent; imagery feels particular to this world. Dialogue is sparse yet charged, advancing subtext and status dynamics under surveillance. Narrative distance holds steady with no head‑hopping and clean focalization. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure spikes (sirens) and the quieting close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut: metaphors are fresh and coherent (“dawn remembering its job,” “laughter printed on cheap paper”). Density is high without purple excess; sentences do multiple jobs and momentum persists. Minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies to support tension and breath. No figurative muddle at the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—dystopian happiness mandate, a blank‑faced performer, cedar lamp channeling non‑electric light, and a “remade hush”—feels distinct and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from prior particulars (whittling → lamp → compliance image) rather than late rule drops. Emotional truth (grief within enforced joy) is rendered with specificity rather than trope. Risk‑taking in tone and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
