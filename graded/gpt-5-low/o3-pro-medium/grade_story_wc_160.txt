<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—harmonizing containment and release—drives concrete choices under pressure (using the chain, opening sluices, whispering a bargain). Interiority is specific and embodied (ear to chain, sweat with ash), with credible contradiction (competence vs. guilt over flood victims). Her “encrypted compassion” ethos informs tactics rather than staying a label. The visible cost is emotional strain and the acceptance that future breaths will demand more.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: surge detection → sluice calibration → partial relief → new fissures → renewed stance → successful venting. Orientation is anchored immediately (who, where, why) and the single-scene structure holds. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: danger abates but the ongoing constraint is named and accepted. Cost is legible in her spent body and the foreclosed fantasy of a permanent fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater-in-a-volcano is tactile and pressures action (sluices, vents, fissures), while the surveyor’s chain functions as micro‑setting/tool that constrains choices. Sensory detail is purposeful (sulfur mist, dew hissing to stone) and evolves with events. World rules are learned through use, not exposition. The environment charges the final image as the building “breathes” more gently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (prevent catastrophic surge while reconciling values) and escalates coherently (first vent eases, then fissures intensify, second inhale forces a new tactic). The apology-to-mountain choice narrows options and reframes power-sharing as risk. Prices are felt (doubt stirred, stamina taxed) and the resolution derives from her agency, not luck. Stakes remain personal and communal (orchid farms, colonies) without telescoping beyond scene pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: mechanisms coupled with compassion, matter and spirit “twin heartbeats.” The closing cadence reweights the premise toward ongoing negotiated equilibrium rather than triumphal control. A few lines verge on stating thesis (“encrypted compassion was not cowardice”) but are supported by on‑page action that earns them. The final image carries ambiguity with responsibility rather than a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (engineering fused to sensual geology). Psychic distance stays steady and apt; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Patterned phrases (“the building breathes”) are taught early and pay off at closure. Diction remains coherent to this world without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet purposeful; images do multiple jobs (chain as instrument, memory conduit, and conductor). Occasional intensifiers and motif reprises risk purple, but clarity and propulsion hold through peak beats. No scaffold loops or cadence monotony; syntax varies with pressure. Final sentences land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a surveyor’s chain as sensor/conductor, adhesive‑decoded maps, and “encrypted compassion” as operational ethic. The volcano amphitheater reframes conflict between tradition and invention with tactile specificity. Turns feel inevitable from planted tools and promises. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
