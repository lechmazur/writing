<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marrow’s motives are precise and embodied—she’s compelled by the midnight voice and by a grief-work calling that becomes a renunciation at the end. The internal conflict between following the currents and staying to steward others culminates in an earned refusal with visible cost. Micro-choices (salvaging parts, feeding “names” as coordinates, fine-tuning the censer foot) reveal values under pressure. No safety-hedging: her choice sacrifices self and station stability to keep the channel open.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: calls → construction → activation → renunciation, with each beat reweighting the stake. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—the decision to remain and steward is on-page and paid for (hydraulic “blood,” reinforced joints, foreclosed departure). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph and supports the final image. The persistent constraint (station hydraulics fueling the rig) shapes options and locks the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The signal station and its detritus are tactile and used: hydraulics’ “blood” powering motors, the gyroscope, and the censer foot all constrain choices. Setting charges the closure; leaving would collapse the tower, so place is fate. Sensory selection is purposeful (rust, dust motes, lunar pull) and filtered through a navigator’s eye. World rules remain consistent and learned through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: follow the reverse currents or remain to guide others. Escalation comes via density—apparatus rises, the sky reconfigures, the voice clarifies—until the trade-off is explicit: departure collapses the system. The price is legible in her self-modifications and the station’s dependency on her. It’s a quiet turn, but the narrowing of options is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reverse migration becomes a lived ethic: grief is navigated backward through embodied tools and names-as-coordinates. The final stance reframes navigation as stewardship, not escape, reweighting all prior images. Subtext breathes through objects and action (censer foot as liturgy; blood as power) without thesis-speak. The ending’s image offers resonant, unsentimental solace with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent with Marrow’s hybrid nature (vellum/circuit lexicon, navigational idiom). Elision and image density are taught early and pay off with clarity at closure. The receiver-voice remains properly oblique, adding pressure without POV leakage. Cadence modulates with stakes: from hush to hum to charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent metaphors; images do multiple jobs (e.g., hydraulics’ “blood” as both world logic and cost). Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains purposeful and legible under pressure. Minimal scaffold or loops; rhythm varies and supports momentum. The final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A singular synthesis: a navigator stitched from maps, a censer-footed gyroscope powered by hydraulic “blood,” and grief plotted as reverse migration. Risk-taking is integral, not ornamental, and implications are followed to an earned, non-obvious renunciation. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight—names as coordinates is especially fresh and functional. The piece avoids genre template beats while delivering emotional specificity.</comment>
