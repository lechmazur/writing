<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation (work-seeking translator) meets a credible, value-testing counteroffer; interiority is embodied (“breath clouds like spilt milk”), and micro‑choices accrue (accepting conversation, naming mismatches, accepting apprenticeship). Contradictory impulses—wages vs. meaning—are staged and resolved at a felt cost. The sentinel’s actions reveal character through restraint and guardianship rather than exposition. Change at the end reads earned by prior beats rather than bestowed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressures accrue through motifs (burned letter, pruning, storm) culminating in a Charged Poise acceptance with conceptual cost (apprenticeship over employment). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the rule‑set (translation of nonhuman dialogues) is taught through action. Closure lands on the page with the accepted apprenticeship and the reweighted final image (“honeyed glow now inside me”). Cost is present but conceptual rather than materially dramatized, keeping it just shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—pavilion, lantern, vines, dew, storm—filtered through a translator’s sensibility. The environment charges the final image (lantern glow internalized) and supplies constraints (last bus gone, approaching storm). Recurring objects (burned letter, pruned cane) are integrated into action rather than postcarded. Minor deduction only because the pavilion itself rarely constrains tactics beyond mood and shelter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning vs. money) is signaled and tightened via the sentinel’s test (name three mismatches) and the storm’s approach, leading to the apprenticeship choice. Escalation is primarily tonal/density‑based but coherent: silence → parable → test → offer → acceptance. The visible cost is more conceptual than visceral; the storm’s threat remains anticipatory rather than stress‑testing the decision on the page. Still, the narrowing of options (no bus, night, storm) credibly pressures the choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of translation, loss, and “destined mismatches” emerges through particulars (ash carrying flavor; pruning as surrender) and returns with reweighted meaning at the end. Subtext lives in gesture and pairing images (burned “y” that “loops through my throat”). A brief on‑the‑nose line (“harvest measured in empathy rather than bottles”) edges toward statement, trimming perfection. Overall resonance is strong and earned without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent voice with supple rhythm; diction fits a reflective, sensorially acute narrator. Dialogue is spare yet loaded, performing action (inviting, testing, offering) more than explaining. Psychic distance is steady; elisions are purposeful and legible. Minor restraint prevents 9+ only because the lens lands just shy of a fully undeniable on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High line‑level control; images do double duty and cadence varies with pressure. Lyric density is rich but mostly disciplined to the vineyard lexicon; metaphors cohere (ferment, ash, pruning) without muddle. No loops or scaffold bloat; momentum breathes without stalling. Slight lushness in a couple of abstractions prevents the topmost band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a translator apprenticing to vines, storm as percussion, soil writing to sky—original yet emotionally grounded. The burned letter’s “unfinished y” is a memorable, reconfiguring image. Risks are integrated rather than gimmicky and pay off at closure. To break into highest echelon, a sharper on‑page price or a small structural surprise under pressure would help.</comment>
