<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s drive—seeking the sacred logic of thresholds amid loss—is specific, embodied (tracing grain, reading knots), and complicated by her fear that finding the missing page might close the “cathedral” of absence. Her final stance (guarding the terrace, returning later to walk the threshold) is an earned renunciation with cost. Interiority stays character‑particular; Arin’s pressure is catalytic but doesn’t eclipse her agency. Minor note: “featherly determined” is more label than operative flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrete (wood grain → weather code → torn page → fragment) to a Conceptual Repricing where distance becomes choreography rather than abandonment. Orientation is clear early (Mira at the prism terrace with Arin). Closure lands on the page with cost—the choice to keep distance, postpone “being found,” and guard the hush. The motif network tightens coherently rather than via plot mechanicals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism terrace, wood grain, and weather‑coded logbook are vivid and POV‑filtered, charging the final image. Environment matters: the prism’s drift “caught” the fragment, and the light assembles corridors that reframe the maze. Sensory texture supports theme without museum‑tour excess. Slight restraint on 9+ because constraint is elegant but not tactically binding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframing absence/thresholds) escalates through a clear deepening: discovering the charred fragment reframes the earlier motifs and forces a stance. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent; the feared cost (closing the “cathedral”) sharpens her choice to delay closure. Quiet but credible stakes; no spurious reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of “necessary distances” integrates with image and action; the final choreography metaphor (“Stand apart so the wind can finish singing”) reweights prior details without moralizing. The maze as prayer/agriculture and the cathedral of absence are potent reconfigurations. Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague; resonance lingers in the decision to keep the threshold sacred until it can be relinquished.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction is controlled, consistent with Mira’s way of noticing. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext (“Sit, … intuit”). Rhythm modulates well; no head‑hopping. A few dense metaphors brush the edge of flourish, but they’re pattern‑taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density; lines do more than one job and propel. Imagery is lush yet legible; repetition (thresholds, corridors, prisms) accrues rather than loops. A hint of purple in stacked metaphors is balanced by clarity at the close. Mechanics are clean; no scaffold or cadence templates stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—corn‑maze cartography, weather code, wood grain divination, and a drifting prism terrace—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The redefinition of distance as choreography is non‑obvious and earned. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring closure. Freshness flows from particularities rather than concept gloss.</comment>
