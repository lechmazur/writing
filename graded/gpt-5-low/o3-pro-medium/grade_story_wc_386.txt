<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation and motive are vivid and consistent, and her key choices (confronting the monks, directing the globe’s placement) align cleanly with her traits. Interiority is image-led but specific (“quiet seamstress, stitching the shards she found”). The main soft spot is limited internal contradiction; she encounters little genuine doubt or degradation under pressure. The social cost of offending the monks registers, but her arc feels more assured than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with a causal dominant at the end: monks seek help → dream analysis identifies the keeper → Mara exposes denial → ritual relocation of the globe → visible release. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the glacier’s haloed myth is pierced and the keeper passes on. Orientation is clear from the outset and carried to a felt after-image (“space instead of absence”). The only limitation is that the price is largely social/spiritual and lightly dramatized beyond brief monk recoil.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely particular and operative: the ice shrine, resin smoke, frozen petals, and the glacier’s translucence all shape and charge the action. The snow globe and glacier function as object-as-setting, constraining tactics (dream navigation, public placement) and powering the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful, filtered through Mara’s professional bias. The environment’s rules remain consistent as they evolve into the culminating reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate the restless presence by telling a difficult truth—is signaled early and tightens through discovery to confrontation to communal act. The meaningful turn is Mara’s public exposure that forecloses the monks’ comfortable veneration, with a visible cost (recoil) and a charged payoff. Pressure coheres and grows under the causal lens without coincidence doing the work. The struggle is more moral/spiritual than contested, keeping the escalation slightly soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of truth versus sanctified myth, connection versus isolation (windows vs mirrors), and beauty’s frailty are woven through objects and culminate in an earned reweighting. The lighthouse keeper’s release reconfigures the glacier’s meaning without didactic wrap-up. One line edges toward sermon (“Let the truth breathe, and his light will rise for all of us”), but the ending wisely returns to image and felt repricing. Resonance lingers through the pilgrims’ reflections and Mara’s quiet exit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person closely held to Mara gives a distinct perceptual signature (“borrowed starlight,” “quiet seamstress”). Rhythm and diction are controlled, modulating cleanly from meditative to revealing without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional and weighted. The voice sustains pressure while staying legible and character-true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is strong: images carry multiple jobs, sentences vary, and momentum holds without scaffolding bloat. Figurative language is frequent but coherent within an established lexicon (ice, glass, light) and rarely purple. No loops or template cadences; transitions are clean. Minor on-the-nose phrasing is the only notable softness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck-diver ghost whisperer, glacier monks, a melted snow globe as haunted microcosm—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “windows of connection” motif transforms meaning at the end without gimmickry. Risks in tone and design heighten stakes and coherence. The piece avoids template beats and honors its own logic.</comment>
