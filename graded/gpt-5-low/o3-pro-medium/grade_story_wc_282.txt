<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ruen’s motive conflict (Ministry data vs. “voice of the unknown”) is clean, embodied, and escalates to a renunciation. His micro-choices under pressure—placing the fossil on the floating water, pressing it to the fissure, stepping into the corridor—align with character and reveal priorities. The internal turn from ambition to “be the hinge that sings” feels earned with a visible cost (isolation, sealing in). Minor note: his competence remains high; a touch more falter could deepen the human texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory mapping → fossil translation → fissure surge → invitation → sealing. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: he accepts the role, the corridor seals, instruments power down, and he trusts the map to sing. Cost is on the page and conceptual stakes reweight the premise without tying a mechanical bow. Orientation is clear early (cave network, hibernating world), with no causality cracks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The caves are tactile and rule-bound (floating water, moonlit pools), and the environment directly alters options (crawl space, water lowering to reveal the corridor). The elm fossil functions as object‑setting, constraining and charging the final image. World rules are learned via action, not dumps, and sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The setting’s logic remains consistent and pivotal to the turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: to become a conduit for the unknown rather than a bureaucratic measurer. Pressure coheres through the surge and invitation; his choices narrow options (accepting the corridor means being sealed in). The visible price (isolation, loss of instruments, fossil’s eventual crumbling) charges the ending. Escalation is driven by his agency in a lyric frame, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of translation, awakening, and future-as-unknown emerge organically from events and recurring images (heat‑maps becoming grammar; the fossil as transitional object). The final reweighting—humanity will “walk through fully conscious,” and he becomes the hinge—resonates without moralizing. A single line (“interpreter not intruder”) leans declarative, but it’s dramatized by subsequent cost. The afterimage invites reflection rather than providing a tidy thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV control is steady and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature (emotion-as-temperature lexicon). Lyric compression is taught early and maintained; the one spoken line is purposeful and in voice. Diction is consistent with the character’s vocation and mindset. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean propulsion; images do more than one job (e.g., “floating water” as world rule and anxiety barometer). Figurative language is fresh and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors or purple drift. No scaffold loops or template cadence; rhythm modulates with pressure. The final image resolves with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sensory cartography of dream residue, floating water physics, and a “factually mystical” fossil synthesizes into an original vision. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the established rules. Bold, non-gimmicky risk in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
