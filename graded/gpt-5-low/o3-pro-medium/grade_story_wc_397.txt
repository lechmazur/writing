<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to study the acoustics of endings before choosing death—is precise and drives each micro‑choice (volunteering, listening, stepping outside). Her interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (parasol tip’s whistle, ice as “plural accents of endings”). The Earned Stasis at the end—postponing the clinic—feels causally earned and carries cost. Minor note: “grips reality loosely” is more tonal than action‑constraining on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: salvage beats and weather pressure build to the blizzard, harmonica, and the ice’s voice, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (drift‑ice marina, euthanasia tourist, three‑day wait). The cost is legible on the page (“bearing the quiet weight of postponed departure”). The throughline is cohesive without and‑then drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina is tactile and determinative: floes, trawling channels, blizzard entrapment, and creaks shape action and catalyze the realization. The parasol tip functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image via sound. Sensory range is wide (hiss, crack, hum, warmth of stove) and always filtered through Mara’s aim. Environment directly pressures and reframes the stakes at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to proceed toward euthanasia—tightens via the enforced wait, the blizzard confinement, and the external chorus of ice aligning with her interior quest. The decisive deepening is her recognizing the marina’s “plural accents” and choosing delay, which forecloses a path for now with felt cost. Pressure is coherent and grows without needing an antagonist. A hair more on‑page jeopardy could have sharpened the squeeze further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of endings, patience, and listening emerge organically through particulars (trawling, harmonica, calving ice) rather than thesis. The final cadence reweights the premise: endings are chords learned over time, not a single note; this reprices her earlier urgency. No moralizing; the ambiguity is purposeful and resonant. One aphoristic line (“Not every voyage…”) tiptoes toward stated theme but is buoyed by context.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular, lyrical perceptual signature sustains without head‑hopping; diction and rhythm suit the cold, patient atmosphere. Narrative certainty stays within what Mara can sense and infer. Dialogue is sparse and subtextual (the foreman’s harmonica prompt), fitting the mode. Minor density pushes the edge at moments but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is supple, image‑rich, and efficient; metaphors cohere to ice, sound, and breath, avoiding muddle. Sentences vary in rhythm, and details do multiple jobs (world, mood, theme). No evident scaffold or paraphrase looping; momentum sustains through lyric accumulation. A few high‑ornament lines flirt with purple but do not obscure causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—euthanasia tourism refracted through an ice‑marina salvage crew and sonic study of endings—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet plot, lyric density, object‑as‑oracle) heighten stakes and land cleanly at closure. Specificity (parasol tip whistle, stove‑pipe song, calving hum) distinguishes it from template grief arcs. The final reconfiguration is both surprising and retrospectively prepared.</comment>
