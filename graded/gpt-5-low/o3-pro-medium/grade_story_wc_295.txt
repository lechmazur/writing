<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is precise and persistent (decode inscriptions to prevent weaponization), and her grief/solitude versus outreach creates credible internal tension. Embodied details (sidereal clock, breath control, tears) ground emotion. The decisive vulnerability—broadcasting and inviting others—earns her shift. A slight safety in her competence keeps some messiness at bay.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with crisp orientation and a maintained Accumulative/Textural lens. Beats progress cleanly: align star → overlay lightcurves → decode → reprice mentor’s death → broadcast → replies → charged resolve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (renouncing solitary grief). The causal throughline never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, dome slit, sidereal clock, telescope, and phosphor screen aren’t backdrop; they enable and constrain her method and time window. Objects (telegram, ledger) recur and charge the final image. Sensory choices are purposeful and POV‑filtered. Atmosphere serves theme without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightens via the decoding and the decision to broadcast, which forecloses isolation. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through reversals, but the emotional price is legible. The revelation about Ariston reframes danger and responsibility, deepening stakes. A touch more hazard or competing demand could have sharpened the turn further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action and image—shared burdens shift stone and sky from threat to remedy. The inscription’s warning, the communal broadcast, and the reweighted “burden as anchor or propulsion” deliver a true conceptual repricing. No sermonizing; resonance lingers in the final resolve to map aspirations. The daylily telegram threads grief into communal meaning without platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close POV with a distinct perceptual signature tied to profession and grief. Rhythm modulates well through the decode/broadcast beats. No head‑hopping or stance slips; quoted lines are integrated cleanly. Occasional lushness approaches purple but remains intelligible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, specific diction; most sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics; momentum carries to closure. A few stacked metaphors flirt with excess in calm beats, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—lucid dream chronicler decoding quake‑freed glyphs via variable stars to prevent interpretive weaponization—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The pressed daylily telegram as a grief‑device and signal is memorable. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The communal reply motif elegantly transforms a solitary observatory vigil.</comment>
