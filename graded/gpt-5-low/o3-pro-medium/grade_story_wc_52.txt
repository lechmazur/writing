<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to transmute grief into form—is concrete and consistent, with embodied choices (raising the ash blank, refusing to “finish” the sculpture) revealing values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (“Stay” vs. accepting “here and gone”) operate in scene rather than as summary. The remembered instruction “breathe earlier” grounds her tactic credibly. Minor hedge: she succeeds with little visible struggle after the freeze, but the cost of acceptance is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the freeze into “crystallized time” deepens the dominant stake and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: “Here and gone” is repriced into a workable ethic. Orientation is clear early (loft, rain, kettle), and the magical beat pays off causally (kettle/rain stilled; lion encounter enabling containment). The cost—choosing endurance and perpetual incompletion—is legible in the refusal to finish the lion. The ending image (chisel poised, rain as commas) cleanly seals the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The loft, rain‑beaded skylight, and kettle are not postcards; they function as a live clock and a medium for the time‑freeze that shapes options. Circus scent, wood, and tools are filtered through Mara’s priorities and charge the final image. The micro‑setting (bench, chisel, ash blank) constrains and enables her tactic. Weather and light evolve with action and theme without overexplanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether grief can be contained enough to live alongside it; it tightens when the husband dissolves and Mara must face the lion alone. She chooses to channel the roar into the wood, then accepts the cost of never finishing. The escalation is internal but punctuated by the supernatural confrontation, which credibly raises the stakes. It’s quiet but decisive, with no convenient rescue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars—kettle, skylight, ash blank, the husband’s method—rather than assertion, and “Here and gone” is reweighted from wound to organizing principle. “Absence, too, can roar” is earned by the scene’s action, not tacked on. The final poise holds complexity: peace carries ongoing cost. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s sensibility; syntax varies to modulate pressure. Patterned diction (“here and gone,” circus textures) is taught early and pays off. No head‑hopping or register drift; the remembered line “Feel the cat breathe, then breathe earlier” gives vivid, natural cadence. The narrative certainty stays within what she can sense and infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: images do multiple jobs and rhythm supports the scene’s ebb and swell. Figurative density is high but coherent to the circus/wood/rain lexicon, avoiding muddle. Minimal scaffolding or loops; the prose remains purposeful. A few lush turns flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—widow of a lion tamer using a time‑freeze to let a roar inhabit ash wood—is distinctive and emotionally grounded. Risks (lyric mode, magical interlude) heighten rather than obscure stakes, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Specific circus craft and the “breathe earlier” tactic refresh familiar grief terrain. The final cadence avoids the safety middle.</comment>
