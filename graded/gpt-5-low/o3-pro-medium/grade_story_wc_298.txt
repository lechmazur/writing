<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and sustained: a reckless idealist barters her own future to revive her sister’s. Interiority is embodied (the “tremor behind her dusky resolve,” the ballast’s “bruise”) and contradicted by her instinctive lunge for the seed versus her fear. Micro-choices under pressure (offering more than memory, choosing the seed, accepting ballast) reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. The change—renunciation of her future—reads earned and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: vow → descent → rule → insufficiency → greater offer → seed choice → consequence → ballast → exit. Orientation is immediate and stable; one scene holds the pressure. Closure lands on the page with cost (visions of the life forfeited, the bruise/weight that remains) and the lens holds to the end. No dangling setups; the dawn clock tightens departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and functional: rules, resources (apples, seeds), and the dawn market constrain moves. Details are selective and charged (“skull-studded soil,” “obsidian mirrors”), integrated into action. The setting directly shapes the bargain and charges the final image (orchard settling, card cooling to ash). World logic feels consistent without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: trade destiny to restore Mira. Pressure tightens credibly when memory proves insufficient, forcing Liora to spend her lived future; the subsequent seed choice and ballast add immediate, felt prices. The reversal (saving Mira at the cost of her own guidance) arises from her agency, not coincidence. Consequences persist into the exit beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of mercy’s cost and grief’s ballast emerges through concrete acts, not assertion. Recurring images (“bruise,” “ballast,” “ash”) deepen a moral calculus that resists tidy moralizing. The final charged poise—blank pages plus soft-burning ballast—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext in the Keeper’s rule frames the bruise as the necessary price of meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A coherent close-third lyric voice with controlled rhythm; diction suits the mythic frame and remains consistent. Dialogue is taut, purposeful, and subtext-rich, advancing stakes (“offer more than memory”). Perceptual signature is distinct—obsidian, bone, onyx—without head-hopping or register slips. Psychic distance tightens at peak beats without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; images pull double duty and momentum holds. Figurative density approaches the edge but avoids muddle; metaphors stay coherent to the bone/root/fire lexicon. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; syntax varies with pressure. The mirrored “inlaying meaning” line is an effective, not redundant, motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bone-orchard market for destinies via apples and seeds feels freshly synthesized and specific. Tarot as burned relic, obsidian mirror-seeds, and the ballast seed add memorable, non-generic turns. The sacrifice is classic but carried with distinctive texture and cost. Risks in lyric compression pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
