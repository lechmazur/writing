<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rook and Mira have legible motives (rebuild through language; freedom tested by fear), and their micro-choices—calling people, stamping cards, climbing to the roof—align with those motives. Interiority skews lyric over bodily specificity but still conveys tension (parole risk, sirens, “Fear is an obedient architect”). The friendship functions as a crucible that advances tactics and trust. Emotional contradiction is present though not deeply embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: details and communal pressure accrue toward a Charged Poise/RR ending as the library brightens and the town gathers. Orientation is clear early; stakes crystallize in the rooftop call and the arrival of exiled citizens. The cost is mostly implied (risk of arrest; parole jeopardy), not paid on-page, softening impact. The final slip “Tomorrow we molt together” reweights the premise without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library and night sky are tactically integrated: cracked rafters, ladders, and beams dictate action (mapping cracks, shoring with dictionaries, roof hatch call). The coffee tin and bullet holes become light portals and signals that charge the final image of communal glow. Sensory specificity is high and filtered through purpose. World rules (words strengthening structure) stay consistent and operative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—build a refuge of language under hostile oversight—is established early and tightens with sirens, rooftop broadcast, and the influx of banned texts. The choice to go public (“Bring your broken stories”) forecloses safety, an effective escalation under the lyric lens. Consequence is signaled but not cashed on-page, keeping cost slightly abstract. Nevertheless, pressure coheres and increases toward the charged dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—language as infrastructure and resistance—emerges through specific acts (seed packets, sonnets along cracks) rather than abstract sermonizing. A few aphoristic lines flirt with thesis-stating (“Fear is an obedient architect”) but are earned by action. The final shared note reframes “molting” from solitary to communal, deepening the question of identity and solidarity. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, consistent lyrical third-person voice sustains imagery without losing legibility. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, distinct in idiom (Rook’s coin-and-crack metaphors vs. Mira’s wary pragmatism). Rhythm modulates well at turns (sirens, rooftop call). No head-hopping or stance drift undermines the effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and economical for most of the piece, with many lines doing double duty (image + action). Figurative density is high but largely coherent and purposeful; only occasional purple edges. Syntax varies, and beats propel rather than loop. The final cadence pays off recurring images cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The conceit of rebuilding architecture with unruly language—and the coffee tin’s seeds of words—is fresh and integrated. The communal “blooming resistance” reframes resistance tropes with specificity (card-stamping, bullet-hole light). Risk-taking in diction and premise heightens stakes without losing clarity. Minor familiarity in a few aphorisms trims the absolute ceiling.</comment>
