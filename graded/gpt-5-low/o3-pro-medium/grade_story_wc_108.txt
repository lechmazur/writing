<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and specific: fear, betrayal, and a self-revision instinct collide in embodied ways (“knees shook,” “corrugated gutters”). The motivation—prove vulnerability as power—drives concrete choices (stalling, decrypting, broadcasting, then the jump). Contradictory impulses act at once in the climax: trembling confession followed by controlled subversion via cables. A few thematic assertions (“I was nobody and everyone”) tilt toward told insight but don’t undercut earned action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: decrypting the cast → discovery of death‑bonus ledger → public exposure on live mics → engineered “rebirth” jump. Orientation is early and steady (roof of a rusted library at night; production context), and the hidden cables pay off the engineer setup. Closure lands on page with cost: shattered windows, security advancing, career and identity upheaval. The lens is Causal and holds through the final charged poise of “walked toward whatever name.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library roof, glass atrium, desert wind, and camera rigs are tactile and shape tactics (the edge, the hidden cables, the satellite link). The seashell functions as micro‑setting, charging decisions and the final image (“clinked against asphalt”). Environmental detail is selective and pressure‑driven, not postcard. Space and tools constrain options and deliver the decisive stunt beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self‑reclamation vs. exploitation/death) is clear from the jump’s setup. Escalation tightens via the ledger revelation and on‑air denunciation, forcing a public, risky choice. The engineered save demonstrates agency while paying cost (burned bridges, exposed contract, physical peril). No extraneous reversals; one decisive deepening leads to a meaningful, costly reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Identity, exploitation, and “vulnerability as power” emerge from events and images (the half seashell’s reweighted meaning; the public confession plus safe‑but‑shattering drop). The porous self is dramatized through copy/replacement and the chosen rebirth stunt. A couple of lines voice thesis‑adjacent statements, but they’re anchored in action and don’t replace scene pressure. The final clink of the shell widens the theme without neat moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice sustains pressure while staying within plausible POV reach. Diction modulates from tactile (“corrugated gutters rattling”) to declarative under the mic’s heat without drift. No head‑hopping or stance confusion; elisions (past discovery, engineer’s prep) are paid off on page. Rhythm tightens at the jump and releases into a charged final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—image, action, motive—with minimal scaffold. Figurative texture is frequent but coherent and purposeful (seashell’s hiss, comet tail) and avoids muddle. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; syntax varies and momentum holds. A few abstracted phrases approach purple but do not blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a phobia‑ridden stunt double as engineered replacement, a child’s cast as cipher, and death‑bonus ledger turning the jump into an on‑air rebirth. The seashell half motif is specific and recharged at the end. Outwitting via broadcast and pre‑rigged cables transforms familiar “expose the studio” beats. Risk‑taking in structure and image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
