<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is crisp (find brother/garden) and contradictory impulses (panic/hope; rescue him vs. abandon the lost) are live in scene. The choice to stitch a third path is earned by earlier cues (chimeric siblings, narrative threads) and carries cost. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“trapped freedom,” the card burning the palm). Slight convenience in the sibling’s unnoticed threads keeps it just shy of flawless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive holds: causal beats (card → theater → choice → stitched seam → lily‑pad bridge) within a lyric frame. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: they leave, but must sustain the bridge by telling, and the garden shifts from wardenship to wandering. Orientation is clear from the first lines and supports the ending image. The price is on‑page and specific (“each pad supporting only remembered weight”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ship’s spaces and tools constrain choices: looping corridors, mirror‑steps, drowned‑stub curtains, and the hull’s crack forcing the ink‑lily bridge. The emerald card and bioluminescent names charge the final image and tactics. World rules are learned through action, consistent in their fabulist logic. Atmosphere is vivid without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free the brother without betraying the lost) tightens at the on‑stage decision point. The stitching of a third path forecloses staying or abandoning, and the lily‑pad rule adds ongoing pressure and cost. Escalation is coherent and driven by the protagonist’s agency. Minor softening comes from the ease of discovering an unnoticed thread loophole.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring particulars (names, threads, gardens, “trapped freedom”) and reprices at the end (“gardens prefer wanderers to wardens”). Subtext hums in the cost of remembering as labor rather than epiphany. No moralizing; the final widening‑the‑cage image lingers with complexity. The “unkindled solace” idea runs through the garden’s rule and the siblings’ tempered exit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with clean first‑person focalization; brief dialogue carries subtext and pressure. Rhythm modulates well from hush to surge (card flaring, ink‑lily crossing). No head‑hopping or register slips. The voice’s metaphoric texture remains character‑bound and consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with few to no loops; images do double duty for mood and mechanics. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, with clear vehicles tied to the world (carnival, garden, threads). One or two lush stacks edge toward excess, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially at closure. Syntax varies with pressure and reads clean on the ear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a carnival‑ship, narrative‑thread mechanics, and “remembered weight” bridge are fresh and purposeful. Turns arise from seeded specifics (chimera twins, compass‑card, thread‑doors). Emotional truth (care vs. captivity) grounds the invention. Risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
