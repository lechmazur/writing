<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and particular—she wants to chart the stillpoint to guide pilgrims and herself—and actions align, culminating in surrendering the inherited ring. Interiority is sensorial and embodied (learning glacier patience, fern regret) with a credible knot of resistance. The internal turn—pressing her palm to her chest—shows contradictory impulses reconciling under pressure. Slight idealization and serenity under stress keep it just short of truly jagged complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held; the pattern densifies from sensing notes to internal fusion to the pool and braille constellations. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: the stillpoint is internal, and she relinquishes the maternal compass to embody the discovery. Orientation is clear (who/where/aim) and the piece maintains one continuous scene with a single tightening. The final image reconfigures tactics (maps as resonance) rather than routes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is tactile and rule-bound, shaping how she navigates (vibrations, notes, root-hollow, pool). The compass ring and the pool function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection is POV-specific (listening through skin), and world logic stays consistent. A hair off 9+ only because environment mostly aids rather than corners her into a hard trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: locate and map the stillpoint; pressure coheres as the melody resists resolution until she risks inwardness. The meaningful tightening is the failed dowsing and the internal pivot, culminating in the relinquishment of the ring—a visible price. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential, with internal and external threads braided. Escalation is quiet but decisive within the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reconciliation and guidance through listening emerges organically from particulars (languages of glacier, rain; resonance over route). The final repricing (“not a place on land but a coordinate inside every listener”) is potent, though the direct statement edges toward telling. Subtext is active in the exchange between forest and Oriole and the maternal inheritance. The ending lingers with an image-driven moral rather than a sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is distinctive, with consistent sensory lexicon and controlled rhythm. Diction (“quiet blaze,” “silent fire”) feels native to the character’s perceptual world and modulates with pressure. No head-hopping or stance drift; purposeful elision is taught and paid off. A trace of elevated-poetic uniformity keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images work double duty and propel momentum. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and earned by the premise; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Rhythm varies and cadences land cleanly at the pool and the final upward drift of braille stars. Minor saturation of lyric modifiers in a few spans prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept and execution feel singular: a blind mapmaker reading languages through skin in an ultrasonic forest, reweighting maps as reconciliations. The maternal ring’s dissolution and braille constellations are fresh turns that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in form and imagery heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. Emotional truth grounds the novelty.</comment>
