<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear from the vow and sustained through the fear of losing his “lantern,” culminating in the renunciation of the quill. Interiority is embodied and particular (“moth wings,” “shadowed rapture”), with a live internal contradiction at the surrender beat. Micro-choices—pausing to rest, tracing meteors, yielding the last speck, stepping back from the quill—reveal a hierarchy of values with real cost. If anything, his flaw profile skews saintly, but the fear/emptiness tension keeps it credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: meteors → map → comet reveals glyphs → condition to surrender → unlocking → village revival. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Earned Stasis; he pays a clear price (sacrifices his spark) and refuses the quill. Orientation is solid early; the piece holds a Causal lens without contradiction. The cost is legible on the page at the decisive moment and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tundra, aurora-lit archway, and keystone chamber are vividly rendered and functionally constrain choice and action. The bronze heart as tool-object is integrated into setting usage and charges the final image. Weather and terrain pressure his tactics (wandering, resting, frost) and enable the comet/glyph reveal. World rules are consistent and taught through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“free trapped creativity”) is present from the outset and tightens at the surrender condition, which forecloses a personal path. The key pressure point is the demand to relinquish the final speck; fear vs. purpose forces a costly decision. The resolution emerges from his agency, not coincidence, and consequences ripple outward (village awakening) while leaving him altered. Tension accrues at sentence and beat scales without soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of inspiration as communal good requiring personal relinquishment emerges organically from events and images. The “emptiness as space for new constellations” line edges toward explicitness, but it’s dramatized and then paid off in the final charged stasis. Recurring motifs (stardust, breath, aurora, rest as punctuation) reweight meaning at the end. The closing image invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the mythic quest mode. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible; no head-hopping or stance slips. Voice modulates under pressure (from wonder to fear to spent stillness) with control. A few lush lines flirt with purple, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; most lines do multiple jobs. Minimal redundancy and strong propulsion through varied sentence rhythms and paragraphing. The lushness is sustained without muddle; metaphors are coherent to the cosmos/aurora register. Slight risk of saturation in the middle, but the prose never obscures causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an astrolabe as “bronze heart,” an unwritten calendar of fatigue, and “remembered stardust” as spendable agency all feel singular. The core turns arise from seeded rules, not late-breaking tricks. The refusal of the quill reconfigures the archetype with quiet audacity. Risk-taking in image and structure heightens stakes without losing clarity.</comment>
