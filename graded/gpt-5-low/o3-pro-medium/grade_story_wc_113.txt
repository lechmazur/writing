<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—decoding Silvestri’s silent code—drives every beat, and her choice to damage the house to change resonance aligns with that obsession. The moral trade (“one more fracture could not harm memory”) shows a credible internal calculus under pressure. Interiority is specific to a musician’s mind and body, though contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) could surface more viscerally. The final acceptance of cost and fulfillment of the code feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is clean from the opening: who, where, when, and the goal are established quickly. Causal links are tight: harmonic → alignment of blotches → instruction → trapdoor → mosaic → duet → code fulfilled (program turns blank). Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a resonant reconfiguration, with conceptual/physical cost acknowledged. The piece operates as Hybrid with an accumulative cadence at the end; the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera, lanterns, and submerged mechanics shape tactics and sound, directly constraining choices (lighting, wading, trapdoor access) and charging the final image. Acoustics and water actively alter options and meaning, not just mood. Specific objects (timpani head, rusted crank, mother‑of‑pearl mosaic) evolve with events. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock/realize the ghost’s code) is present early and coherently escalates through a brave physical disruption that forecloses preservation. The meaningful tightening occurs at the trapdoor: a point of no return that reweights options and sound. Prices—further flooding, personal risk, irreversible alteration—are visible though not harrowingly felt. The resolution is earned by Mira’s agency and commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme arises organically from action: silence as language, echoes as afterlife, art as residency in ruin. Recurring images (unstruck chords, blot‑score, acoustics) reweight at the end when the credo reframes “music ends, yet echoes house the living.” The final blank program and communal exhale deliver a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Subtext of grief/exile integrates with the physical transformations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The close third’s diction and sensory bias feel musician‑specific, with rhythmic control that swells and quiets with pressure. No head‑hopping, and the lyric texture is taught early and sustained. The POV’s inferences stay plausible; elision supports mystery without withholding. The credo lines register as diegetic, not authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—image, action, and mood—without slack; metaphors are vivid and mostly disciplined. Occasional lushness (“harmony thickened like fog”) serves the moment and does not muddle causality. Sentence rhythm varies with scene needs, keeping momentum. No noticeable scaffold or synonym loops dull the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—water damage as score, acoustic disruption as key, a ghost’s silent language realized through architecture—is striking and coherent. Turns feel inevitable once posited, not gimmicky. Risks (lyric mode, high concept, quiet climax) heighten stakes and land cleanly. The images and moves would not transplant cleanly to another setting or cast.</comment>
