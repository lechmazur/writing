<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aram’s motive—understanding transition to ease grief—drives every micro‑choice, from translating aloud to refusing to look at the presence. The contradiction between “haunted ambitions” and “kindly methodical” plays on the page (mapping threads while his chest tightens). His final stance—gratitude within continued absence—feels earned, with a felt cost of letting go of grasping. Minor note: struggle remains mostly internal, but it’s palpable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning causal: find seed → translate → analogical lament → lattice/presence → conceptual repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (“absence transform[s] into an echo he could carry”). Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (Uruk doors, linguistic voltage) pay off in the vocal modulation. Stakes resolve without a hard external test, but the hinge/seed mechanics provide credible on‑page turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is vividly specific and functionally integrated: magnetite vines, suspension fields, lightning held at “touching distance” all shape options and images. The environment acts as a hinge and responds to language, charging the final image and the seed’s reprisal. Detail is filtered through Aram’s translator’s eye, avoiding tourist catalog. Weather and fields materially affect the procedure and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—piercing the passage rule—and tightens when the arbor demands the right “linguistic voltage,” then when the presence gathers and he chooses not to look. The seed’s split and the street‑lattice introduce a deepening that narrows tactics (careful mapping, voice modulation). Costs are internal (acceptance over summoning), legible but quiet. No external adversary, yet agency clearly drives outcomes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of translation as ethical passage accrues through objects and acts: cuneiform, lament, lattice as childhood streets, “Gate held open by memory.” The final repricing—conservation of transition—reweights the opening ache. One near‑thesis line (“understanding never captures a spirit; it only offers it safer passage”) edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly dulling subtext. Overall resonance lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—precise, image‑driven, lexicon consistent with a scholar moved by grief. Refrains (“touching distance,” “kindly methodical”) are patterned rather than repetitive and carry charge. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, subtextually pursuing consent and comprehension. Psychic distance stays steady; lyric compression remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are densely imagistic yet clean; metaphors cohere to magnetism, charge, pattern, and script. Rhythmic control supports escalation, with breath at turns and acceleration at reveals. Minor risk of purple is averted by specificity (“lattice of photon threads” mapped to street corners). No scaffold loops; information density stays high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept and execution feel singular: a magnetic orchard bearing idea‑seeds, analogical physics as grief rite, and linguistic voltage as access key. Turns arise from the protagonist’s profession and temperament rather than gimmickry. The final conservation insight feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold without obscuring clarity.</comment>
