<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kerrin’s motive—to recover vanishing memories—drives every choice from entering the whale to prying the salt coffin. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (lantern craft, wick‑knives, obedience to the harbor vs. her private quest). The decisive act (exhuming her earliest self) earns the later steadiness. Minor shortfall: the internal contradiction could tighten further at the lid‑pry beat with a sharper moment of doubt or risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative lyric): coffee divination → vision → crater → coffin → retrieval, each because/therefore link clear. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost (crystal wail, gravity stitching, tears) and a reconfigured future plan. Orientation is crisp from line one; the two‑shard transition is taught and paid off. Slight ease at the decisive action (lid yields quickly) prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constraining: odd gravity alters steam and breath, tugs her body, and the salt chamber dictates the exhumation method. Recurring objects (lantern, wick‑knives, coffee, salt) charge the final image and govern tactics. The harbor’s hush and “gleaming silence” permeate tone and choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent from maw to crater to coffin.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early; pressure coheres and deepens as the vision mandates a pre‑dawn exhumation, narrowing options. The tightening beat is the descent under unstable gravity and the moral/physical risk of breaking the coffin. Cost lands emotionally and conceptually, though practical resistance is minimal (no true setback beyond atmosphere), tempering intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory, grief, and the physics of forgetting integrate through image and act, not proclamation. The whale’s gravity turns loss into a material ecology, reweighted by the final restoration and communal aftereffect (fishermen humming forgotten tunes). The wildflowers’ regained scent and unlit lantern at dawn provide resonant repricing without moralizing. Plan to “return with allies” hints larger ethics without neat closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit a lantern lighter’s sensibility. Patterned elision (vision/transition) is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or register drift; voice modulates under pressure (from hush to chime and wail) while staying coherent. Strong but capped below 9 due to Q2 not reaching 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do double duty (coffee as divination and map, salt as coffin and scent catalyst). Figurative language remains coherent and purposeful; no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors. Cadence varies effectively, especially around the decisive beats. Minor ease at the climax is structural, not a line‑level flaw.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: whale‑born gravity pockets, coffee‑ground cartography, and salt coffins harvesting cores of memory feel singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric physics, nonliteral causality) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity (wildflowers, wick‑knives, bell‑chiming crystals) grounds the conceit. Slight conventionality in the “map to help others” beat is the only familiar note.</comment>
