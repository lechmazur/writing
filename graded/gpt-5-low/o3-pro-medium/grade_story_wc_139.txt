<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s moral calculus (honest child of a con) drives every micro‑choice, from delaying to weaponizing the ink pot; her contradiction (integrity vs. necessary deceit) is embodied, not told. The minister’s brief objection sharpens her values under pressure. Status dynamics with Corvus are legible and shift when he bleeds. The final “imperfectly balanced” ledger earns her stance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: Corvus’s coercion → Mara’s wait → shard drop → concealment → body‑bag ruse → automated transfer → escape. Closure lands with cost (Corvus dead, moral debt acknowledged) and a reweighted rule‑set about “fair exchange.” Orientation is crisp from the opening; single scene holds. A mild plausibility stretch (automated doors/a.m. routine) doesn’t break the because/therefore spine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prep room actively constrains tactics: refrigeration units for cover, body bags/tags and transfer schedule as the escape vector, formaldehyde atmosphere as tonal pressure. The ink pot functions as micro‑setting/tool charging the ending image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a mortician’s precision. World rules feel consistent without exposition dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the minister without forfeiting integrity) is signaled early and tightens via a decisive tactic (waiting to provoke the shard’s fall). The shard injury, concealment, and timed bag‑transfer mark a single, meaningful escalation path with visible price. Agency is Mara’s throughout; coincidence doesn’t resolve. Ethical calculus (one life for two) sharpens the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of fair exchange, cost, and liquidity crystallize through concrete choices, not sermonizing; the ink pot and “liquefy rigid thinking” motif reweight the final image. The “interest owed by corrupt states” line edges toward on‑the‑nose but stays grounded by action. The ending’s conceptual repricing (imperfect balance accepted) resonates beyond plot. Moral ambiguity remains live, not tidily resolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, tensile voice—mathematical/philosophical diction welded to visceral mortuary detail—holds steady without head‑hopping. Dialogue is minimal, goal‑driven, and subtextual (pressure, threat, refusal). Rhythm modulates well between lyric description and tight action. No withholding beyond purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; images like “a red signature” are precise and earned. Lyric density is high but controlled; mixed‑metaphor risk is managed, and repetition (“deathly vitality,” “liquefy”) is motif rather than redundancy. No scaffold loops or filter stacks dulling immediacy. Minor flourishiness doesn’t obscure action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a mortuary escape using institutional routine and a booby‑trapped heirloom ink pot, framed by a fairness calculus. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under her chosen method of “waiting actively.” Genre elements (asylum, agent) are transformed through specific tools and tone. Bold but coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
