<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—decode living growth in a frozen‑language world—is clear and consistent with his reticence. Interiority is specific to a scholar’s sensibility, but internal contradiction is mild; fear of heresy is implied rather than dramatized. His final stance (quiet demonstrations vs proclamations) fits his character yet carries limited on‑page cost. The piece earns a gentle endurance/renunciation rather than a charged break.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the crystal’s fractured echoes accrete into a pattern, leading to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) and the scene stays continuous. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/CR—returning the crystal and choosing a quiet mode of sharing—though the cost remains largely conceptual. The because/therefore chain is soft, but the cadence shift is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library and chandelier are richly realized; dawn light and dust inform perception and tactics (the crystal is only found because of the setting). The crystal functions as micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true; world rules (post‑dictionary stasis) stay consistent and are learned through action. The environment constrains approach (silence, listening) without bogging pace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving growth within enforced stasis—is legible, with a meaningful deepening when the echoes reveal branching motifs. Pressure is largely internal and accumulative rather than confrontational; escalation comes via density of evidence rather than obstacle. The final renunciation of public proclamation for quiet demonstration narrows a path, but price is subdued. Still, the knowledge shift reweights options convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of growth versus stasis emerges through the object’s function and the gardener/printer echoes. The ending reweights the premise without sermonizing, though one or two lines verge on thesis (“proved knowledge was not a closed book”). Subtext operates in silence, listening, and the charged return of the crystal. Resonance lingers, if more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is measured, lyrical, and consistent with a reticent scholar’s perception; diction and rhythm are controlled. Psychic distance stays stable; no head‑hopping and no unjustified certainties. Patterned elision (fractured audio) is taught and honored. Slightly elevated register occasionally skirts purple, but it serves tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with varied syntax and strong image economy; most sentences do more than one job. A few phrases recur (“suspended hush”) but function as motif rather than loop. Figurative density is high yet coherent; minimal scaffolding. Momentum holds through description without muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—post‑dictionary stasis tested by a sonically reflective chandelier crystal—is striking and integrated. The fractured‑echo method feels inevitable in hindsight with the chandelier setup. Risk‑taking is purposeful and clear under pressure. Emotional cost could be sharper, but the conceptual ingenuity is memorable.</comment>
