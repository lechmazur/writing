<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority ties guilt to embodied detail (tingling nerves, gestures), and micro-choices (wandering, investigating the stain, deciding to stay) align with motive. The internal contradiction—yearning for safety vs. need to atone—operates on the page. Slight dock for a few declarative insights that edge toward thesis rather than showing contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a clean causal seam: stain → bolt → recognition → stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses to remain and confront silence, cost implied as ongoing self-imposed constraint. Orientation is solid early; cost is felt but quiet, not fully dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective detail (cobalt walls, dusty spiral, snow sift) is filtered through POV and returns to charge the final image (bolt warm in pocket against the cold). The fortress’s isolation and staircase enable the discovery and frame the cost of safety. Occasional overt symbolism skims the surface but doesn’t break the atmospheric integrity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (price of safety vs. voice) tightens through the found bolt that reweights the past, producing a credible turn. Pressure is mostly internal, yet coherent and escalating via pattern density. The price is legible but low-external; no acute on-page risk slightly softens the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of silence, guilt, and redemption emerge organically through images (bolt, snow, choir). Strong resonance at the end, but lines like “true safety demanded the risk of sound” border on moralizing and undercut subtext. Still, the bolt’s repricing of “safety” is effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual bias; diction and rhythm support the wintry hush and inner ache. No head-hopping; elision is modest and legible. Minor register inflation appears at times but stays within the voice’s logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Musical sentences and strong image economy carry momentum, but there’s some purple drift and motif reiteration (frostbitten, seraphic) that feel redundant. Figurative density occasionally stacks, risking blur. Overall clarity holds, and the final image is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, silent-choir bellhop, and piano-bolt time-thread synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame. The discovery mechanism and moral calculus feel particular rather than templated. High originality without gimmickry; only the explicit thematic line tempers the finish.</comment>
