<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s scientific detachment versus the humbling pull of the greenhouse’s slow ruin creates a credible internal contradiction. Her choice to move from passive observation to active care is earned by the accumulating cost on the page. Interiority is specific to her profession and embodied in tactile moments (dust on palm, softening stems). A few tidy thematic assertions edge toward over-explanation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the mounting dust patterns and deepening decay create a clear cadence shift that culminates in an Earned Stasis/Reconfiguration: she chooses to restore with acceptance. Orientation is immediate and stable; causality is cumulative rather than because/therefore and holds. The cost—loss of plants, surrender of pure detachment—is legible in the final turn. Slightly essayistic reflection never obscures the closure beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is sensorially vivid and functionally constraining; moisture, rot, and broken glass shape what she notices and can do. The butterfly dust operates as a charged micro-setting feature that literally alters surfaces and options. Weather and environment meaningfully pressure the situation. Detail selection reflects Elena’s trained observational bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate on whether she stays detached or intervenes as decay intensifies; the increasing density of patterns functions as escalation under the chosen lens. The final decision forecloses a path (pure observation) with a felt price. There’s no sharp reversal, but the tightening is sufficient for this length. A slightly larger external pressure point could have heightened crucible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around humility in the face of gradual change, organically braided through butterfly dust and neutron star analogs. The final image reweights earlier material without resorting to plot mechanics. However, lines like “No longer could she view change as mere data” verge on didactic, dimming subtext. The resonance still lands due to concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person close maintains a consistent scientific-perceptual signature, with controlled diction and apt metaphors from her field. Rhythm is measured and modulates as pressure accrues. Occasional expository statements tilt essayistic but remain in character for a researcher. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean, sensorial, and purposeful; images often do double duty. Minor repetition around “gradual change” and “patterns” and a few explanatory sentences slow momentum slightly. Figurative logic holds; no purple pile-ups. The last paragraph’s cadence lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—butterfly wing dust as microcosm of neutron star decay—feels fresh and specific, not a generic science-to-life analogy. Risks (extended metaphor, quiet arc) pay off without obscuring clarity. The internal turn is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its premise without hedging.</comment>
