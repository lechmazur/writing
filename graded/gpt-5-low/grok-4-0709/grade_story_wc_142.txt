<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lanara’s goal and dual allegiance are clear and consistent, and the stone chip/graffiti method reveals character through action. However, much of her struggle is summarized rather than dramatized as micro-choices under pressure. The most vivid, particular interiority arrives around the mural unveiling and talisman use, but earlier beats lean tell-y. The final stance feels earned, though the felt cost to her personally is muted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Situational lens, pressure coheres from creeping gentrification to the envoy’s arrival to the co-op plan encoded in the finale mural. The closure is a Charged Poise: a collective resolve crystallizes with the chip embedded as keystone. Causality is mostly accumulative (weeks of coded organizing → mobilized crowd) rather than turn-driven, but it holds. The on-page cost at the end reads implied rather than explicit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The raft-carnival is vivid and functional: parades and walls enable covert messaging, and the floating sprawl pressures displacement. Sensory details (cotton candy, fireworks on waves) feel selective and POV-filtered. The foundation chip as object-as-setting charges the final image. World rules remain consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prevent privatization) is clear, and escalation tightens with corporate scouts and the envoy’s announcement. The mural plan is a meaningful deepening that redefines options (co-ops, buybacks). Still, prices and trade-offs are under-rendered on the page; the win gathers quickly once revealed. Tension is steady but rarely bites with immediate consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of community resilience vs. gentrification emerge organically through tactics (graffiti codes, co-ops) and the chip’s symbolic reprise. The dual allegiance adds moral texture without false equivalence, as she bridges factions. The final image offers resonance without moralizing, though a hint of neatness trims complexity. Subtext in performance codes (juggling patterns passing messages) is effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately close to Lanara’s sensibility, with selective, biased noticing. No head-hopping or stance drift appears, and the rhythm modulates well between summary and scene. Some phrasing trends generalized (“hope flickered… desperate and unyielding”), but most diction fits the POV. Dialogue absence doesn’t harm; action carries intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean and propulsive, with concrete nouns and purposeful imagery; repetition is minimal. A few abstractions and near-clichés appear, but they don’t stall momentum. Syntax varies and paragraphs carry distinct moves. The final cadence lands cleanly with a charged image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival and graffiti-encoded reorganization feel fresh and well-synthesized with the gentrification pressure. The foundation chip as talisman/keystone provides a distinctive turn. While the theme is familiar, the delivery via carnival mechanics and covert art is inventive. Risk-taking supports coherence rather than gimmickry.</comment>
