<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s drive to understand endurance is clear and embodied through tactile choices (placing the glass, reading sun and smoke, mending comb). The zen/curiosity tension is present but not deeply conflicted, keeping the emotional cost modest. Micro‑choices feel character‑specific and align with his craft. The ending renunciation (leaving) is earned but underplayed in felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: details accrue (sun patterns, smoke, glass) to a conceptual repricing—kindness as the rule binding the oasis across time. The causal hinge (glasses touching → thrum → fractures navigated by light) is coherent and pays off with the fused glass. Closure lands on the page as understanding plus an earned departure, though the cost is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally pressured. Orientation is crisp from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The oasis and its micro‑features (rows of hives, spring, chimney smoke flattening) are vividly integrated and functional. The lantern glass and smoke actively guide tactics and charge the final image. Sensory specificity tracks Elias’s craft‑biased perception. World rules around the fractures are taught through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake is singular (discover why the place endures) and tightens once the thrum fractures time. Escalation is thoughtful but gentle; danger and trade‑offs stay low, with resolution emerging from kindness rather than a pressured choice with visible loss. The decisive deepening is the navigation by light culminating in fusion. The renunciation to leave registers but could carry sharper cost on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kindness/resilience thesis arises from particulars (beekeepers' acts, Elias’s gentle mending) and coheres with the final image. However, the theme is stated outright (“This oasis resisted change not through force, but through accumulated kindness...”), blunting subtext. The resonance lingers, but the explicit articulation in the closing stretch reduces ambiguity. Subtext otherwise works via “phototropic to kindness.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a supple, crafted lexicon matching a potter’s gaze and rhythm. Syntax varies and supports the meditative pressure without slipping register. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Lyric touches feel voice‑rooted rather than generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level texture is controlled, with layered images doing double duty (wheel, smoke, light). Minor tendencies toward thesis‑sentence exposition and a few repeated motifs prevent a higher score. Momentum and clarity never stall. Final cadence is clean and image‑driven despite the brief declarative moral.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Potter + beekeeping oasis + phototropic kindness + light‑guided timeline navigation is a distinctive synthesis. The lantern‑fusion turn feels both fresh and inevitable. Risks are taken in marrying lyric metaphysics to concrete craft, mostly without obscuring clarity. Only the explicit moralizing slightly tempers the ingenuity’s afterglow.</comment>
