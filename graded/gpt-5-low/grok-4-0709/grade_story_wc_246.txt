<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—atoning by “threshing meaning”—is clear and the doubt/resolve tension reads in her “confidently uncertain” handling of the controls and pen. Micro‑choices (tuning receivers, confessing in the broadcast, deciding to write revisions) reveal her values. However, the path to resolution feels low‑friction, with little on‑page cost or contradictory impulse at the peak. The finale’s serenity slightly tidies away ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats chain cleanly: anomaly from wrong seeds → signal exchange → pen awakens → probabilistic “edits” stabilize reality. Closure lands on page (tendrils wither; alarms quiet) with a legible before/after. The “editing history” mechanism is introduced and used, not late‑patched, but the cost is soft—no sacrifice or lasting constraint is emphasized. Orientation is firm from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: inverted raindrops, elongated stars, and the anomaly itself shape tactics (pen siphoning probability) and charge the final calm. The meteor‑nib pen functions as micro‑setting/object that constrains action and anchors the ending image. Sensory selection and world rules are consistent and folded into action. Economy holds; no tourist‑catalog drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (undo consequence of wrong seeds) is clear, and pressure tightens once when the signal invites action and the pen “awakens.” Escalation remains gentle—solutions largely succeed on first try; few options foreclosed and little price paid. The “unbending” moment works symbolically but risk feels contained. The resolution reads earned yet comfortable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of revision vs erasure and learning from error recur through pen, seeds, and “contingent relationships.” The ending reweights prior material toward “edit to learn,” but several lines state theme directly (“not to forget, but to learn”), blunting subtext. Still, the image of probability drawn as ink and the nib unbending carry resonant implication. Ambiguity exists but is modest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third maintains a distinct perceptual signature (cosmic metaphors filtered through a signal interpreter). Rhythm and diction modulate with the anomaly’s surges without head‑hopping. No dialogue, but narrative stance stays within plausible knowledge. Minor flourish never breaks control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong image economy; lines often do double duty (world + theme). Occasional repetition and abstract phrasing (“confidently uncertain,” “thresh meaning”) skim toward statement, but momentum holds. Figurative density stays coherent; no mixed metaphors or clotted syntax at the peak. Copy is clean and sequence clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The meteor‑nib pen drawing probability to rewrite history via contingent cosmic alliances is a fresh synthesis. The gravitational anomaly as consequence of botanical error adds specific texture. While the arc resolves too smoothly to feel radical, the core moves feel distinctive rather than templated. The “unbending” click as causal signal is an elegant touch.</comment>
