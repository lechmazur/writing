<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s duty-versus-grief tension is credible and embodied (wiry engineer, calloused hands, breath syncing to tone). His “logically emotional” trait converts into tactic choice under pressure. The internal cost surfaces at the end, though a few label-y lines (“logically emotional surge”) soften complexity. Secondary figures are thin, but they serve pressure rather than needing depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: rumor → approach → retreat to chamber → vibrational barrier → intruder’s absolution → flight of others → reflective afterbeat. Closure lands on page with a felt reconfiguration (threat dissolved; Elias’s own guilt stirred). The mechanics are briefly expository but coherent; the confrontation resolves a touch quickly for the built stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are vividly rendered and functionally used (ice resonance, treacherous footing shaping tactics, lighthouse chamber as locus). Recurring objects (orb, key) charge the final image. Occasional lushness leans ornamental, but the environment constrains choices and colors the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early—protect the artifact—and pressure tightens as intruders close and breach. Elias’s adaptation is the key turn; the barrier tests intent and exacts a cost in exposure and effort. Resolution feels earned but a shade easy, as the lead intruder is purified swiftly without strong counterpressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Absolution versus guilt is dramatized through sound, not lectured, with the lighthouse-as-beacon metaphor integrated into action. The ending’s echo—his own guilt surfacing—reweights prior images. A few direct statements (“beacon of forgiveness”) verge on didactic, but the subtext largely holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A consistent lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (engineer’s ear for frequencies) sustains mood. Rhythm is controlled, though “flesh/ethereal” motifs are repeated to excess. No head-hopping or stance wobble; compression under stress is believable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid lines and purposeful verbs carry momentum, and action remains clear. However, purple phrasing and synonym echoes (“fleshly,” “ethereal,” “golden”) recur, and some sentences double-explain an image. The figurative density skirts overwrought but does not blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse engineer weaponizing harmonics for moral filtration amid drift-ice—feels fresh and character-bound. Vibrational matching as both method and theme is inventive. Risk is taken in tone and concept; only the neatness of the purification beat tempers surprise.</comment>
