<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied in tactile choices (clearing vines, tracing cracks, strumming). Her brief moment of doubt when “nothing happened” gives a small but credible contradiction. The interiority is particular—she reads cracks as crescendos—though “empathy in motion” trends abstract when repeated. The visible cost is mainly emotional (tears, spent focus), modest but present at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds from hush to hum through iterative adjustments. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when/stakes). Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the silence isn’t shattered but “enriched,” and the final image reweights the world’s rules. Cost is felt rather than explicit, enough for this scope but not profound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The grove, sculpture, and porcelain insulator are vivid and functionally integrated; the object-as-setting constrains tactics as she reads cracks like notation. Sensory selection fits the quiet pressure (leaf-rustle, quill-quiver, faint hum). World rules (a silent world) are consistent and learned through action. The final image is charged by place and tool, not just postcard detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and clear: make music in a silent world. Escalation tightens when strumming initially fails, prompting on‑the‑spot recalibration via crack analysis. The price is mostly intensity and concentration rather than a hard trade‑off; still, the beat structure deepens pressure once. Stakes remain intimate and coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of empathy, fracture into harmony, and listening are earned through concrete acts (reading stress lines, modulating touch). The silence becoming “enriched” rather than broken reframes connection without moralizing. A few explicit formulations (“empathy in motion”) edge toward told theme but are supported by scene work. Resonance lingers in the final quiet, not a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks Elara’s perceptual signature (musical metaphors, score‑like reading of cracks) with stable distance. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure—measured at first, tightening in the “nothing happened” beat, then soft release. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Slight repetition of thematic lexicon is noticeable but doesn’t blur POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and musical, with strong image economy (“wings adding percussive whispers”). Occasionally edges toward abstraction (“core concept of empathy in motion”), but clarity holds and most lines do double duty. Minor repetition and heightened diction flirt with overwriting without tipping into muddle. The final line lands cleanly by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—tree‑song sculptor decoding stress fractures of a porcelain insulator to coax sound in a silent world—is fresh and organically executed. The hedgehog/dawn cue and accumulative hush-to-hum arc feel distinctive rather than quirky. Risks are aesthetic (quiet, lyric closure) and pay off with coherence. Only the explicitly named concept softens the originality slightly compared to letting it stay fully subtextual.</comment>
