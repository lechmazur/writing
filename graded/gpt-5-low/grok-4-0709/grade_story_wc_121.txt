<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to conquer the labyrinth of self”—is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (testing love, solitude, conquest, teaching) reveal layered contradiction. Emotional texture skews summary-heavy in the middle, but the final renunciation (becoming mortal) reads earned with felt cost. Embodiment appears in selective images (hovering, warmth of the tablet) yet sometimes defers to concept. Overall, strong motivation with credible change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: successive branches deepen pressure and reweight stakes, culminating in a decisive change (she lands, mortal). The live clock (“between the drop and the ripple”) keeps the frame taut and paid off in the final image. The integration act provides causal cohesion within the lyric structure, with the cracked tablet marking cost. Clear closure with price, no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct, post‑storm mist, and humming tablet produce a vivid, coherent atmosphere that modulates with the arc (brightens, flickers, dims). The raindrop/puddle and light fluctuations subtly steer urgency and tone rather than mere postcard description. While the environment rarely constrains tactics physically, it charges the final grounding. Specificity and consistency are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and tightened by the clock and by each darker branch revealing new costs. The integration of all branches under strain is a meaningful escalation that forecloses prior options. The final choice trades immortality and flight for freedom, a clear price. Pressure grows coherently without reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: power vs. love vs. solitude, and the procedural revisiting that exposes rot and echoing pain. The forgiveness of the “child afraid of falling” reweights the premise without moralizing, and the last image (touching ground) resonates as answer and cost. Motifs (light darkening, raindrop) accrue meaning instead of being declared. Subtext stays active beneath the spectacle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elara with stable distance and confident cadence. Diction aligns with the mythic register and modulates with pressure (flicker to embers) without head‑hopping. Occasional conceptual phrasing (“procedural generation”) skims abstraction but remains voice‑motivated by the story’s conceit. Rhythm supports escalation and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑rich, and largely efficient; recurring images advance tone and stakes. A few lines flirt with overwriting or conceptual repetition (procedural branches summarized), but clarity endures and momentum holds. The final third is clean and potent. Minor density slip, not momentum‑killing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mythic fantasy with algorithmic/procedural logic feels fresh and purposeful. Gravity‑defiance as both power and curse, resolved through integrated branches, yields a non‑obvious but inevitable close. Risks in structure and diction pay off without obscuring closure. Highly original within a compact frame.</comment>
