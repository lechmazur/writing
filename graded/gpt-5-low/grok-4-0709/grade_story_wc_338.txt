<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (methodical curiosity, empathetic listening to silence) are clear and drive his tactics, and his micro-choices (silent projection, pausing, aligning the torn map) reveal him under pressure. The “shielded yet open” stance hints at contradiction, though the internal conflict never bites hard. Emotional embodiment is present but skews abstract at peaks. The final “mending” choice is motivated, if its cost remains mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pattern-reading through silence builds to a conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean; the single-scene structure coheres. The closure image (pressing the map tear; the vault’s “exhale”) lands as a reweighting with a cost of renouncing imposition, though the price is felt lightly. Escalation via pattern accretion (indentations vanishing, twilight vibration) reads purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (rain-scoured frescoes, projector hum, damp vault) are filtered through his profession and charge the final image when the map tear aligns with the fresco. The environment quietly constrains tactics (silence, non-invasive methods). Weather and architecture shape tone and meaning without postcard excess. The micro-setting (map, projector) functions as tools bound to choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reopen hidden lore through non-coercive seeing—is steady, with one meaningful deepening when anomalies and rhythmic vibration are noticed. Pressure remains contemplative; no antagonist or material risk tests commitment. The final act forecloses forceful paths in favor of attentional stance, but the cost is modest and mostly conceptual. Tension operates, but quietly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silence/empathy/ritual motifs accrue and reconfigure at the end: silence becomes agency, the henge a “living echo” rather than a relic. Thematic statements veer close to telling in places (“silence wasn’t absence”), but the closing image earns resonance. The map’s tear as liminal boundary reframes knowledge vs. unknown. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled close-third voice with a distinct perceptual signature—patient, tactile, reverent—fits the character’s craft. Diction is elevated yet justified by his sensibility; stance is consistent with no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates from descriptive density to sharpened noticing around the anomalies. No dialogue, but the narrative carries subtext well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong, with rich but mostly disciplined imagery; the “whispered” motif repeats but serves patterning rather than padding. Minor redundancy and adjective density in a few lines slightly slow momentum. Syntax varies and remains clear; information density is good. The final line resolves by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an archivist-like investigator reading silent films to “reopen” a ritual site through attention, not excavation. The map tear/fresco alignment is a memorable, specific turn. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but they cohere into a singular vision. The ending’s conceptual pivot feels earned and distinctive.</comment>
