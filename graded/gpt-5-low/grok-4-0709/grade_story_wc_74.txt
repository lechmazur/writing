<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation is clear and particular—methodical hope tethered to insomnia and a quiet mission. Interiority is textured through tactile choices (moonwater, brush, scroll) rather than label-speak. Internal contradiction is mild (fatigue vs. resolve) and could press harder under strain. The final resolve to distribute anonymously reads earned but low on visible cost beyond weariness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: inscriptions and daydreams accrete toward a charged dawn decision. Orientation is clean, single-scene coherence intact, and closure lands with a credible Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (scroll finished, plan to seed the city). Cost is implied rather than dramatized in a sharp dilemma, but the cadence shift at dawn functions. No causality gaps; the set-ups (brush, moonwater, languages) pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the smog, greenhouse, and moonlight shape what’s possible and when. The calligrapher’s brush and moonwater act as micro-setting constraints tied to the waxing moon. Sensory economy is strong, with “saffron quiet” modulating mood and action. It stops short of exerting hard constraint under pressure, hence just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving kindness is remembered) is present early and deepens as inscriptions animate specific histories. Escalation is largely textural—the moon intensifies, visions grow clearer, and by dawn a concrete plan materializes. The price is subtle (fatigue, anonymity, long-haul labor) rather than a pressured trade-off. One tightening beat (the decision to distribute fragments) lands but without sharp opposition.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, communal generosity, and language as vessel emerge organically through the inscriptions and final dawn gesture. Subtext hums in the linkage between vanished scripts and fragile urban kindness. A few overt thesis lines early name the idea, but the ending reweights it through image rather than moralizing. The final image earns a reflective afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and unified with the character’s perceptual bias (plants, moon, tools). Rhythm and diction modulate with the night’s hush and the mild quickening toward dawn. No head-hopping or register slips; free-indirect textures stay clean. The lyric mode never obscures the scene’s legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain clarity; images rarely overreach. Minor repetition (“saffron,” moonlight invocations) feels intentional but skirts lushness. No scaffold loops or filter stacks dull momentum. The final cadence is concise and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—moon-tipped brush, distilled moonlight, lost languages of kindness revived in a greenhouse above a toxic city—feels fresh and coherent. The method (daydream activation) is imaginative yet integrated with character and setting. Closure honors the eccentric premise without retreating to a tidy moral. Risk-taking heightens tone and theme while staying legible.</comment>
