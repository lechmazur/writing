<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and specific—mapping grief through making—filtered through tactile, character‑particular details (bone/brass fingers, stitched body). Interiority carries embodied ache without therapy‑speak, though contradictory impulses rarely press simultaneously; the navigator mostly moves with serene competence. Micro‑choices (which relic, which numbers to dial, when to proceed under a crescent vs. wait) align with motive. The ending’s endurance costs are felt but not sharply foreclosing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the waxing moon and successive calls densify until activation of the compass; closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (choosing to become a beacon). Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (hydraulics failure, censer foot, moon‑linked power) pay off. The causal spine is soft but coherent: failure → build → calls → activation. The cost at closure is more implied than dramatized, keeping it short of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The starlit signal station, rusted beams, rotary phone, and patina bronze base are sensorially precise and integrated into action. Environment constrains tactics (no hydraulics, reliance on stars/antenna) and charges the final image as the station becomes a beacon. Details show professional bias: what a navigator notices serves the build. A touch of ornament (occasional lyrical excess) doesn’t dilute functional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—building a device to guide loss home—tightens via the moon’s constraint and the progressive clarity of calls. Escalation is a steady accumulation rather than sharp turns; the full‑moon activation is the single meaningful deepening. The price (re‑opening grief to become a public beacon) is present but understated. A bolder foreclosed option or on‑page tradeoff would lift pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Reverse migration” and “geography of loss” recur as enacted motifs—the censer foot, sea glass lens, and midnight calls transmute metaphor into mechanism. The ending reweights the premise by making the station a beacon for others, not just self‑repair. A few lines flirt with declarative theme (“Reverse migration wasn’t about…”), mildly flattening subtext. Still, the final image carries earned, unsentimental resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature (tools, tides, celestial calibration) and steady psychic distance. Patterned diction (geography, migration, navigation) is taught early and maintained without head‑hopping. The cryptic call snippets add texture without breaking stance. Occasional elevated phrasing edges purple but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete nouns, and multi‑tasking sentences that carry image and action. Minor redundancies and a few abstractions (“geography of loss” repeats) verge on over‑lyricism but don’t obscure sense. Rhythm modulates well from hush to hum at the climax. No notable scaffolding or mechanical slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a censer foot as compass base, moon‑phased power, rotary midnight calls to the departed, and a “reverse migration” ethos feel fresh and coherent. The emotional engine (choosing to become a beacon through pain) grounds the conceit. Risks are taken without gimmickry; implications follow through. Slight safety in conflict keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
