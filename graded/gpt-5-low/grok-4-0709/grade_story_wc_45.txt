<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s “forgiving skeptic” contradiction drives credible choices: she doubts the hoax yet forgives, and still risks the maze to seek proof. Interiority is specific (bone‑setting as a moral practice) and embodied through handling the pouch, tooth, and bone. The final renunciation—choosing integration over vengeance—feels earned by prior traits. Slight softness: the vision grants answers quickly, reducing visible struggle at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: discovery of the substitute body → entry into the maze → tooth on pedestal → ritual → vision/forgiveness. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes loss and mends the “cleft in certainty.” The cost is conceptual—letting the old pursuit of certainty dissolve—though it’s felt more in image than friction. A touch more on‑page resistance would have deepened the price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective setting (thorny maze, nightshade, moonflowers, vine‑carved fountain) filtered through Elara’s purpose. The garden and pedestal meaningfully charge the final image; the hedge maze gates access and dramatizes the quest. World rules feel consistent, learned through action. The environment could constrain tactics more overtly, but it’s still integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling truth/forgiveness—stays focused, tightening at the ritual when tooth and bone fuse. Escalation is primarily internal, coherently deepening toward the vision. The felt price is modest; the resolution arrives with relative ease once the relic is found. Even so, agency drives the turn and reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness, doubt, and healing thread through concrete motifs (maze, bone‑setting, constellations). The final image re‑weights earlier material without a neat moral, inviting reflection. Occasional abstraction (“innovation of forgiveness”) edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut the earned resonance. The bone‑setting metaphor provides a strong thematic spine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature—curiosity tempered by wary empiricism. Diction and rhythm mostly serve pressure and mood, with effective modulation at the ritual. A few lexical choices (“innovated,” “innovation of forgiveness”) momentarily jar but the stance remains controlled. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean, image‑rich prose with good sentence variety and momentum; objects and actions do multiple jobs. Minor purple inflections and repeated abstractions create slight over‑density in places. The closure image is clear and not dulled by figurative muddle. Minimal scaffold and no disruptive loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fae‑swap lore is refreshed by the bone‑setting craft and the “constellations of mistakes” motif. The baby tooth fused with the stolen bone is a distinctive turn that feels prepared. While the premise draws on familiar myth, the synthesis feels personal and specific. Stakes remain intimate yet conceptually bold.</comment>
