<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—preserve the city by finding and freeing the echo-source—but internal contradiction is light and emotions skew summarized over embodied. The illustrator lens offers specificity (“her illustrations of aquatic beasts guiding her”) that informs a micro-choice. The final act (freeing the bird) reads as earned by prior belief and skill. However, we don’t feel a strong, on-page cost in her psyche at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: seeking the echo nexus → canal exploration → time-sculpted key → uncaging → cadence reconfigured. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the closure is an on-page decisive change. Cost is somewhat conceptual (borrowing time, risking wakefulness) rather than felt, but the mechanism sets stakes and resolves them coherently. Single scene with one transition stays within scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rooftop canals, vortexed tower, and submerged chamber are vivid and purpose-driven; environment constrains choices (gondola route, dive access) and charges the final image. Sensory and professional filters (an illustrator’s noticing) sharpen specificity without touristic cataloging. World rules (time cage, visible breaths) are internally consistent and learned through action. Minor over-lushness is well-managed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prolong the giant’s slumber—tightens through the vortex discovery and the temporal cage problem, culminating in the key-forging decision. Agency drives the turn (choosing to borrow time and uncage the bird). The price is implied more than felt, slightly softening the squeeze at the peak. Still, the escalation reads clean and purposeful under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of creation, captivity vs. balance, and art’s ambition (illustrating “souls”) align with the echo-source and time-sculpting. The final image reweights prior material: harmony is preserved by adding controlled interruptions, a nuanced stance on order vs. generative noise. No moralizing, though the neatness edges toward tidy. Subtext remains image-led rather than declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close is steady with a distinct, lyrical texture suited to fable-like stakes; no head-hopping. Diction tracks the protagonist’s sensibility, and compression is purposeful at pressure beats. No dialogue needed; the narrative voice carries subtext and momentum. Rhythm varies effectively from calm observation to kinetic climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clear, propulsive, and efficient despite lushness; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, motive, motion). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; minimal scaffolding and no evident loops. The peak action is dramatized rather than summarized. A few ornate turns flirt with purple but don’t impede clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>City-on-a-giant plus a time-sculpted key and a caged echo-bird feels striking and integrated, not ornamental. Turns arise from established premises and character capacity. The vortex/nap-cadence mechanism is a fresh synthesis with conceptual integrity. Risk-taking is high and coherent through to the reconfigured ending.</comment>
