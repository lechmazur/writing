<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (to pass on impermanence to Lila) is clear and embodied by concrete micro‑choices under pressure (twining himself secure, tossing apples, mending a vine). His feisty defiance collides credibly with grief, producing a lived contradiction rather than a tidy lesson. The shift from grief‑stalled to reframed vows feels earned through the on‑page catalysts (poem, shard, ribbon). Interiority leans lyrical over granular bodily sensation, but it stays character‑specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive holds: a causal chain (gust → dangling → bag spill → poem read → reweighted meaning) delivers a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The “accidents” are thematically framed and do not cheapen causality; they complicate rather than magically solve. Closure lands on the fused ribbon and shared line about accidents with palpable emotional cost (accepting a seasonal bond that can break and renew). Orientation is clean early and the single‑scene window is respected.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cathedral‑orchard is vivid and pressures choices: elevation and branches force twine‑securing, provide apples, and enable the mending beat. Sensory specificity and world logic stay consistent, and the final image (“orchard above whispering”) charges the thematic turn. Detail is purposeful and filtered through Elias’s craft and stubbornness. Strong integration without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent: physical danger and the risk of failing the generational handoff. Escalation tightens when he dangles and must improvise with spilled tools; the poem deepens the internal conflict rather than resolving it cheaply. The price is felt (risk and the relinquishment of a fixed reading of vows), though the external peril resolves quickly. The final stance is earned by his agency rather than coincidence alone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: vows as seasonal, wisdom arriving via mishap, objects holding promises. The ribbon’s reweighting and the poem’s wind‑caught reveal tie image to idea without over‑explaining. One aphoristic line risks neatness, but the cost of acceptance keeps sentiment in check. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through the fused quartz‑silk artifact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice balances lyric description with tactile action; Elias’s dialogue is distinctively prickly and Lila’s anxious. POV remains steady and knowledge stays character‑bound. Prose cadence modulates with pressure without head‑hopping or over‑explanation. A few aphorisms verge crafted, but they fit his temperament and the piece’s tonal aim.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with generally clean momentum; imagery is controlled and mostly fresh. Minor purple flares (“wisdom’s favorite disguise”) flirt with neatness but don’t blur sense or slow the beat. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks; action order remains clear. Final lines land with image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quartz‑eye mender in a rafter‑orchard is a striking synthesis, and the “forgotten bag” catalysis feels specific rather than gimmicky. The vow concept (“deciduous”) is an original framing that coheres with setting and craft. The shard fusing into a ribbon is an elegant, distinctive turn. Risks are taken in worldbuilding and motif recurrence without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
