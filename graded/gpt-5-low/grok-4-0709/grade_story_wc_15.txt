<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to transform ruin into reverence—is clear and consistently embodied in tactile choices (sewing bridges, gardens, altar). Interiority is vivid but largely unconflicted; we don’t feel a simultaneous tug of fear or doubt against her “haunting optimism.” The sleepwalking conceit limits on‑page deliberation, softening micro‑choices under pressure. Still, reactions to the plate and the crossings reveal character-specific drive without safety hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the labyrinth is materially reweighted by nightwork, and dawn reveals a new social reality. Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when), and the sleepwalking overlaps accrue toward the altar image. The cost is more implied than felt (fatigue, loss of control), which trims the ceiling. Nevertheless, the final cadence (“the canyon breathed easier…”) makes a before/after legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth, tide pools, and bioluminescent moss are sensorially rich and purpose‑driven; the environment dictates timing and routes (chasm, grotto, altar). Details are filtered through Elara’s vocation and faith (nets, vines, shells), avoiding tourist catalog. The plate functions as an object that charges space and tactically guides sewing choices. Setting isn’t mere backdrop—it channels action and shapes the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate texturally via accumulating intersections: bridge over isolation, orchids in darkness, and the altar weave. The tightening is real but gentle; risk or pushback is minimal, and coincidence (others sleepwalking) functions as given condition rather than pressure. Agency is present in the sewing at overlaps, but on‑page cost is soft. The ending is earned as deepening rather than a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Broken precedents” move from motif (plate image) to enacted theme (bridge, forbidden garden, altar rebirth). The story resists explicit moralizing; its answer is embodied in communal repair and ritualized craft. A hint of thematic telling (“broken precedents”) slightly blunts subtlety, but the final charged poise—ongoing nights of mending—lingers with reflective weight. The mend-as-worship frame feels coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with image patterns (“orchid solace,” bioluminescent moss) taught early and reprised. POV remains stable in a close third limited to Elara’s sensorium, even through trance passages. Rhythm modulates well between hush and forward movement, and there’s no head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. Diction fits the mythic register without slipping into academic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-dense, and largely efficient; lines often do double duty (world + theme). A few stacked modifiers flirt with purple (“gentle, floral hush… petals on bruised skin”), but clarity holds. Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable loops; momentum carries through the accumulative beats. Final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—poetic wharf weaver mending heritage via overlapping sleepwalk paths guided by a storyplate—is fresh and coherent. The communal somnambulism as weaving loom is an inventive risk that pays off. Emotional truth comes through craft-as-ritual rather than novelty for its own sake. Slight softness in consequence prevents the leap to the topmost band.</comment>
