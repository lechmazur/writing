<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amir’s motive is clean and particular—grief fused with scientific obsession—and his micro-choices (initiating perturbations, pressing through the wind, choosing renewal over vengeance) align under pressure. Interiority is textured with embodied cues (trembling fingers, the geode in his palm) rather than label-only feeling. The contradiction between vengeance and renewal surfaces credibly at the end. Some abstractions (“intangibly tangible”) edge toward concept over body, trimming peak intimacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative textural build supported by causal steps: perturb, observe anomalies, chase clusters, pinpoint the ultimate pool. Closure lands as a charged poise: systems reboot forecloses further action while he commits to renewal, a stance with implied cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the cooldown window and reboot serve as concrete constraints. The cost is more implied than dramatized, but it’s legible in the foreclosed window and the vow’s burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory, cooling circuit breakers, and battering winds aren’t just atmosphere—they constrain tactics and time, and they charge the final cutoff. Tool and object details (sensor arrays, geode at focal point) are integrated into action. The environment mirrors fragility without overt symbolism. Strong, selective sensory curation through a physicist’s gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>One dominant stake (map and reach the pools) tightens via the ticking cooldown and external wind pressure. Escalation tracks through increasing anomaly density and pursuit of the “largest cluster” to the ultimate pool; then the reboot closes the window, forcing a values choice. The felt price is primarily temporal and emotional, not material, but it’s clear. A single, clean tightening works at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grief-to-renewal, the ethics of potential, and the cost of survival emerge through concrete images (the geode from the wedding, “lives unlived” nodes) and culminate in a non-vengeful vow. The final image reweights earlier material without stating a moral. A middle line explicitly equating anomalies to “what could have been” edges into telling, shaving subtlety. Still, the resonance holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lyric-scientific register feels coherent for a traumatized physicist; diction and rhythm modulate effectively with pressure. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping or unearned certainty. A few phrasings veer toward purple or mantra-like repetition, but clarity survives. No dialogue needed or missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with good sentence variety and purposeful detail. Occasional overwriting (“intangibly tangible,” stacked metaphors) and explanatory lines (“These pools weren’t mere energy…”) slow momentum. Repetitions approach a patterned tic rather than a built cadence. Still, information density remains high and the closure image lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—quantum perturbation theory as grief-work in a helium-buoyed observatory, leveraging a wedding geode to hunt “unused potential”—feels fresh and committed. Turns grow from the premise rather than gimmicks, and the final reconfiguration to renewal reads earned. Risk is thematic and tonal rather than structural, but it pays off. A few familiar lyric moves temper the sense of singularity.</comment>
