<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (“preserve the shape of hope”) drives every choice, and her discovery that the shadow is tied to her past adds credible internal pressure. Interiority is specific—“sharp-eyed dusk noticer,” “softly deliberate”—and actions align with those traits. The confrontation with her own regret at the end provides an earned cost. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is present but could sharpen further under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: anomaly → archival comparison → origin revealed → ritual binding using the stone. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost, not a handwave. The older founding footage seeds the binding logic, avoiding late rule changes. The solution risks slight convenience, but the cost image (“luminous regret lingered”) anchors it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Blooming Library and its dream‑orbs are vivid and functional; the environment supplies the tools (crystalline footage, dream‑share protocol) that shape tactics. The river stone functions as a micro‑setting object that constrains the ending choice. Imagery is selective and POV‑filtered, maintaining tonal coherence. Minor note: a tactile constraint from the floating space itself could further sharpen stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and held: protect hope’s form from the unbound shadow’s erosion. Escalation is coherent under a causal lens—from noticing to investigation to binding—tightened by the revelation that the shadow is her own remnant. The price is her acceptance of regret and transformation of it into guardianship. A single decisive tightening occurs; a second complication might have deepened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of hope transmuted through acknowledged regret emerges through concrete images (petals “in luminous regret,” the binding to stone) rather than moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer: preserve hope by integrating the unbound parts, not erasing them. Ambiguity remains human and charged without confusion. No sermonizing undercuts it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s dusk‑attuned noticing. Lyrical diction stays consistent with the world’s register and does not overreach her perspective. Rhythm modulates effectively at the climax. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly economical; lines often carry dual duty (world + theme). A few heightened phrases risk saturation but do not blur causality. Momentum holds through reflective passages because they reframe present action. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—shareable dreams, a floating library, silent footage as forensic method, and an unbound shadow tied to regret—feels fresh and integrated. The metamorphosis solution is earned by earlier world rules. The guardian‑stone image is memorable and conceptually specific. Risk‑taking in tone and premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
