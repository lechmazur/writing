<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (an overdue apology) is clear and pressurized by guilt and time, and her choices (score selection, uncorking the bottle, the apology itself) align with that drive. Interiority is specific to her odd vocation and metaphor-habits without drifting into therapy-speak. The sister’s brief presence carries real reproach, sharpening Elara’s flaw. The final renunciation—accepting partial forgiveness—lands with credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure tightens cleanly: ritual → apparition → apology → partial forgiveness → fading as machines start. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: a bridge built and knowingly inadequate, with cost in the sister’s fading and the lost orchard. Causality is intact (induced vibrations sustain/fail the contact). Orientation is strong from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archive and orchard are richly realized and functional: the harpsichord and brittle score enable the ritual, and the orchard’s hush sets a live clock. The perfume as micro-setting charges the final image when she corks it, sealing “jasmine and spectral grit.” Sensory texture is varied (dust, scent, sound), filtered through Elara’s aim. World rules (harmonic “currents”) are consistent and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconnection to apologize—is explicit early and coherently stressed by the limited window before the cutting. Escalation comes via the apparition’s fragile hold and the external timer ticking to machinery rumble. The price is unmistakable: forgiveness only partial, contact collapsing. There’s no big reversal, but the narrowing options are felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “imperfect miracle” motif accrues meaning through the leaky vase, fragile currents, and doomed orchard, culminating in a stance that accepts scarred mending. Subtext surfaces in the sister’s line (“mine you planted yourself”), indicting Elara without didacticism. A slight thematic overstatement appears in the final paragraph about her columns’ new tone, trimming subtlety. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent—lyric with a tactile grit—and POV remains cleanly inside Elara. Dialogue is brief but weighted, carrying subtext and conflict credibly. Diction is controlled and pattern-aware; no head-hopping or stance slippage. Occasional repetition of favored textures (“gritty”) slightly narrows tonal palette without breaking control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong, with purposeful syntax and images doing multiple jobs. A few metaphors cluster (“imperfect,” “gritty,” orchard analogies), edging toward redundancy but not obscuring sense. Momentum holds through the ritual and farewell without scaffold loops. Final lines land cleanly on a charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” plus music-as-conduit and the perfume anchor feels fresh and coherent, not ornamental. The orchard-timer entwined with forgiveness stakes elevates the frame beyond trope. Risks are taken in tone and premise, largely paying off. Minor familiarity in a few metaphoric choices prevents a higher mark.</comment>
