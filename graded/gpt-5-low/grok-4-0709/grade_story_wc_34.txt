<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elowen’s motive—to be heard and freed—is clear and embodied in his encoding act, but his interior conflict is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. Lira’s swift arrival and instinctive decoding read convenient and underdeveloped as character pressure. The “seldom-heard” aspect gains poignancy through his encoded plea, yet the liberation comes too easily to reveal deeper flaws or contradictions. Strong, but not searching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The chain (storm’s pause → encoding → Lira decodes → mechanism unlocks → freedom) is coherent and lands a decisive change on the page. However, Lira’s timely appearance and near-miraculous comprehension soften felt cost and make the resolution border on convenience. Orientation is clean and the single-scene window holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtyard-in-the-clouds and storm window actively shape tactics and mood; the plate as tool integrates with the environment’s runes to constrain choices. Sensory specificity (“veined with glowing runes,” “roses scripted with ones and zeros”) is purposeful and POV-filtered. World rules feel consistent through action rather than exposition. The setting charges the final image without excess cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes (freedom vs. remaining trapped/inaudible) are signaled early and tightened by the lightning–thunder clock. Escalation is present—encoding under time pressure—yet the reversal arrives externally with Lira, and the price paid is light. The mechanism unlocks without a trade-off or visible loss. Tension is steady rather than mounting to a squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of articulation, connection, and bridging realms emerge organically from the encoded graffiti and the final promise. Some lines verge on thesis statements (“Hear me, free me...”), trimming subtext. The ending resonates but risks sentimentality by resolving friction cleanly. Still, the image of code-blooming flowers carries real aftertone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person with a distinct diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) holds steady. Rhythm and imagery are controlled and legible under pressure. Minor repetition of coined terms nudges toward mannerism but doesn’t break voice. No head-hopping; focalization remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean and propel action, with vivid images doing double duty. There is occasional purple drift and motif repetition that edges into redundancy (“driftingly alert,” “tinkersong wonder” recur). Syntax varies, and information density is good, but the climax could use tighter, plainer force. No significant artifacts that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” fused with an archaic weather machine and a flower-press-graffiti encoding method feels fresh and integrated. The rescue beat (instinctive decoder arrives) is more familiar and trims the boldness. Still, the specific synthesis of tool, time-window, and art-as-algorithm is memorable. The final co-authored message lands as an elegant, non-obvious flourish.</comment>
