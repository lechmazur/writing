<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to earn forgiveness by refracting her guilt—drives consistent, on‑page choices (sitting at the spire, persisting through sessions). The defiant/mischievous tension is credible and active in the playful stanza that complicates blame. Cost is legible: her readiness requires surrendering innocence for wisdom. Interiors skew lyric but stay character‑particular rather than generic therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes/mist/spire intensify and reweight the central stake. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: “One truth becomes legions, and I am free,” after conceding the cost. Orientation is clean and the ritual deadline frames the scene. Causality is lyric but coherent, with the spire/echo mechanism paying off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The canyon’s echoes and bone towers aren’t just decor; they function to refract her poetry and generate visions, charging the final image at the spire. Sensory selection is intentional (forged hush, mist) and POV‑filtered. World rules stay consistent and learned through action. One notch shy of 9+ due to occasional emblematic phrasing over tactile constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres: the looming dawn and intensified refractions force a stance shift from playful defiance to burdened readiness. The thickening mist/visions serve as the meaningful deepening. Cost is stated and felt, though largely internal and quiet. A single sharper on‑page test of her resolve would have pushed this higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness‑as‑refraction is integrated through recurring images and the spire’s response, but several lines verge on thesis statements (“To forgive is to fracture the heart’s hard stone,” “the price is the self”). The final declaration of freedom flirts with moralizing. Still, the closing image reweights prior material without neat absolution of consequences. Resonance lingers, but subtlety wavers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is controlled, with diction and rhythm matching Elara’s artistic temperament. The poetry lines modulate tone without breaking stance. No head‑hopping or register drift, and patterning (echo/refraction) is taught and sustained. Minor grandness does not undercut clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft shows strong rhythm and image density; most sentences do multiple jobs. A touch of purple (“stream carving bone,” stacked refractive metaphors) risks saturation but stays legible. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum holds. The occasional aphoristic line trims the top end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of a “forged hush” canyon with a refraction‑based absolution ritual feels fresh and coherent. The pale spire as a refractive instrument is a smart, specific choice. Emotional truth (cost of surrendering innocence) grounds the conceit. Not groundbreaking, but distinctly realized.</comment>
