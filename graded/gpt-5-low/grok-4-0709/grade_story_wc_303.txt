<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s want-versus-duty conflict is clear and active, and her micro-choices (coffee ritual, cutting the fern, drawing the bow) align with that pressure. The interiority stays character-specific via tactile rituals, though it leans summary-lyric rather than embodied contradiction at peak beats. The cost—accepting a reshaped life within the empire rather than pure freedom—lands but feels cushioned. Still, actions proceed credibly from her motives without safety hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the causal chain reads clean: waning amulet clock → coffee augury → fern plea → violin act → propagation → renewed amulet. Closure arrives on the page through her decision and act (playing the violin and propagating), with a legible before/after. The felt cost is modest but present in the accepted compromise. The lens reads Hybrid with causal dominance, held consistently through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The velvet observatory and greenhouse annex are vivid and purpose-driven: drapes modulate light and mood; the annex intensifies the plant telepathy; the amulet and violin function as charged micro-settings. Sensory detail is selective and aligned with Elara’s professional and personal biases. Environment and objects constrain/enable tactics (telepathic pressure in the annex; the violin’s specific properties). The final image is charged by these spaces and tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are explicit early and the clock tightens options. The coffee augury reweights choices, and picking up the violin is a genuine narrowing moment. The price—a compromised dream—reads, but its bite is softened by the “have both” solution in perforations. Tension escalates coherently to the act, though with limited visceral resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Propagation and perforation entwine into a coherent theme about reshaping, not erasing, fate. The fern’s plea and the coffee-stain iconography return with reweighted meaning at the end. Occasional explicitness (“she understood”) blunts subtext slightly, but the final image earns resonance without prescribing a moral. The compromise feels thematically honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically unified, with a distinct lexicon (mulberry, velvet, crystal) that matches POV and world. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or stance drift. Quoted plant speech is integrated and purposeful. Rhythm modulates appropriately around the decisive act.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines carry good density and momentum with minimal scaffolding; key images do double duty. The diction tilts purple at times with repeated color/emotion pairing (“mulberry ache”), mildly diluting peak sharpness. Figurative logic holds, and syntax varies, keeping the beat moving. Minor redundancy and lushness keep it shy of top-tier polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ice-crystal violin that perforates destiny, coffee-stain augury, and plant telepathy synthesize into a fresh, specific system of action and meaning. The propagation-with-coffee-grounds turn feels inventive and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are coherent and not gimmicky. The emotional calculus is familiar (duty vs desire) but rendered with distinct objects and tactics.</comment>
