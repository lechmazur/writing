<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent drive to reclaim erased identity through tactile memory “textures” gives the POV specificity. Interiority is sensorially rich and character‑particular, especially at the poison label reveal. However, micro-choices under pressure are limited to attention and collection; contradictory impulses surface only lightly. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but carries modest on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a tide‑timed mosaic of overheard fragments culminates in a resonant reconfiguration where namelessness becomes a tool. Orientation is clear early (port, containers, tides), and the poison label turn binds backstory to present tactics. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise with the talisman and readiness to continue. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, readable but soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The port labyrinth is vivid, tactile, and functional: tides flood paths, containers offer concealment and vantage, and ambient labor noise feeds the method. The poison label as recurring object charges the final image. Sensory detail spans sound, texture, smell, and taste, filtered by the POV’s synesthetic bias. Setting reliably guides choices rather than decorating them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuilding a self against erasure) is clear and coherently pressured by the environment and found relic. The meaningful tightening arrives with the poison label and the fisherwoman’s line, deepening the tapestry. Still, stakes escalate atmospherically more than via narrowing options, and the price paid remains largely internal. Tension works, but it never truly corners the protagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Erased histories and nameless identity accrue through concrete particulars (dockworker’s tale, locket, swallowed village) and reweight at the end. The poison label’s bitterness braided into “salty resilience” gives an earned, non‑didactic resonance. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“nameless identity became a strength”), slightly reducing subtextual charge. Overall, the thematic weave is strong and coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical voice with a distinct perceptual signature (colors bleeding into sounds, textures of memory). POV distance and stance remain stable; overheard snippets are clean and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with tides, though diction sometimes leans repetitive in motif phrasing. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful imagery integrated into action. A few phrases skirt purple/prolixity and motif reiteration, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Syntax varies and the final image lands cleanly. Minimal scaffolding or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The administrative death error, port‑labyrinth mosaic method, and poison‑label talisman synthesize into a fresh texture. Tidal cadence as structural engine feels organic rather than gimmicky. The concept isn’t unprecedented, but execution is distinctive and coherent. Risk‑taking in lyric accumulation pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
