<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (reviving the orchard and answering the karmic debt) is clear and sustained, with embodied costs (fatigue, yearning) that complicate his drive. His micro-choices—heeding her guidance, channeling the bead—track with his contradictions. The ghost bride has distinctive presence and pressure in brief dialogue. Some emotional shorthand repeats (“mournful elation,” “lovingly venomous”), flattening nuance at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative cadence: recurring cameos logically escalate the bead’s charge and the orchard’s awakening, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration (night shatters; debt repaid) with felt loss. Orientation is early and clean; causal links remain intact. The closure image bears cost (her dissolution; his sapped strength). The throughline is simple but tight for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse under endless night is vivid and consistently filtered through Elias’s work, not just scenic. Environment and objects (greenhouse shelter vs. lethal frost; the bead) shape tactics and the final image. Sensory specificity is strong without museum‑tour excess. It stops just shy of 9+ because constraints are more atmospheric than tactically binding on-page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the start (repay the debt/awaken life), and pressure builds via pattern: each cameo widens the awakening and deepens the cost. Agency skews toward guided cooperation rather than hard tradeoffs; still, the final act through the bead narrows options decisively and exacts a price. The toll on Elias’s body and the permanent farewell land. Slight passivity prevents a higher tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Debt, love-as-poison, and healing-with-cost interlock through particulars (toxic blossoms, sapping visits, the final release). The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing; the “mournful elation” paradox accrues meaning. Subtext coheres with the bead as a conduit across lifetimes. Repetition of the theme phrase is a touch on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close holds steady; diction and rhythm fit the gothic-alchemical mood. Dialogue is sparse but consequential and subtextual. Recurrent phrasing risks monotony but remains legible and purposeful. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately at turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line craft is vivid and generally precise, with strong image economy. However, stacked modifiers and repeated coinages (“ephemeral cameo,” “mournful elation,” “lovingly venomous”) produce light paraphrase loops and purple overtones in the middle section. Momentum holds; clarity survives the ornament. Tightening repetitions would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost‑bride debt is familiar, but the alchemical orchard, bead mechanics, and “resonant awakenings” synthesize into a fresh texture. The final reconfiguration feels earned. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. A slightly more surprising tactical turn from Elias could lift originality further.</comment>
