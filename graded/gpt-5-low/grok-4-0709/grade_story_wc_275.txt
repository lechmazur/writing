<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist resolve and “senseless perception” cohere into motivated choices (repurposing the sandbag into a sheath, vowing to encase violence). Interiority is specific to her vocation and history with her father, with embodied action (pruning, whispering to roses) revealing values. Internal contradiction is present but gentle—steadfast pacifism under threat rather than sharp ambivalence—limiting peak complexity. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned with a modest felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats progress cleanly: discovery → interpretation → transformation into sheath → recommitment in action. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the sheathing act reconfigures her stance with the “muffling” effect and a framed vow. Cost is evident conceptually (foregoing father’s legacy; accepting vigilance), though not acutely dramatized. Orientation is clear early (dome, desert roses, tower’s fall) and held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass‑domed rose farm is vivid and constraining; the dome’s protection and the sandstorms outside shape tactics and charge the final image. Object‑as‑setting works: the sheath/trowel under the dome’s “tranquil blaze” grounds atmosphere and action. Details are selective through a horticultural POV, avoiding touristic cataloguing. World rules feel consistent and learned by observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (weaving continuity through chaos) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when she decides to make and use the sheath rather than treat the scrap as debris. Pressure remains largely internal and situational; no antagonist and limited visible price keep escalation gentle. The final choice forecloses violent options symbolically and credibly. A slightly sharper external test would heighten consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of pacifism, transformation, and continuity arise from concrete acts (repurposing wreckage, pruning, whisper‑teaching plants). “Engraved quiet” refracts into ethic and tactic, culminating in a resonant image that reweights the world’s noise. A few lines verge on thesis (“to weave continuity through chaos”) but are supported by scene work. The ending lingers without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third maintains a distinct perceptual signature (horticultural attention, rune‑listening). Rhythm modulates with gentle intensification around the crafting and vow. No head‑hopping or stance slips; diction matches the character’s contemplative mode. The lyric register brushes purple at times but remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean and image‑dense with purposeful repetition of motifs (quiet, blaze, weaving). Occasional abstraction (“senselessly perceptive,” “engraved quiet suggested a way”) nudges toward overwriting but does not blur sense. Momentum holds; sentences do multiple jobs without scaffolding loops. Final cadence lands crisply on charged images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑collapse horticulture, pacifist craft, and a talismanic “engraved quiet”—feels fresh and cohesive. Repurposing wreckage into a peace‑tool is an elegant, non‑obvious turn that recharges prior material. Risks in tone and concept are taken without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity keeps the piece from feeling templated.</comment>
