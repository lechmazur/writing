<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (to touch the “texture of time”) drives choices, and panic vs. obsession creates credible internal tension. Embodied reactions (trembling, knees buckling, vines at ankles) keep emotions on the body. The decisive tactic grows from his vocation, revealing character under pressure. A touch of abstraction in peak beats slightly blunts interior contradiction’s bite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: fragment → retrocognitive trap → escalating visions → profession‑rooted tactic → disintegration with cost. Orientation is swift and stable; single scene coherence holds. Closure is a decisive change with a felt price (fragment lost, echoes fading). Minor hand‑waviness in the mechanics is counterbalanced by early seeding and consistent rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly realized and functionally engaged (breathing bridges, vines anchoring his body). The environment charges the finale and subtly constrains action. Details are purposefully filtered through Elias’s mind and craft. A slight bias toward visual lyricism leaves a few sensory registers underused.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape the retrocognitive trap without losing the self’s aim) is legible early and tightens as visions intensify and the fragment heats. The key turn is agency‑driven: he applies hyperbolic geometry to force a rupture. The cost (sacrifice of the fragment and relinquished access to the past) lands on the page. Stakes could sharpen further with one more concrete external constraint beyond the fragment’s escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Obsession with time’s rough weave vs. the price of touching it emerges organically from action and images. The final smile toward a new maze reads as a repricing: knowledge gained, artifact lost, echoes fading—no moralizing. Recurring “fading photograph” imagery deepens the theme without announcing it. A hair more ambiguity around the ethical calculus of breaking the fragment could have added depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and image patterning. Voice feels particular to a designer‑mind perceiving curvature and pattern under stress. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Occasional density spikes risk purple but do not obscure focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is musical and mostly efficient, with images doing double duty for mood and mechanism. However, figurative density runs high in peak beats (“fading photographs,” “fracturing the air into hyperbolic patterns”), edging toward lushness that could be trimmed for punch. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep momentum intact. The final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Using hyperbolic geometry as a literal escape from a retrocognitive loop in a living bridge garden feels fresh and integrated. The shard’s disintegration as the price for time’s “texture” synthesizes concept and character. Risks in diction and concept cohere rather than read as gimmick. A whisper of familiar visionary tropes remains but is substantially transformed by the mathematical tactic.</comment>
