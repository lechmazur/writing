<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—save her family orchard—drives every action and keeps her choices coherent under time pressure. Interiority is present (heartbeat, nausea, visions of the failing grove) but remains surface-level; we don’t see contradictory impulses complicating key beats. Competence dominates with little visible flaw or self‑conflict. The final resolve feels earned but emotionally tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: inversion hits → follows water → grotto → relic → escape as gravity normalizes. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the live clock supports momentum. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (she secures the relic that can save the orchard), though on‑page cost is moderate and convenience edges in at the relic’s appearance. The causal lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, and hour-long gravity inversion are vivid and integral to tactics (water‑flow navigation, inverted flight) and the final escape. Sensory detail is purposeful, especially the “whirling silence” that shapes behavior and tone. World rules are taught through action rather than dumped. Environment constrains choices and charges the last image of return with the relic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres under the inversion clock and hazardous arches. The key tightening arrives with the hidden grotto and the waning hour, plus collapsing arches on exit. Costs remain light—no sacrifice beyond risk and urgency—so the climax reads more as smooth retrieval than hard trade‑off. Still, agency drives each turn and the time constraint sharpens decisions.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resilience and stewardship emerge through the echoes’ legacy and the growth‑arrow’s history, linking personal need to planetary caretaking. The “gathering of echoes” adds a graceful, nonliteral layer without sermonizing. Thematic resolution is a touch neat, with minimal ambiguity or price. The final promise of renewal resonates but doesn’t reprice the premise with a palpable cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third‑person limited is steady and confident, with a consistent lyric tone keyed to “whirling silence.” Diction and rhythm are controlled; no head‑hopping or stance slips. While polished, the voice could cut deeper into idiosyncratic perception under stress. The modulation from tense navigation to release on exit is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are clear and propulsive, with vivid images (“rivers cascading upward,” “liquid silver”) that mostly serve function. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing keep momentum. Occasional lushness skirts purple but doesn’t blur sense. The final cadence lands without scaffold or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The gravity‑inversion hour, water‑flow navigation, and orchard‑pilot premise feel fresh in synthesis. The echoes as silent vibrations and the growth‑arrow relic are imaginative and coherent with the world’s rules. Resolution leans familiar (quest → find boon → return) but the specifics keep it distinctive. Risk‑taking is present in concept more than in moral calculus or cost.</comment>
