<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elias’s resolve and renunciation are clear, with a brief, credible temptation by the bottle. Interiority favors summary over scene, limiting contradictory impulses beyond that single pull. The endurance choice (rejecting false comfort, committing to labor) lands and feels earned. Greater on‑page struggle or a costlier micro‑loss would deepen him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: beach temptation → laboratory conception → lantern lit → returners arrive. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: a real flame inaugurates a non‑wish path with visible cost (solitude, labor). Some middle beats are summarized (“hours turned to days”), slightly softening causal tightening. Orientation is strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Paper‑Lantern Cove feels specific and atmospheric, with lanterns and sea rhythm filtered through Elias’s purpose. The amber bottle and lanterns function as charged objects; the final image (real flame) reweights prior illusions. Detail remains selective and purposeful. A bit more environmental constraint on tactics (beyond symbol) could push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—authentic revival vs. wish‑mirage—is clear, and the meaningful turn is the refusal plus the lantern‑lighting. Pressure escalates modestly; much of the “work” is summarized rather than tested by obstacles. The cost is legible but not sharply priced on the page. One concrete setback would have tightened stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—rejecting illusion for communal labor—emerges through the bottle/lantern counterpoint and the final real flame. Occasional didactic lines (“No more reliance on wishes”) flatten subtext. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer via action, not moral statement. Greater ambiguity about risk or relapse could deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective alchemist. Rhythms modulate between atmosphere and resolve, with clean stance and distance. Some abstraction creeps in during planning passages but remains legible. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and musical with strong images (“lanterns like forgotten dreams”), and the final line lands clean. There’s mild repetition and abstraction in the planning stretch and a few summary redundancies. Figurative language remains coherent and mostly economical. Line‑level propulsion dips slightly during expository compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of alchemy with civic revival via “working memory” is a fresh angle on genie lore. The amber bottle as a sealed illusion contrasted with a real flame is an elegant inversion. Some elements—ghost town, returning townsfolk—track familiar patterns. Still, the conceptual pivot toward methodical, communal making feels genuinely specific.</comment>
