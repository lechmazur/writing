<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—reclaiming purpose and decoding her grandmother’s legacy—and her micro-choices (studying frost, selecting the brightest path, opening the box) align. The interiority is concrete if somewhat uniform, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The adaptive trait shows through action more than label, though the arc edges toward tidy resolution. Emotional texture is embodied (cold, breath, scorch memory) without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture that culminates in a causal discovery: overlaying frost with ledger routes leads to the crevice and box. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the legacy reframes from smuggling to transmutation into art. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (scars, renunciation of prior certainty) rather than materially legible, but sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the single scene holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon and frost do real work: the environment constrains choice (frost as cipher, dawn as a timer) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (crystalline veins, breath, chill) and character-filtered through a glass artist’s eye. World rules are consistent and integrated through action. The setting’s specificity elevates the thematic turn without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering legacy/purpose—tightens as dawn sharpens the frost and narrows her route to the crevice. The escalation is modest but coherent under the hybrid lens, driven by her attention and retracing choice. The visible price is light; the piece leans on internal reweighting rather than a hard trade-off. Still, the discovery credibly resolves the pressure without coincidence doing the work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Recurring images (frost, light, charcoal) build an organic theme of transmutation and finding meaning “in the pauses.” However, the explicit moralizing (“not of smuggling’s darkness, but of transforming hardship into art” and the grandmother’s didactic note) reduces subtext. The ending offers a resonant answer, but it risks neatness over ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect remains, if slightly curated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in craft (glass, light, pattern). Rhythm modulates between hush and small surges during the trek. Minor diction repetition (“drifting resonance,” “pauses”) but no head-hopping or stance slips. The elision of backstory is controlled and paid off in the discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lines are clear and carry momentum; syntax varies and images mostly earn their keep. There is some redundancy and purple tint (recurrent abstractions like “drifting resonance” and “purpose”) that could be trimmed for density. Figurative logic holds; no coherence breaks, but a few sentences paraphrase adjacent content. Final image lands cleanly without line-level clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frost-as-cipher tied to smuggling and a glass artist’s lineage feels fresh and integrated. The box discovery reframes the premise in a non-obvious but prepared way. Risks are lyrical rather than structural; they pay off without gimmick. Some motifs are familiar, yet the synthesis is specific and memorable.</comment>
