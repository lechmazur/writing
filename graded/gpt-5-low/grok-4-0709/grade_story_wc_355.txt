<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s pacifism and mission to “catalog the varieties of silence” are clear and embodied through tactile actions and sensory thinking. His emotional throughline—tears at the brother’s pain, refusal to escalate—reads specific rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is light; he rarely struggles against an opposing impulse, so the choice at the end feels more confirmation than rupture. Still, his micro-choices at the dials and his listening ethic credibly earn the final forgiveness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a mounting sequence of tuned silences—betrayal, loneliness—culminates in the brother’s confession and a reweighted final image with fireworks. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s listening retrieves a confession and reframes his peace as empathic attunement rather than avoidance. Cost is emotional and relational, legible in tears and the mended rift; modest but sufficient at this length. Orientation is crisp early; single-scene coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop, lantern glow, and star-shot quiet are sensorially rich and integral: the resonator and clasp function as micro-setting tools that shape tactics. The “final stillness before fireworks” materially supports the method and charges the ending image. Details are POV-filtered (“frayed velvet,” “moth wings”) and evolve with action. Environment and objects constrain choice and power the closure, meeting the 9-band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether the clasp will yield its embedded memories, escalating via successive frequencies and specific “silences” that deepen stakes. The lock’s tremble and yield provide a tangible tightening. Opposition is gentle—more attunement than resistance—so the felt price leans inward rather than tactical. Even so, the accumulation makes the final forgiveness credible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—empathy through listening to silence—emerges organically from events and recurring images. Yet it’s at times over-declared (“teaching pacifism through the art of listening,” “empathy bloomed not in confrontation”), muting subtext in peak beats. The fireworks and clasp reprise do meaningful work, but some final-paragraph moralizing dilutes resonance. The emotional aftertaste remains warm and specific despite the overt statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice’s “theatrical sincerity” is consistent and character-specific, with controlled cadence and image selection. Lexicon matches Elias’s cultivated, ritualistic sensibility, and the single quoted line from the brother lands with clarity. No head-hopping or stance slips; distance modulation supports pressure. Slight tendency toward ornament does not obscure focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and largely efficient; metaphors tend to be coherent and sensorially grounded (“moth wings against glass,” “frayed velvet”). Momentum persists despite lyric density, and sentences vary rhythmically. A few lines risk purple or thematic telling, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially through the tuning sequence. No noticeable loops or scaffold clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Recovering a brother’s confession by “tuning the silences” of a diary clasp via a resonator is a fresh, integrated concept. The synthesis of pacifism, sound-as-color, and performative gentleness feels singular rather than gimmicky. The fireworks cadence reweights the premise elegantly. Minor on-the-nose thematics prevent the leap to the very top tier.</comment>
