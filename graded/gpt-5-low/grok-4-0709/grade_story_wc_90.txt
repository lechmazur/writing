<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifism, merged consciousness, and shadow work create a coherent, motivated interior with credible contradictions (urge to mend vs. suppressed rage). Her micro-choices (refusal to strike, choosing to stitch) align with traits and reveal hierarchy of values. Embodiment via buoyancy/haptics with relics is strong, though the integration of her rage and loneliness resolves a touch smoothly for maximal cost. Still, the final renunciation feels earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, each stitch intensifies the pattern toward the portal’s opening, culminating in an on-page decisive change. Orientation is clear early: ship, archive, relics, task. The cost is primarily emotional (confronting grief/anger/loneliness) and is paid through action; it lands but could feel weightier. Causality stays intact with set-ups (photos/tear/console) paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Elysium’s salvage architecture, archive room, encoded tears, and gravity systems are vivid and filtered through Lira’s priorities. The environment and objects meaningfully shape tactics (zero-g buoyancy, console, stasis vault) and charge the final image. Detail selection is economical and purposeful, avoiding tourist cataloging. World rules (tear, shimmer decoding) hold consistently through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (open the sanctuary dimension), and pressure coheres as the stitching accrues toward a final consolidation. The tightening is clear when the last photograph/self-portrait seals the shadow work and reweights options. The felt price is mostly interiorized and could show one sharper loss or risk to heighten consequence. Even so, escalation reads via cadence/intensity increase rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Compassion versus repression, pacifism’s solitude, and integration are rendered through concrete images (tears-as-archives, stitching as healing). Recurrences meaningfully shift by the end (photos become a map; buoyancy becomes passage). One line (“I will not strike”) flirts with thesis-stating but is otherwise earned by the pattern. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a “spectral intelligence” POV; diction and rhythm reinforce the ghostly resolve. Psychic distance modulates cleanly during peak beats without head-hopping. Expository lines are integrated into action rather than standing apart. Minor elevated phrasing never breaks plausibility for this narrator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is controlled, image-rich, and avoids loops; most sentences carry dual duty (world + emotion/action). Figurative motifs (shimmer, stitch, buoyancy) repeat purposefully rather than decoratively. A few phrases edge toward purple but do not blur causality or dull the closure image. Rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: encoded tear-residue photographs, a pacifist who heals by stitching, happiness-linked buoyancy, Kwan Yin’s tear as tool. Turns grow from established rules, not late conveniences. The vision is coherent and risk-embracing without gimmickry. Only the lightness of cost keeps it from an even higher band.</comment>
