<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—redemption by binding ideals to action—is clear and consistently drives her choices. The internal conflict (guilt vs. resolve) is present but largely summarized rather than dramatized under immediate pressure. Embodied emotion lands in the siphoned vitality and dimmed eyes, but earlier beats lean on declarative framing. The “operatively gentle” trait informs her method credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the causal chain is clean: alignment → ritual → spirits → oaths → price paid → treaty bound. Closure lands on the page with cost (life-force siphoned) and a clear before/after. The structure is single-scene, tight, and purpose-driven, though the middle lacks a complicating turn from the spirits. The lens reads as Causal with a lyric surface and holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting and objects are vivid and purposeful: terrace runes, incense, marble altar, and celestial alignment are integrated into action. The environment/time actively constrain choice (midsummer alignment, midpoint of the dance) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity balances sight with scent and touch. It’s lush without drifting into museum-tour listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are legible and contained: end the forever war by binding a treaty at personal cost. Pressure coheres and tightens up to the muster and sacrifice, but opposition is soft—spirits assent without resistance, trimming tension. The visible price at climax clarifies consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs with the siphoning, but no strong reversal tests her commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of redemption’s cost and “flawed beauty” recur through image (runes, imperfect sky) and the binding of life-force to treaty. Resonance is tangible at the ending, but some lines state theme directly (“promising a flawed but beautiful peace”), reducing subtext. The clipboard-as-relic nicely marries word to deed. The piece invites reflection on means vs. ends without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The elevated, lyric third-person is steady and confident, with controlled cadence and image systems. POV distance remains consistent; no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Diction fits the ceremonial mood without register collapse. Minor risk of tonal sameness is mitigated by rhythmic variation at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished, often doing double duty (world + theme), with only occasional near-purple flourishes. A few motif echoes (“flawed beauty,” celestial dance) verge on repetition, but clarity and momentum persist. Strong verbs and concrete nouns carry most lines; the final image is clean. No material scaffold or cadence loops that blunt the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A peace treaty bound by a negotiator’s life-force via an ebony clipboard relic and mustered war-leaders is a distinctive synthesis. The ritualized diplomacy angle feels fresh, though familiar tropes (alignment, incense, runes) soften novelty. The cost architecture and object use are integrated rather than ornamental. It’s confident, if not boundary-breaking.</comment>
