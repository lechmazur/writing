<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—seeking the “sound of approaching endings”—is clear and escalates from euthanasia intent to acceptance via volunteering. Embodied details (parasol tip probing ice, retrieving a child’s toy) reveal character under pressure. The contradiction between her former desire to die and present-purpose endurance is credible and earned. A touch of abstract phrasing blurs edges of peak feelings but doesn’t undercut the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the marina work, capsize, and gale layer pressure until a charged poise moment where patience “folds” into acceptance. Closure lands on the page with a reweighted final image (wind as solace; parasol tip as talisman) and a felt cost (renouncing the sought exit, living with altered perception). Orientation is clean early; the scene window is continuous with one intensifying transition to the storm night. The cost could be marginally sharper in concrete consequence, but the RR is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina is vivid and purposive; weather, floes, and soundscape shape tactics (probing ice, timing, boat capsize risk). Sensory detail is varied (salt, ozone, groans, wind) and filtered through Elara’s altered hearing. The heirloom tip functions as micro‑setting/tool, charging the final image. Minor lyric flourish never detaches from the physical world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent: will she surrender to death or reconfigure her relation to endings. Pressure tightens via the capsize and gale, culminating in a stance crystallization at the edge of the marina. Agency is quiet but real—continuing to trawl, interpret omens, and choose ongoing service—foreclosing the prior path. The price is primarily internal; a small concrete loss or trade-off would heighten it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endings reinterpreted from dread to solace through labor, listening, and inherited fragility (lace/ice). The “fold in patience” reframes waiting vs. acceptance without moralizing. The final image conceptually reprices the premise—wind as the “sound of endings” becomes comfort. Resonance lingers, with ambiguity about sanity integrated rather than explained away.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A steady close third with a distinct lyric sensibility; diction and rhythm align with Elara’s altered perception. The voice modulates under pressure (storm night intensifies cadence) without head‑hopping or register slips. No dialogue needed; imagery carries subtext. Occasional elevated turns are earned by tone and never claim knowledge beyond POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are clean and propulsive with high information density; images often do double duty (parasol tip as action and symbol). Minimal scaffolding; repetition feels patterned, not redundant. A few phrases edge toward purple (“trawling truths”), but clarity holds, including at closure. Rhythm varies and punctuation supports breath without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: euthanasia tourism colliding with Arctic disaster relief and a lace parasol tip as tactile divining rod. The “sound of endings” motif feels non‑obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and premise cohere without gimmickry. It stops short of radical structural innovation, but the vision is singular.</comment>
