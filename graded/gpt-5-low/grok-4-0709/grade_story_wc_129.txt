<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lirah’s desire to “graft” into the community is clear and enacted through concrete choices (proposing the search, comforting others, teaching reed markers, dedicating the arbor). Interiority is largely rendered through lyrical image rather than contradictory impulses in scene, so the internal conflict feels gentle rather than pressurized. Her final integration reads earned but low‑cost. The character specificity (marsh‑reed craft, tactile gestures) is strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the communal search densifies until the full tag completes and the belonging stakes reweight. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when distinct), and the closure lands on‑page with a communal embrace plus the dedicatory act. Cost is present but soft—peril and ache more suggested than dramatized through concrete loss. Structure holds with a clean final cadence shift into the arbor dedication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater provide vivid, specific sensory anchors that shape action (perilous edges, fumes) and supply resources (obsidian shards). The environment constrains choices during the search and charges the final image via the arbor’s material and form echoing the tag. Details feel POV‑filtered through a sculptor’s eye. World rules (nonverbal communication) are shown, not told to excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) is clear and tight; the hesitation→search→assembly progression offers one meaningful deepening. Escalation is more communal ritual than pressure, with limited concrete jeopardy or trade‑offs on the page. The turn at the rim when the tag completes narrows options thematically but without a palpable sacrifice. Tension exists but stays gentle and luminous rather than cutting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory, belonging through art, and ache transformed into strength arise organically from events and images (reeds, tag, arbor). Subtext works through gesture and ritual rather than overt statement, though a few lines verge on thesis (“beyond lost murmurs into enduring connection”). The final image reweights prior motifs effectively. The piece avoids platitudes for the most part, retaining a credible emotional afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is controlled, consistent, and suits the fable‑like register; it modulates with the journey’s glow without head‑hopping. Diction matches the invented world’s feel and stays coherent. Narrative certainty remains within a plausible focalization. Elision is purposeful and the rhythm is confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with strong imagery and purposeful rhythm; most sentences carry multiple jobs. There is some repetition and ornament (“luminescent ache,” glow‑veins, shimmer) that edges toward purple and dampens momentum slightly. Clarity remains high and there are no major loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final lines land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑linguistic community, street‑artist tag as kinship map, obsidian arbor—feels fresh and specific. While the arc (outsider seeks belonging) is familiar, execution through tactile art and nonverbal ritual makes it distinctive. Turns grow from established particulars rather than late rule changes. It takes tasteful risks without obscuring coherence.</comment>
