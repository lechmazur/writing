<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to salvage something pure”—is clear and consistent, and her choice to reveal the truth gently aligns with her core trait. Interiority is specific (windows of connection, careful weaving) but her struggle remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized under pressure. The emotional cost for descendants is acknowledged but not embodied on the page. Competence dominates over contradiction, limiting depth of inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp, and the accumulative build—shrine → globe → visions → log → plan—holds coherence. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she commits to a method that preserves fragile peace while exposing injustice. The cost is present but soft, more conceptual than felt on the page. Causality is clean with no major gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and candles are vivid and purposeful, with the melted snow globe functioning as a charged micro‑setting/tool. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s priorities, sustaining the “borrowed starlight” tone. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain options, it meaningfully charges the action and final image. World rules (ghosts, dream windows) remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (expose truth without harm) are signaled early, and escalation arrives with the visions revealing the captain’s concealed log. There is a meaningful tightening via the choice of method (guided dream sessions), but resistance is minimal and largely internalized. Costs remain implied rather than tested on the page. Tension is steady but rarely spikes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image—purity salvaged from wreckage, borrowed light, careful truth-telling. The final image (aurora, globe secured) reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. A few explanatory lines edge toward telling, but overall the resonance holds. Ambiguity around cost and impact on descendants keeps the piece reflective rather than tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias, avoiding register drift. No dialogue, but the diction and rhythm carry pressure with clarity. Patterned motifs (“borrowed starlight,” windows/lens) are sustained without obscuring sense. Psychic distance remains stable and apt for the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, controlled, and image‑dense with good sentence variety; metaphors cluster but stay coherent to the ice/star/light lexicon. Minimal redundancy and clear sequencing maintain momentum. Occasional abstract phrasing (“weave the truth carefully”) is grounded by tactile detail (globe’s chill, candle sputter). Line‑level craft supports, rather than smothers, the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck-diver medium using a melted snow globe to parse dream cameos in a glacier shrine—is fresh and specific. The investigative method through strangers’ dreams feels inventive and thematically consonant. Risk is taken in a quiet, accumulative structure that privileges texture and concept. Slight safety in the conflict’s smoothness keeps it just shy of the exceptional tier.</comment>
