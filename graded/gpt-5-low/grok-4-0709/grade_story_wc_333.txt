<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—freeing Mira’s shelved idea to mend his own rift—and his micro-choices (waiting for the star, offering the hair) align under pressure. Interiority is present but often abstract; contradictory impulses surface lightly (hesitation vs. bold action) without deep friction. The cost—relinquishing the last tangible remnant of Mira—reads, though it’s handled gently. He remains somewhat archetypal, limiting the depth of internal conflict at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a hybrid with accumulative dominance, the causal chain is clean: first star → vision → interpretive key → offering → portal. Closure lands on the page with cost (surrendering the lock of hair) and a meaningful reconfiguration (fear reframed as cocoon, idea freed). Orientation is strong and single-scene; scope and beats fit the length. The escalation is smooth but modest, relying on lyric intensification more than narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nexus under starlight is vivid and task-relevant: arches, a central stone, and pooled starlight directly shape the act of placing the hair. Specific sensory choices (liquid-silver starlight, twisting arches) align with mood and function. World rules emerge through observation without exposition burdens. The environment charges the final image and tactically enables the unlocking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate the trapped idea/bridge the rift) is signaled early and tightened by the star’s arrival and the disorienting vortex. The decisive offering forecloses a path (keeping the keepsake) and yields the portal; cost is felt but not harrowing. Internal/external pressures interweave, though opposition is mostly atmospheric rather than resisting. Tension builds credibly if gently under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of courage transforming fear and love as a bridge emerge coherently through images (hair to starlight web). The line “secrets were not barriers but cocoons” edges into explicit thesis, muting subtext. The final voice-only visitation offers a resonant answer—release rather than reunion—without mechanical moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lands, if a bit pristine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent close third with lyrical diction holds throughout; perception narrows under stress without head-hopping. Rhythmic control is steady, with elevated register fitting the mythic tone. Occasional abstract phrasing (“cosmic possibility”) risks airiness but doesn’t break stance. Dialogue is minimal and well-placed for impact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong image economy tied to action (starlight pooling, ribbon untying itself). Some purple-leaning abstractions and repeated cosmic diction add minor drag. Figurative language is mostly coherent, and sentence rhythm varies. No significant scaffolding or loops, though a touch more concrete embodiment at peaks would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise blends familiar mythic tropes with a precise object key and a star-signal method; integration feels organic. The “idea as cocoon” reframing is a neat conceptual turn, if a bit stated. Emotional truth reads clean, though the path is comparatively safe. Risk is moderate and coherent, not transformative.</comment>
