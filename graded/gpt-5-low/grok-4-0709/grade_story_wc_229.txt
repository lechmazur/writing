<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s motive is clear and consistent—prove whispers trump shouts and reach Mira—and his ritual choice aligns with it. Interiority is textured (the cork’s warmth, the moonless garden) but leans abstract in peak beats (“screaming tenderness”) rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. He faces little internal resistance once the dawn arrives, so the final embrace lacks a felt trade‑off beyond softened grief. The relationship beat at the end is moving but arrives pre‑earned rather than hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lens: Causal—he purifies intent via the cork, “beckons,” and Mira arrives under that logic. Orientation is sharp from the first lines (who/where/when), and the scene holds a single throughline to on‑page closure (Mira’s return). The decisive change lands, but cost is light and obstacles are minimal, making the resolution feel relatively frictionless. Still, set‑ups (cork, night garden, vibrations) pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, broken heat wave, and dawn wind create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere that mirrors the purified intent. The vial cork functions as a micro‑setting object charged into the final image. Environmental pressure is suggestive rather than constraining—place frames mood more than tactics. Consistency and sensory selection are strong and character‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (reach Mira/prove method), but pressure never truly tightens—no counterforce tests his belief once the ritual begins. The sole turn is initiation of the beckoning; success follows without complication or visible price. Coincidence isn’t used; it’s just low‑resistance causality. The reunion is touching but under‑earned in escalation terms.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The theme—subtlety/whispered intent over brute force—is enacted through the ritual and the silent scent‑beckoning, and the ending image reaffirms it. However, it’s also stated outright several times, edging toward didactic (“whispers indeed traveled farther”). Subtext hums in the scent motif and the purified grief, but moral complexity is limited. The resonance lingers, if somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Steady close third with lyrical diction fits the material; imagery patterns (cobalt, night garden, scent) are consistent. A few lines slip toward purple or abstraction (“tone of screaming tenderness”), but overall rhythm and distance hold. No head‑hopping; certainty remains within what Elias can infer. The brief spoken line from Mira is clean and lands the core idea without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with strong sensory economy, though there are small redundancies and mixed intensifiers (“tender scream” used multiple times conceptually). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; momentum holds. Some scaffold-like assertions (“a testament to patience and purity”) could be trimmed to let images carry the weight. Final image is clear and well‑placed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A lighthouse ritual of purified intent via a charged cork and night‑bloom scent feels fresh and specific. The miraculous return is familiar, but the method and object mosaic give it individuality. Risk is moderate—lyric mode with magical causality—but coherent. A deeper cost or a kink in the ritual would have elevated ingenuity.</comment>
