<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s drive—freedom beyond enforced peace—reads vivid and coherent, and her contradiction (yearning for wildness while tethered to Marek) acts in scene. The scrimshaw-mediated confrontations show credible micro-choices (“Go then,” paired with his visible hurt) that force a costed decision. Emotional embodiment is specific (dock work, water at ankles), not label-only. Minor idealization smooths struggle, but the cost is still felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: coherent pressure accrues from whispers → confrontation → whale call, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change. Orientation is clear from the outset (dock, sublittoral fringe, lovers in conflict). The closure image—she transforms and departs while Marek holds the recharged talisman—lands with cost. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and sea tools (whale call, island, scrimshaw) are woven through action and culminate in a charged final image. Environment constrains choice: only in this liminal zone can the call materialize the island and enable the transformation. Details feel purposeful and filtered through Elara’s sea-bias. Vivid without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (leave/stay; self vs. bond) and tightens decisively at the whale’s call. Marek’s soft-grab and “Go then” force the trade-off, making the price explicit. The escalation is single-step but clean, with internal and external pressures braided. A second complicating beat could have deepened the squeeze, but the core turn holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of freedom versus imposed serenity and love’s letting-go emerge through particulars (combative tenderness, talisman unlocking guarded hearts) rather than moralizing. The final repricing—wild peace beyond calm—reweights the premise of “violence impossible” without sermon. Subtext in their dialogue and objects carries meaning. Slightly on-the-nose phrasing recurs, but resonance remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A lyrical yet controlled third-person close holds steady; diction suits the maritime world and Elara’s sensibility. Dialogue carries subtext and action (“Go then” as both permission and wound). Rhythm modulates well into the climax without head-hopping. A few repeated signature phrases verge on motif-stickiness but do not break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clear, musical, and efficient; images do double duty (scrimshaw as prop and emotional lever). Minimal redundancy; sentences propel rather than explain. Some heightened diction (“combative tenderness,” “sublittoral”) repeats and edges toward purple, but the prose remains legible under pressure. Closing cadence is earned and clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-violence world, scrimshaw unlocking hearts, whale-summoned vanishing island—feels fresh and coherent. The merfolk transformation trope gains specificity through the dock milieu and emotional economy. Turns arise from established elements rather than late rule drops. It’s bold without gimmickry.</comment>
