<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (grounding the spirits) is clear and deepened by her guilt and lineage, and her micro-choices (knot by knot, confession by confession) align with rising pressure. The internal contradiction—competence undercut by fear of unleashing unrest—reads credibly and surfaces at the climax when she admits her family’s role. Embodied perception (“storm seen through clear glass,” threads resisting) keeps emotion lived-in rather than labeled. The only soft note is how neatly her confession resolves guilt without lingering complication.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal spine: unraveling knots and staged disclosures therefore release voices, therefore force the final admission, therefore achieve settling. Closure lands on the page—the net dissolves, the mask mends—with legible cost (publicly owning family betrayal and her delay). Orientation is clean early and the throughline holds in one scene. Slight neatness at the end trims edge, but the decisive change is undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, starlight, net, and needle are vivid, integrated, and functionally implicated: prisms “amplify,” starlight disperses the hush, and the final image is charged by place. Detail selection tracks Elara’s priorities and profession without museum‑tour excess. World rules feel learned in action (net accumulates silence; unraveling releases it). Strong atmospheric cohesion without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressures tighten: each knot escalates from hush to voices to betrayal to self‑implication, culminating in the last knot choice. Agency drives turns; the confession is the price to unlock resolution. Cost is emotional and reputational rather than material, making the resolution feel a touch tidy. Still, the tightening is coherent and felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silence, inheritance, and truth as release emerge organically through the net’s properties and the ritual’s demands; the “interlaced hush” reweights meaning at the end. The final calm feels earned, not moralized, and the piece invites reflection on complicity versus duty. A hint more aftermath ambiguity could have deepened the resonance. Nonetheless, the symbolic system is coherent and active.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is consistent and tactile, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to prisms, threads, and hush. Minimal dialogue feels natural and purposeful, carrying subtext (confession as action). Diction is controlled despite elevation, staying plausible for this fable‑like register. Occasional phrase reuse (“lucid unrest”) reads as motif, not tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush but mostly disciplined; images do double duty (tool/workmanship and metaphysics) and momentum survives the density. Some repetition (“accumulated silence,” “interlaced hush”) skirts incantatory, but clarity holds and the cadence varies. No significant scaffold or paraphrase loops, and the final sentence lands cleanly. A few modifiers could be trimmed for sharper force at peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—mask restoration as spirit‑work via a silence‑absorbing net in a prismatic sanctuary—feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns arise from established properties and personal history rather than late rule drops. The angle on haunting (silence as tangible textile) is inventive without gimmickry. The resolution’s neatness slightly tempers radicality, but the vision is distinct.</comment>
