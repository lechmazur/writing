<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—resisting alien assimilation to study “the chemistry of homecoming”—is clear and propulsive, and her choices (designing the pilgrimage, following the footprints, accepting the amber) align. Internal conflict is present but mostly summarized; we don’t feel a sharp on‑page cost when her skepticism softens. Secondary characters apply light pressure without deep relational stakes. The shift reads earned but gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when land fast), and the accumulative structure coheres: footprints → convergence → artifact revelation → reframed understanding. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the amber recasts “homecoming” as biochemical inevitability with social cost. Coincidence (others arriving) complicates rather than resolves, appropriate to the lens. The turn is understated but legible and on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, spring light, and overgrown sculpture path are vivid and POV‑filtered, with weather and terrain shaping movement and mood. The footprints function as a micro‑setting constraint guiding choice; the tower and amber charge the final image. Sensory texture (rain patter, wet stone, bronze sheen) supports tone without feeling like a catalog. World rules (beacon tower, post‑contact tech) hold consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (reclaim belonging, resist assimilation) and the tightening arrives as unexpected convergence via footprints and the group at the tower. Pressure deepens rather than reverses; the cost is mostly conceptual (yielding some skepticism), with minimal on‑page jeopardy or trade‑off. The archivist’s reveal reweights options but doesn’t force a hard choice. Tension is steady, quiet, and coherent for the mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of return, integration, and engineered ritual interlock through particulars (footprints, relics of homecomings on statues, amber neurochemistry). The final repricing—“convergence wasn’t forced but inevitable”—resonates without moralizing, recasting both artificial and authentic pilgrimages. Motifs recur with escalating meaning (bronze quiet, rain, glow) and avoid didactic closure. The amber’s biochemical echo grounds abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is steady, lyrical, and character‑specific, with consistent diction (“bronze quiet,” “luminous skeptic”). Rhythm and sentence variety support the accumulative build; no head‑hopping or stance drift. A touch of conceptual phrasing appears, but it stays within the narrator’s idiom. Dialogue absence suits the mode and does not harm momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and purposeful; lines often do double duty (world + theme). Occasional repetition (“bronze quiet,” “luminous”) skirts purple but remains controlled and coherent. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies and carries momentum. The final image is crisp and recharged by objects and setting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Combining alien bio‑luminescence, a designed pilgrimage, dusty footprint convergence, and an amber/neurochemistry reveal feels fresh and integrated. The risk lies in the quiet, conceptual turn rather than spectacle, and it pays off. A few genre elements are familiar, but the synthesis reads personal and non‑obvious. Closure feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
