<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—hammered repose over fragile silence—is clear and drives her choices. Interiority is present but largely articulated through lyrical description rather than conflicting impulses under pressure. She reads highly competent, with little on‑page flaw or hesitation to complicate the ritual. The cost is mostly endurance, not a trade that forecloses a future option.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: intrusion → descent → ice‑reading → invocation → hush bloom. Orientation is solid early, and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—the caves recalibrated to a tempered peace—though the cost is more implied effort than a sharp on‑page price. No significant lens ambiguity or dropped setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harmonic caves, glacial chamber, and ripple‑marked floors are vivid and purposive, filtering through a professional’s eye. Environment and tools (ice cracks, echo stone) shape tactics and the final image. Sensory selection feels character‑driven, not touristic. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around subduing the beings’ cacophony; escalation tracks through the ritual’s stages until the storm meets the hush. The opposition is impersonal and mostly static, so the tightening relies on cadence and density rather than reversals. The price paid is stamina/focus, not a visible sacrifice that narrows future options. Still, the ritual choice credibly earns the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—peace as forged, not fragile—emerges through the craft sequence and the “bloom of hush” rather than mere assertion. One line edges toward thesis clarity (“true peace wasn’t fragile silence but a hammered repose”), but the final image reweights prior particulars effectively. The internal landscape realization aligns with action. Ambiguity persists in scale and consequence without muddying meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured lyric register suits the material. The perceptual signature—mapkeeper’s craft and acoustic bias—is distinct. Rhythm modulates from storm to tempered calm without head‑hopping or stance slips. A few elevated metaphors cluster but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with strong verbs and purposeful images; momentum rarely stalls. Occasional density of metaphor risks purple edges (“cacophony of storms,” “frozen lightning”) but coherence holds. Minimal scaffold or repetition; sentences generally do more than one job. The closing image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—ripple‑mark cartography, echo‑capturing stone, ice divination, and a conjured hush—feels fresh and integrated. The world’s acoustic logic meaningfully informs tactic and theme. Risk is contained but confident, prioritizing craft over spectacle. The final reconfiguration reads inevitable given the established tools.</comment>
