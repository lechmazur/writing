<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s drive—to quell inner static and save the farm—tracks cleanly to concrete choices (miniaturize, then burn). The embodied stakes (error codes, humming circuits, tactile work on the box) are strong, though contradictions under pressure are lightly sketched and she executes the plan with few stumbles. The willingness to damage the dome and leave reads as a credible cost. A touch more friction or misstep in the capture beat would deepen character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: geomagnetic reversal exacerbates inner static → fears leak → containment and controlled burn → escape. Closure is decisive and on the page, with cost (damage to dome, fire risk, departure) and a before/after in Elara’s integrated state. Lens: Causal, held through to the final image. The plan unfolds smoothly, bordering on convenient competence but stays earned by set‑ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dome, roses, and desert are vivid and constrain action: evacuation offline, desert lethal, micro‑fractures force an on‑site solution, and the burn uses the farm as tool. Sensory specificity (bioluminescent veins, humming box, fracture blooming) supports mood and tactics. World rules remain consistent and learned through events. Minor flourish risk but mostly purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens as the magnetic peak approaches and the dome fractures. The necessary two‑step solution (contain fears, then burn/launch) narrows options and demands a trade‑off (harm to the habitat vs. survival/mental integrity). Escalation reads because/therefore, though reversals are minimal and the success feels largely uncontested. The visible price charges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of inherited fear, containment-as-care, and integration land via particulars (neural-wood box, seed‑pod packets, controlled burn as transformation). The final image reweights the premise: fears become a bridge to empathy rather than a burden. A couple lines verge on tidy (“guardian of roses and remembrances”), but the resonance is earned through action. Ambiguity remains around future costs, which enriches the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third filtered through an android’s lyric yet tactile perception; no head‑hopping, no withheld facts. Rhythm modulates with pressure, with technical lexicon (subroutine, data packets) balanced by sensuous detail. No dialogue needed; narrative stance stays coherent. Occasional elevated diction risks floridness but aligns with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line work is clean and propulsive, with vivid images doing multiple jobs (fracture blooming, fears as sparks). Minor purple notes and abstraction (“inner static,” “contain chaos”) never cloud causality. No scaffold loops or cadence templates; syntax varies well. The prose sustains momentum through the peak without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: nostalgic android, bio‑engineered roses, magnetic reversal, and a neural‑wood fear box cohere into a distinct vision. The miniaturization/seed‑pod metaphor and controlled burn as escape are inventive and character‑driven. Risks are taken without gimmickry; the world feels singular. Small conveniences keep it shy of the very top tier.</comment>
