<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elowen’s motive and tactics are clear and consistent, with tactile touches like the ink stains grounding her resolve. However, interior contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers—so her endurance costs feel conceptual more than embodied. The library’s no‑violence constraint usefully channels her choices into subtlety. The final acceptance of ongoing vigil registers as an earned stasis but with limited personal price on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: library constraint → cryptic notes with rune → Vesper reads → rare alignment → his ritual backfires via seeded runes. Closure lands decisively as Vesper’s identity sunders; the cost is visible for him and conceptually borne by Elowen’s endless watch. Orientation is anchored early, and the lens stays causal through the climax. Minor summary drift keeps some beats at distance but doesn’t break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library’s rules, time‑bending skylight, and eternal stasis meaningfully shape tactics and the ending image. Details (luminous ivy, etched runes, suspended tomes) are vivid and purpose‑driven rather than touristic. The environment constrains violence and supplies the mechanism of downfall. Slight lyric excess prevents a full step higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>One dominant stake (unmask the pretender) tightens as the rune’s influence accumulates toward the alignment. The decisive turn—Vesper triggering a ritual that the planted runes corrupt—reads earned and protagonist‑driven. The price paid is clearest for Vesper; Elowen’s cost registers more as ongoing burden than a sharp loss. Still, the pressure coheres and escalates under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth slowly eroding illusion is embodied by the “rune of drift” and the library’s graceful decay; the final image of vigilant endurance reweights the cycle. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (ink, runes, constellations) rather than assertions. The piece invites reflection on power, legitimacy, and time’s solvent. Limited internal ambivalence restrains a deeper thematic bite.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, elevated lyric voice stays consistent and apt to the mythic frame. POV distance is steady; no head‑hopping or unjustified certainty. Cadence modulates enough to carry turns without becoming breathless. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong image economy; lines often do multiple jobs (world + tactic + tone). Some repetition (“pause of shifting constellations,” “graceful collapse”) and high figurative density flirt with overwrite but do not obscure sense. Rhythm varies and avoids template cadence. No notable scaffolding or clarity slips in the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The diminutive titan, iron gall ink, and “rune of drift” synthesize into a fresh engine for exposure without combat. The elegant decay aesthetic feels distinctive and integrated with tactic and closure. Risks are taken in tone and concept without losing clarity. A bit more embodied struggle would elevate distinctiveness further.</comment>
