<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are clear and consistent: a prudent deceiver determined to prove care over luck. Interiority is textured via the marbles and rituals, with embodied detail in his withered body and practiced hands. However, contradictory impulses rarely collide on the page; he faces little real doubt once his plan begins. The endurance feels earned but the personal cost is mostly social and underplayed in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with a causal spine: the staged surrender enables hidden tending, leading to the reveal and repricing of “luck.” Orientation is clean from the outset, and beats chain logically toward the winter-frost deadline. Closure lands with a on‑page reversal (Thorne’s collapse vs Elias’s reveal) and a conceptual reweighting. The cost at the end is more implied than felt, keeping it just short of top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden maze is specific and functional, supplying secrecy, routes, and a charged center where the reveal occurs. Vivid sensory texture (hedges, tendrils, wither/bloom) feels filtered through a gardener’s priorities. The amulets and village context integrate naturally with setting. Environment constrains tactics (hidden corners, central heart) and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear—prove the garden’s loyalty—and pressure coheres through Thorne’s public takeover and the frost clock. The tightening is credible: public surrender → secret work → amulet wobble → frost → reveal. Still, Elias pays little visible price under pressure; consequences land more on Thorne and the village’s worldview. The conflict escalates but lacks a sharp on‑page sacrifice or near‑loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The care‑over‑luck theme emerges organically through Elias’s craft and the maze’s response, with the marbles providing a resonant ritual. The ending offers a concrete counter‑valuation of measurable fate. However, the thesis is spoken aloud—“This garden knows its gardener”—which flirts with moralizing and flattens subtext. The piece remains moving but a touch declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and character‑grounded, balancing fable‑like distance with tactile craft detail. No head‑hopping; the diction aligns with an aged, ritual‑minded gardener in a mythic‑modern world. Rhythm varies and strengthens the cadence through the nocturnal sequences. A few elevated flourishes verge on purple but stay controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry strong images and momentum; most sentences do multiple jobs. Recurring motifs (cracked marbles, wither/bloom) are efficiently threaded. Minor over‑ornament (“hedges twisted like forgotten promises,” etc.) skims the edge but does not blur clarity. No notable loop/scaffold; the final image is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The measurable‑luck society fused with a gardener’s clandestine craft feels fresh, and the “mended deception” concept is smartly embodied by the marbles. The reveal reweights the premise without gimmickry. Risks (ritualized polishing, public surrender) read coherent and specific. It stops short of startling innovation, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
