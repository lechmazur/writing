<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (redistribute hoarded power) is clear and her “calmly inventive” trait drives tactics with the sundial and quill. However, interior contradiction is thin—she feels little fear or guilt when the loyal sentinel passes, so pressure reveals little new about her. Micro‑choices exist (scratching guides, concealment timing) but carry limited cost. The ending asserts a coming change without dramatizing a value trade‑off on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lens: Situational with causal threads—blackout pressure frames tactics; the loyal sentinel cameo tests stealth. Closure lands as Charged Poise: a poised revolution signaled by encoded projections, but the on‑page cost is minimal and no option is truly foreclosed now. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The scene tightens once (interruption), yet the decisive shift is deferred to off‑page dawn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The luminous fort, half‑painted sundial, and bronze quill holder are vivid and used functionally; the blackout denies light, forcing scratch‑mapping and angled projections. Setting is filtered through Elara’s professional eye, with tools and surfaces shaping tactics. Rules (light, shadows, angles) stay consistent. Strong atmospheric tone supports the intrigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spark a silent revolution) is signaled, but on‑page escalation is modest: preparation, a brief encounter, then resumed plotting. The interruption doesn’t extract a visible price or force a trade‑off; she remains in control. The blackout complicates the sundial, prompting adaptation, yet no beat forecloses a path or raises immediate cost. Tension is present but rarely sharpens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motifs (light/blackout, coded angles, “cradle of sparks”) align with themes of hoarded power versus distributed ingenuity. Some lines tip into telling (“igniting a revolution so quiet…”) rather than earning resonance through image. The final image promises repricing but leans on assertion over felt consequence. Still, the objects-as-code thread gives a satisfying conceptual echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with a consistent, gently lyrical texture matching the “winking hush” tone. Dialogue is minimal but functional and subtextual. Diction occasionally edges purple, yet remains controlled and character‑plausible for a sentinel attuned to mechanism and light. Rhythm varies enough to carry the scene without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lines are generally clear and purposeful, integrating setting into action. There’s some redundancy and abstract phrasing (“winking hush” and mission assertions recur), and modifiers stack occasionally. Momentum holds, with strong nouns (sundial, quill, arcs) doing work. No major artifacts or scaffolding impede sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The half‑painted sundial as a code device and the bronze quill holder casting precise shadows feel fresh and grounded. The “cradle of sparks” concept is intriguing, even if not fully tested on the page. The blend of covert mechanics and quiet insurrection offers a distinct angle. Greater on‑page cost would elevate the ingenuity from clever to inevitable.</comment>
