<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, coherent motivation (compassion vs self‑protection) drives concrete choices: he attends, hides, resists revealing himself, and slips the note. Interiority balances urge and restraint well (“urge to reveal… but he held back”), though phrasing leans abstract at times. The earned renunciation at closure reads credible with a felt, if quiet, cost. Minor therapy‑adjacent labels (“keenly empathetic”) slightly flatten specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: beats accrue from invitation → entry → hiding → temptation to confront → anonymous aid → exit. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he forgoes confrontation and reframes the mistake into present action at cost. Orientation is clean early; the live clock and betrayer’s speech tighten pressure. Slightly low external stakes keep it below top band, but causality and cadence hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Bookstore→hidden door→lanterned sanctum are vivid and functional; the paradox book as trigger is a smart, character‑filtered detail. Smell of paper, bell chime, and stacks used as cover integrate setting with tactic. World rules stay consistent and tone‑supportive. Environment guides choice but doesn’t strongly constrain it, keeping this shy of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to reveal/engage) tightens when the betrayer speaks and midnight strikes. The key turn is his renunciation—remaining hidden, then redirecting compassion via the note—at an emotional price. Pressure is coherent but soft; no meaningful loss beyond self‑denial is dramatized. The escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing, effective but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paradox threads integrate with action (hidden door via paradox book; “staying while leaving” embodied). The final image reweights earlier material through compassionate anonymity. However, the line “In staying while leaving, he unearthed the wisdom he sought” overstates the theme, tipping toward moralizing. Subtext with the betrayer’s regret is strong and could carry more of the load without explicit thesising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable close third with controlled, mildly lyrical cadence; perception remains plausibly bound to Elias. Elevated diction (“enlarged tranquility,” “veiled chambers”) fits the aesthetic but occasionally smooths edges. No dialogue to strain naturalism; interior rhythm modulates around the temptation beat. Distinctive, if slightly generalized, texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clean mechanics and steady momentum; sensory touches do double duty. Some abstraction and phrase recycling (“enlarged tranquility,” “nested paradoxes”) reduce punch. Figurative density is moderate and coherent, but a few lines tell what image already implies. Overall readable with room to trim and sharpen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Secret library and anonymous‑helper recluse are familiar, but the “staying while leaving” tactic and paradox‑as‑mechanic add a fresh inflection. The betrayer’s on‑stage regret glimpsed through concealment feels humane. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; the piece avoids gimmickry yet doesn’t decisively transform the trope. Solid originality through synthesis more than invention.</comment>
