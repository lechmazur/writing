<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—“to witness change without judgment”—and his actions (unfolding/refolding the swan, leaving/returning) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; he rarely struggles or reveals contradictory impulses beyond a faint tug between lingering and returning. Embodied emotion leans abstract (“eyes like faded ink,” “gripped reality loosely”) over felt, situational stress. The endurance/ritual closure reads credible but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds via ritual pattern (library → burrow → refuge → observation → return), and closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when he re‑commits to the cycle. Orientation is clean from the outset; the portal turn is motivated by the swan. Cost is implied (solitude, non‑intervention) rather than dramatized, limiting impact. Still, the discovery of others learning swan‑folding provides a notable mid‑piece deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: overgrown library/catacombs, the origami swan as a charged tool, and the obsidian refuge along the river. The environment constrains and enables choices—the swan opens/closes the portal; the refuge’s “regenerative silence” resets him and shapes when he moves. Sensory specificity supports tone without static postcarding. World rules feel consistent, learned by action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (enduring neutrality versus the pull to observe more deeply) is present, but pressure remains gentle. The main tightening is the decision to leave after renewal and later to return; the civilization’s echo of swan‑folding adds conceptual pressure but little cost. Escalation is more cadence than consequence; options don’t narrow with visible price. Satisfying as ritual, less so as conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: regeneration through non‑judgmental witnessing, the cost and solace of neutrality, and time’s impartial drift. Recurring images (swan, river, silence) accrue meaning and reweight at the end as he resumes the cycle. The line “a distant civilization discovering the art of folding paper into swans” elegantly refracts the premise without moralizing. A touch of direct labeling (“His motivation was simple yet profound”) slightly blunts subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close distance suits the meditative mode; diction and rhythm are controlled and confident. No dialogue, but the perceptual signature is steady and bias‑filtered through the keeper’s watchfulness. Patterned elision (seasons, drift) is taught early and held. Minor repetition doesn’t undermine stance or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and musical, with strong image economy; however, some abstract repetitions and near‑loops (“gripped reality loosely,” “regenerative silence,” “seasons drifted”) soften momentum. Figurative language is generally coherent and apt; density stays below purple, but a few lines tell what others have shown. Syntax varies, and transitions are clear. Final image is cleanly rendered without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The origami‑swan portal, obsidian riverside refuge, and “regenerative silence” frame a distinctive take on the ageless observer trope. The echo of a civilization learning swan‑folding is a fresh, elegant intensification. Premise risks safety by minimizing conflict, but the synthesis feels organically unified and memorable. Not radical, yet notably above template execution.</comment>
