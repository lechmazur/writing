<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s protector drive is clear and enacted under pressure; his grief (wife and child) grounds motive without melodrama. Reticence vs action produces credible tension, and micro-choices (carrying stones up, choosing seven, placing the letter/glass) reveal values. Some traits are labeled (“warmly observant”) but mostly shown. The cost is primarily emotional, not behavioral, but it still reads earned for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: lamp fails → hauntings intensify → he adapts the stone-letter method to the spectral realm → ghosts calm → lamp relit. Orientation is immediate (skipper, isle, lighthouse), and the scene holds a single stake and window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the living chain now includes the dead, with a continuing-duty cost. Hybrid lens (textural buildup with causal acts) holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, fog, and lantern room are tactile and pressure the choices; the haunted lantern room directly shapes tactics. Sea glass, stones, and lamp function as charged objects that return in the final image. Sensory selection tracks POV and urgency. World rules (cairn codes, hauntings) are taught by action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is keeping safety alight (for ships and ghosts), tightened by the lamp’s outage and the intensified hauntings. The key turn is adopting the stone-letter method as ritual in extremis, narrowing options beyond mere relighting. The price is chiefly emotional and vocational resolve rather than risk, which keeps intensity just shy of top tier. Still, pressure coheres and deepens credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of bottling safety and transmuting grief into communal care emerges through concrete acts (letter chain → spectral extension). Subtext hums in the “luminescent ache” that shifts from burden to balm without stating a moral. The final image reweights the premise: safety is a shared, portable ritual, not only a beam. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close with a distinct, restrained lyricism fits the character and setting. Diction is consistent and modulates under stress; no head-hopping or withheld facts. The perceptual signature (nautical observation, attention to stones/glass/light) remains coherent. No dialogue, but the voice carries subtext through image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and mostly economical; images often do double duty. A few stacked metaphors (“etched with salt and sorrow,” “luminescent ache”) flirt with excess but don’t blur sense or momentum. Sentence variety and paragraphing support pace from ascent to ritual to release. No noticeable loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—cairn-coded letters, sea glass as bottled safety, and a ritual extended to ghosts—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The method-driven solution avoids genre convenience. Risks are taken in tone and concept without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth sits inside specific maritime culture rather than generic gothic tropes.</comment>
