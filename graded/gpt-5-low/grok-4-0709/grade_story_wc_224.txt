<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s need to avoid pain versus her drive to reclaim “the shape of home” gives credible internal contradiction, and her micro‑choices (lifting the stone, committing to the rite, breaking the orb) align with that motive. Interiority is particular—mercury‑glass, feather texture, “hidden thunder”—though some emotions are told rather than fully embodied. The renunciation of nightly substitutions reads earned with visible cost. A slightly glossier ease to the success of the rite modestly reduces struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: find alcove → acquire stone → perform feather rite → endure painful truths → renounce substitutions → depart to rebuild. Closure lands with cost on the page (the orb cracking; pain embraced) and reconfigures options. Orientation is clear early, and one meaningful tightening (choosing truth despite pain) anchors the climax. The feather method is introduced and paid off, avoiding late rule‑change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mountain‑long labyrinthine bookstore is vivid and purposeful—it yields the alcove and the stone and reframes as “guardian” at the end. Object‑as‑setting (orb, stone, feather) charges the final image and constrains tactics in the ritual. Sensory economy stays focused on touch, light, and sound (thunder), integrated with action. While the environment’s direct physical constraint is light, its resource role is essential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus anesthetic substitution—tightens through the ritual into a decisive renunciation. The on‑page price (raw visions; shattering the orb) clarifies a foreclosed path. Escalation feels protagonist‑driven rather than coincidental; the legends and rite guide but do not solve the choice. A second, sharper test under pressure could raise the sense of risk further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of home as relational shape and the ethics of remembering versus forgetting emerge from concrete acts (feather’s texture unlocking language; orb breaking). The final image reprices the premise without a tidy moral, though a few lines state theme outright (“Home wasn’t a place...”). The “hidden thunder” motif meaningfully evolves from suppression to ally. Resonance lingers, if slightly declared at moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (mercury, stone, storm) sustains pressure without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well around the rite and the breaking of the orb. Diction stays coherent to the world; no dialogue needed. Occasional elevated abstractions skim the edge of over‑articulation but seldom blur agency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled: images carry multiple jobs, and sentence rhythm supports momentum. Repetition of motifs (thunder, silver, stone) reads patterned rather than looped. A few near‑synonymous intensifiers could be trimmed, but clarity at closure remains sharp. Figurative density stays legible in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—mountain bookstore, mercury‑glass scrying, feather‑texture unlocking a lost language—feels fresh and purposeful. The central turn (choosing pain to recover communal “home”) lands with specificity rather than trope gloss. Risks in image‑system coherence (thunder/mercury/feather/stone) pay off. Slight convenience in discovery is outweighed by the integrated ritual logic.</comment>
