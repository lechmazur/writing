<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—Elias seeks to understand sacred thresholds—and his actions (wood‑grain analysis, cross‑referencing the logbook) align. However, internal conflict is muted and the epiphany lands a bit tidily, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The felt cost of reframing his loss as “essential” is present but soft. Strong interiority with specific methods keeps the character from reading generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details build toward a Conceptual Repricing in the final paragraphs (“sacredness arose from the hush before crossing”). Orientation is swift and clean; single scene coherence is maintained around the table, terrace, and logbook. Closure lands, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. The sequence of analyzing grain → cross‑referencing codes → childhood threshold memory forms a clear tightening without causal leaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and the wooden table are vivid, specific, and POV‑filtered; prisms, clinks, and light refractions build a palpable atmosphere. The logbook and table integrate as environmental tools, charging the inquiry. While the terrace doesn’t constrain choices materially, it frames the isolation that enables the ritual and the final hush. Strong sensory control without tourist‑catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal and remain abstract; pressure deepens through pattern density rather than concrete obstacles. The main tightening arrives when storm codes align with wood knots, reweighting the threshold memory. Cost is articulated as acceptance rather than a trade‑off that forecloses options on the page. Tension is steady but low, with no sharp test of commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece cohesively develops the theme of thresholds and “necessary distances,” culminating in a resonant reframing. However, the final articulation (“sacredness arose from the hush before crossing”) edges into thematic statement, dulling subtext. Imagery (logbook codes, mazes, storm fronts) earns much of the insight through particulars. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative rather than piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident, with a distinct lyric texture consistent to Elias’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and patterned to the piece’s meditative pressure. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Occasional ornate phrasing risks saturation but remains coherent and voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level work is polished and musical, with concrete images doing multiple jobs. Some figurative stacking and echo (“butterfly effect,” “fractured hush,” “prisms”) verge on overuse, lightly slowing momentum. Clarity is maintained and scaffolding is minimal. The final image is clean, though a touch of redundancy softens its snap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—corn‑maze past, prism‑terrace present, and pilot weather codes as a divination method—is fresh and coherent. Risks in worldbuilding and method feel intentional rather than quirky for its own sake. The reconfiguration at the end is earned by particulars, though the conflict frame remains gentle. Distinctive vision without gimmickry.</comment>
