<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s prudence versus claustrophobia is embodied in concrete tactics (counting steps, mapping exits) while corridors literally close, forcing micro‑choices under pressure. Her decision to touch the organ and later fuse the compass halves is motivated by memory and goal, not convenience. The farewell to her mother’s ghost registers as a felt cost. The interiority remains particular and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative/Textural with clear causal beats: entering → corridor seals → organ reverberates → spatial reconfiguration → fusion of compass halves → widened exit. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (key obtained, labyrinth widens) and a resonant reconfiguration (grief recast as map‑making). Orientation is clean early; the throughline never wobbles. Cost is present in the goodbye and the relinquishing of fear as identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The labyrinth’s narrowing passages and the organ’s spatial power tangibly constrain choices and tactics, not just mood. Recurring objects (compass point, organ) function as micro‑settings that charge the final image (star‑chart on skin). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s cartographic mindset. World rules are learned in action and remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the key despite claustrophobia—is signaled and tightened when retreat seals and gravity destabilizes. Escalation arises from Elara’s choices (engaging the organ, fusing the compass) rather than luck, and each turn narrows options. The visible price is letting the ghost go and risking entrapment to act. Pressure remains coherent through the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inheritance, memory as architecture, and mapping grief cohere without sermonizing; the labyrinth’s “memory” reframes entrapment into return. The final promise “I’ll map the sky for you” offers a resonant answer that reweights prior images. Symbolic recurrences (starlight, compass, organ) evolve in meaning rather than decorate. The wistfulness avoids tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates with pressure—denser during spatial shifts, steadier at release—and avoids head‑hopping. Diction remains character‑plausible even when elevated. Whispers and silence carry subtext without expository crutches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme) with minimal scaffold, and the cadence is varied. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and scene‑bound; it rarely blurs causality. Minor lushness (“starlight bled,” “lungs inhaling”) stays legible and supports momentum. Final lines land cleanly without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The organ that bends space, the Cartographers’ Guild ghosts, and the compass‑rose fusion synthesize into a fresh, specific vision. The turns feel earned from seeded particulars rather than late rule drops. While labyrinth/ghost motifs are familiar, the “spatial mutiny as memory” angle reads distinctive. Risk is purposeful and supports meaning, not ornament.</comment>
