<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Liang’s motive—to preserve textures before the silence erases them—is specific and consistently enacted through concrete micro‑choices (charting intervals, steadying breath, speaking memories). The “earnestly studious” trait turns active under pressure when panic hits and he regulates himself to keep working. Emotional texture is embodied (hum pooling “behind his eyes as a color”) without label‑speak. The shift from archivist to maker—accepting invented histories as lanterns—reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clean: sensory density builds toward a cadence shift when the lamp begins to forget, forcing an urgent, focused response. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “invented histories were not lies but lanterns,” with cost felt in the lamp’s fading and thicker silence. Orientation is swift and stable (Mount Qiyun bonsai pavilion; a single night’s vigil). The constraint (the lamp’s dwindling hum) shapes options and the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pavilion lamp and bonsai labyrinth are vividly tactile and POV‑filtered; the lamp’s hum functions as a micro‑setting constraint that governs tactics and urgency. Specific, sensorial details (cedar sap paper, dew exhaling, moss glowing) are purposeful rather than touristic. The environment returns in the final image (walking the bonsai path; each tree a chapter), charging the closure. World rules (silence, lamps retaining residue) remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—preserving recoverable textures before they vanish—tightens when the lamp starts “to forget,” which narrows options and forces him to speak and write faster. The brief turn (his intervention brightens the lamp and deepens the hum) credibly tests his method. The cost is partial rescue with loss: the hum fades; silence grows thicker, reweighting the win. Pressure is coherent and escalates within the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, invention, and preservation arise organically from tactile acts and recurring objects; the final image meaningfully reweights prior details. However, the explicit articulation—“invented histories were not lies but lanterns”—tips into telling, slightly flattening subtext in the last paragraph. The piece still elicits a resonant aftereffect through charged images (coal‑colored filament, moth‑wing pages). Complexity is present without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice has a distinctive perceptual signature—texture‑first noticing, precise lexicon, controlled lyricism—held consistently in close third. Rhythm modulates with pressure (panic steadied into measured annotation), and inferential leaps stay within what Liang can plausibly sense. No head‑hopping or register drift; the diction fits an artisan‑archivist mind. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful figurative language, and varied syntax that maintains momentum. A lush image rate risks purple, but vehicles remain coherent and task‑tethered (sound → light mapping) with minimal redundancy. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter; beats advance. The final cadence is clean and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Charting a fluorescent lamp’s hum to refract communal residue into “invented histories” feels striking and specific; the bonsai‑crowned mountaintop and stationer craft sharpen originality beyond mere ornament. The central reweighting—embracing invention as preservation—emerges from enacted method, not thesis. Risks in diction and concept land without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
