<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motivation (recover/vitalize the runaway dream) escalates into a meaningful renunciation when she gives the palette away. Interiority is specific and embodied (paying “a drop of her own shadow,” tasting “iron and lilac”). Contradictory impulses are present—pursuit versus the dream’s preference for “almost”—and the final endurance/letting‑go forecloses a path with felt cost. Slightly idealized composure under pressure keeps this just shy of transcendent complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is swift (librarian on an eastern jetty at dawn) and pattern‑teaching is consistent. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she relinquishes pursuit, shadowless, with a cracked lens; absence is reweighted “as a lantern,” and the price shapes the final map. Because the shadow‑cost and palette‑transfer persist into the last image, the before/after is undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago, jetty, basalt, and phosphorescent foam are vivid and filtered through her vocation. Setting constrains tactics (waiting for horizon tear, bridges of mist enabling contact) and charges the final image (palettes of sunrise drifting beneath waves). The palette/camera function as charged micro‑settings. A trace of decorative flourish appears, but it remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (capture/vitalize the dream), with a tightening when the child gains flesh but not eyes, creating a new obstacle. The decisive turn is her choice to offer the palette and not follow—an earned trade that costs her shadow and tool. Pressure builds by density and cadence rather than reversals, fitting the chosen lens. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of absence/presence, seeing versus almost, and stewardship versus possession emerge organically through concrete acts (sunrise captured at the cost of shadow; refusal to complete the capture). The “absence as lantern” reprices the premise without moralizing. Recurring images (salt‑map, iron and lilac, sunrise/Palette) shift meaning at the end. Resonance lingers without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction and image systems feel character‑bound to a librarian‑artist. Rhythm modulates well at pressure points (the shutter click, the cracked lens). No head‑hopping or unearned certainties; elision is pattern‑taught. Intense figuration occasionally risks saturation but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density; images often do double duty for plot and theme. Minor risk of purple excess (stacked modifiers, dense metaphors) but coherence holds, and crucial beats are crisp (“Each exposure cost her a drop of her own shadow”; “the lens cracked”). No paraphrase loops or cadence templates. A slight trim could sharpen peak clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—librarian, salt‑cipher, photographing dawn to paint with light—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The central transfer (giving the palette to the dream) is a fresh, non‑obvious turn grounded in prior particulars. Risk‑taking in diction and worldbuilding heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Emotional truth underpins the novelty.</comment>
