<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s goal and fear are clear—curating memory without betraying the rest—and her tactics (shadow-mapping, then renouncing selection to “listen”) reveal a credible internal conflict. The discovery of the obelisk triggers a shift from control to witness with embodied cost (“antiseptic corridors,” “unmarked coffins”). Micro-choices under pressure (working before the next storm, tearing the page, pressing it to the obelisk) align with motive. Slight on-the-nose phrasing surfaces at the insight beats, but it doesn’t undercut credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: patterning of rain/shadow/whisper escalates to the obelisk’s void and the tactile act of fusing page to stone, yielding a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clean early; the thirty-three-stone measure to thirty-three years lands as a motivated link. Closure is on-page: the archive’s method reweighted and the fog cracking as consequence. The final fragment line is a slight artifact, but the closure effect precedes it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the “crystal whispering forecourt after rain,” solid fog, and stormlight are not postcard décor but charge tactics (shadow-measuring possible only after rain; isolation by fog; the crystal translating thunder). The obelisk’s shadow geography drives discovery and shapes the ending image. Weather and architecture modulate tone and stakes (hush deepens, then lifts). World rules feel consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—what and how to remember—is pressured by the time‑bound mapping and the obelisk’s impossible shadow. The tightening comes when her ledgering method fails ethically, forcing a trade: abandon curation for acknowledgment of grief. The cost is explicit and felt (naming the erased dead; letting ache into the archive) and the outcome is earned by her agency. No antagonist needed; escalation coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of memory ethics, communal erasure, and witnessing emerge organically through images (shadows, names bleeding into stone) and the changed method. Subtext sits in the obelisk-as-void returning what was banned; the single note and lifting hush seal the repricing. A couple explicit thesis lines (“understood… not an act of carving but of listening”) slightly overstate what the images already carry. Still, the final reweighting resonates without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical close third is stable and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature (sensory specificity tied to profession and place). Rhythm modulates well between hush and flare, and the diction feels unified to Lira’s sensibility. No dialogue is needed. A minor tilt toward statement at the insight beats is the only wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is strong—precise images, layered verbs, and multi-tasking sentences—but the final sentence is truncated (“but”), reading as a copy error that dulls the last chord. Figurative density is mostly controlled, with only slight redundancy in hush/rain motifs. Momentum stays clean without scaffolding bloat. The artifact in the last line prevents the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a stormlit observatory, a crystal that translates thunder, and a shadow-led mnemonic ethics culminating in making the obelisk itself a page. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight—the ledger method revealing the void it cannot ledger. Emotional truth (choosing to include pain) anchors the novelty. Bold but coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
