<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation (“to restore lost faith”) is enacted through concrete, risky choices: entering the forbidden orchard, excavating, asking permission of bones, aligning the dial. Contradictory impulses—caution vs. warmly curious drive—coexist and are tested on the page. The seven-day vigil and the final renunciation of the “old ache” read as earned. Slightly soft costs keep this just shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: patterned images (serpent, roots, bones, light) accrue toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands when the sundial is restored and the village map surfaces, triggering a conceptual repricing of “interrupted journeys” with a felt cost (time spent, ethical intimacy with the dead, leaving the dial). Orientation is clean from the first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and sundial are tactile environments that constrain action (warnings, iron gate script, shaft of light for alignment). POV-selective details reflect expertise (museum/inscription habits) and bias, charging the final image. Setting evolves with events (restoration alters wind, scent, and map reveal). It’s integral rather than postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether she can meaningfully “restore” rather than merely visit: warnings raise ethical risk; the dig tests commitment; finding and aligning the gnomon tightens options and exacts a quiet price. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. Stakes remain intimate but legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Time/devouring/return and faith-as-process are braided through concrete acts (serpent gnomon, roots knitting bones, light marking hours); the final reweighting is strong. One explicit statement (“Faith, she realized, was not a monument but a process”) edges toward on-the-nose and slightly blunts the subtext. Still, the pomegranate and “pocket-sized dawn” restore resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with a curator’s perceptual signature; syntax varies and modulates with pressure. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off; no head‑hopping. Sparse dialogue lands with subtext (“where time learns to circle”) without breaking register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet controlled; images do multiple jobs and propel momentum. A few high-density metaphors risk saturation but remain coherent and earned by pattern. No loops or scaffolding dull the closure image, and rhythm varies effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” + sundial serpent reframes diaspora/homecoming with uncommon specificity and follow-through. Risks in premise and diction pay off through integrated motif mechanics and a fresh final cadence. The map reveal in grandmother’s hand feels both inevitable and surprising.</comment>
