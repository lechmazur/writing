<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority drives every micro‑choice, from orienting driftwood to refusing to play the flute until a new understanding forms. The conflict between “keeping as holding tight” and “keeping as letting go” is dramatized rather than told, and the renunciation at the end feels earned. Embodied perception (“air grew denser,” “sigil burned black”) grounds emotion. The visible cost is the relinquishment of her old identity as a wall.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the spiral reconfiguration and gold‑leaf sigil produce a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the stake from mending to tending. Causality is coherent across beats (markers → spiral → fracture opens → new sigil → reoriented guardianship). Closure is on the page with cost (“not as a wall but as a song”), though the final sentence truncation (“and the echo that”) slightly blurs the cadence. Orientation is strong from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Thunder‑echo range and canyon hush are not decorative; they constrain tactics (counting heartbeats, listening for echo) and charge the final image. The flute functions as object‑as‑setting, its fracture aligned with the cedar spindle to structure choice. Sensory economy is tight, with wind moan and pressure on eardrums shaping action. World rules (breaches, sigils) are inferred through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and deepens as she pivots from compass to spiral, the air densifies, and the fracture widens—one meaningful tightening consistent with the chosen lens. Stakes are internal but legible, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses the old tactic of sealing. The cost is primarily conceptual and identity‑based rather than visceral, keeping the ceiling just below the highest band. The choice to descend only after reconfiguring the frame is a clear, earned turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and act: driftwood, fracture, spiral, and hush evolve from control to balance. The late reweighting—tending the tear rather than denying it—lands without sermonizing; the line “Understanding arrived avalanchingly quiet” veers toward statement but is supported by scene. The final reframe of guardianship as shared song provides resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not evasive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, singular lyric voice maintains stable POV with deft modulation as pressure grows. Diction (“avalanchingly quiet,” “looped line… closed gate and open eye”) is distinctive yet coherent for the focalizer. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the reconfiguration. Minor cadence disruption stems from the clipped last line, though primarily a line‑level issue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line craft is often superb—dense, precise, and multi‑tasking—but the truncated closing sentence is a significant artifact at the point of closure. Repetitions (“avalanchingly quiet”) read intentional, yet a few near‑duplicates could be tightened. Rhythm and syntax mostly vary well, maintaining propulsion. The artifact in the final beat prevents higher‑band placement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as a memory‑compass turned spiral and a relic flute that births a sigil is a fresh synthesis. The breach‑tending reframe avoids genre cliché by prioritizing balance over sealing or conquest. Risks in structure and diction heighten coherence rather than feel gimmicky. The vision feels specific and integrated, not template‑driven.</comment>
