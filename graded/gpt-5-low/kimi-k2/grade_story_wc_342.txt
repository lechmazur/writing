<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (to mirror the sky before demolition) is clear and her micro‑choices (prying the safe, translating the coin, embossing the mural, deciding to leave) align under pressure. Embodied tension (“heart races, but her hand remains steady”) gives credible contradiction. Face blindness is integrated as limitation and worldview rather than a label. The endurance/renunciation at the end (walking out, leaving the library to fall) carries felt cost and reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies from discovery to floodlights to claw, culminating in a charged final image. Closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing: the mural fractures into motes/pages, knowledge outlives containers, and the building’s loss is the cost. Orientation is clean from the opening; the live clock and the coin pattern shape tactics. The final cadence reweights the premise without tidy mechanical wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tree‑trunk library, skylight, warped floorboards, and hydraulic claw are vividly tactile and consequential. The concave inner wall and hidden safe directly enable the craft and charge the ending. Environmental pressure (demolition lights/claw) narrows options and informs cadence. Details stay character‑filtered and purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and coherently tightens as demolition advances. Agency drives escalation through the coin’s use and the embossing choice; cost arrives as the irrevocable collapse of the library. The pattern deepens (faces within stars; guild recast as nebulae), yielding a single meaningful cadence shift. Pressure remains focused without busy reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of preservation vs. container, blindness vs. vision, and seed/sky recursion emerge through concrete action and charged images. The reprise (mural → sky; pages drifting) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. A couple of lines verge on explicit thesis (“knowledge outlives its containers,” “to mirror the sky is to reveal”) slightly blunt the subtext. Overall, the images carry the weight without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled, sensuous, and consistent to Lira’s perceptual signature; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythmic modulation tracks pressure (from hush to groan to silence). Elision is purposeful; the piece teaches its pattern early and pays it off at closure. Diction feels organic to the aesthetic and does not break plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double duty. A rich figurative register risks purple but remains coherent and precise, avoiding mixed metaphors. Repetition of “fractally precise” works as motif rather than churn. Sentences propel rather than bog, even in the most lyric stretches.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a face‑blind portraitist embossing a vanishing library’s inner sky via a micro‑ridged coin is striking and organic. The demolition‑seed conceit feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in form and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The conceptual turn at the end avoids cliché and feels singular.</comment>
