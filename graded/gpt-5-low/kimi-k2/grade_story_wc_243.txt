<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—she’s there to record the covenant—and pressure exposes contradiction: the pull to witness versus self-preservation (“She did not step back”). Interiority is embodied and particular (temperature drop, pollen count, grief sharpening perception). The choice to stay is earned by earlier methodical attention and maternal legacy. Cost registers as identity-thinning and accepting the burden to carry “the weight of small moments.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of detail tightens to a cadence shift as the jetty dissolves and the locket reconfigures the contract into pigment/paper. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the covenant preserved through her text at the price of partial self-translation. Orientation is clean from the outset (archivist at the blooming jetty at twilight). No causality breaks; the whispered terms and mother’s precedent shape the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The jetty-turned-bloom becomes an active constraint, dissolving underfoot and forcing her stance. Tools and objects (walnut ink, locket) are woven into environment and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is purposeful and POV-filtered (brine, roses, translucent gull). The setting directly shapes the decision point when the jetty lurches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the covenant—tightens when the jetty begins to vanish and she must either retreat or continue witnessing. The meaningful turn is the refusal to step back, recorded via her own method (“proximate causes of her staying”). Cost is visible in thinning into annotation and accepting ongoing burden. The escalation is coherent and reader-felt without relying on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, witness, and exchange (story for salt) emerge through concrete acts, not moralizing. Recurring images (roses, walnut ink, locket) reweight at the end, especially the photograph becoming a mirror. The aphoristic final line is earned by the scene’s pressures and carries conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers without confusion: preservation demands personal erosion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with a controlled, professional lexicon (“proximate causes,” “manual warned”) that fits an archivist. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the dissolution and lurch. POV stays clean and consistent with no leakage or overexplaining. Patterned diction is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing double duty (world rule + emotion + action). Figurative language is abundant but coherent and scene-anchored; no mixed metaphors dull clarity. No scaffold or paraphrase loops; momentum carries through the peak. Minor lushness never obscures action or cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The covenant-as-blooming-jetty and walnut-ink methodology feel singular and necessary. The mother/daughter relay and the locket’s transformation deliver a fresh, inevitable reweighting. Risks in tone and lyric compression pay off with clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise’s implications without retreat.</comment>
