<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear motive (balancing regret; seeking a difference on an identical staircase) drives concrete choices: marking sigils, rolling dice, writing proofs, and offering the chipped die. Contradictory impulses—grim endurance vs. hope—coexist on the page. The endurance at the end (continuing to walk) carries a felt cost of not fully crossing into reunion. Minor dock for a few explicit self‑explanations that lean cerebral over embodied ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: patterned ascent, math marks, and dice build to a cadence shift when the crack opens and he proves a bridge. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he accepts a gentler staircase and keeps walking after offering the die. Cost is legible in remaining on his side as the light thins. Orientation is clean from the outset; set‑ups (dice, proofs) pay off causally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is both stage and constraint, teaching rules (no rail, boundless turns) that shape tactics (markings, proofs on risers). Sensory specificity (chalk, iron, warm amber air, perfume) grounds the surreal and charges the final image. Environment reconfigures into the slope of her shoulder, directly affecting action. World logic stays consistent through the mathematical motif.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconnect/resolve regret—pressurizes from first paragraph. Escalation tightens with the fissure, the staircase closing like pistons, and the dwindling “filament” of light, forcing the choice to offer the die instead of forcing entry. The price is the partial contact and acceptance of ongoing walking. Stakes remain coherent; no convenient rescue.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Regret, chance, proof, and acceptance braid through objects and acts rather than lecture. Recurring images (dice, chip, proofs) shift meaning at the end, reweighting “perpetual motion” as lived memory. A couple of explicit thesis‑like lines (“regret is simply the integral…”) slightly over‑declare. Still, the final limit image earns its resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, mathematically tinged lyric voice with precise rhythm and controlled modulation under pressure. POV and distance are stable; inference stays within what the narrator can plausibly perceive. The single dialogue whisper fits the register and functions as action. Patterned diction is taught early and paid off in the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; lines do multiple jobs (image, world, and theme). Figurative texture is rich but purposeful, with few redundancies; cadence varies to match pressure. Slight risk of metaphor pile‑up is managed by consistent logic and payoff in the closure beat. No notable scaffolding or artifact loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: math as spellwork for grief within an infinite staircase frame; the chipped die as tactile conduit. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (the equation on the riser causing a crack; offering the die to bridge). Bold structural and tonal risks heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth undergirds the conceptual daring.</comment>
