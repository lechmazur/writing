<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—grief plus professional calling drives her to defy the council and leave the known grid. Interiority is embodied (pressure as forgiveness; the anchor link’s heft) and character‑specific. The shift from instructor to transgressor to teacher feels earned, though her swift fluency with alien method verges on ease. The wife’s lesson grounds the leap and keeps it credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density tightens from balcony to glyph contact to trench dive to the reconfigured “surface.” Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—abyss becomes sky—with cost legible (taboo breach, leaving community, accepting a new rule‑set). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and every move is a because/therefore within the lyric logic. The final “horizon” image pays off the pattern with a clear before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The benthic city and trench are tactile and pressure the choices (depth, cold, forbidden glyphs). The anchor link functions as a tool‑as‑setting, constraining and enabling navigation and charging the last image. Details are selective and POV‑filtered (Euclidean refusal, gravity’s memory). World rules evolve through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking self and status to learn a new navigation—tightens from contemplation to commitment (pressing the link, leaving watchers, crossing the lip, diving). Escalation is a cadence deepening rather than adversarial; the taboo and grief provide coherent pressure. A sharper on‑page resistance could heighten price, but the internal/external braid suffices at this length. The ending stance crystallizes into teaching, an earned resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of grief, orientation, and re‑mapping meaning arise organically via objects and acts; no sermonizing. The “stars as braille” and “horizon” reprise reweight the world without platitudes. The abyss‑as‑sky insight feels earned by specific ordeal and love. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a technical bent (geometry, gravity) suits the POV and never leaks. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and the imagery pattern—unfolding/folding—stays consistent and paid off. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Elevated diction feels character‑plausible for a navigation instructor.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, action). Figurative texture is rich but coherent; repeated motifs are deliberate, not purple. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates dulling momentum. A hair’s breadth from maximal polish as a few metaphors push toward lushness but do not blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Familiar elements (grief, taboo knowledge) are transformed by a fresh synthesis: benthic city, alien edge geometry, gravity‑memory starlight, anchor‑as‑sextant. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, especially the abyssal “surface.” Bold yet coherent risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels singular and memorable.</comment>
