<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—protect the artifact by translating its grief—is clear and consistently embodied (calculating resonance while her heart “winced”). The micro‑choices (returning the key, selecting the thinnest ice, modulating pitch) align with her “logically emotional” nature. However, internal conflict is gentle and largely uncontested; we seldom see her falter or pay a personal price beyond fatigue. The crypt keeper exerts minimal interpersonal pressure, keeping the crucible mostly internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/why), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as ritual steps reconfigure the wail into a lullaby. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the key melts, the keeper’s duty ends, and the world’s risk is repriced. Beats link coherently—piercing note, ice as throat, colored sound, relit beacon—without convenience. The price is legible on the page and inflects the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina is not mere backdrop; it dictates tactics (“ice conducts sorrow differently,” thin floes where sound travels fastest) and charges the ending as the marina becomes a resonant chamber. Sensory specificity is rich and purpose‑driven (audible colors, ice as throat) across sight, sound, and touch. World rules are taught through action and remain consistent. The environment shapes choice and the final image, clearing the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear: prevent the sea’s grief from drowning every throat. Pressure tightens through ritual sequencing and the surrender of the key, culminating in a successful but not facile transformation. Still, the path is smooth—no real reversal or hard trade‑off beyond the key’s sacrifice—so tension crests more as intensification than crisis. The visible cost helps the resolution feel earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around protection as release vs. imprisonment, embodied by the melted key and the choice to translate rather than silence grief. The final image (“Rest,” sweeping beam scattering sunset like seeds) offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext hums through object work and ritual, avoiding moralizing. Complexity remains, even as the piece lands gently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third’s lyric texture is steady and character‑specific (engineer’s sonic lexicon blended with awe). Rhythm modulates with the ritual’s rise and easing, and the single spoken word at the end is well‑timed. No head‑hopping or stance slips; inference stays within what Lira can plausibly sense. Elision is purposeful and paid off in ritual cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly precise; images like “needle through silk” and “ice became a throat” carry multi‑function weight. Figurative density is high but controlled and consistent with the piece’s lyric aims. Minor risk of purple is offset by clear action sequencing and momentum. No scaffold loops or cadence templates mar the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—sonic absolution, an artifact of living sound, ice as sorrow conductor, a key that melts into memory—is distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. Ritual mechanics feel fresh and character‑driven rather than ornamental. The final reweighting (protection through translation) is elegant and non‑obvious. Risk‑taking in imagery and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
