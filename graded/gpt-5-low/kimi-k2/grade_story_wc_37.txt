<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and persistent—she aims to preserve the orchard/realm—and her actions align under pressure (kneeling to name the first peach; deploying the final tapestry). Interiority is embodied through sensory choices rather than labels (“air tasted of iron and lullabies”). The inner contradiction (clinging vs. letting go) is present but could surface more explicitly in on-page hesitation. The final cost—allowing her memories to scatter—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned singing and binding escalate toward the culminating sky-covering tapestry. Orientation is clean early (mica window, greenhouse, orchard at night) and the closure lands with cost and a reconfigured world state. The night’s pushback provides coherent pressure without breaking the lyric mode. The final image (memories scattering; orchard holding them) delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse/orchard is tactile and rule-bearing (mica panes brightening; roof surface enabling the sky-covering act). Setting details are integrated with action—songs alter panes; tapestry interacts with the structure—charging the closing image. The environment constrains tactics (climbing the central tree, covering the greenhouse). Sensory specificity (iron and lullabies; phoenix fireflies) sustains tone without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling a dying realm) is signaled early and tightened as the night actively unravels her song. She adapts: from general singing to naming a precise peach, then to blossom-swaddling, then to the final tapestry. Cost is legible in her fraying voice and the relinquishment of personal memory. Opposition remains atmospheric rather than agentive, but pressure still coheres and deepens effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory, inheritance, and the ethics of holding vs. releasing accrue through concrete acts (naming, grafting, swaddling). The ending reweights the premise: she chooses communal remembrance over personal retention, inviting a future recognition via a child’s peach. No moralizing; the resonance arises from image and action. Ambiguity lingers in a satisfying, purposeful way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close POV with a distinct perceptual signature (“air tasted of iron and lullabies”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; the final song without words is tonally apt. No head-hopping or stance wobble. Slight risk of uniform lyric intensity, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High line-level craft with dense yet coherent metaphor chains (thread/dawn/knit/swaddle) doing multiple jobs. Minimal scaffolding; sentences carry action and image without loops. A few lush runs edge toward purple but remain purposeful and legible, including at the climax. The final cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: woven dawns, mica panes, phoenix fireflies, and a greenhouse sky-tuck feel fresh and inevitable by the end. The risk of a purely decorative lyric is avoided because each image informs tactics. The mirror-world premise and communal-memory solution read as singular rather than templated. The last reconfiguration is both unexpected and earned.</comment>
