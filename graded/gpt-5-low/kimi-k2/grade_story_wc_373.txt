<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lila’s conflicting impulses—betray Roe to save her father vs. honor the truce—are embodied through tactile choices (thumb on the recorder, fob to lips, snapping the reel). Her final renunciation is earned by the setup and Roe’s photo reveal, with an on‑page cost to her father’s commutation prospects. Interiority remains concrete and character‑specific, avoiding platitudes. Minor convenience in Roe’s understanding doesn’t undercut motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean single‑scene structure with because/therefore causality: truce → recorder armed → Roe’s counter‑move (photo) → Lila’s reversal and destruction of evidence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with a visible sacrifice (fob surrendered, tape destroyed). The pressure window (“until sunrise,” 30 minutes left) tightens options. Slight convenience in Roe’s anticipatory photograph keeps it just shy of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The under‑pier pirate market is vividly sensoried (kerosene, cinnamon, gun oil) and functionally constraining via the hush/truce and no‑words rule. The watch fob and recorder operate as charged micro‑settings guiding choice. Environmental choreography (ladder, crate, cedar box) remains spatially consistent. Atmosphere deepens meaning without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (capture the sound to free her father), and escalation tightens through the repeated “false starts” until Roe’s photo forces a harder calculus. Lila’s decision forecloses a path with cost, not luck. Tension threads sentence‑level (near‑noises) to story‑level (deadline). The single deepening is sufficient at this length and lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of trust, surveillance, and the ethics of silence are enacted through the truce and the recorder rather than stated. The “false starts” motif evolves from ambiance to moral test, reweighted by the sigh at the end. The final renunciation offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Ambiguity remains meaningful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm match Lila’s sensibility. Elision (no dialogue per truce) is taught by the premise and paid off in subtext. No head‑hopping or stance drift. The cadence modulates under pressure without florid overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with evocative, purposeful imagery; lines do multiple jobs (setting, tension, character). A few metaphor stacks flirt with excess but stay coherent to the nautical/criminal palette. Momentum never stalls and syntax varies. The clipped final fragment slightly blunts the closing image’s polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “truce of hush” and “sound of trust breaking” frame is a fresh inflection on crime‑market scenes, with the recorder and fob integrating elegantly. The Roe photo turn is earned by prior hush dynamics rather than twistiness. Emotional specificity and object work avoid template beats. It takes a tasteful risk on quiet renunciation over gunfire and makes it land.</comment>
