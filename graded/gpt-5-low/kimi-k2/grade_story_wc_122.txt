<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is lucid and urgent, embodied through tactile teaching habits and escalated numbness. Her micro-choices (threading the needle, pressing forehead to skin, later teaching without words) reveal values with felt cost. Internal contradiction is present (skepticism versus ritual surrender), though it resolves smoothly. The change—regaining felt connection rather than hearing—is earned and character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual assembly → hush entering → reversed images → teaching reprise. Orientation is clear early (cavern, Garrick, goal), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the cost of confronting grief (tears, backward memories) and leaving a “spent key.” The because/therefore chain is ritualistically soft but coherent; cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cavern, drum, and copper disc are tactile and rule-setting, with environment and tools shaping tactics (vibration over sound) and charging the final images. Sensory choices fit a deaf POV—soles, wrists, skin—integrating setting with character priorities. The rules (hush filament, backward method) are taught through action rather than dumping. The setting’s hush recurs to power the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing numbness—tightens via ritual commitment and the embodied test of placing her forehead to the drum. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial; the images unspooling backward deepen pressure and exact a price (tears, grief revisitation). The school coda demonstrates consequence rather than introducing a new turn, which fits scope. Stakes remain intimate and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as fertile space rather than absence—emerges organically through action (vibration pedagogy, backward songs, the “spent key”). The final teaching beats reprice silence as score, not void, without moralizing. Recurring images (seasons, hush filament, tapping heartbeat) accrue weight and deepen meaning. The resonance lingers beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A precise, lyrical third-person closely tracks a tactile perceptual signature befitting a deaf music teacher. Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction remains consistent and motivated by sensory bias. Dialogue-by-sign is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext without exposition. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; metaphors (filament of hush, mirrored hush) cohere with drum/cavern imagery. A few intensities verge on purple, but clarity and momentum hold, and lines usually do double duty. No notable loops or scaffold; final images land cleanly. Density supports rather than smothers the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—drum maker’s cathedral, backward-recorded hush, tactile pedagogy—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (ritual mechanics, lyric closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific, not generic; objects and methods aren’t gimmicks but engines of change. The imagined physics of silence is fresh and consistent.</comment>
