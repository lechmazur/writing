<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (repair, protect, and expose) are coherent and intensify under pressure; contradictory impulses—anger versus gentleness, need to be “good” versus truth-telling—operate simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices (saline bath, pulling matrices, labeling “Mirage,” contacting an investigator) reveal a value hierarchy. The renunciation—letting go of being “purely good” for vigilant compassion—feels earned with a visible emotional cost. Slight tidiness in her resolution prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: the ritual of reconstruction tightens toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and causality holds as work begets realization and decision. Closure lands: she commits to report while shielding the chameleons, with the cost of vigilance and loss acknowledged. The cadence shift at dawn seals the before/after without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop, mist, skylight, and specialized tools aren’t decorative; they enable the bio‑regeneration, shape choices, and charge images (“constellations...like jury members”). The incubator and skylight evolve the atmosphere into the final charged image as dawn slices in. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true, balancing science and lyric. Environment and object-as-setting clearly constrain and empower action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: how to act without betraying compassion. Pressure coheres through procedural precision that deepens into ethical clarity (the key tightening: “report the crime yet shield the chameleons”). The price—abandoning naïve goodness for vigilant, regret-laced action—is legible. Limited external push keeps it shy of peak intensity, but the internal escalation is credible and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: repair as moral refusal, appearances as Mirage, gentleness that survives by evolving. Subtext in images—the jury of stars, spider silk tensile after rain—resonates without sermonizing. The final act/image reprices “gentleness” into vigilant compassion, answering the central question without stating a moral. It lingers with felt complexity and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (science‑laced tenderness) remains stable. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, letting anger pass “like weather” without breaking tone. No head‑hopping or illicit knowledge; compression and elision feel taught and paid off. Slight lushness in places doesn’t blur perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and purposeful; many sentences do double duty (worldbuilding and moral pressure). Rhythm varies well; images remain coherent with few modifiers wasted. Mild purple notes (“shimmering stillness,” “silver bruises”) verge on over‑ornate but don’t impede clarity. No loops or scaffold; closure image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Wildlife rescue meets speculative bio‑regeneration with a con aftermath—an original synthesis made specific by the tail tip and ethical matrices. The “shedding layers” method gives a fresh internal mechanism. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, not contrived. Boldness is measured, with authenticity over gimmick.</comment>
