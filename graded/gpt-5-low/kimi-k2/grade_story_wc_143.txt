<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, specific motives—duty and grief—drive her endurance, with micro‑choices (embedding the grain, calibrating the flash, staying in the cold) revealing a meticulous, devotional nature. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“catalogued every fracture...as if it were a love letter”). Internal contradiction—curiosity sharpened by grief—exists but remains quiet; little on‑page wobble under pressure limits complexity. Still, the final endurance choice feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive builds via a countdown and ritual prep to a charged final image. Orientation is crisp early; the capsule’s timing and the terminator’s kiss lock causality to the closing act. Closure lands on the page (violet flare/shutter) with a legible price (sacrifice of the grain, endurance against cold/time). The lens holds cleanly from setup through payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: cold drains the battery, thin air and the terminator’s geometry dictate timing, and the summit’s exposure heightens risk. Recurring objects (tripod, capsule, hourglass grain) are integrated into environment‑driven choices. Occasional plausibility fuzz (vacuum at summit) reads stylized rather than sloppy and doesn’t break the story’s internal logic. The final image is charged by place‑specific constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the last bloom before extinction—tightens through a real clock (30→20→10→5) and rising environmental pressure. The meaningful turn is the ignition/bloom convergence that forecloses failure and costs the hourglass grain. Escalation is coherent but largely linear; there’s no reversal beyond cadence tightening. Still, agency and cost are unmistakable at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Time, extinction, memory, and stewardship braid subtly through the hourglass grain, the orbital gardens, and the ghost orchid’s seven‑minute bloom. The violet flare that vaporizes the relic while mirroring the orchid reframes preservation as both witness and loss. No sermonizing; resonance arises from concrete ritual and image. The final shutter-click offers a non‑literal answer: to keep is to spend.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person closely held to the inspector’s sensibility; diction and metaphor are coherent with her professional gaze. Rhythm modulates with countdown beats, tightening at the end without forcing. No head‑hopping or register slips; the patterned elision (countdown time stamps) is taught and paid off. Voice remains distinctive and controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are economical yet lush, with images doing double duty (crater as cradle, breath as ghosts). Minimal scaffolding; momentum sustains through the countdown. Figurative density stays coherent; no mixed metaphor at the peak, and the final sentence lands cleanly. A few repeated motifs (“dawning hush”) risk redundancy but support cadence rather than stall it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lunar‑light orchid, a chem‑timed flare as both clock and elegy, and a crater inspector’s devotional craft. The hourglass grain’s sacrificial arc feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (poetic science, ritualized pacing) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
