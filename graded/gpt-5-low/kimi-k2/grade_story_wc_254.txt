<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motive (“the old ache…the need to stride through boundaries”) drives concrete actions—paraphrasing the ban, pressing the notebook, stepping through the membrane. Interiority is sensuous and embodied (iron/snow taste, tremor in the wrist). Internal contradiction is present but soft—fear dissolves rather than contends, so cost reads more conceptual than visceral. The arc from tremor to song is earned but not punishing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of boundary‑play intensifies (paraphrase → entry → membrane wrap → walking water) to a charged final image. Closure is a conceptual repricing—“the echo is already home” reframes the ban and symmetry at cost of the old order. Causal links are clear within the lyric logic (her paraphrase triggers the colonnade’s response; notebook inscription reweights rules). The cost is more metaphysical than material but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: the humming quartz and inverted lake dictate access, alter physics, and script the ending (dim to ember; water holding weight). Sensory specificity is high without museum‑tour excess; world rules are learned by interaction (glow dims on paraphrase, ink rises from keystone). The environment charges the final image (constellation‑filled silhouette over the lake). Anchors are early and stable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crossing forbidden symmetry—tightens through one meaningful deepening as the ban becomes about mirror/echo, not speech. Agency drives turns: paraphrasing to gain entry, notebook to rewrite rule, choosing translation over trespass. Prices are internal (she sheds fear, name, shadow edges), with limited tangible jeopardy. Tension is lyrical rather than peril‑driven but coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of borders as transformable perception lands through image chains (mirror, echo, membrane, translation) rather than sermon, with a resonant closing answer. The thesis appears in on‑world text (“What is forbidden…”), risking explicitness, but is earned by prior enactment. Final reweighting—echo already home—casts earlier acts as retranslation, not rebellion. Ambiguity lingers productively in the symmetry logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent diction (“lantern‑moth hush,” “throat of light”) and stable close third. Rhythm modulates well at turns (hum deepens; cadence slows at membrane wrap, quickens across the lake). No head‑hopping or register drift; purposeful elision feels taught from line one. Dialogue is spare and functions as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush imagery sustains clarity; most lines do double duty (world rule + emotion). Figurative density is high but coherent; motifs stay in one semantic field (echo/mirror/membrane) avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum holds through syntax variety. A few adjectives risk over‑ornamentation, but they don’t blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis—ban as symmetry, paraphrase as method, colonnade as responsive instrument—feels inevitable in hindsight. The notebook ink reversal and “water held her weight” image are memorable and non‑derivative. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without confusion. The piece commits to its strangeness and follows implications to a clean final reprice.</comment>
