<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arlen’s motive—to capture and file wonder before the wounded season closes—drives concrete micro‑choices (angle adjustments, not touching the moth‑memories, soldering the crack). His “peripheral focus” is dramatized as a constraint that reveals a temperament of restraint over indulgence. The renunciation at the peak (choosing storage over contact) reads as a credible, character‑specific cost. Emotional texture stays embodied and avoids generalized labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: measured angles, daylight/night/frost density, and reflections compound toward a charged poise ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: wonder is trapped, the timer runs in reverse, and the world reweights into “ordinary winter,” with the swallows gone. Cost is legible on the page—the choice forecloses immediate experience to preserve it. Orientation is clean by ~120 words and the two‑shard structure coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern’s reflective geometry and frost actively shape tactics (angle selection, candle use, shielding the mechanism). Objects/tools (timer, pillars, candle) function as micro‑settings that constrain options and charge the final image. World rules are learned through action (echoes harvested via angles) without exposition dumps. The environment persists into closure by contrast with the cellar and the healed‑to‑ordinary winter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early—secure wonder before the lull ends—and pressure coheres through nightfall, frost, and the discovery of the crack. The key tightening is the crack’s leak and Arlen’s decision to solder and reverse the mechanism, which closes off the path of unmediated experience. The price is felt but the intensity is purposefully quiet; escalation is more deepening than reversal. Still, agency drives the outcome and costs reweight the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—preservation vs experience, reason’s urge to domesticate wonder—is developed through particulars (angles, echoes as moths/leaves, the tin‑boxed laugh). The final cadence reframes earlier images: reverse ticking releases curated echoes while winter normalizes outside. No moralizing; resonance arises from the chosen containment and its quiet, ambivalent certainty. The cellar shelf (“Wonder, 3rd harvest”) is a potent revaluation of the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (“peripherally focused”) sustains pressure without opacity. Syntax and rhythm modulate well across beats (day to night to dawn) with purposeful diction. No head‑hopping; stance and psychic distance remain steady. Elision is taught and paid off in the reflective method rather than withholding facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush but disciplined; images earn their keep (sparks to moths, echoes as leaves) and carry multiple duties. Minimal scaffold or synonym loops; momentum holds through concrete action. Figurative language stays coherent to the reflection/echo motif, avoiding mixed metaphors in peak beats. Line rhythm supports the accumulative build without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of a locksmith reverse‑engineering wonder via angle‑coded reflections and a harvest of echoes feels original and inevitable in hindsight. The conceptual risk—trapping wonder in “the cellar of reason”—lands with felt cost rather than cleverness alone. Recurring objects/images reconfigure meaning at the end without gimmickry. The world logic is singular and fully committed within the brief span.</comment>
