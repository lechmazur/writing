<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rowan’s motives are concrete and escalate from self-soothing to restoring the conservatory, with embodied contradictions (fear vs. awe) driving action. Micro-choices (orienting forks, selecting gratitude, pressing the final fork to his heart) reveal a hierarchy of values. His realization—that the music is for the sanctuary, not ears—reconfigures his stance credibly. The only softness is the limited on‑page cost beyond vulnerability and surrender of the forks’ last chord.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the pattern of color-emotion intensifies through fork placement, prism-making, and culminates in a green chord that thaws frost and stirs the bird. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with a physical effect and a conceptual repricing (music for glass). Causality is clean and props are earned. The cost is implied (expenditure of emotion, relinquishing the last chord) rather than explicit, keeping it just shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory and its rules constrain tactics: no sound world, reliance on glass, light, and moon; shards/prisms become tools; the lemon tree and bird anchor the final charge. World rules are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. The environment directly shapes choices and charges the final image. Sensory specificity (color as heat, frost retreating into droplet-reflections) is purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating silence into life—is clear early and tightens as Rowan shifts from individual regulation to rectifying the entire space. The meaningful turn is pressing the fork to his own heart, prompting convergence and visible change. Pressure is coherent and grows, though the visible price is subtle rather than sharply foreclosing a path. Absence of an antagonist is not a deficit here.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as a medium, “unshaken marvels” awaiting translation, and music reframed as color/heat. The final realization reweights all prior images without stating a moral, and the bird/tree tableau hums with implication. Resonance lingers through concrete particulars (golden droplets, empty case). Minor deduction since the cost component is more implied than felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyric, and character-filtered; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head-hopping. The perceptual signature (synesthetic color-emotion) stays coherent and purposeful. Elision is taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue is needed; the stance remains stable and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; imagery often does two jobs (world-building and emotional calibration). Lines like “shards of frozen dolphinsong” and “heat-caterpillars” stay legible and character-specific. No paraphrase loops or scaffold bloat; momentum persists. A hint of purple flourish exists but does not blur causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The noiseless world solved via emotion‑mapped tuning forks and glass optics feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects (forks, glass, lemon tree, bird) synthesize into an original closure image. Risk-taking is purposeful, not gimmicky. The conceptual pivot—music for a non-auditory audience—elevates the premise.</comment>
