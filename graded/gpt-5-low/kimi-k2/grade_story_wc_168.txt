<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—translating guilt into something shareable—drives every micro‑choice, from where she stops to how she handles the box. Contradictory impulses (protector vs. survivor’s guilt) are embodied in concrete images (the rookie’s curled glove, the scar as “text”). The renunciation at the end (returning innocence, accepting scar) feels earned. Slight neatness in the sky‑written “forgive” risks over‑tidiness but doesn’t undercut the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: ritual actions intensify meaning until the “forgive” and innocence‑repriced ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she forecloses a self‑punishing stance and accepts a charged stasis. Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the scene remains continuous and coherent. The porcelain box’s open/close and the ridge’s seam image stitch structure cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ridge, moonlight, and wind‑sculpted pines are specific and lived‑in; moonlight becomes functional, enabling the prisming and auroras. The porcelain box acts as a micro‑setting that charges the final seam image. Sensory detail stays purposeful and filtered through a firefighter’s bias. Environment tangibly shapes the ritual and the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (atonement via translation) are established early and intensify as the ritual proceeds to the aurora and sky‑word, narrowing her internal options. The meaningful tightening is the shift from bargaining with fire to repricing innocence; cost is acceptance rather than erasure. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens. The conflict stays internal but never static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, protection, and forgiveness emerge organically from ritual and image rather than thesis. “Pain…not a wound but a prism” reframes the premise and is paid off by the moonlight colors and the townward drift. The final recognition—innocence lent and returned—reweights everything without sermonizing. The sky‑spelled “forgive” toes the line of literalness but resonates through prior setup.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization and no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—measured description to charged cadence at the aurora/forgive beat. Diction fits a seasoned firefighter with poetic acuity; metaphors stay character‑filtered. The lone spoken line is purposeful and in voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax and purposeful variation; few if any scaffold lines. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and disciplined; extended metaphors (prism, seam) stay consistent. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates dull momentum. A couple images approach sentiment, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—wildfire trauma alchemized via a porcelain reliquary into auroral language—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects and celestial motion are innovatively leveraged without gimmickry. The risk of the literal “forgive” pays off due to groundwork and the innocence‑as‑loan twist. Distinct vision and integrity carry the piece.</comment>
