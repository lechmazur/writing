<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysandra’s motive—recovering and returning lost conversations while confronting her own half-truths—is specific and consistent, and her micro-choices (piecing the map, choosing to speak apologies, engaging strangers) reveal a credible internal shift. The embodied tells (plants wilting near dishonesty, mint-scented apologies) ground her contradiction between performative beauty (gilded ink) and plainspoken need. The change to plain rice paper and the plan to read aloud register a felt renunciation. External resistance is light, but the emotional price is clear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under a Hybrid lens (causal spine with lyric accumulation), the sequence is coherent: find map → decode → descend to jars → test honesty rule → accept mission to return words → plant and commit to reading. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive behavioral change on the page (speaking to strengthen the vapor; shifting to plain paper). Costs are emotional and vocational (abandoning gilded artifices). Escalation could use one sharper external counterforce, but causality holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky actively constrain speech and movement (acid rain, respirators), and the mango tree/hatch/archives concretely guide choices. Recurring objects (vines, jars, map, ink) charge the final image of silver-leaf tea and plain paper. World rules (lies wilt life; honesty preserves vapor) are shown in action, not told. The setting meaningfully shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering and returning honest speech, especially the brother’s) is clear early; pressure tightens with the archive’s rule that lies dissipate—forcing her to speak at cost. A meaningful turn occurs when she rereads the map and discovers the “return” path, shifting her from seeking to bearing responsibility. External obstacles are minimal; stakes lean internal but remain legible and paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of candor as restorative is earned through concrete acts (apologies brightening vapor; speaking with strangers greenings vines) rather than declared morals. The finale reweights prior motifs: she trades gilded artifice for plain paper and living tea that bears voices—an organic, non-didactic answer. It resists pat symmetry by acknowledging cost and ongoing labor (reading aloud at dusk). The archive’s rule integrates concept and theme without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close with a strong perceptual signature (“ink mixed from copper sulfate and hope,” “apology that smelled of crushed mint”) stays consistent and character-bound. The rhythm modulates well between wonder and urgency; elision patterns are taught and legible. No head-hopping or register slips; the lyricism remains purposeful under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but the voiced jar functions effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and economical; most sentences do more than one job (world, emotion, motion) without scaffold or loops. Figurative density is high but coherent to the motif-set (plants, metals, speech as vapor). The final image is clean and propulsive; no muddled metaphors in peak beats. Minor lushness never obscures causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—archiving spoken truth as vapor, plants that wilt near lies, and a greenhouse city under acid skies—feels singular and internally logical. Turns arise from character agency (apologizing to stabilize a voice; choosing to return words). The risk of embracing a fully metaphorized ecology of honesty pays off in a fresh, inevitable-feeling end image. High originality without gimmickry.</comment>
