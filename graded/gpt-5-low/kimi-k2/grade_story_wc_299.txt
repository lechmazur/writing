<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elliot’s contradictory impulses—armoring himself with provenance vs. confronting grief—are embodied and culminate in a credible, costly choice to leave hiding and give the cloth away. Micro-choices (turning the cloth, smelling it, pressing it to his chest) reveal value hierarchy. The renunciation of his insulating tactic feels earned by prior beats. No safety‑hedging: he accepts pain as the price of movement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of sound/silence and object handling tightens toward the decision to deliver the cloth. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost—he foregoes the refuge of facts and the trailer to face the past. Orientation is clear early and the single scene holds together. The causal link from reframing the cloth (“not a relic; a question”) to action is clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The quarry trailer and “echo valley” atmosphere are vivid, multi‑sensory, and filtered through a roadie’s ear. Setting subtly mirrors and pressures the internal state (machine clanks as snare, quarry as wound) and frames his hiding. While it charges the final image (stepping into night air), it doesn’t strictly constrain options, tempering ceiling. Object-as-setting (cloth) strongly charges the close.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep insulating or risk pain—tightens through a cadence shift when facts “fall away.” The choice to give the cloth away forecloses a path (continued hiding) with emotional cost and a specific next step (find the sister). Escalation is internal but coherent and suffices at this length. External pressure is light, keeping it just shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motifs of applause/silence, echo, and the charged object evolve to a resonant non‑literal answer: give the echo “somewhere to go.” Thematic clarity is earned through particulars rather than moralizing, though a couple explicit statements (“The cloth wasn’t a relic; it was a question”) reduce subtlety slightly. Emotional aftereffect is steady and honest. Complexity remains without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, sensorially precise, and character‑specific (gear and tour detail as lexicon). POV distance remains stable with clean free indirect texture and purposeful lyric turns. Rhythm modulates with pressure, landing the final quiet without drift. No head‑hopping or register clashes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; imagery is largely clean and consistent. A mild tendency toward stacked metaphors (“last chord,” “echo valley longing,” “scar”) skirts purple but doesn’t blur sense. Sentences vary in length and propulsion fits the scene’s tempo. Final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ex‑roadie/antique appraiser in a quarry with a Marshall cloth is an uncommon, authentic synthesis. The “after the applause” frame and object‑centric pivot feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are quiet rather than flashy, but they cohere. Familiar grief terrain is individualized through tactile, lived‑in specifics.</comment>
