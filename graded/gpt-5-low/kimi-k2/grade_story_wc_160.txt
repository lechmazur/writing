<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motives and competence are clear and embodied: she measures, calibrates, and decides under pressure to balance water and rest. The trembling→certainty progression is specific and earned (“hands trembled again, but this time from certainty”). Internal contradiction is modest (duty vs. reverence), and she faces it through calibrated action rather than speechifying. Slight lack of visible sacrifice keeps it shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causality is tight: cipher→amphitheater→measurement→lever→water’s murmur, with a clean cadence of activation and response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—gentle flow, slowed turbines implied, volcano at rest—anchored by her deliberate calibration. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, but legible. The final sentence fragment softens the cadence slightly without breaking closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amphitheater-in-volcano and the surveyor’s chain shape tactics and imagery; environment constrains the choice (risk of waking magma) and charges the final images (chain singing, coiled). Details are selective and POV-filtered (pumice motes, pine resin, warm exhale), integrating setting into action. World rules feel consistent and learned through doing. Strong integration without gratuitous cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—balance power vs. mountain’s rest—is clear early and tightens at the lever pull with real risk. Escalation is quiet but coherent: precise tension to avoid awakening magma while restoring water. The visible price is muted (no on-page loss; slower turbines are imagined), keeping the pressure more ethical than visceral. Still, the agency-driven act convincingly reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of engineered compassion emerges through particulars (cipher as “encrypted compassion,” calibrated chain, gentle water) and culminates in a reweighted world. The “ingenuity could indeed be kind” line edges toward moral statement but is supported by scene work. Subtext carries through recurring images rather than thesis. Resonance lingers in the mountain’s “lullaby” and the chosen moderation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled POV with a distinct observational lexicon grounded in Lira’s craft. Rhythm and diction mostly match the character’s sensibility, with patterned phrases (“sing,” “breathe”) used purposefully. No head-hopping; free indirect texture is steady. Slight purple shimmer at times, but it serves the mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is often elegant, with images doing multiple jobs and minimal scaffolding. Some density of figurative language flirts with excess but remains coherent. The unfinished final sentence is a notable artifact in the closing beat, dulling the cadence. Minor repetition (“dappled resolve”) and echoing metaphors add a faint glaze.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a machinist decoding gold-leaf adhesive to tune a volcano’s hydrology under a credo of “encrypted compassion.” The chain as instrument and metronome is an original, functional motif. The ethical calculus is non-obvious and enacted rather than declared. Bold without gimmickry, though the risks stay contemplative rather than harrowing.</comment>
