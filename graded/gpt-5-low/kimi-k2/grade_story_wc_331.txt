<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mireille’s motive—listening for where stories live—is clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (avoiding creaks, following the scarf, touching the coordinate) revealing character. The “provisional” belief earns credibility and shades her risk. However, internal contradiction remains understated; the piece favors poise over contested impulse. The cost registers as stewardship weight rather than an emotionally fraught trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern intensifies (Fibonacci flicker → hyperbolic aisles → copper book → reawakening), then resolves to a reweighted stasis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the library’s “inhale,” altered light, and the scarf’s new weight mark a before/after. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no causality breaks. The on‑page cost is conceptual and custodial, not visceral, which slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated; the scientific‑poetry library and its rules (equations as narratives, hyperbolic aisles) both constrain action and charge the ending. Sensory selection is specific and voice‑filtered (“hot toner and cold starlight,” “Möbius strip” drool). Recurring objects (scarf, copper book) function as micro‑settings that shape choice. The environment directly enables the central turn and infuses the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens: the geometry’s bending narrows options, the scarf’s tug compels a test, and the touch triggers a library‑wide shift. The dominant stake (finding the living place of stories) is established and meaningfully tightened. The price—bearing awakened voices and altered solitude—is felt but gentle, keeping tension elegant rather than harrowing. No antagonistic force, but the escalation cadence is clean and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—stories living in the charged interval between reader and read—emerges through image systems and is reweighted by the ending. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis (“not on the page, not in the mind...”), muting subtext and inviting Thematic Echo penalties. Earlier images (hydrogen love letter, protein‑fold diary) do strong thematic work without saying it. The resonance remains, but subtlety slips at the finish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature (math‑poetic diction) stays stable and apt. Rhythm modulates with pressure; sentences breathe around the hyperbolic turn and tighten at the reawakening. No head‑hopping; distance is well‑managed without over‑explaining. Slight risk of ornamental flourish is largely countered by coherence and intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, purposeful metaphors that mostly reinforce the science‑poetry braid. Minimal scaffold; images often do double duty for plot and mood. Lushness approaches overload but avoids muddle due to consistent vehicle domains and clear sequencing. The line “the hush that lives between footnotes and heartbeats” typifies the controlled richness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—hyperbolic geometry in a scientific poetry library, analog memories incarnate, scarf as conduit—feels both fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (math‑lyric fusion, conceptual closure) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from seeded particulars rather than late rule drops. The codex’s complex coordinate as inciting sigil is especially inventive.</comment>
