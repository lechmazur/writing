<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lin’s interiority is vivid and embodied—“turned gunfire into grammar” versus helpless sister—yielding credible contradictory impulses. Micro‑choices (decoding the cast, pressing coral, asking for the planting ritual) reveal values under pressure. The cost is quiet but legible: acceptance that “the arm will remember the break” and her own fear dissolving into shared night. Secondary presence (Dr. Vanna) supports rather than dilutes the core relationship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece deepens through the code, coral, and ritual to a charged poise. Orientation is early and clean; the single scene coheres. Closure lands with cost in the on‑page ask to plant the coral and the recognition of enduring injury. The final image reweights everything without mechanical tying‑off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The atrium, mist, and garden are sensorially rich and filtered through Lin’s priorities. The brain coral functions as object‑setting, charging the final image and shaping action (pressing a print, then planting). Environmental tone and tools constrain mood and options (anesthetic hush enables decoding; garden enables ritual). Specificity avoids cataloging and stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding meaning and solace while the brother undergoes surgery—is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation is a textural tightening: from waiting to decoding to the ritual request, foreclosing the path of passive dread. The cost is acceptance of trauma’s archive rather than resolution. No antagonist needed; pressure remains internal but focused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: translation, reef ecology, and bodily memory braid into “shared anxieties” without sermonizing. The coral motif reconfigures at the end (from relic to planted ritual), offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. Subtext lives in gesture (saline watering) and silence (hush, breath). The piece resists tidy morals while delivering coherent meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled; POV stays tight to Lin with consistent diction. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual (“the arm will remember the break”). Rhythm modulates with pressure without head‑hopping or register drift. Patterned lyricism is taught early and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, with high information density and purposeful imagery (“iodine and orchids,” “ghost reef”). A touch of lushness (“lotus‑hearted ache”) risks purple but remains coherent with the frame. No loops or scaffolding slow momentum; sentences vary and propel. Final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—translator in a war hospital using a brain coral as ritual technology—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The saline‑watering idea and cipher on a child’s cast feel genuinely inventive and character‑true. Risk‑taking in lyric form heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids templates and lands an authentic, singular stance.</comment>
