<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent: align with “purpose” despite “stellar doubt.” The tension between quiet enthusiasm and doubt animates micro‑choices (coin placement, listening, accepting the backwards prophecy). Bodily and sensory focus (hums, chord shifts, the lens touching her forehead) grounds emotion. The final acceptance of dissolution feels earned, with felt cost implied in her surrender to the light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scene tightens from coin‑circle hum to voice confirmation to the lens’ birth and her dissolution. Closure lands on the page with cost—she fuses the coins, sends light, and dissolves, reconfiguring cause and origin (CR with RR). Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when). No causality breaks; the backwards prophecy directly shapes options and the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, coins, and telescope are not mere backdrop; they constrain tactics (arranging coins, filtering through a cracked lens) and charge the final image (deck resonating, then dissolving). Specifics like “ambered” resin walls, cracked console, and “shattered spider’s eye” lens create tactile stakes. The setting evolves with action (vibrates, flickers, dissolves), mirroring the internal shift without heavy symbolism. Strong economy and integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (alignment with purpose before total dark) is signaled early and coherently escalates via pattern shifts (coin adjustments → voice confirmation → telescope focus → newborn light). The pressure clarifies rather than multiplies, appropriate to the accumulative lens. The price—self‑dissolution—arrives as a committed choice, closing other paths. No luck‑based resolution; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—retrocausal purpose, fate vs. agency, meaning after endings—emerges from particulars and the final reweighting (the light she sends becomes the beginning). Subtext rides images (coins into a single lens; “Nothing mattered, therefore everything did” reframes nihilism). One aphoristic line borders on overt thesis, slightly softening subtlety. The ending’s resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature: science‑poetic diction filtered through Mira’s focus on frequencies, chords, and wavelengths. Psychic distance is stable and modulates under pressure with control. No head‑hopping or register drift; the pattern of poetic compression is taught early and paid off at closure. Voice and stance fit the conceptual stakes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multi‑function imagery without clog; rhythm varies, maintaining momentum. Figurative language is rich but coherent, with few mixed metaphors; minor lushness is balanced by clear action lines. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops that dull turns. The final third stays sharp and legible despite heightened lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy as memory, galactic coins as lens, and retroactively initiating a new universe feel fresh and internally inevitable. The fusion of commerce fossils into a cosmological seed is an inventive synthesis. The risk of high lyric density pays off with clear closure and conceptual cost. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>
