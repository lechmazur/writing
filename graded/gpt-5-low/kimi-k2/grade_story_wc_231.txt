<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation (decode the stranger’s gesture and shoulder what she left) anchors every micro‑choice, and emotions are embodied through tactile action (counting gaps, scent‑triggered memory). The internal turn—from uncertainty to chosen burden—reads earned, with a felt price in accepting grief. A touch more on his resistance or competing impulse would deepen the crucible. Still, the keeper’s specificity and method reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: attention → observation of gaps → memory transfer → vow. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he chooses to bear the memories, pins the Edelweiss, writes, and promises, with the cost legible in the wilting petals. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no causality breaks. The final image reweights isolation into stewardship with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful—mist erases, the beam sweeps, the dock’s negative spaces become active terrain for the method. The Edelweiss and lantern function as micro‑setting objects that charge the final image. Environmental rules remain consistent and learned through action (mist thinning to reveal a silhouette). Slight constraint on choice (beyond mood) keeps this just short of transcendent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent: understand/contain the stranger’s bequeathed memories. Escalation is a textured tightening—studying gaps, receiving the first vivid borrowed memory, then actively “pouring” memories into named vacancies. The cost is present (he accepts burden; the flower wilts), and the vow forecloses a path (his own forgetting). A single decisive deepening rather than multiple turns, but sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resonant meditation on grief transfer, witness, and the ethics of remembering emerges from particulars (Edelweiss scent → avalanche boy → vow). Subtext works through image and silence rather than moralizing; isolation is redefined as communal stewardship. The final repricing—“isolation is no longer empty; it is witnessed”—elegantly answers the piece’s question. No platitudes; the cost keeps the resonance honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical single‑POV voice with consistent perceptual bias (negative spaces, scent, tidal metaphors). Rhythm modulates well between slow attention and sharper turns (“He gasps”). Elision is purposeful and legible; no head‑hopping or register slips. A few high‑ornament lines flirt with excess but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet clear; images do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Minimal scaffolding; syntax and paragraphing breathe with the scene’s pressure. Lyrical figurations stay coherent (opal, mist, tide, alpine air) without mixed metaphors or loops. Very slight purple tendency in places, but it doesn’t dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper as custodian of borrowed memories, decoding via “gaps,” Edelweiss as alpine ghost in a salt world—feels fresh and inevitable. Risks in concept and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. The silhouette returning backward from tide is a striking, specific turn. Small conventional anchors (keeper archetype) are transformed through method and object.</comment>
