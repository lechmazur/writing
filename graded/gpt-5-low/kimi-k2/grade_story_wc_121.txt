<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—escape the self‑labyrinth—and the internal contradiction (compulsion to retrace vs. desire to land) sharpens under pressure. Embodied moments like boots hovering and the hospital floor constant ground the psyche in concrete images. The renunciation (throwing the tablet) feels earned by prior beats (runes fixing, algorithm looping). A touch of declarative insight (“the labyrinth is not outside you”) edges toward on‑the‑nose but is paid off by action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning accumulative until a decisive causal act: density and patterning intensify, then the explicit choice to “surrender the thread” reconfigures options. Closure lands cleanly when she hurls the tablet and gravity returns; cost is legible as the loss of her retracing compulsion. Orientation is set early and holds through the surreal turns. No stray setups; the hospital floor recurrence and the runes fixing pay the final turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The viaduct, rain, and tablet aren’t postcard scenery; they constrain tactics (hovering, warnings in liquid light, a live pause “between the drop and the ripple”). Environmental shifts mirror and pressure choices (procedural segments failing, hospital floor constant), and the tablet charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, not touristic. World rules stay consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens: algorithmic generation glitches, the runes stop resetting, and a single constant forces confrontation with the core wound. The instruction “surrender the thread” reframes the initial goal, demanding a trade‑off. The throw forecloses a path with cost (giving up the tool and identity premise of retracing) and yields the earned stasis of gravity. Stakes remain internal but are dramatized physically.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of control vs. surrender and self as maze emerge through image systems (viaduct, ripple, thread) and reweight at the end with a quiet, resonant “now.” The final image conceptually reprices prophecy into presence without moralizing. One line voices the thesis too directly, slightly flattening subtext, but subsequent beats earn it. Overall resonance lingers with cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, coherent lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“glass breaking in reverse,” “periodically eternal”) sustains throughout. Psychic distance modulates cleanly under pressure, and the pattern is taught early and honored. No head‑hopping or register slips. Compression serves momentum rather than obscuring it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with varied rhythm; lines often do dual work of world and psyche. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and consonant with the story’s physics, avoiding muddle. Minimal scaffold or loops; images progress rather than restate. A few stacked metaphors approach lushness but do not blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: “periodically eternal” as a property, procedural generation of architecture, and a self‑labyrinth literalized through time fractures. The decisive renunciation reframes a familiar quest trope with specificity and consequence. Risks in diction and structure heighten stakes without losing clarity. The final puddle‑ripple image is memorable and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
