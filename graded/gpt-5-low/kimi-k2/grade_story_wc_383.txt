<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is explicit and propulsive: rescue her mother’s mind before the garden dissolves. Her internal tension—sorrow versus the fierceness of independence—plays through tactile micro‑choices (matching and quickening her heartbeat, lifting the shell, not looking back). Reactions remain embodied and specific, not labeled. The final endurance/renunciation (accepting the garden’s loss and the voice’s silence) feels earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres around the live clock and the ritual’s cadence. The closure lands cleanly: the garden is gone, the voice falls silent, and the archive lives within—an on‑page cost with a before/after hinge. Orientation is clear by the first lines; the pattern (resonance → deeper access → collapse/translation) is taught and paid off. No causal gaps or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The velvet garden and the shell are deeply integrated, not decorative: they determine pathing, method, and the final image. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful; the environment constrains choices (lectern, rearranging paths, dawn limit) and charges the ending. The vacant lot turn reweights the space with loss. World rules are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (archive before dawn) are signaled early and tighten with the shell’s warning and the star’s fade. Agency drives escalation: she matches and quickens her heartbeat, accepts the price, and removes the shell, triggering collapse. Cost is unmistakable—the garden dissolves and the mother’s voice quiets—even as meaning is carried forward. The pressure remains coherent without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory versus autonomy is rendered through concrete acts of translation and renunciation rather than moralizing. Recurring images (shell, petals/letters, fading star) shift meaning at the end to answer the story’s question without telling it. A slight overt statement (“translate isolation into independence”) trims subtlety, but the final hush and embodied carry reassert resonance. The emotional aftereffect lingers without neat simplification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is consistent, selective, and confident; perception and diction feel character‑bound. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and purposeful elision is taught by the voice from the start. The shell’s brief dialogue integrates as action rather than exposition. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is elegant and mostly efficient, with strong verbs and layered images doing multiple jobs. A dense metaphorical texture risks saturation (“velvet,” “pale fire,” “bruised sky”), but clarity and momentum persist. No paraphrase loops or scaffolded repeats dull the peak beats. The closure image is crisp and unsmudged by prose artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—neural garden quarantine, a mind in a seashell, heartbeat resonance as method—feels singular and inevitable. Turns grow from the established logic, and the final repricing (“I am not gone, only translated”) reframes the premise with authority. The risks in language and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template arcs and ornaments with lived specificity.</comment>
