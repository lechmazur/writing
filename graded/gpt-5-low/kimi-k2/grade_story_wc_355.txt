<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s pacifism is tested against her “almost struck back” memory, and her micro‑choices (tuning, singing, refusing force) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. Embodied perception (sawdust, ozone, tools as “reluctant soldiers”) grounds emotion. The cost—reopening a sealed regret—lands via the bruised thumbprint. Slight softness: success arrives with little struggle on the page, muting contradiction under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual actions deepen pressure until the clasp “sighs” and the memory reconfigures the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—empathy “locking open”—with visible emotional cost in the bruise and replayed night. Orientation is clean from the opening, and setups (tools, frequencies, fireworks) pay off. The path unfolds smoothly, with minimal risk of failure, slightly limiting felt jeopardy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop and sky are tactile and functional: tools enable the nonviolent method; skylight and fireworks modulate cadence and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true (“starlight dripped,” “lavender and rust” harmonics). Environment constrains action toward acoustic unlocking. The final light wash gilding the clasp ties setting to resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover the feared silence without violence—is clear, and pressure coheres through the methodical tuning sequence. The tightening arrives when the clasp remembers and the thumbprint forces her to face the near‑violence. However, escalation lacks a real reversal; the process rarely threatens to fail or exact more than interior cost. Still, agency drives the turn and forecloses the path of force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: empathy as a shared frequency, silence as fullness rather than absence. Recurring objects (clasp, tools, fireworks) reweight meaning at the end. One explicit statement (“empathy is not a gift given…”) flirts with didacticism but is earned by the enacted ritual. The dedication line risks sentimentality yet is buffered by strong image work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm fit “theatrical sincerity.” POV is stable, with controlled psychic distance that tightens at key beats. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible through closure. Minor purple edges don’t disrupt clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery; verbs are strong and syntax varied. A few stacked metaphors (“starlight dripped,” “tools as soldiers,” “fireworks as war drums turned celebration”) approach saturation but stay coherent. No loops or scaffold bog momentum. Rhythm supports the accumulative pressure to the final click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The conceit—cataloguing silences and unlocking regret by tuning frequencies—is fresh and integrated. The fireworks clock and workshop acoustics synthesize into a non‑obvious but inevitable finish. Risk‑taking in tone and method heightens stakes without obscuring sense. The final “empathy locking open” image reframes earlier particulars convincingly.</comment>
