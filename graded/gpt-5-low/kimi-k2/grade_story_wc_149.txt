<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (repay a debt, free the trapped soul) drives the action, and contradictory impulses (love and betrayal) are embodied in tactile images (frosting fruit, the bead warming). The choice to press bead to fruit is earned by prior lifetimes and her stewardship of the greenhouse. Internal struggle is more told than dramatized in the moment, so micro‑choices under pressure feel limited. Still, the visible cost—her dissolution—is convincingly tied to her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: nightly guardianship → approach to brightest fruit → bead pressed → soul transfer → forgiveness → dissolution → dawn. Closure lands on the page with cost (her vanishing) and world‑level reconfiguration (endless night breaks). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the hybrid causal/accumulative pattern holds. Minor softness in on‑page resistance prevents a higher tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse and endless night are integral to choice and consequence; the environment literally reframes the ending as dawn cracks the blackened glass. Details (silver leaves, star‑fruit, soot‑painted panes) are vivid and filtered through the bride’s history with the place. The setting constrains tactics and charges the final images (ordinary fruit post‑release). World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing his soul/settling the debt) is clear early, and escalation concentrates at the bead‑to‑fruit act where the greenhouse shudders. The visible price—her dissolution—reads on the page. However, there’s little active opposition or risk of failure beyond internal resolve, so the tightening is singular rather than layered. The turn still feels earned under the accumulative/causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of debt, love’s complicity in betrayal, and redemption emerge organically from recurring images (bead, fruit, frost, dawn). The forgiveness line risks explicitness but is supported by concrete costs and prior particulars, avoiding moralizing. The final image (bead under the oldest tree, warmth humming) reweights the whole. Complexity remains without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature suited to a centuries‑bound ghost. Rhythm and diction are consistent and modulate effectively in the climax (shuddering greenhouse, dissolving bead). No head‑hopping or stance leakage. A couple of repeated phrases (“ephemeral cameo appearances”) are noticeable but not damaging.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful images; lines often do double duty (world‑building and motive). The prose maintains clarity even amid metaphor, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Minor repetition and one or two abstractions (“resonant awakenings”) are redeemed by consistent usage and payoff. No significant scaffolding or muddled metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard + endless night + ghost bride + bead is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable by the end. The soul‑fruit ecology and soot‑black glass are specific and memorable, and the resolution avoids genre cliché. Risks (lyric compression, mythic register) pay off without obscuring clarity. The core twist (dawn returns as her price) is earned.</comment>
