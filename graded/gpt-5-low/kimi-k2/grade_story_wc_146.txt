<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The tuner’s motive—restore balance—reads cleanly through action, but interiority is intentionally withheld, limiting complexity. His patience shapes micro‑choices (pausing, adjusting stride, stepping back), giving him agency without a confessional mind. The old woman’s hum and the silent procession provide relational texture without dialogue. The renunciation at the end (letting the rhythm continue without him) lands as a credible, if quiet, cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: footsteps → bell strike → arch strike → procession → ghosts → renunciation. Orientation is strong from the archway entry; pattern is taught early and paid off. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s pulse resumes and the tuner cedes control, with the arch “singing” and the bell ringing on its own. Cost is modest but present in his withdrawal and in the town’s reweighted boundary between living and dead.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific across senses (“tasted of rain and cedar,” mortar dust like breath), and spatial choreography is clean. The archway and fountain function as charged sites—tools that enable key acts (summoning ghosts; balancing the fork) and inflect the final image. World rules are learned through action, not explanation, and remain consistent. The recurring objects (bell, fork, arch) decisively charge the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres via density and layering rather than antagonism: the rhythm gathers bodies, then the dead, culminating in the tuner’s relinquishment. The dominant stake—restore the town’s pulse—tightens through two meaningful escalations (bell, then arch) and a final stance shift. Cost is felt but understated; no hard trade‑off beyond renunciation, which keeps it below the highest band. Tension operates at cadence and image rather than conflict beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: community remembering itself, balance between living and almost‑living, art as restoration through restraint. The fork’s final stillness and the town’s self‑sustaining rhythm offer a non‑literal answer about stewardship versus control. No moralizing; resonance comes through image and pattern. Ambiguity about the ghosts’ ongoing presence deepens the aftereffect without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person voice with disciplined cadence and sensory precision; patterning is taught and controlled. Psychic distance is steady; no head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythmic prose mirrors the on‑page rhythm without syntactic monotony. Compression and elision serve mood and remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing double duty; metaphors are coherent and grounded in the milieu. Varied sentence rhythm keeps momentum while sustaining hush. Minimal redundancy; no template cadences that dull the beat. The final line recharges prior motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—revival by a bell tuner via communal rhythm—is fresh, and the execution commits fully without gimmickry. The archway as instrument, the fork balancing, and the “wild hush” tonal arc feel singular. Risks in lyric accumulation pay off with a clear closure image. Emotional truth is carried by image and restraint rather than explanation.</comment>
