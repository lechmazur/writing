<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motivation (to listen, decode, and bridge mistrust) drives embodied micro‑choices: crouching, using the lens, writing the reply, offering a hand. The ex‑registrar’s ledger with red corrections externalizes cost credibly. Internal contradiction is mild—the registrar moves smoothly from caution to invitation with little friction—so the struggle feels low‑risk. Still, the relationship turn is earned and credible at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs (lens, tickets, crystal hush) build toward a resonant reconciliation. Closure lands on the page via the ledger’s red corrections and the mutual handling of the lens—an on‑page reconfiguration with conceptual cost (authority surrendered, trust reset). Orientation is clean from the first lines, and causal links (decode → invite → descend → ledger) hold. Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the center puddles delivers earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the rain‑slick marble, crystal columns, and cloisters shape acoustics and posture (“forecourt carries every breath”), charging how they listen and respond. The micro‑setting of puddles as mirrors recurs to frame the union and the final clarity image. The environment influences tactics subtly more than it constrains, so its role is strong but not determinative. Consistent atmospheric rules and selective detail keep it grounded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether honesty can rebuild trust—is legible early and tightens when the ticket’s doodles resolve into confession and she replies in kind. The ex‑registrar’s descent and open ledger mark the meaningful pressure turn; authority is relinquished in view of a potential relational cost. Escalation is gentle; resistance is minimal, but the price of exposure and acceptance is clear. The cadence deepening fits the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lens as honesty’s figure evolves from object to shared instrument, and the final cloud‑and‑clear breath reweights the whole. The theme “truth as weight and relief” emerges from action, not sermonizing, despite one aphoristic line. The ending’s composed image offers a non‑literal answer: clarity as a carryable burden. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close sustains a distinct perceptual signature (questions in footsteps, stone “comment”). Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and in character, with subtext doing the work. Psychic distance modulates cleanly at turns without leakage. No withheld knowledge artifices; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and images pull double duty; diction is precise without excess. Occasional phrase recurrence (“ambiguously clear”) reads as motif, not filler. A touch of purple is present but coherent to voice and scene. Momentum holds; no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors dull the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—ledgered fraud, a projector lens as honesty device, cryptic doodles decoded by light in a crystal forecourt—feels fresh and unified. The reconciliation avoids cliché through tactile particulars (red ink corrections, paper filter in the brass gate). Risks in tone and setting pay off without obscuring clarity. The conceptual turn is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
