<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is precise and consistent—she’s driven to decode the tear and the chapel’s silence—and her methodical choices (projector setup, frame alignment, the decision to press and then leave the map) track cleanly. The “shielded openness” gives her interiority specificity, though true internal contradiction is subtle rather than strongly dramatized. The visible cost is quiet—she forfeits the map and accepts the wound’s truth—but it lands. A touch more friction or risk in the chapel could have deepened the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of observation → alignment → shadow fingers → adhesion → reweighting of absence delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the throughline is cohesive. The cost is legible in her renunciation and new ethic of mapping. One could wish for a slightly sharper on‑page consequence, but the closure image convinces.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The chapel’s rain‑scoured vault, broken rose window, and frescoes do more than paint a mood—they constrain actions (shielding the projector, cold intensifying, wall adhesion) and charge the final image. The environment evolves causally (1973 brightness to 2023 erosion) and reframes the henge as pigment. The setting’s rules feel internally consistent and discovered through use. The final ridge shimmer is earned by the chapel’s “whispered” logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: will she render what the land refuses to be mapped. Escalation is a density increase: shadow growth across decades, cold deepening, and the map’s adhesion—culminating in a committed act and revaluation. The price is conceptual and aesthetic rather than perilous, which fits the lens but slightly softens bite. Still, the decisive overlay moment narrows options and compels the renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Absence as presence, maps as wounds, and empathy as method all arise from concrete actions (listening to silence, overlaying tears) and recur in a reweighted last image. Lines like “the maps did not tear; they were torn” edge toward explicitness but are earned by evidence on the page. The final commission with a silver‑stitched seam reframes the world’s blanks with cost and responsibility. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through a precise perceptual signature (cartographic tactility, filmic alignment, temperature as message). Diction and rhythm modulate gracefully with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Purposeful elision (“listened…to the silence between the frames”) is taught and paid off. No dialogue needed; the narrative stance remains confident and plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum; imagery is rich without devolving into figurative muddle. Minimal scaffold or loops; repetition (“silence,” “tear”) functions as motif rather than churn. The prose varies rhythm and lands key images cleanly (shadow fingers, adhesion, silver seam). A hair more pruning could tighten a couple of near‑synonymous beats, but clarity and cadence are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Combining a map framer, twin silent reels, and a chapel that “whispers” through temperature and shadow feels freshly synthesized and inevitable in hindsight. The henge-as-pigment turn and the parchment adhesion image elevate without gimmickry. The piece risks a quiet, conceptual closure and earns it. Specific professional sensibility grounds the lyric strangeness.</comment>
