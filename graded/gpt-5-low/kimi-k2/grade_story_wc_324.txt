<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s profession, tools, and “persistently curious” trait motivate each choice, and her embodied attentiveness (kneeling, adjusting the aid, speaking messages) feels lived. The moment she reframes her aim—protecting vulnerable voices including the dead—tracks cleanly to her vow. Internal contradiction is light; she accepts obligation with minimal friction, softening the sense of struggle. Still, the small cost—carrying the burden of others’ stories—reads credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses → figures gather → translation → names restored → vow → dispersal. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she commits to carrying stories, the hearing aid’s light goes dark, and the photograph’s weight recharges the stake. Orientation is solid from the first lines; single scene coherence is tight. Cost is on‑page in her acceptance of ongoing burden and the charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atrium’s wet marble, roses, and mist create a tactile, credible world filtered through Mara’s instrument‑focused perception. Micro‑setting objects (hearing aid, tracer, photograph) are integrated into action and charge the ending. While the atrium itself rarely constrains tactics, the tools-as-setting do, culminating in the device winking dark. Sensory economy stays purposeful without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure builds as more dead arrive, sharpening the responsibility to translate and testify. The tightening is a density increase under the chosen lens, peaking when Mara turns pulses into syllables and must answer multiple claims. Stakes remain intimate rather than perilous, but the vow forecloses the option to remain a mere observer. The cost is subtle yet legible in the final burdened image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of memory, names as passage, and ethical listening arise organically through specific objects and acts. The photograph’s reweighting and the “medicine ran out, not the will” line deepen resonance beyond sentiment. A few explicit statements (“incidental heroism…,” “She understood then…”) edge toward telling. Despite that, the ending’s conceptual repricing—expanding “vulnerable voices” to include the dead—lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Mara’s sensorium and professional idiom. Dialogue is spare and functional, carrying subtext (“They took my name”) and moving the scene. Rhythm modulates well from hush to an imperceptible brightening as the messages pass. No head‑hopping or stance slippage undermines clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and vivid, with fresh images (“reeling hush… like damp velvet,” “soft as moth wings”) that serve mood and action. Sentences carry multiple jobs without scaffolding or loops; momentum is steady. Occasional heightened diction risks purple but remains under control and voice‑true. The final cadence is earned and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” and hearing aid tuned to longing provide a distinctive, memorable angle on ghost liaison tales. The procedural‑meets‑lyric synthesis feels organic rather than gimmicky. While the core “help the dead move on” premise is familiar, the specific toolset and ethical frame refresh it. The closing image’s quiet boldness elevates the piece.</comment>
