<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—safekeeping starlight tied to her mother and the darkened sky—is clear and embodied through precise micro‑choices (heel‑to‑toe steps, glacier‑soaked paper, grief held back). Internal tension between grief and the required patience acts in scene, not summary. The endurance at the end reads as an earned refusal to hurry. A touch more contradiction under peak pressure could push it into the rare tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: ritual density tightens to the obsidian seal’s click, which lands closure with cost (sacrifice of gathered objects to rust, disciplined grief, charged carry). Orientation is crisp from the opening image and never wavers. The final charged poise—seven constellations beating against her heart—reconfigures options without soft reset. The constraint of silence/patience persistently shapes tactics through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The subarctic crater orchard is tactile and operative: cold, silence, and fragility constrain movement and tempo. Tools and objects (plate, obsidian seal, discarded items) are interwoven into action and the final image. World rules emerge via practice rather than exposition, and the orchard subtly mirrors her restraint without blunt allegory. The shimmer on branches retrospectively charges the space as altered by the ritual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture and contain starlight without spillage—is set early and tightened by successive, silence‑dependent steps. Escalation arrives as the animals animate/orbit and culminates in the sealing, with the felt price of loss and disciplined pace. The conflict skews internal/ritualistic, yet pressure coheres and rises under the lens. A sharper external hazard might heighten cost, but what’s here is sufficient and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Memory, preservation, and patience accrue organically through images (heartbeat as map, frost as “last syllables of a prayer”) and culminate in a reweighted final image. The mother/orchard/sky triad refracts grief without moralizing. The ending quietly answers the central question—how to hold light when the sky forgets—through a concrete, sacrificial practice. Ambiguity is purposeful and reflective, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice with controlled distance and clean focalization; no head‑hopping or explanatory slack. Patterned diction (“demonstrating patience physically”) is taught and purposeful, strengthening motif rather than looping. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening around ritual beats and relaxing into charged images. No register drift; the figurative palette remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (memory‑light, patience‑as‑physics) and minimal scaffolding. Lushness risks purple but maintains clarity and momentum; repetitions read as motif, not filler. Syntax varies and carries propulsion into the closure image. One or two stacked metaphors flirt with excess, but they do not blur sense or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: flash‑paper alchemy, heartbeat‑maps, and a crater orchard feel specific and inevitable together. Ritual mechanics are fresh, consequential, and culminate in a non‑obvious, earned reconfiguration. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging, and the final image is memorable. Bold choices elevate without obscuring clarity.</comment>
