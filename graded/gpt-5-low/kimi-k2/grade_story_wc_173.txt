<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lys’s purpose and method are clear and consistent, with embodied reverence (“fingers trembling… from reverence”) and a principled refusal to perform as trained. However, internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance beyond ritual difficulty, so the choice carries less struggle than the stakes imply. The cost—taking “the weight of every echo” and letting the sanctuary crumble—lands, but her path feels assured rather than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from tracing one thread to releasing all, shattering the dome, and condensing into a heart-sized prism that she implants—a clear RR/CR with on-page cost. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/why), and the causal sequence is coherent. The price is legible in “weight of every echo” and the sanctuary’s destruction, reconfiguring the world and her body.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and snow are vividly realized and functionally integrated: refracting walls store voices; starlight threads are literally handled; light turns snow to steam; the sanctuary collapses into the final prism. The environment isn’t mere backdrop—it supplies the mechanism and charges the final image pressed into her chest. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing erased voices/defying the empire) is signaled early and tightens as she moves from single thread to total release and structural collapse. Agency drives the turn; the visible prices are sanctuary loss and bearing the prism’s weight. The main limitation is low direct resistance or trade-off mid-scene, making the arc feel inevitable rather than contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memory versus enforced silence coheres through recurring images (threads, prism, lullaby), culminating in a reweighted final image of embodied remembrance. The line “silence, when held too long, becomes a scream” states theme a bit baldly, slightly reducing subtextual charge. Still, the ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: resistance as custodianship of echoes carried in the body.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely-held voice is steady and confident, with disciplined rhythmic variation and controlled diction that suits the mythic register. Elision is purposeful; no head-hopping or stance wobble. A few lush phrases approach purple but remain legible and voice-true under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet mostly efficient, often doing double-duty with image and action (“the marble beneath her feet began to sing”). Minor intensifier stacking and ornament appear but do not obscure sequence or closure. Rhythm and paragraphing sustain momentum through the climactic light-collapse and quiet closing cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—courtesan-as-weaponized-chastity harvesting echoes by unweaving starlight—feels fresh and specific, with the prism seeding a memorable final turn. Though “empire of conformity” is familiar, it’s revitalized by concrete, idiosyncratic mechanics. The risk is stylistic density rather than structural novelty, but it pays off.</comment>
