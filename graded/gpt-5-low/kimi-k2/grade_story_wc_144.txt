<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is precise and embodied—repair the drone before the whistle to guide a rescue—and her competence reads lived-in (the water basin, spider-silk laminate). Interiority is carried through tactile and auditory perception rather than abstract labels. The maternal undertone (“the way she once whispered to her daughter”) adds depth, but contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal; she rarely doubts or errs. Stakes land, but the struggle feels slightly too smooth for peak-band complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: drone returns damaged → time pressure announced → diagnostic via water → patch → restart → projection → release. Orientation is crisp early (depot, shop, Orion), and the closure beat lands with a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend as she sends the drone and resumes waiting. Cost is mostly opportunity/time rather than a concrete loss on the page, which softens the decisive feel. Still, the because/therefore chain holds throughout without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is richly integrated and constraining: the skylit water basin dictates her method; the mist and hatch frame launch; the depot’s loudspeaker and anchor clock compress time. Sensory specificity honors her blindness (heat on her cheeks, “water’s mirrored song”), avoiding tourist catalog detail. The environment charges the final image as the shop becomes “a lantern for anything lost.” World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair before the Orion departs) is announced and tightened by the loudspeaker and whistle ripple, which destabilize her workspace and force speed. The meaningful turn comes at the projection of the star map and the precise bearing decoded—pressure resolves through her chosen method. The price is chiefly time/attention under a live clock; minimal friction (no failed attempt or tool loss) keeps the escalation from peaking higher. Nonetheless the tightening is coherent and earned under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Repair as promise, departures/returns, and care translated into craft interlock without sermonizing. The final image (“lantern for anything lost”) reweights earlier particulars—the basin, mist, lullaby—into a resonant credo. Maternal echoes enrich the theme without overstatement. Slight sentiment risk is checked by concrete action and tactile detail.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third-person voice has a distinct perceptual signature—sound, touch, and light refracted through water—consistent with her blindness and vocation. Diction is lyrical but controlled, with rhythmic modulation under pressure (“Her fingers flew now…”). No head-hopping or register slips; inference stays within what she can plausibly sense. The voice carries tension without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is supple and efficient; most sentences do double-duty (action plus image) and propel momentum. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and scene-true (rail depot’s “magnetic calm,” water’s “mirrored song”) with no mixed metaphors at the climax. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; syntax varies to fit pressure. A few high-lyric touches flirt with purple but remain anchored to concrete beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of a blind artisan reading fractures via water refraction to repair a hummingbird drone in a mist-walled harbor is fresh and memorable. The method and setting aren’t ornamental; they drive tactics and closure. The motherhood undertone avoids cliché through specific ritual (lullaby, whispering to the drone). It’s a refined, non-obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
