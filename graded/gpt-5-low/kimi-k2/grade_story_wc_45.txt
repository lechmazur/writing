<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ivy’s “forgiving skeptic” stance drives every choice—from pocketing the tooth to requesting the original child and initiating the ritual—and her skepticism bends rather than vanishes. Embodied, profession‑specific details (vet tweezers, bone‑setting) ground her inner conflict. The girl’s guilt and Ivy’s response create a credible, intimate crucible. Minor softness: the emotional price Ivy pays is more conceptual than dramatized pain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal beats with accumulative lyric pressure) holds: discovery → maze → meeting → ritual → repriced ending. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: the child’s bones knit into light and the tooth’s meaning is reweighted, with the cost of accepting the death and recasting guilt. Orientation is clear early; set‑ups (tooth, bone‑setting, lullaby) pay off. Slight convenience in the girl’s timely appearance and a clipped final fragment nick the perfection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hedge maze and secret garden are sensorially vivid and functionally charged: the maze “swallows sound,” the bench inscription reframes the act, and the garden responds to the lullaby. The tooth-as-tool and setting interlock to shape the outcome. World rules emerge through action rather than expository dump. Spatial choreography and tone remain coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting guilt/mistake into guidance—tightens when Ivy chooses to press the tooth into the bones and hum, foreclosing denial. The ritual is the decisive deepening; the price is releasing the possibility of literal resurrection in favor of a luminous, conceptual repricing. No antagonist needed; internal and external conflicts braid cleanly. Escalation is elegant rather than high‑heat, but clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Forgiveness, repair, and the ethics of substitution develop through particulars (cleft palate mirroring a “cleft in certainty,” bone‑setting as science/prayer). The final image of bones becoming constellation‑light reweights the premise without didactic closure. One line (“we’re turning all our mistakes into constellations”) leans declarative, slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance lingers and invites reread.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close focalization retains Ivy’s perceptual signature (clinical tools, animal care, lullabies). Dialogue is spare, distinct, and functions as action; the girl’s lines carry history without over‑explaining. Rhythm modulates well between hush and charged revelation. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and economical—images like “too smooth” and “archived in real time” feel precise and earned. Occasional stacked metaphors approach lushness but stay coherent. The final sentence fragments (“a hidden”) introduce a visible artifact at the end, dulling the last cadence. Otherwise momentum and clarity are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of changeling lore with veterinary bone‑setting and a cosmological forgiveness map. The bench inscription, opalescent tooth, and bones‑to‑constellation turn feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and lyric compression pay off without obscuring sense. Minor familiarity in a couple mythic gestures keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
