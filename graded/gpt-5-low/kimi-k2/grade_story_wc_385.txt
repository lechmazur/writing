<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation (to learn why some people echo) is clear and sustained, and the final choice between freeing voices and preserving them reads as a credible Earned Stasis with felt cost. Interiority is textured and embodied (boots on fossil beds, ribs vibrating), not label‑only. The contradiction—compassion for trapped voices versus reverence for their beauty—surfaces on the page and drives the decision. The stranger adds relational pressure without stealing POV clarity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates via density and pattern—song → echoes → co‑singer → shell reunion—toward a charged refusal that reweights the stake. Closure lands on the page when she fuses the shell into the rock, choosing endurance over release; the cost (foregoing freedom for the trapped and letting the stranger dissolve) is legible. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern taught early pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The canyon, serpentine nexus, and fissure are not postcards; they structure movement, provide the final action, and charge the closing image. Object‑as‑setting (the shell) integrates with the place to create a “new mouth for the earth,” directly shaping choice. Sensory specificity is high across sight and sound, filtered through the singer’s priorities. World rules are learned through embodied action (singing glyphs) rather than expository dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (what to do with the echoes after learning their source) tightens meaningfully when the second singer arrives with the matching shell and offers the possibility to “silence the song.” The choice forecloses a live option; consequences (ongoing sorrow, stranger’s dissolution) are on the page. Pressure accrues coherently under the accumulative lens rather than through reversals, and the internal/external interweave in the peak beat. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The imagery and actions develop a coherent theme about grief as resonance and memory made audible; the closing refusal embodies complexity. However, the explicit thesis line “we echo because the stars remember us” flattens subtext at the very end (Thematic Echo penalty). Prior images (astronomers, cartographers, ribs vibrating) earn much of the insight without needing declaration. The resonance remains, but subtlety is compromised.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice sustains a controlled psychic distance; perception stays character‑bound and pattern‑driven. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from solitary call to braided counterpoint) without head‑hopping. Sparse dialogue/mutual singing functions as action rather than exposition. No withholding or register drift undermines reliability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, and purposeful figurative language that mostly avoids muddle. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains legible and earned by the mythic register. No notable loops or scaffold; transitions carry momentum. The final cadence lands cleanly with a charged image despite one on‑the‑nose sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—cosmic grief turning bereaved humans into living echoes, enacted through ritual singing and a bisected shell—feels fresh and inevitable within its logic. Risk‑taking in form (accumulative lyric, progressive disclosure as method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The stranger as “first echo” is an elegant, non‑obvious turn grounded in prior motifs. The piece commits to its premise and follows through to a specific, memorable final act.</comment>
