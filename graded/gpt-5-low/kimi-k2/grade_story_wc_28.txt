<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Azim’s “gentle radical” ethos and Leylah’s grief-forged softness are embodied through tactile choices (pressing the red tessera, continuing the rebuild). The motivation to choose empathy over rage is dramatized rather than told, though true inner contradiction is more implied than stressed. The dialogue carries subtext and pressure (“Empathy burns more than rage...”), and their partnership under pressure alters the plaza’s state. Slightly limited by the protagonist’s relatively untroubled certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mosaic work and memory images layer until the charged act of replacing the pupil and continuing repairs reconfigures the plaza (low hum, exhale, sky stabilizes). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (choosing empathy and renaming over vengeance). Orientation is clean early (ancient plaza, after the fire, Azim/Leylah), and causality is coherent through the tactile sequence. The final sentence truncation slightly blurs the last cadence but the closure has already occurred.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plaza and shattered sky are deeply integrated and charged: stars pooling in flagstone cracks, glass bones, frost, and the stepping stone guide the method and final image. Environment constrains tactics (following chipped patterns; the intact square as locus of action) and culminates in a tactile shift (plaza exhale, sky stops bleeding). Sensory specificity is vivid and POV-filtered (soldier’s canvas coat lined with salvaged velvet). Strong economy with details evolving alongside action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to reconfigure memory toward empathy—tightens when the red tessera is found and placed, leading to a concrete rebuilding choice. Pressure escalates via the decision to “rename” and persist in patching, with Leylah’s line sharpening the moral calculus. Cost is present but primarily conceptual/emotional rather than material. The beat structure coheres under the accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of aberrant mercy and the weight of empathy accrues through concrete particulars (surgeons without anesthetic; mothers forgiving armed soldiers) and is answered by the renaming act. The final images reprice the world’s brokenness without moralizing, though “Empathy burns more than rage...” edges toward thesis. The gazelle’s restored sight reframes watchfulness and responsibility. Resonance lingers in the plaza’s exhale and stabilized sky.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a strong perceptual signature; diction is consistent with the narrator’s sensibility. Dialogue is minimal but textured and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well between image and action with clean POV containment. A few lavish metaphors push toward purple without breaking legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is rich and mostly precise, but density occasionally crowds clarity, and the final sentence truncation is a material artifact at the closure beat. A few metaphor stacks verge on excess (“sky once porcelain… stars dripped… pooling”) without loss of sense. Overall momentum holds, yet the line-level slip in the last line dampens the landing. Concision in a couple reflective sentences could further sharpen cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—fire-cartographer, retrocognition through a tessera, renaming a plaza’s memory via mosaic repair—feels fresh and internally coherent. Risks in style and concept pay off in a singular vision that avoids generic allegory. The red tessera as gazelle’s pupil is a memorable, specific turn that reweights prior images. Minor familiarity in a few lines of aphoristic phrasing keeps it just shy of the very top tier.</comment>
