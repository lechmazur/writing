<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear desire (integrate laughter into healing) and steady agency: she descends, offers her palm, uncorks vials, and gives up the tooth. Interiority is embodied through sensory bias (vials chiming, mica like starlight) rather than labels. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is minimal—she remains composed, with little visible fear/temptation battle. The final micro‑choice to speak after a century feels earned and character‑specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative lyric build on a causal spine: tooth vibrates → side cave musician → wind aperture note → release of sins → tooth memory → tuned laughter. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the gorge retuned, vials emptied, the tooth transformed, and she breaks her silence (“Thank you for the song”). Cost is legible: relinquishing her stored confessions and the guarded silence she kept for a century. Orientation is crisp from line one, and the throughline never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Echo Gorge operates as a misaligned harp whose acoustics dictate tactics and closure. The wind aperture, basalt frame, and mica shape choices and supply the mechanism of retuning. Details are vivid across senses and POV‑filtered; the final blaze of sunrise over mica charges the last image. Setting isn’t postcard—it's the engine of the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused (integrate the escaped laughter) with a clear tightening at the wind aperture’s pure note. Agency drives the turn (uncorking vials; transferring the tooth) and forecloses a path (she loses her cache; accepts release over hoarding). Pressure is more spiritual than perilous, so the risk feels gentle rather than harrowing, but it coheres and deepens. The cost carries into the quiet, tuned ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: healing requires integration, not suppression; music as both blamed scapegoat and true remedy. The crocodile tooth and laughter reprice guilt into harmony without moralizing. The final thank‑you and single clear note crystallize meaning beyond plot. Ambiguity remains human and resonant, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“harp strung with moonlight,” “mica like spilled starlight”) that remains coherent under pressure. Dialogue is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext (“music blamed for silence”). No head‑hopping or stance drift; psychic distance modulates cleanly at the climax. The voice is confident without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with varied cadence; images do double duty for atmosphere and mechanism. Metaphor field (harp/music/echo) is consistent and avoids muddle; minimal scaffold or loops. A few lush lines flirt with excess but never obscure causality or dull the ending image. Rhythm supports escalation into a crystalline close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a soul collector retuning a valley‑harp via laughter and a crocodile tooth is striking and internally coherent. Turns feel inevitable from seeded elements (tooth vibration; musician’s history; wind aperture). Risks taken in concept and diction heighten stakes without gimmickry. The final reweighting feels both fresh and earned.</comment>
