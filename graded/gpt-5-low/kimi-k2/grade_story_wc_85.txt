<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s guilt, habits, and self‑erasure are embodied through tactile choices (sifting carvings, fitting the watch hand) and a credible internal contradiction (comforting lies vs. costly truth). The realization that her silence was a choice lands off a concrete cue (the note), not as a generic epiphany. The final renunciation (“I chose silence, and I can choose voice”) feels earned by prior beats and carries cost. A slight neatness in articulating the insight keeps it shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative lyric density and clean causal turns: shore search → watch hand → note → explicit choice. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the single transition back up to the terrace is clear. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (choosing voice, repairing the watch) and a felt price (renouncing her erasures). No dropped setups; props and images pay off coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and objects are vivid and charged: the cobalt terrace, the forgotten shore, driftwood “letters,” and the watch hand all filter through Mara’s bias and history. The environment and tool (watch hand/watch) constrain and charge the final image, not just decorate it. Weather/tide and the terrace’s cold subtly pressure her choices. Specificity remains purposeful without tour‑guide excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she face the truth and end her profitable silence—tightens through concrete discoveries (pulsing hand, tin box, note). The ticking/pulse deepens pressure into a must‑act choice that forecloses a path (continuing to forge without confession). The finale shows agency with cost: writing real names and releasing the page. Escalation is single‑step but decisive and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth vs. silence/time as lineage is integrated through recurring images (ribbon of time, ticking hand, paper boat). Subtext lives in the watch starting again and the terrace “exhale.” The line “I chose silence, and I can choose voice” slightly overstates what the imagery already shows, trimming the aura of restraint. Overall resonance is strong and lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third‑person closely held to Mara, with consistent diction and a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure; image‑driven sentences carry narrative confidence without head‑hopping. The single spoken line is apt and earned. No withholding beyond purposeful reveal via objects.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images often do double duty (driftwood both setting and epistolary metaphor). Figurative language stays coherent and scene‑bound; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. A few elevated phrases (“sieved hush”) recur meaningfully rather than as ornament. The final image is crisp and unblurred by purple overreach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Black‑market genealogist, driftwood as letters, and a watch hand pulsing back time combine into a fresh, necessary synthesis. Turns arise from the premise’s logic rather than gimmickry. The risk of lyric compression pays off in a reweighted ending that feels inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity avoids generic repentance arcs.</comment>
