<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira’s motive is clear and particular—“to catch the echo of a goddess”—and her tactics (zigzagging, voicing silence, driving the spike) reveal a cool strategist who chooses to relinquish that coolness. The embodied cost lands when she lets her pulse race and accepts the burn. The internal contradiction (discipline vs surrender) is present but resolves quickly and mostly without friction. A touch more resistance or misstep before yielding would deepen the struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern breaks and sonic density build to a bargain, then a paid cost. Closure is on-page and felt—she trades her defining attribute to keep the echo. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and each beat (“Low C” question mark, pause of constellations, bargain) coheres. The price persists into the final image (no longer cool-headed, “walking resonance”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is a fully functional system that shapes tactics (zigzagging paths, silence as action, sound pooling) and charges the ending. The rail spike operates as a micro‑setting object that constrains choice and conducts divinity. Sensory specificity across sound, touch, and taste (“moonlit mussels”) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: keep the goddess’s echo at the cost of composure. Escalation tightens from intention to summoning to a bargain that forces a trade-off, culminating in surrender and marked transformation. The cost is unmistakable on the page (heat drained into iron, loss of cool-headedness). Pressure is largely lyric rather than oppositional, but it coheres and deepens credibly under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of predictability vs divinity, silence as speech, and the price of communion are woven through recurring particulars (iron, lullaby, zigzag, constellations). The final image (“walking resonance,” tide recognizing its old singer) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about bearing the cost to hold the echo. No sermonizing; the implications arise from scene and image. The industrial/sea dialectic enriches the moral calculus without flattening it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinctive lyric voice with a stable single POV and precise diction carries the piece. Rhythmic control supports pressure (e.g., the “low C” bending into a question mark). Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible through closure. No dialogue artifacts; the narrative confidence matches what the focalizer can plausibly infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density prose largely earns its metaphors; images do multiple jobs and advance momentum. Occasional lushness edges toward purple but stays coherent and voice‑motivated. No scaffold loops or cadence templates bog the reading. The final lines are clean and recharged by earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound garden, iron as lullaby skeleton, voicing silence to net a goddess—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in language and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established rules and character choice rather than late contrivance. The feral lullaby tone ties novelty to emotional truth.</comment>
