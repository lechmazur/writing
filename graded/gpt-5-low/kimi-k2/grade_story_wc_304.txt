<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Her motive—saving the dead’s “last spark” at personal cost—is clear and intensifies at the threshold. The hesitation before infusing the chip embodies credible internal conflict. Specifics (widow’s eyebrow, laugh line) yield character‑particular interiority over labels. The renunciation—surrendering every spark she gathered—reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and patterned motifs build to the infusion and collapse. Closure lands on the page with cost—“no emerald left to weigh them down”—and reconfigures options (from hoarding sparks to distributing them). Orientation is clean from the opening and the scene maintains one continuous pressure. The final salon image reads as a coherent after‑state, not a soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto, aurora, and threshold are vivid, purposeful, and constraint‑bearing (wind spirals, hush, stone glow). The environment actively shapes choice and cadence, culminating in the pane’s collapse and aurora dimming. Occupational micro‑setting (salon) reprises to charge the final image. World rules are learned through action, not told.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (consolidate sparks vs. lose them to oblivion) is signaled early and tightens at the hesitation beat. The decisive infusion forecloses a path (keeping the chips) with visible price. Pressure escalates in a single, sufficient intensification (the pane brightening to collapse). If anything, external counterpressure is minimal, but internal stakes carry it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—beauty work as custodianship of grief and memory—emerges from concrete acts, not declaration. Recurring images (mirrors, spirals, static/patterns) reweight at the end: from private preservation to communal bequeathal. The last salon image offers a resonant non‑literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful (what the sparks truly are) while cost is undeniable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical yet controlled voice with a consistent perceptual signature (“finding patterns in static”) sustains throughout. Psychic distance and certainty stay aligned to the POV; no head‑hopping or gratuitous elision. Rhythm modulates effectively at the climax (from hush to “a chord,” then silence). Diction feels coherent with the character’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful imagery, and minimal scaffold. A few lush phrases flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion are preserved, especially through the peak beats. No notable loops or template cadence; syntax varies to match pressure. Final images are crisp and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The “beautician mortician” saving emerald eye‑sparks within a sky grotto is strikingly original and unified. The lens‑as‑not‑door turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, metaphoric system) pay off without gimmickry. The synthesis of vocation, ritual beauty, and cosmological stakes reads fresh and memorable.</comment>
