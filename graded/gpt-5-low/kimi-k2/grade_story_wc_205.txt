<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: failed revolutionary, elegist, thief vs. “translator.” Concrete micro-choices (covering mirrors, hosting midnight readings, surrendering the vase) reveal values under pressure. The Solenne exchange sharpens moral stakes without flattening Mara’s guilt. A slight softness remains in how easily her new stance takes hold socially.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and acts accrue toward a reconfiguration from ownership to stewardship. Closure lands on page as Mara hands over the healed vase and they covenants as stewards; the cost is relinquishing claim and facing her betrayals. Orientation is clear and the pattern is taught early (mirrors/time; shard/stories). The Company’s enforcers yielding so readily trims felt resistance at the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, time-visible mirrors, and chronal storms are sensorial and purposeful, constraining action (covering mirrors) and charging the ending (standing before them uncovered). The shard/vase functions as object-as-setting, evolving with the social shift. Details flow through POV bias and world rules stay consistent. The final constellation image pays off the environment decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—who owns the past/time—tightens through the mirror fear, Solenne’s “theft” charge, and the collective method choice. The tangible price is Mara’s renunciation of possession and identity recalibration. However, external pressure (Company enforcers) dissipates quickly, easing the climb. The meaningful deepening is clear even if the opposition yields with minimal friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: ownership is too small for memory; sorrow is transformed, not erased. Recurring motifs (mirrors, visible time, the shard becoming a vase) shift meaning at the end. Some lines verge on thesis (“ownership was a language too small”), but they arise from action and are largely earned. The final poem serves as conceptual repricing rather than a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (elegiac, image-driven) consistent with Mara’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (“I’m translating”). POV distance stays stable and confident; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates cleanly from somber to luminous at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with vivid metaphors (“bruise-colored ribbon,” “nacre around grit”) mostly serves sense and mood. Minor purple lean does not blur causality, and sentence variety maintains propulsion. No scaffold loops or template cadences mar the final third. A few elevated phrases stack, but remain legible and voice-true.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original fusion of visible time, social archaeology-as-story, and a baroque asteroid yields a fresh moral calculus. The shard healing through accumulated narratives is a memorable, non-obvious turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual closure) pay off without muddle. Emotional truth grounds the conceit through Mara’s earned renunciation.</comment>
