<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motive (prove lateral time to touch her brother) drives every choice, and her obliging trait is nicely cross‑pressured by private urgency. Interiority is embodied through tactile interactions with the nexus/lever and the “mechanically warm” air as tether. The cost lands as sideways grief rather than tidy triumph. A hair more contradiction under peak pressure (hesitation vs risk) could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the scene escalates from setup to Möbius corridor to collapse, culminating in a charged poise ending. Closure is on‑page with cost: proof attained, but at the price of reconfigured grief (brother’s name frozen in the nexus, dream‑songs threaded with her loss). Orientation is clean early; props and rules pay off. No causality breaches; the lever reset seals the breach with satisfying finality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station, dome, lever, and zero‑g moth‑whales are not postcard dressing; they shape options (the whales’ agitation tightens the clock) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity (“ozone,” “thawed frost,” “violet clouds”) is POV‑filtered and purposeful. The nexus functions as micro‑setting/object that constrains action and returns transformed. Atmosphere and world rules stay consistent through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear from the first paragraph; pressure coheres and tightens when the tunnel collapses and the whales’ dream‑songs thrash. Her sprint back across folding light is a single, meaningful intensification that narrows options to one. The price is emotional (proof tinged with grief) and physical risk, with no coincidences resolving the problem. Stakes remain intimate but felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief reconfigured by non‑linear time emerges organically through events and recurring images (hush → flurry → hush). The final “sideways moment” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing, repricing proof as a bittersweet tether rather than victory. Motifs (icy warmth, wings at rest, mechanically warm air) accrue meaning and shift at the end. Subtext operates in image rather than thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature; cadence modulates under pressure (collapse beats quicken). POV remains stable and modest; information stays within Lira’s ken. Patterned diction (“mechanically warm,” “hush”) is taught early and pays off without monotony. No dialogue needed; narrative texture carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do multiple jobs (nexus as tool, symbol, and clock). Repetition is purposeful rather than looped, and syntax varies to keep momentum. A few lush lines flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion hold. The closing image is crisp and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Moth‑whales, a magnetic nexus, and a Möbius corridor synthesize into a fresh, coherent vision; not genre wallpaper. The sideways time proof entwined with a sibling loss feels non‑obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, concept‑driven closure) heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through.</comment>
