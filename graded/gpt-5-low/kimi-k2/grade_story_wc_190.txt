<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—to teach silence to comfort—drives concrete, compassionate choices (placing the vial, calibrating breath), and the child’s presence functions as a live pressure. Interiority is mostly conveyed through tactile action and attention, not summary, which keeps it specific. The piece favors serene competence over contradiction; a deeper internal snag or cost for Lira would amplify complexity. The child’s shift from mute sorrow to sigh and smile lands credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush thickens through measured attention until the sigh catalyzes a luminous re-weighting. Orientation is clean from the outset (canal, terrace, whistle) and the single-scene window is disciplined. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: grief metabolized into earned quiet; the vial’s still sphere and “the silence knows your name” seal the before/after. Cost is emotional and present, if gentle, not mechanical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism terrace, canal, and storm glass are vividly particular and persistently in play; the terrace bows, drifts, and sets the physical grammar. Environmental texture and object rules are learned by doing, not told, and they charge the final image (still sphere, softened hush). Sensory detail favors light and sound in a way that serves the premise without tourist cataloging. The setting subtly constrains tactics (drift, bow, starlight focus) rather than merely decorating.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—holding and reshaping the hush for a grieving child—is signaled early and deepens coherently. The meaningful tightening comes at the involuntary sigh, which transforms the device and reweights the space. Stakes remain intimate; the cost is internal and scaled to length, though pressure is gentler than sharp. Agency is endurance and guided attention rather than a dramatic choice, but it’s earned and effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence as presence emerges through action (breath-counting, storm glass responses) and culminates in a resonant final image. The explicit line “Silence isn’t empty… It’s a room we build together” risks on-the-nose moralizing, but is supported and then transcended by the visual closure. Recurring images (whistle echo, snowflake, constellated train) evolve meaningfully. The piece invites reflection without didactic wrap-up.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the focalizer’s perceptual signature (attentional precision, acoustic awareness). Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and subtextual, serving action rather than explaining it. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates well at the sigh/flurry beat and settles with the earned stasis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete images, and a clean rhythmic arc. Figurative language is fresh, coherent (prism rainbows, captive weather) and does not cloy; density supports mood without purple overload. Minimal scaffolding or loops, and information density remains high with momentum. The final image is cleanly delivered without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—gondola on a prism terrace, an emotion‑mirroring storm glass, tutoring silence post‑whistle—feels novel and internally consistent. The catalysis into a constellated snow-train is an earned, surprising yet inevitable turn. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off in coherence and resonance. The vision reads singular, not stitched from template parts.</comment>
