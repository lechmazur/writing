<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—seeking beauty despite colorblindness—drives concrete choices (accepting the trade; arranging plants) under real cost. Interiority feels embodied and particular (“tasted of iron and cherries”), with simultaneous contradiction (desire vs. fear of losing “awakening”). Her “innocently cunning” mask under pressure reveals value hierarchy. The final acceptance of the dome reads as earned stasis with cost acknowledged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link cleanly: offer → trade → arrangement → note → reconfigured practice → charged final object. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she barters another awakening and embraces a path that will demand more). Orientation is clear early (courtyard at dawn, phoenix, kiln; who/where/when). No causality breaks; the phoenix reprise ties the pattern at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard, kiln, glass shards, marbles, and living vines aren’t decorative; they constrain tactics and enable the plant‑arrangement method. Recurring objects (reed tongue, domes) charge the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid beyond the visual, apt for a colorblind POV. World rules are taught through action and hold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (what she will trade to awaken beauty) tightens when she accepts the bargain and the plants externalize her cost as painful memories. The clear note and its embodied price escalate pressure to a credible turn: she chooses a practice that depends on embracing imperfection and its ongoing toll. Quiet, but the reweighted options are unmistakable. No contrived antagonism; agency drives the deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Symbols and actions embody the theme (cracks, domes, ivy’s healing reach), culminating in a charged acceptance. However, the line “beauty was not the absence of flaw, but the conversation” states the thesis overtly, dulling subtext at the end. The rest earns resonance through image and cost. The phoenix/reed reprise reweights the premise effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled and consistent with a tactile, synesthetic perceptual signature suited to a colorblind painter. Dialogue is spare and pointed, carrying subtext and turning pressure. Rhythm modulates well around peak beats (the clear note; the dome handoff). No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense but purposeful; images do more than one job and propel momentum. Figurative language is fresh and coherent to the world (glass, heat, note as color). Minimal redundancy; syntax varies to match pressure. A hint of aphorism at the end trims peak potential but doesn’t muddy closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—color perceived as vibration through plants, a reed tongue as chromatic key, bartered awakenings—feels original and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mode, mythic phoenix braided with craft detail) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Recurring objects reconfigure meaning at closure. The piece avoids template beats and delivers a distinctive vision.</comment>
