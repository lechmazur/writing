<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The guardian’s vow-bound silence and ritualized labor make his motivation legible and consistent, with embodied choices (shutters, mirror, weaving) revealing character. Interiority is conveyed through action rather than thought, fitting the piece’s lyric mode. The lack of explicit internal contradiction undercuts peak complexity a touch, but endurance-as-stance feels earned. The moment he lifts the pearl on the mirror most strongly fuses motive and action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned openings → braiding → vortex/pearl → soothed canal, a clear tightening and cadence shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: darkness “learns,” water is “no longer hungry,” the mirror is left reflecting morning—conceptual cost born of the guardian’s vow and the unrescued child. Orientation is clean from the cobalt dock and canal through to the final image. The chain of ritual steps reads coherent and necessary without mechanical over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The dock, shutters, and canal are tactile and specific; weather and wet surfaces materially enable reflection and tactics. Color and texture (cobalt rain sheen) recur to charge the final image, and the dental mirror functions as micro-setting at closure. World rules are learned in action—light as blade, water as conduit—without exposition. The environment constrains method and supplies the very resources (angles, stillness, reflective planes) the ritual requires.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether light can be taught into the water to reach the lost child; escalation is delivered by increasing pattern density (from opening shutters to braiding). The decisive tightening is the woven starlight that produces the pearl and the nonverbal exchange. Costs are mostly conceptual (silence, acceptance that retrieval isn’t the aim), which slightly softens visceral stakes. Still, the earned soothing of the canal reads as a real price paid and a stance fixed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes through image: recognition as antidote to devouring darkness, grief taught into matter, listening across thresholds. The final reweighting—“darkness learned the shape of the child’s missing smile, and the stars learned the sound of a mother’s cracked voice”—is earned, not declared as a moral. Recurring particulars (mirror, shutters, reflections) transform from tools to ethical grammar. Ambiguity remains purposeful: consolation over restitution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—precision in verbs (“braid,” “angle,” “feed”) and controlled metaphoric field. Distance and stance are stable; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the weaving/pearl beat. The voice trusts image and action, avoiding explanatory intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush but controlled; images are coherent and actionable (light as blades, shutters as eyes). Minimal scaffold and no significant loops; sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum. The density of figurative language approaches saturation but remains legible and pattern-consistent. The closure image is clean and unblurred by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—canal guardian, dental mirror, shutters as star-weaving apparatus—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (ritual cosmology, silence as agency) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from taught patterns rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth (grief reconfigured into recognition) grounds the novelty.</comment>
