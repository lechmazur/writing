<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive—witnessing without judgment—anchors his choices, and the handling of the swan and inscription reveals character through action. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely struggles or wavers, which flattens tension. Embodied perception is rich (dust, stone sweat), yet we don’t see a live dilemma that forces a painful trade. The Earned Stasis at the end is credible but low‑conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a taught pattern of descent → immersion in regenerative silence → return and inscription culminates in a quiet, charged cadence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he recommits to non‑judgment with visible cost in ongoing decay and aging, reweighted by the last “begin.” Orientation is strong from the outset, and the origami/obsidian mechanics are consistent. The cost is felt conceptually and atmospherically rather than dramatized as a high‑risk choice, keeping it shy of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is exquisitely rendered and filtered through his vocation: overgrown library, catacombs, river, obsidian cube, and swan all interlock. Environment and object constraints matter—the obsidian refuge and folded swan enable/limit passage and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with water, dust, and mineral imagery shaping the mood and choices. One notch off perfection only because the environment rarely cornered him into a difficult spatial or logistical decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens via density and cadence: the portal opens, the silence intensifies, and time’s drift exacts a cost that reweights the stake. The key tightening is the felt stiffening of the swan’s fibers, forcing return and foreclosing further immersion. Stakes remain coherent—guard the silence versus the library’s ongoing crumble—without introducing new threads. The escalation is elegant but gentle, never quite forcing a wrenching sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—regenerative silence versus judgment—emerges through concrete acts (release, inscription, return) and recurring objects that shift meaning. The final image (“begin”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: endurance as renewal with cost, not denial. A single sentence edges toward stating the thesis (“for judgment was only another sound...”), slightly reducing subtextual purity. Overall, it invites reflection beyond the page without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization and confident diction; patterning is taught and kept. Rhythm modulates well between lush stillness and tightened beats (swan stiffening, step through). No head‑hopping or register slips; imagery remains voice‑true. Minor risk of over‑saturation is managed by clarity through the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density; lines often carry world, mood, and theme at once (“droplets fall like punctuation”). The figurative texture is rich but rarely muddled; repetitions (dust, vines, glass) function as motifs rather than loops. A few stacked metaphors approach purple yet maintain coherence and do not blur causality. Momentum breathes appropriately for a lyric piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: obsidian cube, origami swan, and “regenerative silence” feel singular and inevitable together. Images like cities in dewdrops and equations sprouting roots push beyond genre habit. The quiet closure reprices the premise without trickery, and the risk of densely lyrical diction pays off. Freshness serves meaning rather than ornament.</comment>
