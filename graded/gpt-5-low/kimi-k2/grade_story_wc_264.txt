<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (shift from escorting to “cultivating sparks”) drives concrete choices, especially pressing the spark into the clock against the archive’s interest. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“feels in his teeth,” “fractured lullaby”). The renunciation of his original duty carries cost (unmaking the archive; burning returns). Slightly limited contradiction on the page—he pivots decisively but the tension between duty and cultivation could surface earlier under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and motifs tighten toward the decisive act with the clock and spark. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—he chooses to seed forests of lullabies, reweighting preservation from ledger to living sparks, with on‑page cost (archive narrows and folds, memory gift with loss). Orientation is taught early and consistent; corridor transition is legible. The final fragment (“When the last ember lands”) slightly mars cadence, though closure already reads prior.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: the glowing dune, phosphorescent blooms, and later glass forest shape sensation and options (mirage door; blooms whispering pruned names). The chess clock functions as micro‑setting/object that constrains the climactic tactic and charges the final image (planted like a sundial, counting negative hours). Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered. Minor cap due to final‑line stumble and occasional lushness that edges toward decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—what to do with erased futures/dreams—tightens through the door confrontation to the choice to “cultivate what you discarded.” The reversal (using the archive’s offered spark to unmake/narrow it) is protagonist‑driven and carries legible price. Pressure coheres; the cadence shift after the clock absorbs the spark reweights the field. Stakes could register more bodily risk before the act, but the conceptual cost is strong.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus erasure emerges organically through actions and recurring images (“save not the trees but the shadows,” lullabies as seeds). The ending rephrases the premise without moralizing—flames that “pollinate” reprice loss as generative. One line borders on thematic echo (“The sparks you seek are the dreams you guard”) but is grounded as diegetic text. Resonance lingers with the cost of unmaking the archive and the ambiguity of spreading soft fire.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with coherent POV and controlled rhythm; diction (“probability tides,” “occasionally everywhere”) feels character‑filtered rather than generic lofty. Dialogue is sparse but charged, carrying subtext and pressure in few lines. Psychic distance modulates cleanly at turns (mirage door; offering of spark). Minor slip in cadence at the very end prevents a higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are dense, often doing multiple jobs, with varied rhythm and strong verbs; images mostly cohere without muddle. A few figurative stacks edge toward purple but stay legible. Copy error in the final fragment undercuts polish and cadence. Overall momentum holds without loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Conceptual synthesis—archive of all pasts, dreamless guard, chess clock as temporal seedbed—is fresh and integrated with stakes. The pivotal turn (using the archive’s gift to unmake/narrow it for growth) feels non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risk‑taking in tone (“fractured lullaby”) largely lands without obscuring clarity. Slightly safer conflict embodiment (minimal resistance) keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
