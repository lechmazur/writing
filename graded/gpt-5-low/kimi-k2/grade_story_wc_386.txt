<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Nadia’s motive—salvaging something pure from grief and catastrophe—is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (frosting the globe, arranging candles, knotting threads) reveal a meticulous, haunted temperament. Internal tension surfaces between exposing the drowned’s truths and yearning for a purified remnant. The brother’s jersey detail adds human cost without overexplaining. The earned endurance at the end (carrying the locket) forecloses denial with a felt price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual acts intensify, imagery densifies, and the final salvage reconfigures the premise with cost. Orientation is immediate (glacier shrine, Nadia, the globe), and the sequence coheres: signal to expose → relics appear → transfer of “pure snow” → sealing a locket. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—truth confronted, sorrow borne—and the empty globe/star image seals the after. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and snow globe are not mere décor; they constrain tactics (breath frosting glass, candles shaping paths, ice’s “auroras” answering) and charge the outcome. The environment’s properties directly enable the portal/clarity beat and the transfer of “rescued snow.” Spatial and sensory choreography stays coherent while amplifying mood. The final image is inseparable from place: the emptied globe reflecting “one single star.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (salvage purity vs. confronting wreck-truth) are signaled early and deepen as the globe “sweats” and the sea rises—an effective pressure build for this lens. The key tightening is Nadia’s choice to ask the dead and then to extract only the snow, accepting the cost of what remains unfixable. Cost is emotional rather than tactical, but it is legible in the relinquishment of the globe and the carrying of the locket. A touch more friction or risk in the act itself could sharpen escalation further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of ethical salvage, grief, and truth-telling through shared dreams accrue through concrete particulars (radioman’s ribs, brother’s jersey), not thesis. The ending reweights “borrowed starlight” and “windows of connection” into an ethic: take only the pure drift the drowned willingly give. Resonance lingers without moralizing; the charged image of the emptied globe and the locket embodies cost and mercy. Purposeful ambiguity (Nadia absent from future dreams) enriches subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, singular lyric voice with clean POV boundaries sustains through pressure; diction and rhythm suit Nadia’s ritual focus and vocation. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in closure without opacity. Imagery choices feel character-filtered (wreck-diver acoustics, morse, submersible creaks). No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful; most images do double duty (world logic + emotional charge). A few metaphors approach saturation but retain coherence and do not blur action. Syntax varies, momentum holds, and transitions are clean. The final cadence is sharp and unencumbered by scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck-diver as ghost whisperer decoding dream cameos within a glacier shrine, salvaging “pure snow”—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring images are transformed rather than echoed; method and worldbuilding cohere without exposition. The risk of dense lyricism pays off in clarity and emotional precision. The final reconfiguration is fresh and memorable.</comment>
