<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Cass’s motivation crystallizes clearly (“to merge parallel timelines”), and her choices—radioing, aligning the hourglass—flow from her resilient, service‑oriented nature. Interiority is concise but character‑specific; she acts with calm determination rather than exposition. The primary weakness is limited contradiction under pressure; her competence faces little internal friction. The cost lands in her solitude—“Cass alone remembered”—but is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds patterned pressure (radio, light, heartbeat) toward a charged reconfiguration where the ferry reintegrates and Cass accepts ongoing duty. Orientation is quick and clean; the shift to the grotto is taught and then operationalized. Closure lands with cost—only she remembers; the ghost schedule adds persistent constraint. Causal links within the lyric mode are coherent, with the hourglass turn serving as the decisive tactic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ferry, fog, and spectral grotto are vividly rendered and integrated with function: the grotto “responded,” revealing corridors that shape her mapping and choices. Micro‑setting objects (radio, hourglass) charge the final image and constrain tactics (turning the hourglass to match “clocks run sideways”). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, not a tourist catalog. The world’s rules remain consistent within the established surreal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reuniting scattered timelines to bring commuters safe—is legible and tightened through a decisive act (aligning the hourglass and braiding the radio signals). Escalation reads as deepening density rather than multiple reversals, fitting the lens. Agency drives the resolution; coincidence initiates but does not solve. The on‑page price is quieter (ongoing burden and isolation) but it charges the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Guardianship, mercy for the almost‑lost, and time’s pliability emerge organically through motifs (hourglass, tilted clocks, horn’s chord). The final ghost timetable and “keeper of the sideways clocks” reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext of service’s cost—being the sole rememberer—lingers. No single thesis is stated; the resonance accrues through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is stable and distinctly filtered through Cass’s workmanlike yet wonder‑attuned perception. Diction is controlled with rhythmic variation; brief dialogue lines carry function and tone. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; the pattern of accumulative imagery is taught early and sustained. Minor flourish risk never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑rich, and forward‑pushing; metaphors (“stalactites of frozen moonlight”) are evocative and consistent with the world’s logic. Repetition is purposeful (radio patterns, sideways clocks) without paraphrase loops. A touch of purple leans lush but does not muddle causality. Sentence rhythm varies well, and the closing cadence is earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—commuter ferry as liminal portal, radio as loom, hourglass turned sideways, a 7:15½ run—is fresh and memorable. The horn’s chord folding space and the spectral grotto’s responsive starlight feel non‑derivative and purposeful. Risks in concept and diction heighten meaning without confusion. Emotional truth (service with cost) anchors the novelty.</comment>
