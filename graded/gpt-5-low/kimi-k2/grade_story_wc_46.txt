<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—to share light without fire—anchors every choice, and the sacrifice of her mother‑charged sea glass is a felt cost. Interiority is specific (counting heartbeats, apology to shark) and embodied. The internal tension between memory and communal need (“weigh memory against hope”) surfaces credibly. A faint lack of friction beyond ritual steadies the arc just shy of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from arrival to polishing to union with the pearl, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration: the village illuminated and the shard surrendered. Orientation is clear from the opening (who/where/why), and the throughline holds. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence. The progression is smooth rather than nail‑tight, but coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto, mist, tide pools, and pearl integrate with action and constrain tactics (basin, sharkskin, proximity to the pearl) while charging the final image of light washing the village. Sensory detail is purposeful across sight, touch, and sound (“grotto sighed,” “applause”). The environment shapes the method and the outcome. The world’s quiet rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early and deepen as the shard thins and the pearl’s presence demands a choice. The primary tightening is internal and ritual: risking the loss of a personal relic to achieve communal light. The price—relinquishing the sea glass—is visible and binds want versus need. Pressure skews contemplative over adversarial, but the escalation still reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around inheritance, patience, and non‑destructive illumination; motifs (sea glass, polishing, zephyr bloom) reconfigure at the end without sermonizing. The mother’s teachings translate into the method and cost, earning the closing repricing (“they simply learned how to stay”). The final quiet bloom carries emotional aftereffect beyond plot. Resonance is layered and precise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled and lyrical without drifting in register; diction and rhythm adapt to pressure at the pearl. Dialogue is sparse and natural, with a graceful tonal pivot in the child’s line. Perceptual signature (patience, craft, sea‑bound noticing) is distinct. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and musical; images align (glass/pearl/light) and avoid muddle. Sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; repetition serves pattern rather than padding. A few lush turns verge on abundance but retain clarity. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sea glass thinned by gem‑polishing offered to a “pearl of stillness” as a non‑burning light source feels fresh and specific. The synthesis of ritual craft and communal need differentiates it from familiar magic‑light tropes. The costed sacrifice grounds novelty in human truth. Risks are taken in lyric mode without obscuring coherence.</comment>
