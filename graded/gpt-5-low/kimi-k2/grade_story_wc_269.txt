<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s drive is clear and embodied: a former coral-bleaching witness turned gauge keeper compelled to decode vanishing routes. Her agency leads each turn (tapping, assembling, descending), with a credible moment of hesitation before the spiral. Interiority is concrete and sensory (ear to titanium, bioluminescence), though internal contradiction is subtle rather than sharply dramatized. The endurance at the end (“vigil,” logging nothing) reads as a meaningful, earned stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned taps → coordinates → unsounded slick → descent → loom/sextant → restored lane → re-anchored station. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing (paths folded, restoration contingent on witness). Cost is felt in the risk and the refusal to reduce it to data; the ending’s “anchored to both sky and abyss” seals the before/after. The slightly truncated final line is a hairline seam but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sea station, its pillars, sensors, and emergency pontoons are concrete and tactically relevant; the environment literally opens (water-lid, spiral ramp) to shape choices. Sensory specificity is vivid without cataloging—bioluminescent seams, fossil shells that “remembered sunlight,” a brass sextant. Setting charges the final image (station “anchored” after the restoration). World rules are taught through action and remain consistent within the fable-logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“discover why some paths disappear”) is signaled early and deepens through a single decisive intensification at the slick. Escalation coheres: tapping becomes a method that provokes a response, enabling descent to the loom. The cost is primarily risk and renunciation (choosing witness over data), not a hard trade-off against a counterforce, but sufficient at this length. The earned return to vigil reflects a narrowed, clarified path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of witnessing, erasure vs folding, and “delayed revelation” interlock organically with ocean-code imagery and the loom of currents. The reef’s impossible color restores moral weight without sentimentality; the atlas/sextant transformation reweights the premise. The explicit line “Paths do not vanish; they wait for witnesses willing to descend” slightly overstates the thesis, trimming subtlety. Still, the final charged poise invites durable reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a stable close third POV; diction and rhythm suit the character and setting. Patterned elision (taps, folds) is taught and paid off; no head-hopping or register slips. Images and verbs are purposeful, and modulation under pressure reads intentional. The non-dialogue approach amplifies subtext through physical responses and sound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with fresh metaphors tied to action (“stars drowned,” “panels rose,” “seams like solder”). Occasional lushness never impedes clarity, but the final truncated sentence is a visible seam. Minor repetition (“periodically eternal” twice) is stylistic rather than padding. Rhythm varies well, sustaining momentum through the descent and return.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: post–fossil fuel sea-lane erasures as oceanic folds, tapped codes, and a literal water-hinge into a current-loom. The atlas/sextant/page metamorphosis is both surprising and inevitable given prior cues. Risk-taking heightens meaning without obscuring readability, and the ecological angle avoids cliché through specific, mythic-concrete inventions. The re-anchoring ending reframes the work’s logic memorably.</comment>
