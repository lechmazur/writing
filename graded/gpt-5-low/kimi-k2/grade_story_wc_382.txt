<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear desire (“to learn the language of old buildings”) meets embodied doubt (the rehearsed laugh; opening mail “meant for a ghost”). The widow applies pressure that reshapes the narrator’s stance through lessons and ritual. The branded chest is a concrete cost linked to accepting stewardship. The internal contradiction—skeptic politeness versus longing to be spoken through—earns the closing acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the seal-mediated “lessons” densify until the branding and wall’s answer reprice meaning. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph and time’s brief montage serves cadence and pressure. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the narrator becomes a conduit with cost (branding, promise-weight). Setups (seal, “agreed upon lies,” rooftop garden) pay off at the meteors and sealing of the body.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and integral: cedar scent, verbena tins, parapet, lemon balm, and meteors all shape action. The rooftop garden and night sky directly charge the final image (meteors as sentences; punctuation burning). The seal functions as micro‑setting/tool that constrains choices (pressing wax to brick, branding the chest). World rules (buildings “speak”) are learned through action without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the narrator will accept being “spoken through”—tightens from polite visits to ritual interrogation to bodily marking. The decisive deepening occurs when the widow brands the narrator, foreclosing refusal. Pressure is internal/existential, but escalates coherently under the accumulative lens. The mutual-interrogation turn reframes agency without deflating cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonance is strong in motifs (grammar/tense, interrogation, translation) and in the repricing of fluency as surrender. However, the final explicit theme line (“the language of old buildings is mostly made of agreed upon lies…”) undercuts subtlety. Subtext (not turning to face the dead; sugar as social lie turned communion) works beautifully. The closing image still lingers despite a touch of overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, assured lyric voice with clean, consistent POV; diction matches sensibility throughout. Dialogue is spare, charged, and subtextual (“Old buildings keep their own grammar,” “First lesson… Second lesson…”). Rhythm flexes well between image and action without head‑hopping. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (meteors as sentences; the seal as period). Syntax varies and pacing accelerates into the branding and meteor shower without muddle. A few stacked metaphors approach saturation but remain coherent and legible. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise—learning a city’s “grammar” via a seal, with the dead shifting tense—is fresh and confidently executed. Risks (lyric accumulative structure; anthropomorphic architecture) heighten stakes and cohere at the end. Specifics (cedar blotting wax, cornices as eyebrows, “future imperfect”) feel inevitable in hindsight. The widow’s tests and the mutual interrogation concept are inventive without gimmickry.</comment>
