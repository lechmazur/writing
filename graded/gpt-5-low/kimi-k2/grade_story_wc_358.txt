<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (“to cultivate foresight in action”) is dramatized through concrete choices: silk‑mapping, proposing the trade, and mastering the door rhythm. Relationship pressure with Mara reframes duty, and the badge exchange literalizes responsibility. Interiority is shown via tactile perception (wind, silk, bruise‑blue dawn) rather than label‑speak. Slightly limited contradiction on the page—she adapts quickly with little visible doubt—keeps this shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: silk mapping → reverse flow → container → training → bulb bursts/ribbon snaps → decisive door slam restores the town. Closure is a decisive change with cost (risk of expansion, broken bulb, snapped ribbon) paid on the page. Orientation is crisp early and remains coherent through the maze. Setups (patch, wind, doors, tides) all pay off without mechanical over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth constrains tactics and options (rearranged corridors, door rhythm) and directly shapes the ending act. The silk ribbon, bulb, tides, and doors function as micro‑setting tools that charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered, with wind patterns becoming a lived map. World rules (the sphere’s “breathing” through seams) are learned in action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent/contain the sphere and restore the town) is signaled early and escalates coherently. The tightening beat—the bulb bursts and ribbon snaps—forces a high‑risk, timed decision that narrows options to one precise act. Internal aim (foresight) directly informs the external tactic under pressure. Costs (silence deepening, risk of expansion, relinquished rest) are felt, not merely stated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of foresight-as-practice emerges organically through repeated door‑timing and the charged return of the patch. The final image (“foresight is a door…in time with the world’s hidden breathing”) reweights prior motifs (wind, doors, pulse) without sermonizing. A slight explicitness in the last lines edges toward articulation, but it remains earned by scene pressure. Subtext in Mara’s fear and the town’s silence sustains resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice balances lyric precision with clarity; diction fits the focalizer’s sensory intelligence without slipping into abstraction. Dialogue is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext (“I thought I was the only echo left”). Psychic distance is stable, and compression in peak beats remains legible. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme) with minimal scaffold; rhythm tightens at crisis without purple drift. Recurring images (silk, bulb, breath) are controlled and coherent; no metaphor muddle at the peak. Minor flourish is always tethered to action, and sentence variety keeps momentum. Clean mechanics and sequencing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a probability sphere “breathing” through wind seams in a container maze, tracked by silk, is distinctive and thematically integral. The patch’s luminous re‑sewing is an elegant, non‑gimmicky reweighting. Risks in concept and imagery pay off with clear stakes and tactic‑driven closure. Nothing reads templated or derivative.</comment>
