<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lina’s motive (defy “Burn the diary” to restore the captain’s joy) is specific and consistently dramatized through tactile micro‑choices: using prism light, donning the cracked goggles, placing them on him. Interiority is embodied (“gloved palms,” “throat tightened”) and contradiction is present via affectionate detachment versus urgent care. The relationship shift at the roof is earned by prior choices. The only softness is low resistance—her decoding flow feels a touch too smooth for the risk implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the climb’s floor‑by‑floor cadence tightens pressure toward the roof, with the cipher and light pattern deepening knowledge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: disobedience converts to a shared reclaiming of joy, with the fleet looming as cost. Orientation is clean from the opening. Minor limitation: obstacles are mostly atmospheric rather than consequential setbacks, slightly softening the felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire, elevator, prism windows, and roof wind are vivid and functional; scattered light both constrains a decoding tactic and charges the final aurora image. Tools-as-setting (goggles, glass, gears) are integrated with tactile specificity. Weather and altitude shape breath, timing, and choice. Minor check: world mechanics remain lyric rather than system‑tested, but at this length it works.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (save or burn) and escalates via the ticking ascent and decryption revelations. The key tightening occurs when Lina chooses method (prism light/goggles) and commits to a public, irreversible gesture on the roof. Cost is legible (disobeyed order under imminent fleet), though resistance is internal and atmospheric rather than contested on the page. Tension holds, if quietly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory versus joy, sorrow as ballast, and flight reclaimed accrue organically through recurring images rather than lecture. The cipher’s aphorisms risk tidiness, but their origin in the captain’s hand keeps them earned. The final laugh “like engines restarting” reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity persists (fleet’s approach) to keep resonance charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical/icy lexicon, auroral color). Rhythm modulates with the ascent; diction remains consistent with Lina’s sensibility. No head‑hopping; purposeful compression works. Slight tilt toward high lyricism, but clarity never falters.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: minimal scaffolding, high information density, and images that do multiple jobs (goggles as wound, tool, and lens). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent to motif; no muddled metaphors or looped phrasing. Cadence varies to match pressure and breath. A hint of aphoristic sheen remains, but it suits the diary frame.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Airship melancholy plus cipher via prism light and cracked‑lens star maps feels fresh and purposeful. The elevator‑as‑clock and the tonal “affectionate detachment” give it a singular stance. The emotional turn is inevitable in hindsight from seeded particulars. Not radical, but confidently original within mode.</comment>
