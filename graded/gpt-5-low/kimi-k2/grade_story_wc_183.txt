<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motive—recover sister/self through names—tightens into the stay/go renunciation with visible cost (the card crumbling, ship sinking). Contradictory impulses are live on the page (“Stay” vs “Go”), and micro‑choices (pulling threads, pressing the card to soil, exhaling the chord) reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority is specific and character‑particular without therapy‑speak. Minor abstraction at times, but emotion remains grounded in sensory action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: density of images escalates toward a decisive act (choosing “Go,” exhaling the chord) with cost. Setups pay off (thread → trapdoor → engine room; aberrant chord → exhalation), and the closure is legible as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration. Slight ding: the final line truncation blurs the last cadence, softening the closure image even though the choice lands beforehand.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship and fog are exquisitely specific and continually used to constrain choices (dissolving corridors, digesting fog, sinking ship) and charge the final images. Recurring objects (calliope, mirrors, vines) are integrated through action rather than static description. Sensory detail is rich yet purposeful across senses. World rules (memory as architecture) stay consistent through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (recover names/sister) and coherently tightens: follow the chord, thread the memories, reach the engine, choose at the rail. The price is unmistakable: relinquishing the ship and card to save a reconstituted self. Internal and external pressures interweave without redundancy. No antagonist needed; pressure grows from environment and vow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of identity, naming, and the limits of reunion (“unkindled solace”) are dramatized through concrete acts and recur reweighted at the end (“journey, not the arrival”). The emerald card, calliope, and garden function as thematic engines, not tokens. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion. Slight cadence bruise at the final fragment prevents a higher resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A distinctive lyrical voice with controlled focalization and consistent psychic distance; perception feels plausibly character‑bound. Rhythm modulates effectively across turns (mirror, cabin, hold, engine). The truncated last line disrupts the otherwise excellent cadence, necessitating a cap. No head‑hopping or unjustified register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is often superb—densely metaphorical yet purposeful—but the final sentence is cut off (“Above, the”), dulling the closure image and rhythm. Figurative saturation occasionally edges toward excess but remains mostly coherent. Proofing slip at the end is a significant artifact that touches the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High originality in synthesizing maritime ruin, carnival detritus, and a memory‑garden mechanic. The narrative thread device and the emerald swatch card are fresh and consequential. The aberrant chord as motive force is non‑obvious and earned. Minor execution blemish (truncated ending) is the only barrier to the top band.</comment>
