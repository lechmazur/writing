<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (to be visible to those who need her) is clear, embodied, and drives concrete micro‑choices, culminating in sacrificing “lullaby II” for the teen. Contradiction is present and earned: protect the cache vs. answer immediate need. Emotions are tactile and particular (palms over joists like braille, tape warmth on collarbone). The final renunciation is credible and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the outage’s “sapphire hush” deepens, the found fragment densifies the pattern, and the footsteps force a charged choice. Closure lands in a resonant reconfiguration: Lira foregoes her plan to cache and instead places the tape under the floor to reach the teen, with a felt cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the single scene tightens without drift. The final realization (“visibility travels in both directions”) is earned by the act, not stated in lieu of it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library’s crawlspaces, pipe chases, and flickering lights are not decorative—they constrain tactics, enable memory bleed, and stage the final floorboard transmission. Sensory specificity is rich yet purposeful (sweating metal, oxide like rusted petals, captive stars). The environment charges the last image as the voice rises “through wood and bone.” World rules (ghost currents in copper) are discovered by action and remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility as care) is signaled early and tightened when footsteps appear, forcing a trade‑off: safety/preservation vs. immediate aid. The meaningful turn is Lira reversing her caching plan to place the fragment under the board. Cost is legible (risk of exposure, loss of a prized shard from a finite set). Pressure remains coherent and grows with the deepening outage.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as shelter and visibility as mutual is embedded in objects and acts, not preached. Recurring images (“sapphire hush,” magnetism, bone) reweight at the end as the voice tells the teen, “You are not alone.” The realization that visibility is reciprocal reframes Lira’s project with emotional consequence. Ambiguity remains humane without vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and filtered through Lira’s tactile, methodical perception; elevated diction fits a life attuned to books and hush. POV is steady and modest in knowledge, with no leakage. Rhythm modulates well, tightening around the footsteps and softening in the final charged poise. Dialogue is minimal but precisely placed to pivot the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled and efficient despite lyric density; images earn their keep and rarely overflower. No notable loops or scaffolding; sentences advance action, place, and emotion simultaneously. A few repeated motifs (“sapphire hush”) are pattern‑taught and payoff‑bearing, not redundant. Syntax varies to manage breath and pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—ghost currents from tape in copper, a crawlspace archivist of voices, and a live outage mediating memory—feels singular and inevitable. The final turn is non‑obvious yet fully prepared. Risks in premise and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth grounds the novelty.</comment>
