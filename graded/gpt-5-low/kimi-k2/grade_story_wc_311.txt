<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (to name/forgive) meets grief and absence; embodied images (hollow ribs, heartbeat restored) ground the lyricism. Micro-choices—aligning the prism, speaking the vow—are specific and earned. Internal contradiction (keeping the dead vs. letting them rest) plays in the moment, not summarized. Slight remove from concrete resistance keeps it just shy of visceral peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual of scattered light → names → internal reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first line; the observatory, atlas, and cylinders cohere causally. Closure lands on the page with cost (names sinking into ribs; heartbeat restored; benediction). No loose set-ups or logic leaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, prism shards, blind telescope, and dusk are vivid and tool-like, not postcard. The space and objects directly enable the tactic (scattered moonlight through broken prism) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (brine, frost, lilac in winter) and POV-filtered. Rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal but legible: transform fear through naming and pay with memory. Pressure tightens as light exhausts and names carve into him; the atlas bleaching visually marks cost. The final vow is an active stance with consequence, not a soft reset. Slightly low on overt external pressure, but the accumulative intensification works.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: naming reframes monstrosity as sacrifice; memory as an ethical act. The “here be dragons” atlas reweights at the end into lanterns under waves—clean CR/RR without sermonizing. One explicit line about his purpose risks stating the thesis, but the scene earns it. The afterimage lingers with humane complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, distinct lyric voice with steady psychic distance; diction and rhythm suit the reaper’s centuries and grief. Minimal dialogue is precise and charged (“I name you… / Then remember…”). No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions are taught and paid off. A hair from maximal due to uniform nobility of register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is dense yet clear; images do multiple jobs (“each needle carrying a syllable”). Rhythm varies; no noticeable loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent to light, sea, and memory; it rarely over-piles. A couple of near-ornate lines brush purple but don’t blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reaper + observatory + atlas monsters reframed via crystallized light is an elegant, fresh synthesis. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (monsters as compressed sacrifice) and the closing benediction feels earned. Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Memorable and particular rather than template.</comment>
