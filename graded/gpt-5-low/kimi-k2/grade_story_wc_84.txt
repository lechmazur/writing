<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lira’s motives and micro-choices are clear and embodied (hovering fingers, aligning the chip, obeying the pulsing trails), with the pilgrim applying soft but pertinent pressure. Her fear (“afraid its memory might burn her”) adds credible hesitation before action. Internal contradiction is modest but present, and the final acceptance of resonance over destination reads earned. The pilgrim is spare but effective, though their own motives remain largely emblematic rather than individuated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → decoding under the “right” sky → projection → following pulsing trails → conceptual compass. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (home as frequency) with a felt cost of relinquishing destination. Causality is coherent, though the chip’s convenient presence leans fated more than pressured. The final line fragment is a polish slip, but closure has already landed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory’s copper domes, meridian line, and roof are vivid and tactically relevant (must decode under the sky; aligning to the broken meridian). Sensory choices feel character-filtered and purposeful, and the environment charges the final image. World rules are learned through action (matrix, projection, pulsing trails) without exposition dumps. Minor cap due to global polish issues elsewhere precluding 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent early (belonging/home), with one strong tightening: the pilgrim’s condition that decoding must occur under the originating sky, followed by the instruction to follow pulsing trails. Agency drives the turns (aligning, slotting, following, closing the parenthesis), and the price is a shift from place-seeking to living with calibrated absence. Escalation is quiet but consistent with the accumulative design. No luck-driven resolution undercuts the arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of belonging, absence, and mutual legibility accrue through concrete motifs (matrix, foundry, printer-font stars, parenthesis). The repricing—home as frequency rather than locus—reweights the opening beautifully. One explicit thematic line (“WE ARE THE MISSING PIECES OF EACH OTHER”) veers toward declaration, dulling some subtext. Overall resonance remains strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close maintains stable distance and an idiosyncratic perceptual signature (“brilliant dimness,” “Morse code heartbeat”). Dialogue is spare, suggestive, and functional, with the pilgrim’s idiom differentiated. Rhythm modulates well between stillness and motion. Minor end-fragment is a copy error that affects polish more than POV control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Many lines do double duty with crisp, evocative images tied to action (twilight soldering, letters as cast type). Figurative density is high but largely coherent and voice-driven rather than purple. However, the final sentence is truncated (“the next shard of the”), a material artifact in the last beat that dulls the closing image and precludes top-band scores. Otherwise, momentum and clarity hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of drone tech, type-foundry matrices, and celestial mechanics to explore belonging feels fresh and integrated. The parenthesis/glyph turn is an elegant, unexpected yet inevitable move that reweights prior motifs. Risk is taken in the lyric-accumulative structure and pays off with clarity. A polish slip keeps it just shy of the very top tier.</comment>
