<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is concrete and sustained by the mother’s promise; the eel herder’s micro‑choices (stone order, switching Fibonacci to golden rectangle, opening the locket, scattering the rocks) reveal priorities under pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile acts with dust and stones. The cost registers as ongoing endurance and self‑renunciation rather than triumph. Internal contradiction (precognition that never grants certainty) usefully complicates action without hand‑waving.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases toward a charged poise where the promise is re‑priced (“so the stars can finally rest”) and the jar is won at a cost. Orientation is clear from the opening (where/who/what world rule) and each beat flows from the last through purposeful pattern work. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration and a brief Decisive Change (catching the dust, curse lifting for a breath) with a felt price of continued duty. No causality gaps; the tightening is modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tidal bluff and frictionless world are vividly rendered and actively constrain choices (stones slide, surf halts, dust is catchable; the aurora “sigh” governs resource timing). Objects-as-setting recur (painted rocks, locket, jar) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is precise and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. World rules stay consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfilling/redefining the promise through pattern mastery) is flagged early and tightens when the fragmentary vision requires a pattern switch and then a timed capture of falling dust. The on‑page price is subtle but legible: the curse’s partial lifting underscores the burden that returns, and the scattering of the charged rocks reads as renunciation. Escalation is primarily density and cadence rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens. A slightly sharper on‑page risk or jeopardy would push this higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres through the lived particulars of pattern, promise, and rest; the closing reprices the mission from prevention to release. Recurring images (spirals, primes, dust) accrue meaning and the final jar image resonates without tidy moralizing. A few direct statements (“Every promise is a pattern”; “understanding is a promise”) edge toward explicitness but remain earned by scene. Ambiguity lingers in a productive way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is singular, controlled, and textural; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (stone placement beats vs. vision beats) while staying coherent. POV certainty matches what this character can plausibly infer; brief dialogue carries resonance without exposition. No head‑hopping or stance drift. The lyric register feels character‑bound rather than authorial.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful figurative language, and varied cadence. Imagery remains coherent to the world’s physics and motif (frictionless sea, dust, geometry) without purple sprawl. No noticeable scaffold loops or filter stacks; momentum holds through the climax. Minor repetition functions as motif rather than redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: eel‑herding in a frictionless world meets mathematical ritual and star‑dust husbandry with a reinterpreted oath. Turns arise from established elements (pattern shifts, aurora‑timed dust) rather than late rule drops. The vision of letting stars rest reframes familiar “save the world” stakes into something stranger and humane. Bold but legible without gimmick.</comment>
