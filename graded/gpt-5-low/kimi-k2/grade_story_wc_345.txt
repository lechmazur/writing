<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Luma’s altruism and constraint (can’t speak, chooses chalk) motivate coherent action, and Kiran’s curiosity-to-leadership arc is clean. Internal contradiction is light—most emotion is archetypal rather than messy or individuated. The sacrifice (Luma dissolving into the bell) lands as a credible price derived from her values. Secondary characters (mechanic, twins, archivist) add texture but apply minimal personal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is strong: chalk → Kiran reexamines → bell discovery → community forms → woven threads → nebula anchored → Luma’s dissolution. Closure reads as a decisive change with an on‑page cost and a reweighted world. The stakes are tracked and paid off through the final image of the bell anchoring the nebula. The clipped final fragment “Years later, Kiran—now” is a structural blemish post‑closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Orchard Planet and floating arches are vividly particular and directly constrain tactics (threading the arches; arches cracking raises pressure). Recurring objects (bell, chalk) are integrated into the environment and charge the final image. Sensory selection (lavender cloud, midnight‑blue blossoms) serves tone rather than cataloging. World rules (dew as filament, trust anchoring nebula) stay consistent and are dramatized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the orchard by anchoring the nebula) is clear early and tightens with “before the final crack.” Agency is credible: Kiran proposes the net, the group adapts (tensions, knots, rhythm), and Luma pays the price. Escalation is mostly linear but effective; fatigue and fear deepen pressure without a hard reversal. The resolution emerges from chosen collaboration, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of chosen family, trust as infrastructure, and communal repair emerge through images (chalk as invitation, bell as heart). However, the explicit maxim “Family is the orchard we choose to tend together” states the thesis, edging into moralizing. Subtext otherwise works via the nebula’s reliance on trust and the cost of Luma’s endurance. The resonance is earned but slightly sweetened by declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is consistent, image‑driven, and confident without head‑hopping. Diction (“brambled hope,” “blackboard of possibility”) establishes a distinct cadence that modulates under pressure. No dialogue necessary; the chalk questions function as voiced action. Minor sentimentality and the closing fragment nick polish but not focal control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are often beautiful and purposeful, with recurring objects doing double duty. There’s mild purple stacking at times, but clarity holds. The final fragment (“Years later, Kiran—now”) is a visible artifact in the last third and undercuts finish. Occasional intensifiers (“simultaneous bloom,” “hummed with brambled hope”) verge on excess but don’t obscure cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ghost‑gardener, chalk‑led organizing, and a nebula anchored by trust synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame. The bell’s reweighting and the arches as a practical constraint feel non‑derivative and inevitable in hindsight. The communal engineering montage (threads, star‑sailor knots) adds ingenuity without gimmickry. Minor conventional notes (stated moral) temper the singularity.</comment>
