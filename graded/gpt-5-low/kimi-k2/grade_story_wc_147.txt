<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motives—preserve a moment vs. survive—intensify under the clock. The contradictory pull (clutching the vial while choosing to release the memory) is embodied and earned. Micro‑choices (unscrewing the vial, pressing helmet to the altar, choosing which future instant to keep) reveal a coherent value hierarchy with cost. No therapy‑speak or tidy rationality; the renunciation feels lived-in and paid for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative texture feeding a causal turn) is taught early and held. Orientation is swift (temple, dome, HUD clock), and the decisive act—relinquishing the mother’s memory—unlocks the altar with visible cost. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she chooses to preserve the surrender moment, reweighting the premise. No dropped set‑ups; the distress signal ceasing cements the bargain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The temple, hush, and exosuit constraints shape choices at every beat (oxygen, coral‑fused mechanism, buoy ascent). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (algae‑filmed constellations, whale song entering as the hush thins). The vial functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image. World rules (coral retreats, circuitry brightens) remain consistent and legible through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused and escalates: the clock ticks, the mechanism resists, realization forces a sacrifice. The key tightening is the insight that the temple stores instinct, not moments, which demands a renunciation. Cost is unmistakable—the fading of her mother’s last smile—while gaining a single perfect future instant. Pressure is coherent and grows without coincidence bailing her out.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—surrender as a form of power; choosing to live forward—emerges from concrete acts (the dropped perfume, the chosen future instant). The “gathered hush” reweights meaning, avoiding moralizing and offering layered resonance. The final image (empty yet luminous vial; private ocean of quiet) answers the core question non‑literally. Counter‑readings (loss vs. transfiguration) remain plausible without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single, controlled POV with a distinct lyrical texture that matches pressure and environment. Rhythm modulates well—from dense hush to the loud surface—without head‑hopping. Diction stays within the character’s plausible lexicon for a scientist‑diver, with metaphor patterned and consistent. The lone spoken line breaks the lyric surface effectively and feels earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, purposeful metaphor, and varied cadence serving momentum. No scaffolding loops or synonym churn; images pull double duty (gardenia scent as trigger and loss). Figurative language is coherent to ocean/temple/hush; no mixed vehicles that blur sense. The last lines land with clean, concrete images rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>An underwater temple that preserves not moments but the instinct to keep them is a fresh turn. The perfume vial trade for a single perfect future instant reframes memory tropes with specificity. Risks (lyric density, conceptual closure) pay off cleanly and feel inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis of object, environment, and thematic calculus reads singular, not templated.</comment>
