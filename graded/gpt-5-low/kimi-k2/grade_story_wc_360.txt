<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear motive—solve emotion like an equation—meets contradictory lived pressure as empathy leaks and the borrowed persona frays. Her decision to reverse the process and accept the cost (halo cracking, prints ashing, loss of the borrowed self) is earned. Embodied specifics—metal taste, press’s breath—ground interiority. Minor hedge: the astronomer’s whisper risks outsourcing agency but she reclaims it in the reversal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure ratchets via vanishing stars, leaks, and autonomous press, culminating in a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on page with cost—the cracked halo, destroyed prints, relinquished persona—while reweighting the premise. Orientation is clean from the first line. The backward run of the press is a precise causal pivot that tightens options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop, press, and topaz roof are integrated tools and constraints, not décor; they shape tactics (letterpress mechanics, reverse run) and charge the final image. The halo as object‑as‑setting recurs and dictates physical choices. Sensory texture is vivid yet purposeful. World rules stay consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to finalize the broadside/experiment before time erases the sky—tightens as stars wink out and emotion escapes containment. The key escalation is her choice to reverse the transposition, which incurs visible loss and forecloses the original path. Internal and external pressures interweave coherently. Stakes remain intimate but consequential, scaled well to the form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme arises through image and action: transposed empathy as inversion, the cost of quantifying feeling, and the necessity to “become the distance.” The final theorem line functions as a charged in‑world credo rather than moralizing, reweighting prior beats. Ambiguity is purposeful (the “I was never here”/“stay” print) and lingers. Slight explicitness prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature—mechanical and celestial lexicons fused. Psychic distance modulates cleanly under stress without leakage, save the purposeful astronomer intrusion. Diction remains apt to the character’s craft and mindset. The single spoken line lands as textured subtext rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with crisp, original images; line‑level rhythm varies and propels. Figurative saturation is deliberate and coherent; few, if any, mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold drags momentum. Slight risk of lushness in clustered metaphors prevents 9+.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: letterpress as empathy transposer, halo fragment as emotional substrate, astrophysics as emotional math. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight—the reverse print and crack are seeded. Risks (lyric density, conceptual closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image reframes the premise with memorable originality.</comment>
