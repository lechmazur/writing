<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motives are clear and embodied—the copyist’s fidelity to music and hunger to “replant” story drive every micro‑choice. A credible inner tension surfaces around the lyric’s dilemma (“cloak…or let it wander?”) and resolves in a costly commitment to safeguarding. Interiority is specific (ink, brittle paper, dust as medium) rather than abstract. The arc is quiet but earned; a hair more contradiction under peak pressure would lift it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the radio’s emergence, dust’s animation, and co‑conducting intensify toward a resonant closure. Closure lands with cost when she chooses stewardship—gathering motes into a vial and accepting delay (“until ears grow hungry again”). Orientation is clean from the opening, and setup/payoff threads (no blank pages → dust as score) are honored. The cost is subtle but legible and tied to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ruined conservatory, mist, and radio are vivid, selective, and filtered through a music‑maker’s eye. Environment constrains tactics (no paper → use dust; radio’s dial as heat/guide) and charges the ending (vial against her heart). World rules are learned through action, not exposition, and sensory range is strong without excess. A touch more spatial choreography during the dust‑orchestra swell could further ground the magic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes consolidate around preserving/reseeding narrative; pressure builds via the pirate signal’s invitations and the lyric’s choice. The meaningful tightening arrives with the binary—silence vs wandering—answered by stewardship. Tension remains more textural than adversarial, but agency clearly drives the turn. Slightly sharper consequence or risk on the page would heighten felt stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory, transmission, and custodianship accrue through particulars (dust, scores, the reworked violin line) rather than stated moral. The final charged poise—keeping stories “until ears grow hungry again”—reweights prior images with a gentle, unsentimental cost. Subtext of art as seed and piracy as caretaking reframes without sermonizing. A marginally stronger counter‑pressure to the choice could deepen complexity further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the copyist’s sensibility; diction and rhythm adapt under rising intensity without losing control. Patterned elisions (seed/broadcast/dust transformations) are taught early and pay off at closure. No head‑hopping or register slips. A few lines flirt with lushness, but cadence remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images do double duty (dust as medium and memory), and sentences vary in length and rhythm. Figurative density is high but coherent, with minimal scaffolding or loops. The prose propels rather than stalls, and the final image lands clean. One or two ornate metaphors could be trimmed without loss, but they don’t blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—pirate radio as seed‑casting for story, dust as mnemonic instrument, a copyist as conductor—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects reconfigure meaning at the end without gimmickry. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes while staying legible. Only the gentleness of on‑page cost keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
