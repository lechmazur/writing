<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear motive—she’s a translator of overlooked histories—and concrete micro‑choices under pressure: stepping through the painting, refusing to follow the children, paying with a memory. The costed renunciation (not following, surrendering the grandmother’s trembling‑hands memory) reads earned. Interiority is sensorially grounded rather than labeled. A touch more internal contradiction on the parapet would deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motif density tightens toward the costed exchange and the decision to carry the story back. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she accepts the role and pays in memory—then reaffirms it by raising the fragment. The final sentence truncation slightly blurs the parting image, softening impact. Orientation is clean from the first lines (market, catwalks, role) through the portal and return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The market, canvas, and lighthouse function as charged micro‑settings; the lens fragment acts as an object‑as‑setting that gates passage and charges the final image. Sensory specificity is high and consistently filtered through the translator’s eye. World rules are learned by action (fragment + painting = entry) without dump. Setting could constrain physical options more overtly, but it still shapes tactic and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor and transmit overlooked histories—tightens through the portal sequence to the parapet and culminates in the paid memory and the refusal to follow. The exchange in salt provides a visible price that reweights options. Pressure is lyric rather than adversarial, yet coherent and escalating under the chosen lens. A sharper external pinch point would raise urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Recurring images (lens, thread, boats) evolve to articulate a nuanced thesis about history as sail rather than chain. Subtext operates via object choices and the market’s economy of memory; the final act reweights earlier material without sermonizing. One line (“histories are not chains but sails”) edges toward explicit statement, but the scene earns it. The afterimage of warned ships and a chosen role lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyric perceptual signature with disciplined cadence; diction matches the character’s vocation as a translator of subtleties. POV remains stable and confident, with brief dialogue carrying thematic charge. Rhythm modulates effectively between wonder and decision. Minor risk of flourish accumulation is mostly controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and efficient; images often do double duty. Occasional metaphor stacking stays coherent, but the truncated final sentence dulls the closing snap. Minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum is preserved across transitions. A touch more syntactic variation in one or two clusters could heighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market, memory‑economy, and translation‑through‑color synthesize into a fresh, coherent vision. The fragment’s usage and the salt‑priced memory exchange feel specific rather than trope‑driven. Risk‑taking (portal via painting mechanics, tonal “eternal instant”) pays off cleanly. Minor familiarity in lighthouse imagery is offset by execution.</comment>
