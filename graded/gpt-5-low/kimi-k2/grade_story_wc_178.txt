<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Naram-Sin’s motive—securing cosmic order over personal glory—is consistent and sharpened by his frugality and skepticism. His hesitation at the covenant and swift, weighted acceptance register as a genuine internal conflict with visible cost. Embodied details (patched coat, fasting, charcoal diagrams) anchor interiority in action. The renunciation forecloses a future path (naming comets) in a way the story has earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: tile permutations → mapped palace → hidden chamber → covenant and renunciation. Orientation is firm from the opening, and the closure lands on-page with cost (“surrender his star-charts... portion of every future night”). The causal lens holds through to the final image of the Crooked Staff; no reliance on coincidence to resolve. The fused tile and settled palace create a decisive change and persistent constraint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The palace’s dusk-labyrinth and ziggurat heart are vivid and continuously functional, guiding tactics (step only where memory is lightest) and enabling the discovery. The chamber’s mechanics (obsidian/cedar gears) constrain and define the covenant scene. Recurring objects (tile, charcoal, quartz lens) act as micro-settings shaping choices and the final image. The environment charges the ending with the palace’s “dusky harmony” and steady constellation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the turning sky—is clear and tightens from nightly work to a single moral calculus at the chamber. The seventh-dusk stilling and the voice-diagram offer a credible escalation and test of values. The choice extracts a visible price (future nights and charts), not a symbolic dodge. Pressure is coherent and protagonist-driven throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: empirical devotion versus mystical covenant; order secured by personal renunciation. The final image (keeping only a useless lens) reweights the earlier devotion to measurement into sacrifice for stability. “A lock that listens for the right devotion” matures into a lived ethic, not a platitude. Ambiguity remains humane without confusion—no sermonizing or cheap symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person closely hews to Naram-Sin’s perceptual bias (astronomical frames, material frugality) with consistent diction. Elevated language is justified by the mythic frame and remains controlled. No dialogue needed; voice modulation aligns with rising pressure (from observant to incantatory at the covenant). No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is dense yet disciplined; images carry multiple jobs (lapis columns tuning to dusk, equations as devotion). Occasional lushness skirts purple but maintains clarity and propulsion. No paraphrase loops or cadence ruts impede momentum. Final lines cleanly resolve by image without explanatory clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Babylonian clockwork cosmology, a magic-square as navigational covenant, and “equations of devotion” feel distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. The sacrifice of observation to preserve order is a non-obvious, thematically rich turn. Risk-taking in tone and myth-tech integration heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The concept commits fully and follows its implications to a charged, quiet end.</comment>
