<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to find microclimates and build safe zones—drives concrete micro-choices (reviving consoles, locating archives, tracing coordinates). The internal contradiction (habitual abandonment vs. choosing to stay) is dramatized rather than told, culminating in a credible renunciation. Emotions are embodied through tactile work and the bookmark’s evolving charge. The cost is felt in her commitment to “stay,” though external pressure remains gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: awakening the room → discovering maps → committing to build a kiln and stay. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and decisive intention, with the bookmark placed as placeholder for action, and the final image reweights “measurement vs. making.” Orientation is clear early. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual, present but not severe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is tactile and purposive: thawing metal, false panel, reluctant ducts, and the archive shape access and action. Environment constrains and enables choices (heat, maps), and the bookmark functions as an object-as-setting that charges the ending. Sensory detail is vivid without cataloguing. World rules (old station tech) stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing abandonment to build inquiry havens) is signaled and tightened by the discovery of “Safe Corridors” and the map’s terrace coordinates. Pressure escalates modestly via the room’s revival and the emotional turn from narration to commitment. The price—foreclosing her pattern of leaving—is legible but mostly internal. Lack of a stronger external counterforce keeps tension refined rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of making vs. measuring, abandonment vs. staying, and inquiry as warmth accrue through concrete acts (scraping frost, coaxing ducts, placing the bookmark). The final image reframes the premise: “when measurement gave way to making” functions as conceptual repricing. Occasional explicit statements (“places that measure the human heart”) skate close to thesising but remain earned by prior particulars. The thawing heart motif deepens rather than decorates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyric POV with a perceptual signature—ritualized narration of tasks—stays stable and controlled. Diction is consistent with character and situation; psychic distance modulates cleanly. The self-narration device folds into action rather than explaining it. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with strong verbs and precise nouns; images are fresh (“rime in thin curls like pages”). Figurative density is high but coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Minimal scaffolding and no loops slow momentum. Cadence supports the accumulative build and the closing charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—glassblower resurrecting a thawing weather station to found inquiry havens—is fresh and specific. The cracked bookmark as tool, talisman, and baton is an elegant throughline. Risk-taking in tone and method (self-narration) heightens coherence and stakes without obscuring clarity. The final conceptual turn feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
