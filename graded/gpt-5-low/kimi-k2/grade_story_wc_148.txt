<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Leif’s motive—pursuing the hush to reframe his father’s legacy—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete micro-choices (descending, keying both doors, threading mirrors). Interiority stays character-specific and embodied (“sustaining impossibilities,” fingers on carved names). Internal contradiction is present but subtle (risking body/time vs. compulsion to gather painful truth). The closing acceptance (wearing the hush as armor; fused ring) reads as an earned endurance with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation lands early (who/where/when and the lighthouse-prison), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through the descent and mirror-labyrinth. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the labyrinth collapses and the lattice becomes a ring, charging the final stance. Cost is legible on the page (the binding ring and the burden of carried hush). The beats progress coherently from door to door to mirrors to return, without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison, jagged reef, spiral stair, and mirror labyrinth are tactile and integrated into action. The environment constrains and enables choices (hidden downward stairs; doors keyed by a confessional lattice; bedrock chamber; search boats below). The lattice-as-object evolves into a ring, charging the final image. Sensory detail (wet stone, lantern oil, copperlight) is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming and reweaving the hush) is signaled early and tightens at the pulsing second door and through the mirror-threading. The escalation is accumulative: density increases, the hush sharpens from velvet to keening, culminating in mirrors cracking and collapse. The cost is internalized but concrete (accepting the burden and the ring). While largely interior, the pressure coheres and narrows options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of truth/lie, confession vs. sunlight, and generational myth are embedded in objects (confessional lattice) and actions (threading, mirror-braiding). The final image reweights the premise: silence becomes a carried, armored responsibility. One explicit thesis line (“the hush was not silence...”) slightly overstates what the scene already shows, softening subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely tracks Leif’s perception; diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful. Patterned imagery (copperlight, hush, lattice) is taught and reprised without head-hopping or stance drift. Compression serves mood and momentum, and uncertainty is legible where intended. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext through image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density and forward motion; line-level rhythm varies with pressure. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and scene-anchored (no mixed vehicles), avoiding purple excess. Minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops; images do multiple jobs (confessional lattice as tool/theme). The prose remains clear through the peak beats and at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a fable’s aftermath refracted through a lighthouse-prison, confessional metal as key, and a hush made of unheard cries. The mirror-labyrinth risks familiar imagery but is freshly purposed as a weaving of competing truths into burden. The ring-fusion payoff feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold conceptual choices heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
