<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—guarding a space for innovation—meets a credible counter‑impulse: fear of trespass and loss of control. Her choices escalate under pressure (planting the seed, descending, dissolving the key), revealing a real cost: surrendering proprietorship. Interiority is image‑driven yet specific (mirrors reflecting intentions, forgetting one’s name) and not therapy‑speak. The renunciation at the end is earned by prior beats rather than a sudden epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑POV, clean anchors (Mara, lodge, brook) and coherent Hybrid/accumulative causality: seed → influence → bloom → descent → surrender → merger. Closure lands on the page with cost as the master key dissolves and Mara relinquishes control; the house’s autonomy is a decisive change and conceptual repricing. Set‑ups (the note’s riddle; mirrors/orthogonal movement) pay off in the staircase/cavern and living maze. No teleports or resets; pressure tightens toward a legible after-state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lodge, brook, courtyard, and corpse flower are sensorially vivid and functional: the brook “sings a new key,” feeds the house, and the flower becomes the literal threshold/staircase. Environment constrains choices (descent) and charges closure (merged house‑maze organism). Details are POV‑filtered (escape‑room consoles, glyph consoles) and consistent with the world’s shifting rules. The setting’s specificity is integral rather than ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control vs evolution—is clear and escalates: secret seed influence, guests’ gauntlet, eruption, and the key’s dissolution. The decisive tightening is Mara choosing to lose proprietorship to keep innovation uncaged. Pressure is coherent and grows from her agency rather than coincidence resolving the conflict. The cost is explicit and enduring (role surrendered; the house now chooses riddles).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of control, surrender, and innovation emerge organically through concrete images (mirrors of intention; forgetting names to open locks). The final reweighting—innovation safeguarded by letting it escape—resonates with the corpse flower test. Slight on‑the‑nose line (“safeguarding innovation meant letting it escape”) softens the subtextual finish. Even so, the final image of the ajar door and forgetting certainty carries genuine aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (“orthogonal,” “storm‑born silence,” “lattice of light”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—calm setup, incantatory mid, tightened cadence at surrender. Diction stays coherent with the character’s vocation and the story’s mode. Minimal dialogue is purposeful and charged (“Grow”), functioning as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density; images do more than one job (corpse flower as puzzle, test, portal). Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains coherent and propulsive. Repetition patterns (“orthogonal,” “silence”) are motif‑driven rather than looped scaffolding. Syntax and paragraphing vary, sustaining momentum into the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Combining escape‑room craft with a corpse flower’s uncanny biology and non‑Euclidean puzzles feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “forgetting to solve” mechanic and the house becoming a self‑curating organism elevate beyond trope. Risks (mythic diction, concept‑heavy turn) pay off with clear stakes and a concrete cost. The vision is cohesive and memorable.</comment>
