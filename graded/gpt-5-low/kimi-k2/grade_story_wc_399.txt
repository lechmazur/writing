<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Her motive—to preserve the prophet’s fading echo—is clear and embodied through specific choices (the diagonal cut, the choice of silence, the touch on the parapet). The internal turn from mourning to stewardship reads earned by the surrender of control. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. communal trust) coexist on the page without tidy moralizing. Secondary figures (monks) apply quiet pressure by method, not dialogue, keeping focus on her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via the echo dimming and ritual intensification rather than plot reversals. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she consecrates by relinquishing control and distributing the echo, with a concrete cost stated (“preservation meant surrendering control”). The final silver speck in the engine reweights the premise with a lasting constraint and ongoing price. Orientation is clear from the opening and stays coherent in one continuous scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion and kinetic parapet are tactile systems that shape action (humming silk diaphragms, pitch shifts, shards dividing, hinge warmth). Environment constrains method (peripheral awareness, quiet ritual) and charges the last image (silver speck within the engine). Sensory palette is rich across modalities (sound, touch, air, light) without tourist cataloging. World rules are learned through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: preserve the echo before it gutters. Escalation is a density increase: the echo manifests, then is divided and surrendered, with the live clock of fading memory. The meaningful tightening is the choice to offer silence and share shards, foreclosing possession for preservation. Pressure is coherent, though largely tonal rather than confrontational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-commons and preservation-through-surrender emerges from concrete acts (silence over speech, diagonal clearings, shard distribution). The final image reconceives permanence: wisdom as a communal, breathing mechanism, not a captured artifact. Ambiguity remains purposeful (what is “sharpened silence” costs her ownership), avoiding didacticism. Recurring images (diagonal, pavilion hum, silver) accrue meaning rather than symbolize loudly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, distinctive lyric voice with consistent focalization through the walker’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates to match ritual cadence; diction is cohesive and character‑specific. No head‑hopping; certainty matches perceivable facts within this world. Elision is purposeful and taught by early patterning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multi‑function density (image, action, and theme) with few redundancies; momentum persists through lushness. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and world‑true (wind into quieter wind; tuning‑fork pitch). Minor risk of purple is mitigated by consistent system metaphors and clear sequence. The closing cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—kinetic parapet, diagonal walking, conjured clearings, echo-as-light shards—is singular and integrated with stakes. The ritual logic (preserve by relinquishing) feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in tone and design heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. The final conceptual turn (memory housed as a silver speck in a living engine) is inventive and fitting.</comment>
