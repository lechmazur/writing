<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied: atonement via preserving names, executed through tactile, craft-specific choices (rebraiding the rope, pressing wax). The guilt/forgiveness tension is active on the page, with memories surfacing as she works. Micro‑choices track a value hierarchy (care over force, remembrance over utility). The final endurance—choosing to carry the charged rope and cast a new bell—reads earned with a felt emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and ritual steps toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the wax tablet’s imprint and glowing footprints—a before/after that repurposes war‑casting into name‑keeping with cost acknowledged. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). The sequence is legible with a single scene and one deepening turn (rope resonates → names released → imprint secured).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: ice prisms, narrow ice steps, and aurora all influence action and cadence. The rope and sanctum behave as environment-tools that constrain tactics; cold, melt, and resonance matter to outcomes. The final image (glowing footprints; dawn in the forge) is charged by place. Sensory selection is POV-filtered through a caster’s craft lexicon.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve names) is present from the outset and tightens as the ritual risks reawakening guilt. Escalation is a textural intensification (aurora brightens; rope resonates; names release), culminating in the irrevocable act of impressing the names into wax. The cost is primarily internal but legible. A single tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of transforming instruments of war into vessels of remembrance is earned through concrete craft actions, not told moral. Recurring images (wax, bell, rope-as-waveform, aurora light) shift meaning at the end to consecrate names rather than erase them. The final choice reframes “lost wax” into “what the wax had lost,” a clean conceptual repricing. Sentiment is restrained by specificity (Lina, Tor, Arin) and tactile process.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric voice is confident, consistent, and plausibly filtered through a maker’s perception; syntax modulates with pressure. Metaphors (rope as waveform; droplets as notes) are controlled and coherent. No head‑hopping, clean stance, and purposeful elision patterns. The diction occasionally risks lushness but remains legible and scene-advancing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density; lines often carry multiple loads (image, action, theme). A few lush phrases recur (“technically gentle,” “snowmelt ardor”) but read as motif rather than filler. Figurative language stays coherent to the established physics and craft. Rhythm is varied, with minimal scaffold or redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rope as frozen waveform, punched card aligning with braids, and lost‑wax atonement synthesize into a strikingly original mechanism and image system. The reweighting at the end feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking is purposeful and lands without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template beats while delivering emotional truth through craft particulars.</comment>
