<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation (to reopen and understand “borrowed time”) meets a credible counter-impulse (preservation), culminating in a renunciation when the membrane “threaten[s] to tear.” Embodied perception and ritualized action reveal a meticulous temperament without exposition. Micro‑choices (seed placement, breath control, withdrawal) show values under pressure. The cost—foregoing full entry now to protect the inheritance—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through the ritual: cold harnessed, seeds align, hum rises, vortex opens, membrane thins. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she withdraws and reseals, reconfiguring the meaning of inheritance with a felt price. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and no causality breaks. The final stowage of the cap ties the action to a new steady state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and cold are not decorative; temperature is the instrument for “decreasing entropy,” and the dome’s cracks and wind inflect tone and constraint. Environmental responses (ice retreating/advancing) track with her tactic. The acorn cap functions as a micro‑setting that charges the closing image over her heart. Sensory specificity is vivid yet purposeful across sight, sound, touch, and scent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open without breaking) tightens as the ritual succeeds and then imperils the membrane. The key turn is her choice to stop and reseal, foreclosing deeper immediate access to “borrowed time.” The price is legible and scales to this length. Tension builds through cadence and image rather than reversals, consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece achieves strong thematic resonance via the ritual reframing inheritance as stewardship and permission, embodied by the seal-and-carry choice. However, the line “inheritance is not property but permission” states the thesis overtly in the final third, slightly flattening subtext. The closing image still reweights the premise with lingering ambiguity and cost. Overall, insight feels earned by specific acts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent psychic distance; perception and diction feel character‑bound and tactically focused. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially around the membrane beat. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Purposeful elision and image logic are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; momentum rarely stalls. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern‑taught, with few if any mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies to match charge. One or two phrases flirt with grandness, but clarity holds through the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Vortex inheritance,” entropy‑coaxing, and seed‑ritual engineering synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling design. The acorn cap as vortex cradle is memorable and thematically integral. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The reconfiguration at the end feels both surprising and earned.</comment>
