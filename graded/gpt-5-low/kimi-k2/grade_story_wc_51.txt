<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—free herself by measuring and transferring burdens—and actions track cleanly to that goal. Embodied emotion is vivid (weights pressing “like wet wool,” ribs calcifying), and micro‑choices (flame angle, breath control, sequencing small→medium→largest) reveal values. Internal contradiction is subtler; guilt drives her but there’s little simultaneous push‑pull beyond endurance vs. release. The earned endurance and partial self‑petrification register as a credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with closure via Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing; the ritual intensifies until the avalanche burden softens and transfers. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the sequence escalates coherently through the ritual steps to a decisive cadence shift when the black sphere hisses and yields. Cost is on the page (“ribs turning first to coral, then to stone”) and persists into the final image (lamp ember, tether redefined). The before/after is unmistakable: trapped → released with a new, gentler tether and a world reweighted to carry human burdens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the bronze grotto traps her, the “shingled hush” forms the loom, and the metal accepts and seals weight, directly shaping tactics. Specifics (oxidized ribs, starlight fissures, blue lamp flame, whalebone reverie) are vivid and point‑of‑view filtered. Environment constrains and then absorbs, charging the ending as the grotto “kept its own slow time.” The lamp-as-micro‑setting further charges the final walk into night.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (win release by balancing burdens) is clear, with a clean tightening: small→medium→largest burden culminating in direct confrontation with the absorbing sphere. Agency drives the turn—she orients, breathes, and applies heat—rather than coincidence. The cost (partial calcification, loss of lamp’s potency) is legible and alters her ongoing state. Tension is mostly ritual‑charged rather than adversarial, but it still narrows options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of redistribution of guilt and the materiality of memory emerges through image, not assertion, and reweights at the close: stone and metal carry what flesh cannot. Motifs (lamp, hush, frost feathers) evolve in meaning and converge in the final cadence. The forgiveness note arrives through the world’s greening rather than moralizing. Complexity persists: she is freed yet tethered to knowledge and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close distance with a distinct perceptual signature (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) holds throughout. Rhythm modulates with pressure (shorter clauses under the largest burden beat), and elision is purposeful and legible. No head‑hopping or register slip; diction matches the mythic‑lyric mode taught early. The voice carries the piece without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet controlled; metaphors cohere to metal, bone, frost, and sea lexicons without muddle. Minimal scaffold or redundancy; each sentence advances image, pressure, or tactic. A few high‑ornament phrases flirt with purple but remain functional and clear at peak beats. The final images land cleanly without figurative drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—fractal weaver, shingled hush as loom, bronze cavern that absorbs burdens, lamp as operative tool and elegiac relic—feels distinct and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and conceit heighten rather than obscure stakes. The avalanche guilt reconfigured through material transference is an original moral calculus. The final hum and counting hush provide a fresh, memorable exit.</comment>
