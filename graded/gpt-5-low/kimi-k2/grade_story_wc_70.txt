<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marisol’s motive—tending wonder through a truth-bound routine—is clear and governs her choices (climbing, striking the match, telling the traveler). Interiority is particular (“involuntarily truthful,” the warmth of the coin) but contradictions are mild and the epiphany leans tidy. Costs exist but are gentle (spent matches, surrendering certainty), keeping the arc credible yet not searing. Overall strong, if more luminous than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: found object → riddle → ascent → match → hum → luminous bees → reweighted stance. Closure reads as resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (the blackout as cocoon; “the song changed key”) with a modest on‑page cost (the emptied matchbox, relinquished expectation). Causality within the magical logic is coherent with no teleports or resets. Stakes remain focused and the final image consolidates the pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower, copper veins, lacquer box, and bees are sensuously realized and used functionally (stairs, rods, sockets, platform). Setting actively charges choice and the final image; the match reveals hidden filaments specific to place. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Marisol’s role. World rules are consistent within the piece’s magic-real frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will the tower “sing” again, and what that means—tightens through the riddle and the match strike, which reweights options. Escalation is primarily experiential and cadence‑driven; the match’s ignition is the decisive intensification. The cost is present but soft, so pressure reads as wonder-leaning rather than risk‑driven. Resolution stems from Marisol’s agency and stance crystallization rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of transformation and the ethics of attention (“listen with wonder”) emerge through objects and choices, not explanation alone. Recurring images (bees, song, coin warmth) reweight meaning at the end. A few explicit formulations (“Wonder, always wonder”; “changed key”) verge on thesis‑statement and slightly blunt subtext. Still, the final glow carries earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“nectar dusk,” copper, hum) remains steady. Dialogue is sparse but functional and subtextual, aligned with her compulsion to truth. Rhythm varies and modulates with the scene’s rise, with no head‑hopping or stance drift. A few repeated constructions skirt purple but do not break control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs and concrete images pull double duty in mood and function. Minor repetition (“wonder” and tonal phrasing) and occasional lushness nudge toward excess but retain clarity and momentum. Syntax varies and paragraphs earn their space; no loops or scaffold dull closure. The final image is clean and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drone‑hive/bioluminescent rebirth conceit feels fresh, and the lacquer‑box riddle is an elegant trigger that pays off. The synthesis of civic infrastructure and living wonder is unusual and coherent. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the match reveals hidden filaments. Bold but not gimmicky, with originality arising from integrated particulars.</comment>
