<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—crossing the labyrinth to confront seven years of unsent letters—drives coherent, escalating micro‑choices (bleeding on the shard, reading aloud, cutting again). Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (ink “tasting” in her mouth, letters turning to lead). Contradictory impulses—fierceness and tenderness, fear and yearning—coexist on the page. The renunciation cost (sacrificing the shard and the bitter protection of silence) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned ritual intensifies to a clear Decisive Change—she writes the apology in blood, the spirits echo it, the shard dissolves, and she chooses to stay. Orientation is clean from the start (Lira, mangrove labyrinth, night). Cost is on-page (blood, loss of talisman, surrender of old identity). Beats build coherently toward the final stance without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth, spirits, and moonlight are not backdrop; they constrain tactics (tide, roots, knot of waterways) and power the ritual mechanics (condensation script, healing, bud opening). The shard as tool-object evolves and charges the final image. World rules (healing under moonlight, condensation text) read consistent through action. Sensory specificity is vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (face the unsent apology) tightens as the song narrows, letters gain weight, and reflections confront her with past/younger selves. The key turn is the blood‑written apology; price is explicit and forecloses the prior path of avoidance. Escalation is coherent and pressure rises; no reliance on coincidence to resolve. One clean deepening is sufficient at this length and delivered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of accountability, presence, and the tender cost of repair emerge through concrete ritual and recurring images (ink → lead → living tissue; breath as shared tide). The finale reweights prior material, but “I choose to stay present” edges into thematic declaration, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the resonance of the shard’s dissolution and communal breath sustains a strong afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical, image‑driven voice is controlled and consistent with Lira’s sensibility; psychic distance modulates cleanly under pressure. Patterned diction (song, condensation, moonlight) is taught early and pays off. Dialogue fragments are sparse, purposeful, and subtextually charged. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line craft is taut and musical; images do multiple jobs without clogging clarity. Figurative density is high but coherent, with minimal redundancy; rhythm varies to match escalation. Minor risk of purple is kept in check by tactile action (blood, bud, steam). Final line lands cleanly on an image despite one overt statement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar motifs (unsent letters, apology) are transformed via distinctive mechanics (condensation script, shard-as-healer/sacrifice, moon-healing ecology). The ritual logic feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Bold accumulative design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth registers as specific rather than generic.</comment>
