<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich, character‑particular interiority (“stunt double to a vanished star,” fear of heights) drives concrete micro‑choices under pressure. Contradictory impulses—terror and resolve—coexist and surface in embodied actions (decrypting, prying the plate, climbing). The twin confrontation reconfigures the self‑story with visible cost. Minor on‑the‑nose lines (“vulnerability was power”) slightly flatten the otherwise nuanced psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: shell → coordinates → reel → revelation → safe → roof key → confrontation → burning contracts. Closure lands on the page with cost (burning evidence, risking career and family mythology) and a decisive stance shift (“not to fall, but to fly on the truth”). Single POV and two shard-like moves within one location retain clarity. A touch of convenient magic (the shell’s guidance, micro‑grooves) leans stylized but holds under the piece’s logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rusted library and its tools actively shape tactics (projector, floor safe, “Roof” key) and constrain access to the final confrontation. Sensory specificity is vivid and purposeful (“moonlight dripping… like molten silver,” gears like rigging) and filtered through the stunt double’s bias. The environment charges the last image by staging the roof choice. Occasional symbolism edges close to declared meaning but stays rooted in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming agency/identity—tightens with each discovery, culminating in the contract burning and refusal to “fall.” The film’s reveal meaningfully escalates pressure, narrowing options and forcing confrontation. Fear of heights injects immediate bodily cost into the roof scene. The resolution is earned through agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of self‑authorship, exploitation, and the power of chosen vulnerability emerge organically from objects and acts (shell, film, cast, fire). The seashell’s silence and the final step toward flight reweight prior images. A few explicit formulations (“vulnerability was power,” “rewrite the script”) skim toward thesis‑saying, slightly dulling subtext. Overall resonance lingers without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice maintains tight psychic distance and modulates with pressure. Dialogue is brief yet stakes‑bearing and subtextual. Elisions (director’s off‑stage handoff, past fire) are purposeful and paid off by on‑page discoveries. Diction stays consistent with the narrator’s sensibility despite heightened imagery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and propulsive, with strong verbs and multi‑tasking sentences that advance plot and atmosphere. A few dense simile clusters flirt with purple (“molten silver,” “tears like broken glass,” “faulty neon”), but clarity and momentum hold. Minimal scaffold and no notable loops. Rhythm varies well across beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—phobia‑ridden stunt double in a rusted nocturnal library decoding a cast to expose a studio‑forged twin—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects are repurposed in surprising, earned ways (shell as oracle, cast as cipher). The betrayal reveal avoids template beats by rooting in tactile problem‑solving. Slight reliance on familiar meta‑film phrases is the only minor drag on uniqueness.</comment>
