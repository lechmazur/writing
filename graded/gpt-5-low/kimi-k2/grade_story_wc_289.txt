<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Arin’s goal (to return the secrets and seek the connecting thread) is clear and drives her key choice to give up the twig; Elian adds immediate pressure. Interiority is particular and image‑led, though the conflict remains gentle with limited on‑page hesitation or contradiction. The cost—relinquishing the burden and identity of kept vows—is legible and earned. Dialogue reveals status and need without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: arrival → chance meeting → the “gifted” requirement → offering the twig → release of letters → entry into the temple. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she surrenders the twig and the temple absorbs the words, altering what connection means with a felt cost. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The “gifted component” constraint motivates the decisive act on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lotus temple, mirrored petals, and rain are vividly rendered and integral to action: the site’s rules (monks, public art, gifted heartwood) channel choices. Environment charges the ending image as the pond “drinks” words and filaments rise to show connection. Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered. Weather/time materially affects outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when Elian’s sculpture demands a gifted sliver, forcing Arin to surrender her talisman. The escalation is inward but concrete, culminating in a visible price and a new stasis. Pressure coheres; no antagonist needed. The conflict is elegant rather than harrowing, but the trade‑off is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, transparency, and communal connection emerge through events and images (steam‑letters, mirrored petals, glowing filaments) without moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: personal vows become shared tissue with cost and relief. Subtext in “relief of subtraction” and “made transparent” resonates beyond plot. No thesis is stated; meaning accrues organically.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization around Arin; diction and rhythm feel intentional and modulate well. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and subtextual. The patterned elision (“prismatic hush”) is taught early and paid off. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density and musicality with mostly coherent figures; images work in concert (letters as steam, petals as mirrors). Occasional phrasing verges on purple or slips (“clouds still full of forest than rain” reads like an error), slightly dulling clarity. Momentum stays intact with few redundancies. Line‑level craft remains strong despite the lushness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise and imagery (love‑ghostwriter, gifted heartwood, steam‑letters rejoining originals) feel singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric texture and conceptual worldbuilding pay off without obscuring closure. The public art constraint grounds the metaphysics. Fresh synthesis elevates familiar themes of love and memory.</comment>
