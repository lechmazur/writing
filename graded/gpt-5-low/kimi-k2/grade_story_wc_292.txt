<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lila’s motive—honoring Morag’s erased bravery—drives concrete choices, and her “nervously confident” temperament is dramatized in tactile actions (aligning the nail, speaking stanzas, pressing the mirror). The exchange question creates genuine internal friction between rescue fantasy and substitution cost. Embodied details (salt‑sweating walls, warm copper) keep emotions specific. Minor hedge: her acceptance cost is a touch conceptual versus fully felt in body at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: stanzas trigger phenomena → hatch → mirror/offer → choice → reconfigured jet stream and vow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lila remains to hold the vow while Morag returns, with the nail pinned as a charged token. However, the final sentence is truncated, and the “one adrift” price is a bit ambiguous, softening the cost’s on‑page clarity. Orientation is solid from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The weather station isn’t backdrop; instruments react to stanzas, the hatch sits under the anemometer, and the barographs’ agitation pressures the decision. The copper nail and brass meridian ring function as micro‑setting tools that constrain moves. Sensory atmosphere (salt, ozone, kelp, wet iron) is selective and purposeful. Strong environmental causality charges the final images (nail pinned; new charts singing).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: can exile be reversed without unacceptable cost. Escalation coheres—each stanza intensifies pressure, culminating in the mirror’s exchange question that narrows options to a sacrifice. The cost is present (Lila’s foreclosed rescue of herself; taking on sea‑etched age/role), though the “who goes adrift” mechanic remains slightly soft. Agency drives the turns rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—lineage of bravery versus the myth of permanent boundaries—emerges through objects and acts (nail, atlases, stanzas), not exposition. The final vow reframes maps and weather as moral reading, offering a conceptual repricing of exile. The story resists neat moralizing, acknowledging substitution’s cost. A few lines (“exile…reversed by those willing…”) edge toward overt statement but are earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with maritime‑scientific diction stays coherent to Lila’s perception. Repetition motifs (“nervously confident,” stanzas) feel patterned rather than mechanical. Quoted stanzas carry subtext and action rather than decorative mystery. Minor blemish: the abrupt unfinished final sentence jars the otherwise tight modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and efficient; many sentences do double duty for image and causality. Figurative language is fresh and mostly coherent to the world (“Salt remembers the shape of ankles”). There’s a clean propulsion across beats, but the incomplete last sentence and one or two near‑echoes slightly dent cadence and finish. Proofreading slip at the very end notably dulls the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of meteorology, cartography, and revenant exchange feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The copper nail as talismanic interface is an original, specific choice; the mirror‑exchange reframes weather maps as dialogue with the dead. Risks (lyric science‑myth fusion) pay off without obscuring clarity. Only the closing fragment keeps this from higher.</comment>
