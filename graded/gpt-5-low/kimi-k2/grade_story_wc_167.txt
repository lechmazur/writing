<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s motive is clear and particular—redeeming flawed glass by refracting “reckonings” into everyday epiphanies—and her final choice (leaving her treasured panes) carries a real, character‑specific cost. Interiority is embodied via tide‑pool readings and occupational detail. The internal contradiction (treasuring the panes vs. relinquishing them) is present but could tighten under greater pressure. No relationship crucible appears, which limits micro‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds pattern and cadence toward a charged choice, then lands an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing as she installs and leaves the panes. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the timing tether (noctilucent clouds/“before everything shifted”) coheres through closure. Cost is legible on‑page: she sacrifices her flawed panes and accepts that the city will “forget the language of small flaws.” The closure image reweights the premise without mechanical wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn, mist, kelp, wet iron, and the prism atrium are richly tactile and filtered through a glazier’s eye. Environment and object constrain choice (the atrium appears only with the noctilucent clouds), and the final image is charged by setting (rainbow ghosts across waves). Spatial and sensory choreography remain coherent and purposeful. Minor cap applied due to final‑third artifact elsewhere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates quietly but credibly: the clouds arrive, the panes ignite with meaning, and the tide‑pool communion forces a decision about leaving the panes. The dominant stake—proving value in the mundane—tightens into a concrete sacrifice under a live clock. The cost is felt but understated; an additional on‑page obstacle could have sharpened the turn. Still, the single meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—flaws as sacred and value in the mundane—is organically earned through refracted imagery and the tide‑pool method, not lecture. The closing images (rainbow ghosts, stained‑glass prayers) extend meaning without explicit moralizing, though “teaching anyone who bothered to look” edges close to telling. Subtext operates in the choice to relinquish cherished objects to seed others’ memory. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in a glazier’s craft; diction and rhythm are consistent. POV distance is stable and confident; no head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience. Patterned elision (ritual method, accumulative imagery) is taught early and paid off. A slight over‑ornate tilt appears at moments but remains coherent with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong—high information density, concrete verbs, and multi‑tasking images—yet the prose occasionally skews purple. A visible artifact mars the final line (“…a reflective glazier whose quiet” truncates), dulling the last beat’s click. Figurative layering is mostly clean, but a touch of redundancy in thematic phrasing creeps in. Rhythm otherwise breathes with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—glazier, flawed panes, noctilucent clouds, prism atrium, tide‑pool divination—feels fresh and inevitable once seen. The reframing of imperfections into constellations/birds/planets is imaginative without gimmickry. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes and coherence. Only the slight didactic seam and the line artifact prevent a higher tier.</comment>
