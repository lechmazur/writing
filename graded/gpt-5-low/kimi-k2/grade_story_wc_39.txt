<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—he comes “to sweeten the silence” and translate between generations—and his choices (capturing, sealing, then releasing sounds) align. Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual, the sob he denies, and the father memory threaded via the dawn whistle. Internal contradiction is subtle (a hoarder of sound who ultimately releases it), yielding a credible endurance/renunciation. The cost is felt in letting the jars go and the music box “unwinding like a life.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: ritual action layers until the cadence breaks when the ballerina moves and the chorus sentence forms. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established quickly) and the closure lands on the page with conceptual cost. The final image—chorus traveling on dunes, footprints erased—reconfigures the premise with an earned, quiet inevitability. No causality breaks; each step grows from prior moves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The feral loft, dunes, louvers, and jars are sensorially vivid and functionally integrated; the environment pressures choices (wind, louvers channeling sound) and carries the final chorus outward. Objects-as-setting (jars, music box) charge the last image. Weather and time inflect action rather than decorate it. Specificity remains character-filtered, never touristy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence across generations—tightens through the ritual’s progression and the decisive release. The key deepening is the ballerina’s turn and the sentence the chorus forms, which reweights what he’s doing from private solace to communal bequeathal. Cost is internal and conceptual, not adversarial, yet it’s legible in renunciation and the spring “unwinding like a life.” Pressure is coherent for a lyric piece, though not combative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory, inheritance, and art as translation arise organically from actions and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. The dunes dispersing the chorus reframes presence/absence without moralizing. One line states aim overtly (“to become the translator…”), but the ending earns its ache without thesis. The father-war memory threads in to deepen stakes rather than summarize them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is singular, controlled, and lyrically confident with a stable close third distance; diction and rhythm match the poet’s sensibility. Perceptual signature is strong (auditory bias, tactile ritual) and modulation under pressure is deft. No head-hopping or stance leakage; purposeful elision reads intentional and paid off. The whispered “Stay” is a precise, in-character inflection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is richly musical with high information density; images carry multiple jobs. Metaphor remains coherent (sound as light, breath, animal), and syntax varies to manage momentum. A few lush lines flirt with purple but do not stall or blur sense. The final cadence is clean and earned without loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in jars to translate generations via a feral loft and a blistered music box feels strikingly fresh and integrated. Risks in premise and diction heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The ballerina’s late “turn” is a surprising yet prepared reweighting. Emotional truth undergirds the novelty, avoiding mere cleverness.</comment>
