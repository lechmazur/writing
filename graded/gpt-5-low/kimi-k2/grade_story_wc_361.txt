<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s conflicting impulses—professional anonymity versus a dawning desire to seed wonder—are concrete and embodied (the thumb on the pendant, the knees clicking). Her final choice to relinquish courier identity by gifting the pendant reads earned by prior beats. Secondary figures apply soft but relevant pressure that reveals her values. The cost—letting go of Rell’s approval and the defined role—is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: encounters stack under the aurora until the hooded figure reframes the mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Mira refuses the hand‑off and repurposes the pendant. Cost is on‑page (identity trade, mentor’s absence accepted). Orientation is clear early, and the single meaningful tightening at the cliff aligns with the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway, tollgate, cliff, and fire are vivid and filtered through Mira’s priorities; the environment/time (pre‑dawn) quietly constrains her options. The pendant functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image. World rules (hum/germination) are learned by observation. Atmosphere coheres with theme without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deliver before dawn vs. succumbing to the pendant’s social pull—is signaled and tightened at the cliff reveal. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the accumulative lens; the reveal that Rell crossed into myth reweights the mission. The price is primarily identity/time rather than physical peril, which keeps tension quiet but credible. The ending choice forecloses the courier path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—coaxing wonder from routine, memory shifting into myth—emerges organically through repeated, reweighted images (the pendant’s hum; dragonfly breath). The final act reframes “delivery” into “invitation,” offering a non‑literal answer without moralizing. The mentor’s dissolution into collective wonder resists neatness while feeling inevitable. Subtext hums in pauses and shared breath rather than declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely tracks Mira’s sensibility; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure but remain consistent. Indirect dialogue and image-led narration preserve POV integrity without head‑hopping. The perceptual signature—world parsed through courier craft and the pendant’s hum—feels distinct. No gratuitous elision or explanatory intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: images carry double duty and momentum rarely stalls despite lushness. Figurative density stays coherent to the dragonfly/aurora motif with minimal purple drift. Sentence rhythms vary and conclude on charged images. Minor repeats (“wonder,” “hum”) serve pattern rather than padding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courier-myth frame is refreshed by the sympathetic vibration conceit and the accumulative confessionals under the aurora. The turn from delivery to dissemination feels both surprising and prepared. Specific images (dragonfly breath over the fire; tollgate bell tolling once) mark a singular vision. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
