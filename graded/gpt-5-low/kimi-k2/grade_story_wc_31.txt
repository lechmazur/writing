<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Miren’s motive is clear and particular—fulfilling a luminous vow tied to her drowned mother—and her choices (descending at lowest tide, testing books, playing wires, breaking the case, releasing the key) enact that drive. The contradiction between “hiding behind truth” and the vow resolves credibly when she decides to tell the town. Interiority is embodied via synesthetic perception rather than labels. The only slight limitation is that resistance is mostly atmospheric, not interpersonal or logistical.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from lamp tones to sunken library to “Last Hymn,” with the sky lanterns as a soft clock. Orientation (who/where/when) is established immediately and never wavers. Closure lands on the page: the unnamed color is found, the vow completes, and Miren relinquishes the key with felt cost. The throughline holds cleanly without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional: low tide exposes the dome, water and glass shape movement and sound, and bioluminescence charges the final image. Details are selective and POV‑filtered (e.g., notes painting air, jellyfish through stained glass). The recurring object (key tag) and the environment directly constrain choices. World rules feel consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible (“discover the color of sound before the last lantern burned out”), with one meaningful escalatory turn at the phonograph. The time pressure and the tide create a coherent narrowing without overt antagonist. The cost—releasing the key, ending the quest’s refuge—reads on the page. Pressure is more elegiac than sharp, but it still tightens in step with the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of grief, memory, and the synesthetic persistence of the drowned arise from action, not assertion. The mother’s voice as color reweights prior motifs and offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the core question. The vow’s completion and the decision to speak to the town deepen beyond personal closure into communal reckoning. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unnamed hue.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice saturates perception with color‑sound correspondences and stays consistent. Elision is purposeful and paid off in the closure image. No head‑hopping or register drift; the rhythm modulates well from hush to bloom. Dialogue is absent but not needed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet disciplined; images do double duty (sound-color also carrying grief). Varied sentence rhythm supports momentum, and there’s little scaffolding or repetition. A high density of figurative language skirts purple but remains coherent and legible. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lamplighter, synesthetic vow, sunken library, phonograph “Last Hymn”—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects and the tide‑clock integrate originality with function. Risk‑taking in image and premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration (the drowned sing in every wave) is both surprising and thematically integral.</comment>
