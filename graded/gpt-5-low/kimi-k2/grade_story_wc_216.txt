<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation and embodied interiority (textures felt by skin) drive tactile micro-choices. The protagonist’s agency—paper airplane, stair ascent, fusing shard and gear, waiting—reveals values under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle (yearning vs. surrender to non-counting time) but present. Emotional cost lands in the “exquisite ache” and the quiet renunciation of numbered time.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held; density and patterning escalate toward a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean: who/where/aim established in the opening. Closure lands when she accepts a skin-read compass and meets “the woman who remembers tomorrow,” a reconfiguration with felt cost. Setups (airplane, shard) pay off without convenience or contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vivid, sensorial, and integral: bullet holes, swallows-to-equations mural, spiral decades, seed storage. Environment shapes choices (stair ascent, hatch discovery, wall-touch finale) and charges the closing image (vibrating swallows under paint). Objects-as-setting (globe, gear, timer) are discovered through action. Tone and world rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the capsule/message of time’s texture—is clear and deepens via the airplane’s return and the fused compass. Escalation fits the lens: increasing sensory-texture pressure and the unexpected buyer summons narrow options toward a meeting. The cost is primarily emotional and existential rather than tactical, but it’s felt and reweights the future. No luck-based resolution; her tactics trigger the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—time as felt texture, inheritance of waiting, and choosing how to spend belief—emerges organically through objects and action. The textures sequence (“silk… gravel… honey…”) reframes grief and agency without moralizing. Final image (palms on the wall; swallows stirring) offers a non-literal answer to how to live after numbers fail. Resonance lingers with complexity, not a tidy lesson.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction and imagery feel character-bound and purposeful. Brief dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances plot (“woman who remembers tomorrow”). Rhythm modulates with pressure without head-hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision teaches its pattern and pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; images do more than one job (mural retouched into falling equations). Figurative language is lush but coherent and legible; minimal scaffold or loops. Syntax varies to sustain propulsion; line-level clarity is strong through closure. A few ornate lines approach saturation but do not blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—garage-sale spycraft, an emerald silo, a timeless shard that pauses a pulse, textures as cartography—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric accumulation, minimal overt antagonism) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established particulars (airplane message, fused compass). Emotional truth undergirds the novelty.</comment>
