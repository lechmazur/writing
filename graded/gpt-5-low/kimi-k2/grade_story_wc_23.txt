<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Grief-driven motive is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (placing glass where heat peaks, bleeding onto the bronze) embody that desire under pressure. Internal contradiction (resistance vs. compliance) is present but light, largely resolved early. The sibling relationship functions as crucible through the echo beside her and the final exchange of the bronze. A meaningful change lands at the end with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the midnight calls and lunar pulses build a coherent pattern that culminates in a clear on‑page crossing with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (navigator at the signal station post-failure), and set-ups (dish, censer foot, calls) pay off. Closure is a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration as she crosses and receives the bronze “cool, steady.” No causal breaks; the constraint of moon‑linked heat shapes tactics to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The signal station, frozen dish, and river are sensorially specific and functionally constraining; the dish becomes the work surface and path. The censer foot as micro‑setting/tool charges the final image and directs movement via heat. World rules (lunar fluctuation guiding action) are learned through use, not exposition. Atmosphere and environment directly shape choices at every turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reaching the lost brother) is clear and pressure coheres as pattern intensifies: “Build the cradle that rocks backward” is a decisive tightening. Costs are tangible (wire cuts, searing bronze, leaving the station) and force commitment at “Cross.” Escalation is protagonist-driven, not coincidental. The luminous path and rim pause sharpen the peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief as navigation and memory as reverse migration arises organically from action and image rather than thesis. Recurring motifs (moon phase pulses, censer foot) reweight at the end, shifting from pain to “cool, steady” solace. The piece resists tidy moralizing and invites reflection on what returning means (echo vs. body). Subtext hums in the instructions’ riddles without overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely held to the navigator sustains texture without drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and the phone-voice lines are spare and propulsive. No head‑hopping or stance slips; elision patterns are taught and paid off. Diction is precise and character-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images do more than one job and momentum holds. Figurative language is frequent but disciplined, with no muddled metaphors in peak beats. Syntax varies and the final line resolves musically. Minor risk of purple is kept in check by concrete action and cost.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—decommissioned dish as altar/instrument, censer foot as lunar metronome, reverse migration as memory’s river—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The ritual build and cryptic calls refresh familiar grief tropes through specific, embodied tactics. The crossing scene is a bold, earned image rather than a gimmick. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
