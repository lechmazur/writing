<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—reframing her sister’s disappearance by “measuring the curvature of sorrow”—is specific, embodied, and sustained through micro‑choices (placing the eyes, whispering primes, following the spiral path). Contradictory impulses (fear of seeing, buried optimism) play in scene and culminate in a credible renunciation: leaving the eyes and moving on. The cost is legible: she sacrifices a talisman and forecloses the fantasy of retrieval. Interiority stays concrete and character‑particular without therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions, image sequences, and small responses (the stalactite drop, the sap, the fern) accrete toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on page with cost—“I’ll keep the parentheses open” and stepping into the tunnel, after leaving the eyes. Orientation is clear early (cavern orchard at night; single POV; one scene), and the core stake tightens via the orchard’s response. Hairline: the clipped final “Behind” is an artifact but prior beat achieves closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and tactically active: stalactite drip as “decimal point,” mosaic chips as method, calcified peach receiving the eyes, and the spiral path governing movement. World rules are learned through use, not exposition, and the environment charges the final image (fern against “stone’s gray algebra,” eyes left to watch). Sensory detail feels purposeful across sight, touch, taste (“salt drifting,” “iron”). Minor cap applied due to line‑level artifact in the final third.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to live with ambiguous loss) is signaled and deepens through a single decisive intensification: ritual evokes a response, prompting the choice to leave the eyes and proceed. Agency guides escalation: Lira’s tactics shift from measuring to balancing, foreclosing the retrieval‑fantasy path. The felt price (relinquishing the object and the backward gaze) charges the ending. Quiet but coherent pressure fits the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars—eyes as lenses of grief, parentheses imagery, geologic patience—rather than sermon. The repricing is clear: from solving to keeping balance, from wall to corridor; the orchard’s tiny fern embodies earned hope without sentimentality. One explicit phrase (“Ambiguous loss, the scholars called it”) edges toward label, but the final image resists tidy moralizing. Resonance lingers in the open‑parentheses vow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically controlled and coherent with Lira’s sensibility; metaphor system (math, geology, taxidermy) is consistent. Psychic distance holds steady, and the prose modulates rhythm to match pressure. Dialogue is minimal and effective as ritual utterance, not exposition. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong—dense but purposeful figurative language, varied syntax, and high information density. However, the final stray fragment (“Behind”) introduces an artifact in the closing beat, dulling the polish of the cadence. A few stacked metaphors verge on lush, though clarity largely holds. This artifact disallows 9+ across categories.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—cavern orchard, taxidermy eyes, math of emotion, stalactite decimal—feels singular and necessary rather than ornamental. The fern’s emergence as repriced answer is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in imagery and method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor direct label (“ambiguous loss”) slightly tempers the novelty.</comment>
