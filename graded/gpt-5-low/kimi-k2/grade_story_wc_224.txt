<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and intensifies—from fleeing pain to embracing the cost of remembrance to rebuild “home.” Interiority is embodied (mercury tears, iron‑tasting air) and the actions align (placing the stone, speaking the word). Contradictory impulses—urge to forget vs. duty to speak—coexist credibly. Minor safety: she succeeds without much on‑page struggle once the tree is found.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual actions (stone → feather → ink → maps → tree → word) deepen pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration where the mountain becomes home. Cost is legible (each old‑tongue word resurrects the forgotten; remembering hurts), and the decisive act (“She spoke the first word…”) lands. A textual flaw—truncated final line—blunts the cadence of closure even though the core transformation precedes it. Causality remains coherent within the lyric pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore is vivid and integral: corridors constrain movement; the reading room, ink‑stalactites, and the tree all shape tactics and the final image. Objects are handled, not just seen; maps on her skin guide her in real time. The setting charges the ending as the labyrinth reconfigures into childhood home. Minor repetition keeps it just shy of transcendent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming a living home/identity—tightens as she descends, accepts the feather’s memory‑cost, and finally speaks the world‑shaping word. The meaningful turn is the decision to stop “decorative” seeing and use the tongue despite its price. Stakes stay personal but consequential; pressure grows coherently. Slight ease in the final stretch (few obstacles once the core is reached) trims peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: language as home, memory as architecture, inheritance as burden and gift. Recurring images (feather, ink, heartbeat/mountain pulse) evolve and reweight meaning at the end. One explicit thesis line (“home wasn’t a place but a language”) leans didactic; the images already carry it. The emotional afterglow is earned and reflective rather than sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, lush, and controlled, with a stable close third limited to the seer’s perceptions. Rhythm modulates well, and diction matches the mythic frame. Two textual slips—“substitutes reality nightly” (awkward/repeated) and the cut‑off last sentence—disrupt polish. Otherwise, focalization is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High image density mostly serves momentum; many lines do double duty. However, minor redundancy and a few purple edges appear, plus the fragment “reflected not substitutes reality nightly” and the truncated final sentence harm finish. A touch of synonym/phrase looping around remembering/forgetting slightly dulls propulsion. Craft is strong but not immaculate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—mercury‑glass body, language‑stone, ink‑stalactites, a library‑mountain built from ancestral bones—feels fresh and committed. The feather‑as‑conduit and maps on skin are inventive and thematically apt. Risks are taken without gimmickry, and the turn to language as literal architecture lands. Minor line‑level slips prevent topmost tier.</comment>
