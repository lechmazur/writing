<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motivation (rejecting false comfort, choosing conceived revival) drives concrete micro‑choices: speaking the blueprint, setting down the bottle, and leaving. Interiority is sensorial and particular (star‑anise, rotting pilings), though internal contradiction is mild and rarely contested on the page. The renunciation carries cost but faces little active resistance, slightly softening pressure. Still, actions align tightly with traits and yield an earned stance shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: last wish → conceptual pivot → blueprint spoken → ritual renunciation → departure with a lantern rising. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he rejects magical ease in favor of conceived labor, with felt cost in leaving props and wishes behind. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; causality is coherent through motif recurrence. Cost is subtle rather than stark, but it’s legible and charged in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered (salt wind, bleached signs read through “working memory,” stage under moonlight). Environment and the charged object shape the closure: the theater stage becomes the locus of civic invocation and the lantern rises from it. The cove “listens,” evolving from backdrop into participant, reweighting the final moment. Detail economy stays purposeful, avoiding tourist catalog breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to pursue wish‑based revival or conceive a labor‑based covenant—is signaled early and tightens when he speaks the blueprint and sets down the bottle. The escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, consistent with the chosen lens. Cost is the renunciation of ease and the solitude of departure; absence of an opposing force limits visceral tension. The closing image confirms a reweighted future without undercutting the earned price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres: true revival demands work, memory, and communal structures over miracles; the bottle reweights as “the color of memory” rather than elixir. Subtext plays through lanterns, the stage, and civic rituals (listening circles, grief lanterns) rather than plot summary. A few on‑the‑nose lines (“comfort offered without wound or work…,” “He did not promise ease; he promised engagement”) reduce mystery. Overall resonance is strong and the final image re‑answers the premise without sermonizing the last beat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a stable distance; diction and rhythm are confident and modulate with pressure (from hush to incantatory blueprinting). Perceptual signature is distinct—an alchemist’s sensibility measuring hope, scenting star‑anise, weighing memory on “brass scales.” Purposeful elision and patterned syntax are legible and paid off at closure. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, motion) without sludge. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“books grew on trees,” “alphabet‑shaped rice”), with minimal overlap or mixed vehicles. One or two declarative thematic lines flirt with abstraction but do not stall momentum. Cadence varies well from hush to ceremonial.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Conceptual ingenuity is striking: aqueducts of stories, markets trading silences, libraries that leaf into parchment. The bottle’s redefinition and the cove’s “listening” synthesize world, theme, and action into a non‑obvious, inevitable close. Risks in lyric civic design pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
