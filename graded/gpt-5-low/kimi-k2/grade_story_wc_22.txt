<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied—he sows to heal a poisoned battlefield and rebind land/sea, using his mother’s seeds and ash. Interiority is conveyed through actions and languages rather than exposition, which fits the lyric frame. Internal contradiction is light (grief versus hope) but present in the “hearhe-coach” driver who now plants instead of ferrying soldiers. The final choice—using the last pod at the jetty—reads earned and carries a visible cost (the last chance).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: patterned sowing/chanting intensifies toward the heron’s circle and the last seed at the tide line. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration as the battlefield blooms and the tide carries “forgotten songs.” Cost is legible in the use of the final pod and the relinquishment of grief’s stasis. Orientation is crisp from the first line; no lens slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: jetty/reef/battlefield details are filtered through his vocational and grief‑charged perception. Environment constrains choice—the final planting at the jetty’s edge requires tidal reach to “bind the submerged concord.” Sensory textures (warm planks, slack tide, ash thumbprints) are economical and charged. Consistent world rules learned through observation rather than dumping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore life and concord—tightens through the heron’s sign and the last‑pod decision at the liminal tide line. Escalation is modest but coherent: birds inform tactics; the circle concentrates effort; the final seed forecloses retries. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, but it reads on the page via “the last” and the mother’s ash. Absence of overt antagonist is offset by persistent environmental pressure (poisoned soil, dead reef).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of grief, memory, and restitution emerge through tangible acts (planting, languages, ash) rather than statement. The “submerged concord” motif is reweighted at the end when tide and flowers reciprocally “remember,” offering a non‑literal answer to the central question. The heron and gulls function as subtextual interlocutors, not symbols shouting. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature—dead languages braided with bird‑speech and botanical tactility. Diction is controlled, lyrical without drift; distance stays stable. Compression is taught early and sustained; no head‑hopping. The rhythmic modulation toward the closing cadence feels earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean, varied syntax; figurative language is precise and tethered to action. Minimal redundancy; images do multiple jobs (“tiny coffin” pods). One or two familiar phrases (“color of dried blood”) but they don’t dull the closure image. Final lines carry momentum without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—coachman/hearse driver who speaks to birds and dead tongues to re‑seed a battlefield at a dead reef’s edge—is striking and coherent. The heron’s drawn circle and the tide‑bound last seed are fresh turns that feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mythos, multilingual murmurs) heighten stakes without muddying clarity. The vision reads singular rather than stitched.</comment>
