<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lila’s motives and methods are precise and embodied: the bell, the hundred-step cadence, the careful packets and notes reveal a leader whose gentleness is tactical. Her exchange with Tomasz shows values under pressure and a credible refusal to despair. Interiority is implied through sensory bias and choice rather than spelled out. The endurance stance at the end reads earned with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of quiet runs reweights when the star-marked seed crate appears, leading to a communal gathering and declarative reframing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (“tomorrow is already planted”), with the bell as ritual instrument. The incomplete final sentence slightly blurs the cadence, but the closure effect precedes it and is legible. Orientation is clean early with who/where/when established.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ridge, terra-cotta arbor, cracked tiles, wet clay, and moonlight create a tactile geography that the characters navigate to act. The arbor and bell function as charged micro-settings/tools that constrain behavior (drop point, signals, gathering locus). Sanctions shape what appears in the place, keeping world rules consistent. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, with the environment glazing the final circle image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sustaining a people’s continuity under sanctions—tightens when the anonymous aid shifts from food to seeds, forcing a stance about future over mere survival. Lila’s agency escalates from discrete deliveries to communal declaration and convening, a meaningful turn. Costs (risk, scarcity, moral weight of leadership) remain present. Pressure is coherent and grows without needing an explicit antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of identity as enacted nourishment (recipes as votes, trust as cargo) accumulates through concrete acts, not abstraction. The bell and seeds reconfigure charity into lineage and curriculum, culminating in the future-facing declaration. A few lines verge on explicitness (“to declare that we are still a people”), but they’re earned and supported by image chains. The final communal image resonates beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (sound-as-quiet, clay, moon, bread). Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual; Tomasz’s question pressures Lila’s stance. POV distance is steady and plausibly informed; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with action, especially around the bell’s signals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and efficient, with metaphors that cohere to sound, clay, and bread motifs. Sentences carry multiple jobs and avoid scaffolding; cadence supports the accumulative design. Minor deduction for the truncated final sentence, which nicks the landing’s polish. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of “amplified quiet” logistics, smuggled bell ritual, and seeds-as-future gives familiar exile material a fresh, memorable angle. The trust economy reframed as the heaviest cargo is an incisive turn. Risks are taken in tone and restraint without obscuring clarity. The final reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
