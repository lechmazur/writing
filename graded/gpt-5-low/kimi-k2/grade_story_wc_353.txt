<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (“to restore what was lost”) drives each micro‑choice, and embodied perception (“throat aches with borrowed sorrow”) grounds emotion. The sculptor’s tactics evolve credibly from listening to entering the fracture to exhaling. Internal contradiction is subtle (quiet reverence vs. the bold act of sounding), not overt, which slightly limits depth. The felt cost appears in her body and in the widened cracks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held through closure as sounds accrue toward birdsong. The decisive reconfiguration lands on the page when siskins begin to sing, reweighting the world from mute to tentative sound. Cost is legible: her throat, the insulator’s widened cracks, and the grove’s stored grief exhaled. One clean tightening arrives when she identifies the spiral/moment of muting and chooses to “enter the fracture.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grove is vividly specific and functionally constraining (ear‑bark, lichen, rubbed branches yielding pitches). The porcelain insulator functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered through a musical lexicon. Environmental rules stay consistent and shape choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and escalates: mapping chords lacks a heart until she commits to the spiral, deepening pressure. The “entering the fracture” turn narrows options and demands a price. Resolution flows from her agency (exhaling, matching pitches) rather than coincidence. Quiet tension operates at beat and sentence levels without false intensifiers.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—restoration through listening and embodied empathy—emerges through action and images (hedgehog’s trust, trees’ tension release). The final image reweights prior material with a non‑literal answer: teach silence to breathe. A slightly explicit line (“not by breaking the silence but by teaching it how to breathe again”) edges toward thematic statement, trimming the score. Ambiguity remains: the work is “only beginning,” resisting tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a musical perceptual signature remains stable and apt. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, tightening at key beats. No head‑hopping or stance drift; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. The voice’s confidence matches what the focalizer can plausibly infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet clean, with vivid images doing multiple jobs (“ear‑bark,” “spiral” cracks). Figurative language is coherent and pattern‑taught; cadence breathes with the scene. Minimal redundancy and no notable scaffold loops. A few lush stretches risk saturation but do not blur causality or the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—tree‑song sculptor, telegraph insulator, listening to lichen and scars—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established motifs (telegraph history, spiral cracks) rather than late rule changes. The emotional truth of coaxing song by gentleness avoids trendiness or cliché.</comment>
