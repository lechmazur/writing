<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and idiosyncratic—“restore lost laughter”—and her micro‑choices (throttle modulation, kneeling to “listen,” restarting for a second movement) reveal character under pressure. The mournfully eager contradiction animates her conductorship without sentimentality. Internal sensation (“pressure behind her eyes”) grounds emotion. A slightly declarative insight line reduces ambiguity but doesn’t undercut earned action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: sound density builds (cough → roar → movements) to a resonant reconfiguration where the house itself laughs. Closure lands with cost: fuel spent, grief macerated, and a tangible cadence shift as appliances hum in key and guests laugh in sleep. Orientation is clean from the hour/time anchor to the tunnel and kitchen. The visible truncation of the last sentence is a copy slip but the closure has already arrived.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel and the blower function as micro‑setting constraints that shape tactics and outcomes; acoustics become the haunting engine and the “last, perfect note” delivers payoff. Sensory detail is specific (brick throat, pale quivering notes, tick of cooling engine) and filtered through Elara’s bias. The kitchen reprise (fridge hum, spoon clink) extends setting into resolution. World rules (magical acoustics) stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through deliberate intensifications (three pulls, first movement, the lullaby fold, idle hush, second movement). The tightening choice—letting the house “laugh at its own sorrow” before resuming—recasts tactics and narrows options. Costs are emotional and material (fuel depletion, relinquishing control to the house’s voice). Stakes stay coherent without requiring an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grief-to-laughter transmutation is dramatized through sound and motion rather than abstract telling, culminating in a reweighted domestic soundscape and dawn image. Subtext in the house learning to laugh at itself is strong, though the explicit thesis sentence slightly overstates the moral. Motifs (hourglass, wind, off‑key lullaby) shift meaning by the end. The final single leaf’s spin offers a quiet, resonant after‑image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—mechanics of sound and tool interwoven with grief—without head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure (staccato bursts vs. hush). The lone whispered line lands with echoing subtext rather than exposition. A minor copy truncation at the very end is a blemish, not a voice failure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled, often doing multiple jobs at once; images are coherent (sound as architecture, grief as dust/confetti). A few repeated vehicles (“macerate”) are purposeful but verge on insistence. The clipped final line (“She left the”) is a proofing artifact at the closure edge, dampening the finish. Otherwise momentum is clean with minimal scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—a leaf blower as symphonic conduit for a house’s grief—is fresh and rigorously followed through with specific mechanics (off‑key wind, acoustical tunnel). Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the sonic ritual logic. The domestic haunting reframes familiar grief tropes without gimmickry. Risk‑taking in object‑as‑orchestra pays off.</comment>
