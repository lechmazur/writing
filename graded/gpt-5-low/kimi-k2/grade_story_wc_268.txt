<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thimble’s motive—restore truth and unmask the pretender—is clear and consistent, and his key choice (to deploy the rune) aligns with it. Interiority is specific (amber eyes, calloused feet; long study of cryptic margins), though largely composed and competent with little in-scene contradiction or doubt. Emotional cost is present but muted (a “small, sad” smile; innocence lost). Strong, but a touch frictionless in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The sequence is coherent—clues → confrontation with the mark → activation of the rune → systemic correction—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early, and the ending’s before/after is legible. The price is more elegiac than harrowing, but it’s on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is vividly realized and consistently filtered through Thimble’s scholar-warrior lens; objects and spaces (spiral steps by century, cracked dome) charge the action. The setting supports the method of betrayal and exposure (marginalia, indexes, footnotes). It shapes access and final image rather than tightly constraining tactics. Lush yet purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates when the pellet warms and the rune begins to “pull at the edges of things.” The revelation spreads with consequence, but opposition never pushes back; the resolution feels assured once the rune engages. The tightening is meaningful but low-friction. Effective, not harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Truth versus authored history emerges through concrete particulars (heron smudge, tear-stained period) and culminates in the library self-correcting. The “graceful collapse” reframes victory as both justice and loss, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights the premise with quiet cost. Subtext is carried by image rather than thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person closely tracks Thimble’s perceptual signature (scholarly, tactile, cosmically scaled). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent without head-hopping. Ornate phrasing edges toward luxuriant but remains legible under pressure. No dialogue needed or missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with strong image economy and minimal scaffolding. A few stacked metaphors and elevated diction risk density creep, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Repetition serves pattern (cosmic motifs) more than padding. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—marginalia as weaponized history, a rune that edits reality’s footnotes, and a diminutive titan-librarian—is fresh and cohesive. Turns feel earned by seeded particulars. The risk is aesthetic rather than structural and pays off in tone and concept. Distinct without gimmickry.</comment>
