<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority (“somatic markers,” metallic taste, lungs freezing) grounds a credible need for stillness and guides micro‑choices (breathing, pressing the photo to bark, writing “Still possible,” leaving the photo). Contradictory impulses (witnessing grief vs. seeking calm) coexist rather than alternate, culminating in an earned renunciation that carries cost. One minor risk is the clinical term “somatic markers,” but it’s integrated through sensory detail rather than therapy‑speak summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: detail density builds to the olive‑tree contact and the photograph’s reconfiguration, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (“warning to witness”). Orientation is clean from the outset, and the closure’s cost—keeping grief without denial—is on the page. The choice to plant the photo and plan a return crystallizes the before/after without neatness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum/cliff micro‑setting actively shapes action and meaning: the stone circle, softened wind, and single olive tree create constraints and resources that enable the ritual. The lighthouse and sea refract the final image, charging the return plan. Details are selective and POV‑filtered, with sensory variety beyond the visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether Mira can hold grief and breathe; escalation appears as a deepening: somatic markers rise, she works through them, and then reweights the photograph and her stance. The cost (not forgetting; relinquishing magical fix‑seeking) is legible. It’s quiet, but the internal tightening is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—optimism anchored in realism—emerges from particulars (photo, bark, breath, silt metaphor) and culminates in the act of planting memory rather than erasing it. The olive tree’s endurance gives subtext without overt allegory. There’s one direct formulation of the thesis, but it’s earned by scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, patient lyric voice with controlled rhythm and sensory bias remains stable and character‑bound. Diction is elevated but coherent with the narrator’s sensibility, and the few spoken lines serve action, not exposition. No head‑hopping or unjustified elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet layered; images do multiple jobs (“paper…like skin over a healing wound”). Rhythm varies with pressure, and there are no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors. Figurative density never blurs causality, particularly at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drone strike trauma filtered through an arboretum ritual, somatic awareness, and the lighthouse/keeper afterlife. The “pearl of stillness” is literalized through action rather than slogan. The closing reweights earlier images without gimmickry.</comment>
