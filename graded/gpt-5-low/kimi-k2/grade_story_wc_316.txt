<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—defeating creeping numbness—drives concrete choices (lifting the jar, cracking the seal, proposing “your turn to feel”). The relationship crucible with Kael‑2 produces a credible pivot from confrontation to mutual surrender. Embodied detail (theta rhythm syncing, CSF droplets as micro‑memories) grounds interiority. The only softness is the occasional aphoristic line that risks smoothing contradiction, but cost (relinquishing ownership, exposure to feeling) lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene situational lens holds: pressure accumulates as the clone draws the argument‑blade, Kael opens the jar (irreversible), the scroll rewrites, and the brain speaks. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: custody → stewardship, with an on‑page price (risking sensation, dissolving ownership). Orientation is clear early (dojo above rewritten Pacific, jar, scroll), and the time‑ripples shape the contract on the page. Minor convenience in the scroll’s grant is offset by the characters’ decisive surrender that enables it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating dojo and its event‑horizon, magnetized obsidian cradle, and living‑ink scroll are vivid and functional. Setting constrains options (shelter from rewrites; scroll reacts to history) and directly affects outcome (joint custody rewrite). Recurring objects (jar, scroll, blade) charge the final image (EMERGENT jar, rain within). Sensory economy is tight; no postcard bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—possession vs shared feeling—tightens when Kael opens the jar, making surrender the only non‑violent path. The reversal (from blade to kneeling) is earned by acknowledging mutual numbness; cost is relinquishing claims and re‑sensitizing. Pressure coheres under the situational lens; the world’s lurches complicate but don’t resolve. Slight softness: external mechanism (scroll) assists resolution but is unlocked by their choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ownership to stewardship; emotion outsourced then reclaimed; complementary opposites slice pretense. Subtextual beats (kneeling, breathing onto gray matter) carry the insight. The explicit aphorisms on the scroll (“become the storm that remembers it is water”) edge into moralizing, trimming the score. Still, the final image of rain filling the EMERGENT jar resonates and reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is confident and consistent, with textured diction matching the surreal premise. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful (“Possession is nine‑tenths…” vs “Your turn to feel”) and advances subtext. Rhythm modulates well at peak beats (opening the jar; the brain speaking). No POV leakage or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images do double duty (CSF droplets as memories; blade that “cuts arguments”). Metaphor load is rich but coherent within the world‑logic; rhythm varies cleanly. A few aphoristic turns verge on purple, but they don’t blur causality or the closure image. No loops or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Corporate shaman + ego‑death + clone custody within a time‑sheared dojo is a fresh synthesis. The “argument‑cutting blade” and complementary‑opposites method feel novel and necessary, not ornamental. The emergent third voice (“I am the feeling you outsourced”) reframes the premise with inevitability. Bold risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
