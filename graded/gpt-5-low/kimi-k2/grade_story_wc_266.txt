<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation and arc are clear: the boy seeks courage and the guides midwife that transformation. Interiority is mostly externalized through ritual and image rather than deep internal monologue, but the micro‑choice to speak “Stay” lands as character‑specific. The guides’ embodied knowledge (“salt in their joints”) differentiates them without stereotyping. Some contradiction (fear vs. draw toward the path) is present but lightly rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions and images intensify toward the bell‑stone and the naming of fear. Closure is on‑page with cost: the boy names “Stay,” accepts a binding thread, and walks on, foreclosing his prior tether. Orientation is clear early; the pattern is taught and paid off. The price is emotional and conceptual, not dramatic, but it’s undeniable within the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally integrated: fog, lanterns, ridgeway, and the unstruck bell constrain and channel choices. Recurring objects (leash, ticket punch, lanterns) charge the final image and tactics (circle, spiral, stamp). World rules emerge through action (indirect routes, star mark) without exposition. The environment modulates tone and decision‑making, especially at the stone where the act must occur.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes focus on whether the boy can summon and bind unused courage to cross; pressure coheres through the accumulating ritual and stories. The decisive tightening is the requirement to “call it by the name you fear most,” narrowing options to a single vulnerable act. Cost is felt in relinquishing flight and accepting constraint (thread replacing leash). Escalation is quiet but precise under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of guidance, ritual, and reclaiming feral courage arise organically from particulars and recur in reweighted images (leash → light thread; ticket star → pulse). Subtext in the lullaby and indirect routes deepens the notion that courage is cultivated, not found straight on. Slight overt moralizing appears in “unused courage is never truly lost…,” softening the afterglow. Still, the final charged poise resists tidy moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person voice maintains consistent distance and selective diction. Rhythm suits the ritual cadence and modulates at key beats (the crisp click; the small word “Stay”). Minimal dialogue is purposeful and subtextual. No head‑hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line work is musical and image‑dense without collapsing into muddle; metaphors (lanterns as metronomes, unstruck bell) cohere to maritime and ritual registers. Information density is high with few redundancies; sentences propel rather than stall. A touch of purple is avoided by recurring object use and action integration. The final cadence cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ferry‑guide psychopomps, star‑punch, and leash‑to‑light transposition feel distinctive and integrated. The ritualized, accumulative structure pays off with a non‑obvious pivot (“Stay” as the feared word). Risks in diction and conceit are controlled and coherent. The synthesis reads fresh and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
