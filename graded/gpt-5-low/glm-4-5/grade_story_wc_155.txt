<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Amelia’s motive (to recover lost joy) is clear and her actions align, but on‑page contradictory impulses are minimal, so pressure never tests her in a revealing way. The closest friction—the council’s doubt—is summarized and easily overcome. Interiority is serviceable yet leans declarative (“she knew better”), blunting embodied conflict. The ending change (joy rekindled) is earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the because/therefore chain (find fragment → light‑develop → exhibition → communal response) coheres and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is light and mostly conceptual (labor, skepticism), but a before/after is legible. The montage spans several beats—more than one transition—yet remains clear and purposefully cumulative. The final image reweights the premise without a decisive act, which suits the design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fog‑bound orchard district, observatory, and the fragment/lamp apparatus are vivid and consistent with Amelia’s perception. Setting supports tone and theme, though it seldom constrains choice beyond atmosphere. The fragment as object‑micro‑setting charges the final image effectively. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover joy, revive community memory) is clear, but escalation is gentle and largely unopposed. The key tightening—the public display—doesn’t visibly foreclose options or exact a price; doubt from the council is waved past. Tension operates more as steady unveiling than pressure. Emotional risk is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Recurring images (fog/light/fruit/dance) braid into a coherent theme about illumination restoring communal joy. However, explicit theses (“human hearts yearned for beauty,” “rekindled the human capacity for wonder”) tip into told moralizing, reducing subtext. The final reprise (“Perhaps all ruins are just stories waiting for the right light”) is apt, if a touch on‑the‑nose. Resonance lingers but could deepen with less assertion and more image‑driven implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A consistent, gently lyrical third‑person voice fits Amelia’s sensibility and maintains stable distance. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with clean focalization and no head‑hopping. Occasional declaratives flatten intensity, but the perceptual signature (light as paint, exposed‑film conceit) is distinct. Dialogue is sparse and functional, carrying small emotional pivots.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and mostly lean, with images doing double duty (light as restorative art). Some lines edge toward summary or sentiment (“she knew better”), softening momentum. No major loops or figurative muddle; rhythm varies adequately. Information density holds, though a few statements repeat theme rather than advancing pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Painting with light” to develop a muted fresco is fresh, and the “exposed film” metaphor integrates concept and action. The arc—art reclaiming community—is familiar, yet specifics (mist‑preserved district, observatory conversion) keep it from generic uplift. Risks are modest but coherent. Closure feels earned within this vision, if short on surprise.</comment>
