<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s ambition and sensory gift motivate clear choices (climbing higher, the moonlit vigil), and her shift from extraction to apprenticeship reads earned. Internal contradiction is light—she meets little resistance—so pressure rarely exposes competing impulses. Embodied perception through scent and doodling is character‑specific. The final stance (keeper/bridge) lands but with minimal visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Structure is coherent and anchored early; the accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern and scent density build to the blue‑lit reveal. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the “corpse flower” redefined as guardian library, reweighting Elara’s goal. The cost is soft (time, isolation, risk suggested rather than dramatized), which keeps the ending from fully tightening. Nonetheless, the before/after is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The treetop village, rope bridges, mists, and “wildflower hush” create a vivid, sensorial atmosphere filtered through an herbalist’s bias. The wrapping‑paper journals function as a recurring micro‑setting charged in the final image. Environment lightly constrains choice (climbing higher than others dare) but doesn’t decisively shape tactics in the climax. World rules feel consistent and integrated without dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking the seed’s nature and legacy—is clear, with one deepening turn at the opening’s blue filaments. Escalation is gentle; external pressure and hard trade‑offs are minimal, so tension remains low despite lyrical charge. The resolution stems from her attention and endurance but lacks a palpable price or foreclosed option on the page. A credible loss or risk paid in scene would strengthen the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of listening to an undercurrent of wisdom via lineage and practice coheres through recurring images (scent, doodles, hush). However, explicit statements like “I’ve learned to listen… to the undercurrent of wisdom” edge toward moralizing, reducing subtext. The final image reaffirms belonging and stewardship but risks neatness. Resonance lingers more through image than argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct sensory palette (“wildflower hush,” “turning of the tide’s thought”). POV control is steady; limited dialogue fits and serves action. Occasionally elevated diction borders on purple but remains largely character‑motivated. Rhythm modulates well across calm and reveal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑rich, and mostly efficient; several lines do double duty for mood and world. Some ornate phrases and nominalizations (“motivation—that persistent drive…”) add weight without adding pressure. Mild repetition (“wildflower hush,” “turning of the tide’s thought”) risks decorative echo rather than new charge. Mechanics are clean and sequencing clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Corpse flower as guardian library and the family doodle‑journals on wrapping paper feel fresh and organically linked to character. The reclassification twist is earned by pattern accrual, not a late rule. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; conflict containment keeps it from breakthrough originality. Still, the synthesis of scent, pattern, and lineage is memorable.</comment>
