<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s desire and method are clear and consistent, and the maternal lineage grounds his motive. Earned Stasis lands: he chooses to give voice to others while accepting being forgotten. However, interior contradiction is light; he scarcely struggles or wavers on the page. The young woman scene offers embodied empathy but not a pressured choice that reveals deeper fracture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: gestures, camera, and gathered witnesses intensify into a charged final image. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a palpable cost—the gift persists while he vanishes from memory. Orientation is clean from the opening; the single‑scene progression is legible. Slight softness in causal turns keeps it just shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harbor is vivid and functional: moonlight, water, boats, and distance are not ornament but fuel the “mapping” of silence. The camera as tool and the water’s rhythms shape the method and final image. Sensory detail leans visual but is purposeful and filtered through Elias’s attention. Strong charge in the ending as the harbor “sings.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on honoring silence versus personal erasure; pressure deepens as the crowd gathers and his signing weaves multiple silences. The cost is conceptual yet felt, with a cadence lift near the end. Still, there’s no sharp on‑page dilemma or foreclosed option beyond the standing condition of forgettability. Tension is steady rather than tightening into a hard test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silence-as-music, memory/oblivion, and inheritance cohere through recurring images (hands, camera, water) and culminate without a moral. The theme arises from action—translating the woman’s grief and the harbor’s quietude—rather than thesis statements. A few overt lines (“silence was not emptiness”) and repeated “joyful sorrow” slightly blunt subtlety. Overall resonance lingers credibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person holds distance and bias with control; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates as the gathering thickens; diction aligns with the piece’s contemplative mode. Absence of dialogue is appropriate, with subtext carried in gesture. Minor repetition edges toward formula at moments but seldom breaks texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly precise; images like the camera “honoring” grief work. There is some redundancy (“joyful sorrow” recurs) and a few familiar metaphors (“scattered diamonds”), which slightly dull freshness. Momentum remains intact with minimal scaffold. Figurative density is high but coherent and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The filmless camera as compass, sign‑mapping of silence, and the forgettable advisor premise synthesize into a distinctive conceit. The inheritance from a deaf mother adds a fresh, humane wrinkle. Risks are thematic and tonal rather than structural, and they pay off in the charged closing image. Small cliché flecks at the line level prevent a higher leap.</comment>
