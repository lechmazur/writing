<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cyrus’s motive—repairing his life by negotiating with his ghost—is clear and consistent, and his actions (fitting the wheel, stepping onto the word‑bridge, offering the wheel) align under pressure. Interiority is vivid (regret, time‑torn perception) though contradictory impulses are lightly sketched rather than dramatized in conflict. The ghostly counterpart provides a relational crucible at the peak but with minimal verbal interplay. The cost is legible in surrendering the wheel and accepting a reconfigured self.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal dominance: find wheel → harness → images → bridge → confrontation → dissolution → carousel restarts. Orientation is strong early, and the sequence pays off with an on‑page Decisive Change (wheel sacrificed, time re‑aligned) that carries cost. A single, clean tightening move (word‑bridge to the ghost) keeps coherence. The negotiation resolves swiftly, but without breaking logic or robbing the ending of consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon/carousel ecology is specific, tactile, and rule‑consistent; the lagoon’s currents and the carousel’s energy constrain options and shape the final image. The disposable camera wheel functions as a charged tool‑as‑setting, materially altering what can happen. Sensory and object choices are purposeful (crystallized moon fruit, iridescent debris) and filtered through Cyrus’s scavenger bias. The world’s physics are taught through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early, and pressure tightens via the active build: assembling story fragments, producing the word‑bridge, and risking the crossing. The decisive trade—surrendering the long‑sought wheel—registers as a price. Escalation is mostly linear and smooth; there’s little resistance or reversal once the device engages. Still, agency drives the peak, and the cost reweights the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of eroded ambition, self‑reconciliation, and the power of communal stories accrue through concrete images (bridge made of others’ words) rather than moralizing. The ending’s reconfiguration (carousel turning, currents aligned) offers a resonant answer about integration over return. The ghost’s “recognition—perhaps even forgiveness” lands as earned rather than declared. Ambiguity remains purposeful (what future this integration yields), inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (scavenger’s eye, time‑blurred memory) remains stable. Diction and cadence modulate effectively at the peak without head‑hopping. Minimal dialogue is functional and avoids expository strain. The lyric register matches the world’s strangeness without sliding into vagueness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density and propel scene and image; repetition is mostly purposeful (eroded ambitions, fractured stillness/liquid peace). Figurative language is vivid and coherent to the world’s logic. A few abstractions (“magical power,” “profoundly chronologically confused”) skim telling, but they don’t blunt the closure image. Rhythm varies, and mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The disposable camera wheel as a temporal focusing gear and a bridge woven from overheard stories feel fresh and integrated. The self‑negotiation with one’s ghost avoids cliché through specific mechanics and a concrete price. The carousel/lagoon cosmology is novel and consistent. Risk‑taking in image logic heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
