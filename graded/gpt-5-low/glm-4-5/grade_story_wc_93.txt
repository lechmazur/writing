<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific (the mentor’s vow and the curse), and her micro-choices (placing stones, persisting as the dust escalates) align. Interiority is mostly conveyed through image rather than complex contradiction; doubt/fear are present but lightly rendered. The shift from “control” to “respect/harmonize” reads earned by the events. Cost is conceptual (living with the curse), not strongly felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: stones → pulses → eruption → reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the opening image, and set-ups (math sequences, eels, dust) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the dust integrating and the visions reframed. The cost at the ending is modest but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bluff, aurora, tidal pools, and frictionless rule are vivid and purposeful; the dust’s behavior and the stone placement are charged by the world’s physics. Sensory specificity stays aligned with her vocation (eels, shells, ratios). The environment subtly constrains options and powers the final image. Occasional abstract phrasing keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore balance/understand patterns) is clear and escalates through the ritual culminating in eruption. The meaningful turn is the realization that harmony, not control, resolves the pressure. Prices are more implied than dramatized: danger is mentioned, but the scene rarely corners her with a hard trade-off. Tension holds but never bites down hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Harmony vs control and reverence for pattern emerge organically from the ritual and the eel imagery. Thematic closure is strong but somewhat declared (“not meant to be controlled”) rather than fully subtextual. The reprise of “borrowed dawn” and integrated dust offers a resonant conceptual answer. Complexity is present but cushioned by assurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a controlled cadence and image-led thinking. The perceptual filter (mathematics, constellations, eels) is character-specific and steady. No head-hopping or stance slips, and modulation at the climax is clean. A few generalized lines edge toward exposition but do not break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong image economy (stones, ratios, aurora, dust) with mostly clear syntax and momentum. Minor redundancy and occasional abstract tellings (“world unraveling at its cosmic seams”) soften pressure. Figurative language is evocative without muddle, and rhythm varies well. No major artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Elusive eel herder” in a frictionless world using math stones to engage collapsed stardust is fresh and coherent. The core turn (respecting pattern) isn’t novel, but the vehicle and world-rule integration feel distinctive. The eel choreography and dust sphere add memorable specificity. Risk is present in the synthesis more than in structural daring.</comment>
