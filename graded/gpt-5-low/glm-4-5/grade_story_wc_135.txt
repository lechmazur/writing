<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elina’s role and aim (“compile fragments into meaning”) are clear, and her choice to share the herald’s true story is consistent and compassionate. However, her interior life is summarized rather than dramatized; we rarely feel embodied conflict or contradictory impulses as she works. She functions more as an interpreting conduit than a pressured person. The emotional progression from discovery to disclosure is convincing but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece layers visions and objects toward a reweighting: the herald’s sacrifice reframes exile and return. Orientation is clean from the opening (“ivory harbor after rain”) and the recurring valve coheres causally. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s stance shifts from anger to sorrow to peace, and the valve’s final placement charges the ending. The cost is emotional and communal rather than decisional but is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harbor after rain, the briny air, and pale stones are vivid and consistent, and the recurring valve functions as an object‑as‑setting in the final image. Details are POV‑filtered through an archivist’s sensibility and motif of absence/presence. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it permeates tone and meaning. The specificity supports the accumulative build without tourist‑catalog breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reknitting communal meaning post‑exile—is clear early. The main tightening/deepening arrives with the herald’s revealed sacrifice, which reconfigures the community’s emotional options. Pressure remains gentle; consequences are more thematic than hard‑priced, and Elina’s agency is primarily curatorial and declarative. Still, the knowledge turn credibly narrows how anger can be held and redirected.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Absence vs. presence, truth vs. false comfort, and communal repair emerge through the valve, the diary, and Elina’s archival ethic. The ending reweights prior images (the valve on the desk; harbor no longer defined by absences) without resorting to a tidy moral. Some lines edge toward essayistic statement (“not with false promises but with the truth”), softening subtext. Yet the final shared‑understanding image carries genuine resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in third‑person close; patterning (“through staggered intervals”) is taught and reused. Diction fits an archivist’s sensibility and supports the accumulative design. No head‑hopping or register slips, and the modulation toward the final calm is apt. The lack of dialogue keeps subtext internal but suits this mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong sensory anchors and purposeful repetition, and sentences generally do more than one job. There is some conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing that could be tightened (“navigated absences” recurs as label rather than scene in a few spots). Rhythm holds and the final image is clear. No figurative muddle or mechanical errors distract from closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Ocean‑spray archivist,” “navigated absences,” and the trumpet valve as catalytic relic feel fresh and coherently synthesized. The accumulative reveal of the herald’s hidden sacrifice is not a common template move and fits the world’s logic. Risk is moderate, with originality more in concept than in dramatized confrontation. Its restraint and civic‑memory frame read distinctive.</comment>
