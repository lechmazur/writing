<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The therapist’s motives (execute a flawless goodbye) are clear and embodied in concrete micro‑choices (arranging chairs, placing the vinyl, modulating volume). Interiority is steady and credible, if a touch generalized in a few lines of credo. Secondary characters register briefly yet meaningfully—Mrs. Anders’ memory and the son’s denial sharpen the crucible. The arc leans endurance over contradiction; little internal friction, but the cost lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative design is clean: family arrival → music enactment → charged object transfer → death → soft cadence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the son holding the shard, the music bridging denial and acceptance, with death as the paid cost. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and set‑ups (vinyl, “no tears,” scent) pay off. The pressure tightens without a hard turn, consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: “scent of hope” (lavender/cedar), the above‑clouds haven, the guitar and vinyl as tactile anchors. Details are filtered through the therapist’s professional attention, integrating setting with action. The environment charges the final image even if it rarely constrains choice. Strong micro‑setting work around the mementos table and bed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crafting a flawless goodbye—is established early and tightened by the ticking clock (hours). Escalation is a controlled deepening (music soft → louder; son’s denial → bridge toward acceptance) rather than reversal. The visible price is Mr. Anders’ death and the family’s first moments without him. Agency is quiet but present in the therapist’s choices that foreclose alternate paths.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motifs (fragment → wholeness, scent → hope, hymning the mundane) braid into a coherent meditation on reunification and meaning over miracle. Subtext carries through action—the shard becomes a reliquary, the music reframes denial—though a few lines nudge toward thesis statement. The ending’s image reweights prior particulars without explaining them. Emotional honesty largely avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent first‑person, calm, attuned voice fits the role and setting; diction and rhythm modulate gently with pressure. Sparse dialogue rings natural and carries subtext (the son’s “when you’re feeling better”). No head‑hopping or stance slips. Lyric texture is controlled and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line craft is clean and purposeful, with strong nouns and recurring images doing double duty. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts sentimentality but remains grounded by concrete detail. Minimal repetition (“pulsing stillness”) reads as motif, not loop. Pacing and syntax support the quiet urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hospice scenes are familiar, but the vinyl shard as therapeutic tool and the “scent of hope” blend feel fresh and integrated. The piece commits to a quiet, textural build rather than twist. The final synthesis—ordinary magic, fragment held as relic—lands as specific rather than generic. Not radical, but confidently executed.</comment>
