<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maia’s motive—finding a voice under censorship—reads cleanly and drives each micro‑choice (ascending, setting the timer, extracting the map, writing). Interiority is textured through concrete objects (telescope, envelope, map) rather than labels alone. Internal contradiction (furious fire vs tranquil mask) is present, though the cost of breaking the mask remains mostly implied. The final stance—resolved purpose—feels earned by prior beats, if a touch safe in terms of on‑page risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm, timer beeps, and mask‑slip window build toward a Charged Poise closing image. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when and regime pressure). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she claims voice and intent—but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it below top tier. The beats link coherently without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, telescope, and above‑cloud perch are vivid and purposeful, shaping mood and opportunity (privacy, vantage, storm electricity). The timer, deck, and lightning charge the final image and the thematic stakes. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist listing. Minor symbolism edges up to overt at times but stays effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to speak truth under suppression) is clear, and the live clock (mask‑slip window) supplies the key tightening. Escalation is felt via the timer’s cadence and the shift from contemplation to writing to outward gaze. However, external pressure never presses back on the page, so cost and narrowing remain largely internal. The resolution is credible but not hard‑won in scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Recurring images (lightning, lens, scars/map, masks) cohere into a theme of truth piercing control. The final image reweights prior material—words as rarefied air seeping downward—with quiet resonance. Occasional explicit statements (“The power of truth…could not be contained forever”) blunt subtlety. Still, the piece invites reflection beyond plot without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled lyric register that fits Maia’s sensibility; the “perceptual signature” centers optics, maps, and weather. Rhythm varies enough to carry momentum, and the single spoken word lands with intent. A few grand abstractions push toward purple, but POV integrity holds. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is mostly clean with strong images, but figurative density is high (“verses on the walls,” “cartography of scars,” “storm‑kissed wonder,” “rarefied air”) and occasionally redundant. Some paraphrase echoes slightly slow momentum. Clarity survives; cadence works with the timer beats. Trimmed metaphors would sharpen pressure without loss.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While “censored artist finding voice” is familiar, the observatory, darkroom timer, and cartographic frame give it a fresh inflection. The mask‑slip window as social mechanic is intriguing. The ending’s seepage image feels specific and earned. Risk is moderate rather than bold, with little subversion of expected turns.</comment>
