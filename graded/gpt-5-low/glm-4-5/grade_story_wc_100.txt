<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (haunted by mortality, professional instinct to “give rest a permanent address,” inadvertent stubbornness) are clear and drive his choices from opening to closure. Interiority is specific at key objects (the lens vibration) but contradictions under pressure are light, with few genuine missteps or costs. The transition from undertaker to keeper is earned, if emotionally tidy. A deeper felt price for leaving his old life would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: package → coordinates → dive → library → assembly → beacon → role shift; the drive lens reads Causal. Closure lands with a Decisive Change to “keeper,” but the on‑page cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. Middle beats (acquiring the sub, entering the library) proceed with little resistance, trading tension for momentum. Still, the final reconfiguration is coherent and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful setting: cliff, gray waters, coral forests, “impossible spiral towers,” zero‑G books, and the airlock integrate with action rather than stall it. The broken lens functions as an object‑as‑setting, charging the final image. Physical constraint from the environment is minimal (the ocean and airlock never meaningfully restrict options), keeping this just shy of the top band. Sensory selection supports tone and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming distress into sanctuary/purpose) is signaled early and resolves, but pressure escalates gently rather than through hard turns. Warnings from locals and deep‑sea descent promise risk yet never bite; assembly succeeds without setback. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the pedestal’s purpose and commits to restoration. Clear, but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of death, memory, and preservation are embodied through the lens’s shift from distress to invitation and Elias’s vocational redefinition. A few lines edge toward thesis statement (“giving rest a permanent address”), slightly dimming subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, if a touch declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent single‑POV lyrical voice with controlled cadence and apt diction for the character. The perceptual signature (undertaker’s attention to stillness, light, and ritual) remains steady. Minor flourish density appears, but never breaches legibility. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong line‑level craft: clear syntax, varied rhythm, vivid imagery (“fish scattered like silver thoughts”). Occasional purple or repeated constructions (“impossible spaces,” abstract intensifiers) lightly crowd peak beats without obscuring sense. Momentum holds; few redundancies. Clean mechanics throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Undertaker + broken lighthouse lens + drowned library is a fresh synthesis that feels cohesive rather than gimmicky. The beacon’s reactivation as a metaphysical sanctuary lands as an elegant turn. The ease of the quest and familiar hero‑as‑keeper trope temper the sense of risk. Still, the conceptual integration is memorable.</comment>
