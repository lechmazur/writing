<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s motives (reckless curiosity, skepticism, need to surface a “swallowed truth”) are clear and embodied through tactile engagement with the valve wheel and the radio. The internal contradiction—religiously skeptical yet using talk-radio psychics—adds texture. The closing shift toward accepting unspoken truths reads earned but low-cost. Emotional specificity is solid, if occasionally phrased in familiar terms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Structure holds as a single-scene accumulative build: tunnel → object → radio confession → vision → repricing of the “ghost shift.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the final image (cooling wheel, dawn) signaling a before/after in stance. Costs remain largely conceptual, softening impact. Orientation is clean from the start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and selective—damp air, brass beading, the radio’s static—filtered through an explorer’s eye. The beaded valve wheel functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image. Sensory balance and economy are strong, though the environment rarely constrains action beyond mood. Consistency of tone and world rules is maintained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearthing the swallowed truth) is clear, and pressure coheres through the confession and the vision surge. Escalation is modest and largely interpretive; Marcus isn’t forced into a hard trade-off or tangible loss. Agency operates as attention and interpretation rather than decision under cost. The result feels resonant but low-pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—truth vs silence, confession’s liberating weight—emerges from images (wheel warming/cooling, dawn) but is undercut by explicit moralizing (“Some truths weren’t meant to be swallowed but shared”). Subtext exists in the humanization of the ghost shift, yet the ending states the thesis rather than letting image alone carry it. Resonance lingers, if a bit over-explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and credible; voice maintains a controlled lyricism that suits the piece. Radio snippets feel natural and functional. Occasional clichés (“paint the sky,” “like lead”) flatten texture. Overall rhythm and certainty match what Marcus could know.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear with good momentum and selective imagery; the tactile handling of the wheel is strong. Some scaffold and familiar phrasing creep in, and a few sentences paraphrase the same insight. The final paragraph leans tell-y, dampening charge. Grammar and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—interpreting talk-radio psychics as investigative practice—adds a fresh angle. The beaded valve wheel as talismanic object is effective, if not wholly unprecedented. The “ghost shift as human tragedy” insight is thoughtful but familiar. Overall synthesis is distinctive enough to engage without feeling groundbreaking.</comment>
