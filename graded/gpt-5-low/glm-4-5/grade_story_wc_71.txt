<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria’s motive—diagnosing why some houses feel alive—drives concrete ritual choices and culminates in an earned realization. Interiority is specific (streetlights “daydream,” “shard of hush”) but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or pays an emotional price beyond wonder. The lighthouse placement beat reveals character through action. The change is credible but gentle, with limited cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the ritual repetitions gather until the lighthouse glow and felt vibration reweight meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the shard lets her perceive a hum of attachment, redefining “alive houses.” Cost is soft but present as acceptance of presence-as-echo and the mortality it implies. Orientation is clean and the cadence shift at the glow beat is decisive for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The predawn bay, “daydreaming” streetlights, and lighthouse cottage are vividly filtered through Aria’s sensibility. The shard, driftwood, and key function as micro-setting tools that charge the final image and guide action. Details are selective and purposeful, with the environment cohering to tone and ritual. World rules (quiet magic) stay consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—understanding—and tightens at the placement-and-glow sequence. Escalation is primarily deepening rather than conflict; the shard’s activation changes knowledge but the price is understated. Agency is present in the ritual method and targeted choice of the lighthouse. The cadence shift is clear, though stakes remain contemplative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—love’s residue animates place—emerges via objects and ritual, then reweights at the glow. However, the final paragraph states the thesis too baldly (“life lingers where love leaves its traces”), softening subtext. The shard’s “inadvertently profound” nature enriches the idea of presence as echo. Resonance lingers, but moralizing tempers the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close-third voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“streetlights daydreamed,” “hushed blaze”) holds steady. Distance and certainty fit what Aria can plausibly infer. Modulation aligns with the glow/revelation beat without slipping register. No dialogue; narrative texture carries the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are controlled and musical, with purposeful repetition and image economy. Occasional abstraction (“sanctify her understanding,” “inadvertently profound truth”) tendencies approach telling, but rhythm and specificity usually ground them. No major loops or scaffolding; momentum is steady. Minor purple edges do not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orris shard as a “shard of hush” is a fresh, memorable device; the ritual of displaced objects feels original within a coastal, predawn lyric. The lighthouse glow beat reconfigures the premise cleanly. While the core insight is familiar, the execution’s texture and object logic distinguish it. Risk is quiet but coherent and integrated.</comment>
