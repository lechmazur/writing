<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (find where deleted files go) is clear, consistent, and scales to a risky breach. We get specific interior texture—her pattern sensitivity, the “archive doesn’t lie” credo, and the visceral thrill/fear during the 90‑second window. Internal contradiction is present but light (duty vs. transgression); she largely reads as hyper‑competent. The final renunciation—disappearing underground—carries a credible cost and aligns with her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: 731 pattern → restricted sectors → fabricated credentials → access → discovery → alarms → flight. Closure lands with on‑page cost (alarms, career/freedom jeopardized) and a decisive change of state (she has the evidence and goes underground). Orientation is solid early (role, setting, task) and held. The only minor limitation is low resistance in the breach itself beyond the ticking validation window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archive is vividly rendered as a “digital necropolis,” with restricted sectors and grayed‑out interfaces that concretely constrain choices. The 90‑second authorization and security alarms make the environment an active pressure system, not wallpaper. Recurring objects (Stellaris patch, warning symbols) are filtered through her professional gaze. World rules stay coherent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>One clear tightening: she chooses to lie, triggering a live clock and risk that culminate in alarms and exile. Stakes (truth vs. personal safety) are present and escalate without gimmicks. The cost is explicit enough to charge the ending. Slight softness in adversarial pushback mid‑breach keeps it short of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and institutional power accrue through particulars (deleted files “go everywhere,” the archive as both reliquary and weapon). The Stellaris patch and the 731 motif reweight meaning at the end. Occasional on‑the‑nose lines (“ensure that nothing… could successfully delete the truth forever”) skim toward moralizing. Still, the final repricing of “deletion” into dispersion lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical tech‑noir cadence that suits her mind. Diction remains plausible for a meticulous archivist; filtered noticing is steady and character‑bound. No head‑hopping or stance drift. A touch of elevated rhetoric at peaks is noticeable but not destabilizing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are generally propulsive and dense; exposition is integrated with momentum. There is some metaphor pile‑up and motif repetition (“ghosts,” “echo,” “songs”) that edges toward purple. Still, syntax varies, scaffolding is minimal, and the closure image is clear. The prose carries pressure without major artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar conspiracy/investigation bones are energized by the “deleted goes everywhere” reframing and the social‑archive custodian POV. The 731 numerological breadcrumbing and the Stellaris patch provide specific texture. Not wholly transformative, but the synthesis feels purposeful and coherent. Risk is taken in the lyrical register and pays off more often than not.</comment>
