<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—to prove the garden knows its gardener—is clear and consistent, embodied through the ritual of polishing and placing marbles. Interiority is specific to his craft and age, with the “withered” body mirroring seasonal cycles. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are limited; he faces little direct challenge beyond the anticipated scientists. The endurance choice at the end reads earned but carries a muted on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds via recurring acts (polishing/placing marbles) toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he sets a final marble and affirms mystery over measurement. Orientation is clean and the closure lands conceptually, with cost implied in aging and in the refusal to submit to quantification. Escalation is subtle, hinging on the cereus bloom and impending visit rather than a decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden maze, cottage center, and cracked marbles create a tactile, coherent world filtered through a gardener’s eye. Specifics like the junction of three paths and the night‑blooming cereus ground the lyricism. The environment charges the final image but rarely constrains a choice on the page. World rules (maze responding to emotion, measurable luck) remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (defend the garden’s unquantifiable bond), but pressure barely tightens; the scientists’ visit functions as a looming backdrop rather than an on‑page test. The cereus bloom provides a small victory, commemorated, not contested. The closing act is a stance rather than a forced trade‑off, with cost largely conceptual. Tension operates more as atmosphere than as narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through marbles as “mended deception,” the paradox of “blooming withering,” and the measurable luck frame. The final whisper—“They will look for measurements and find only mysteries”—lands, though it edges toward stated thesis. The images (repaired marbles, maze responsive to hearts) carry most of the resonance. The piece invites reflection without collapsing into tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence fitting an elderly gardener. Diction and rhythm stay within a plausible, reflective register; no head‑hopping or stance drift. The voice sustains pattern without monotony, and key lines punctuate with control. Minor explanatory lines surface but do not break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and purposeful repetition (polishing/placing, “blooming withering”). Occasional abstractions and light paraphrase echoes appear but don’t drag momentum. Figurative language is coherent and grounded in the garden‑craft lexicon. The final image recharges earlier motifs without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of measurable luck with an emotion‑responsive maze and repaired marbles feels fresh and integrated. The “mended deception” conceit is an original angle on order vs. wildness. Risk is modest but coherent; the piece commits to a quiet, accumulative design. A more acute on‑page test could elevate ingenuity by converting concept into pressure.</comment>
