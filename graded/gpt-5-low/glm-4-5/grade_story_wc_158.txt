<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The insomniac poet’s drive is clear and consistent—transform pain so others can rest—and their choices (singing, persisting, surrendering life) align. Interiority is lyric rather than granular, so contradictions are felt more in texture than specific moments. Still, the endurance reads as an Earned Stasis with visible cost (a life of sleeplessness). The persona stays archetypal, limiting psychological specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: postcard → lullabies → blossoms → defense against darkness → legacy. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the poet dies and the shell “keeps singing,” with the postcard pinned overhead—cost is legible. Orientation is clean from the first line. A single deepening turn (darkness threatens; the poet sings louder) tightens stakes without breaking the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is vivid and active, its walls responding musically and blooming; the environment shapes outcome by cradling sleepers and carrying the lullabies. Object and setting integrate (shell walls as instrument, blossoms as constellations). Sensory detail is purposeful, especially light and scent (“reef-shadow joy”). Minor risk of ornamental lushness is kept in check by consistent POV filtering through the poet’s vocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are largely internal—maintain hope vs. encroaching despair—with one credible tightening when “darkness threatened” and the poet must sing louder. The cost is endurance culminating in death, but pressure remains gentle rather than knife-edged. The postcard and blossoms function as evolving counters to despair, cohering under the chosen lens. Absence of on-page resistance beyond the abstract keeps tension from peaking higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting suffering into communal rest emerges organically through action (lullabies → blossoms → protection). The final image reweights the premise: the poet’s absence becomes presence encoded in the shell, a resonant answer to isolation. No didactic moralizing; motifs (postcard, constellations, bioluminescence) accrue meaning. Slightly emblematic characterization limits moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, distinct lyric voice sustains the piece; phrasing like “shyly unstoppable” and “off-key wind” feels unified and intentional. Distance and stance remain stable, with compressions taught early. No dialogue; the poetic register matches the narrator’s sensibility. Minor repetition operates as pattern rather than filler.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high imagery density with few muddles; repeated phrases act as leitmotifs rather than loops. Syntax varies and momentum holds across centuries without slack. A touch of purple risk is present but rarely obscures meaning. Final cadence is clean and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis—oceanic shell-as-world, galaxy postcard, bioluminescent lullaby-garden—feels fresh and coherent. The cosmological-to-intimate bridge is executed with conviction and minimal exposition. The risk of a purely decorative lyric mode is avoided by the functional transformation. Human specificity is somewhat archetypal, holding it just shy of the top band.</comment>
