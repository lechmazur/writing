<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent interiority and motive (to honor hidden effort) are rendered through tactile routines, but internal conflict is minimal and risk‑light. His choices (whistling, following moon paths, returning to tea) align, yet lack contradictory impulses under pressure. The villagers’ judgment hints at cost but isn’t dramatized in-scene. The final acceptance of imperfection reads earned but serene rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → moon paths → parapet → return, culminating in a quiet Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is strong from the outset (cabin by river, nets, tea ritual). Closure lands as a charged reprise (tea whisk, dawn, fading paths) with a conceptual cost (choosing appreciation over explanation). The cost is subtle, not acute, keeping the ceiling below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: damp parapet “whispers,” moon paths only after rain, fireflies mapping the marshes, all filtering through his craft-trained gaze. Environment constrains choices (he goes after rain; visibility of paths depends on conditions). The bamboo whisk functions as micro‑setting charging the final image. Sensory balance and specificity are strong without feeling touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring hidden effort) is clear, but pressure barely tightens; conflict is largely contemplative. The significant deepening is the rain‑dependent journey and the final cadence shift at dawn. No major option is foreclosed beyond accepting solitude and ephemerality. Tension is present as a hum rather than a climb.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motifs (nets/knots, fireflies, moon paths, tea whisk) coherently embody the theme of unseen labor and impermanence. However, explicit moralizing (“This appreciation… was the highest form of wisdom”) undercuts subtext in the final third. The ending image still resonates, but the stated thesis blunts ambiguity. The thematic architecture is elegant but a touch declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a contemplative craftsman’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are measured and fitting. Perceptual signature—pattern‑spotting through craft—is distinctive. No head‑hopping and no dialogue liabilities. Occasional elevated phrasing (“scintillatingly somber”) brushes mannerism but doesn’t break coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and efficiently patterned; objects do multi‑work (nets, whisk) and lines carry atmosphere and character. Minor overwriting and conceptual restatement appear in spots, with one explicit theme statement flattening subtlety. Rhythm and sentence variety generally serve momentum. No major artifacts or loops impede clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of artisanal craft, moon‑path cosmology, and a mossy parapet yields a fresh, memorable frame. The firefly constellations and rain‑activated whispers feel original and organic to the character’s lens. Risk is quiet but committed; the story follows its implications without gimmickry. Novelty is earned through specificity rather than twist.</comment>
