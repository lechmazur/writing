<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya’s motive (vivify the duplicate and overcome numbness) is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices—approaching the jar, channeling vitality, choosing to feel pain. Embodied touches (“hands trembling,” “cool glass”) anchor her interiority. The transformation to “bridge between opposites” lands but reads a touch tidy and declarative. Minor therapy‑speak abstractions dilute the messiness of the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hybrid drive holds: situational pressure (the rewrite wave) converges with causal action (the vivification through opposites) to produce a CR/RR closure. Orientation is swift and clean; the pedestal/label stakes are clear. The cost—embracing pain under a ticking temporal wave—is legible on the page. The legal battle is off‑stage, but the on‑page closure is earned enough for this scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and the labeled jar are vivid and purposeful; the dojo’s stability under rewrite and the jar as micro‑setting constrain tactics and charge the final image. Details like obsidian pedestal and specialized adhesive feel selective and world‑true. The environment mirrors pressure as the dojo trembles at the climax. No wasted cataloging; setting serves the choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awakening the duplicate before the rewrite erases them) is signaled early and tightens as the wave crescendos. The decisive move—Maya choosing to feel pain to fuel vivification—narrows options with a felt price. External antagonists remain conceptual, slightly softening the on‑page squeeze. Still, the pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Identity, autonomy, and non‑zero‑sum consciousness resonate through specific images (duplicate label, awakening brain). However, the final paragraph drifts into thesis (“consciousness was not zero‑sum… exponential”), edging into moralizing. The strongest thematic work arises earlier from the charged contrast between Maya’s numbness and the brain’s projected memories. The ending’s conceptual repricing lands but could trust the images more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is coherent, controlled, and modulates under pressure; lyric diction suits the speculative frame. Occasional abstract register (“complementary opposites,” “ego death survivor”) distances immediacy. No dialogue, but interiority substitutes effectively. Rhythm supports the crescendo without head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong nouns and a steady cadence; key lines carry multiple jobs (world, stakes, emotion). Some conceptual repetition and abstraction (“numbness,” “opposites,” “rewrite of history”) add light scaffolding and reduce bite at peak beats. Imagery of light/pulse is familiar but functional. Momentum holds through the end without loops that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating dojo, temporal rewrites, a labeled duplicate brain, and vivification via opposites—feels fresh and integrated. The legal/ethical custody frame elevates beyond trope. The bridge‑maker self‑redefinition is earned, if slightly neat. Risks are taken without losing clarity.</comment>
