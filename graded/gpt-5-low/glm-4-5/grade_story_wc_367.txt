<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—guiding humanity with “ancient shadows”—is coherent and consistent, and her ritualized labor grounds her competence. The internal countercurrent (elation vs. fear of misguiding others) surfaces, but it rarely pressures a concrete choice on the page. Her prophetic slip creates worry but doesn’t force a sacrifice or visible mistake. Still, micro-choices (aligning mirrors, declaring the hidden channel) reveal her values under soft pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative: the piece tightens from pattern (nightly ritual) to a specific test (guiding refugees through a hidden channel). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she recommits despite the risk of prophecy, with a felt responsibility cost. Causality is adequate (her actions steer ships), but the price is more conceptual than dramatized. Orientation is clear and the single-shard structure holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, aurora-fed wick, and optical mechanics are vivid and POV-filtered, and the environment/tool directly shapes tactics (mirrors, lenses, beam path). The setting charges the final image and is not mere postcard. Sensory specificity prioritizes functional detail over excess ornament. Not quite 9+ because constraint-driven cost from setting is implied more than paid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safely guiding a refugee fleet—tightens when she opts to reveal the hidden channel. Agency is present and drives outcome; coincidence (twin comets) is flavor, not resolution. The legible cost is light: risk and responsibility rather than a concrete loss or foreclosed option. Escalation is clean but not punishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of rediscovery after collapse and marrying ancient intuition to tech emerge organically through objects and ritual. “Shadowed elation” becomes a thematic stance, not just mood. Occasional telling (“reckless rush into convenience”) softens subtext. The final image coheres without sermonizing but remains relatively safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person closely-held voice with consistent focalization. Rhythm and diction suit the mythic-technical blend; exposition occasionally intrudes. The stray artifact (“室白鲟”) jars tone and polish. Dialogue snippets feel natural for the piece’s register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean, with purposeful images and good verb choices. Some explanatory density (“total internal reflection,” tech details) edges toward telliness under pressure, and one typographic glitch disrupts polish. Minimal redundancy; momentum holds. The closing cadence lands without purple overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—aurora wick, optical seamaps, a laughing storm herald post–info collapse—feels fresh and coherent. Turns arise from established tools and ritual, not late rule drops. Emotional truth leans modest but genuine. Strong originality tempered by low-cost conflict keeps it below the top tier.</comment>
