<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena’s motive and temperament (“carefully reckless,” “cautious exuberance”) are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices—pushing bold interpretations, deciding to present—fit her. Internal tension between risk and scholarly integrity is present but mostly told rather than dramatized under pressure. We don’t see her make a costly relational choice on the page; the pressure remains anticipatory. Still, her interiority feels specific to a linguist’s mind.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from archival labor to a breakthrough and a charged walk to the chamber. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she steps toward confrontation before treaties, with a visible potential cost (reputation, failure at the brink). The structure is clean and anchored early; causality is simple but intact. The absence of an on‑page decision by the leaders keeps the close quiet rather than transformative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archive is sensorially grounded (dust motes, dim light) and POV‑filtered through tools of the trade; the glass ink well recurs and charges the final image as it sits emptied and left behind. Specifics feel apt to an extinct language setting without museum‑tour excess. The environment guides mood and process more than constraining choice. It enriches tone and theme even if it doesn’t force tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and time‑boxed (“before paths diverge”), with real deepening when she finds the ceremonial text with consequences. Escalation is primarily internal/knowledge‑driven; there’s one meaningful tightening but few on‑page trade‑offs. The cost is implied—risk of dismissal, the ink well drained—but not paid yet. Tension works, though the conflict remains largely preparatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reconciliation through language and the ethics of promises emerge organically from concrete archival work and the lattice of obligations. The “symphonies of truth” motif refrains meaningfully, if a bit insistently, charging the closing image of crossing the threshold. Occasional thematic repetition (“restore trust after silence”) edges toward told moral. Still, the ending offers a resonant, open answer without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A consistent, mildly elevated third‑person limited voice fits an erudite linguist and holds steady. Diction and cadence are controlled, with patterned phrasing used as motif rather than crutch, though repeats (“interconnected promises,” “symphonies of truth”) verge on mantra. POV modesty holds; no head‑hopping or gratuitous exposition. Rhythm modulates during discovery and the final approach effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and image‑driven, with good information density and purposeful sentence variety. Some paraphrase loops and mantra‑like repetitions slightly dull momentum. Figurative language generally lands, but a few intensifiers and restated stakes could be trimmed. The final lines are crisp and visually decisive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—an arcane linguist healing a political rift via ancient contractual language—feels fresh and thoughtfully integrated. The ceremonial text with consequences is a smart, specific turn. Execution is elegant but conservative; the piece avoids riskier structural or ethical complications on the page. Memorable images (the drained ink well, the lattice of promises) help distinguish it.</comment>
