<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive (quantifying emotion to reach her vanished mentor) is clear and sustained, with a credible tension between disciplined caution and “buried optimism.” Her embodied actions—tracing chips, invoking equations, handling the glass eyes—align with motive. Internal contradiction is present but gentle; the piece avoids a sharp on‑page price beyond self‑guarded hope. The final renewed‑purpose choice reads earned, if low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The ritual’s density builds—eyes awaken, time slows, mosaic rearranges, a fleeting mentor image—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (a new configuration and path) with conceptual cost (hope as risk; loss persists). Orientation is solid throughout. The closure lands quietly but cleanly under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cavern orchard, bioluminescent fruit, mineral drip, and the mosaic stone are vivid and purposeful, filtered through the conjurer’s technical perception. The mosaic functions as a tool‑setting that actively shapes action and the final image. Environmental logic is consistent and thematically consonant. A tangible constraint beyond ritual timing would push this into the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (understanding loss to potentially recover the mentor), and escalation arrives via intensifying phenomena (eyes animate, patterns shift, vision appears). The tightening is primarily a knowledge deepening rather than a foreclosed option, and the price is conceptual rather than paid on the page. It’s credible and cohesive but never truly corners her. The final move—accepting a new path—feels earned but low‑pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Thematic spine—quantifying feeling without reducing it—emerges through image and method (equations murmured, mineral nourishment mirroring emotional dynamics). The repricing moment reframes “mathematics of emotion” as relational transformation, dovetailing with ambiguous loss. A few explicit statements (“wasn’t about cold calculation...”) tilt toward telling, but resonance survives. The final charged poise sustains ambiguity without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady, close third with a consistent lyrical-technical texture; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Diction suits a meticulous conjurer blending logic and intuition. Rhythm is measured and modulates gently with intensification. A touch of repeated phrasing slightly flattens peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sensory, and mostly economical; several lines do double duty (world + theme). Minor redundancies (reiterated moon‑silence, “buried optimism,” and role labels) shave momentum. Figurative logic holds without mixed metaphors. The final image is clear and unsmudged by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—cavern orchard ecology, taxidermist’s eyes, and emotional mathematics—feels distinctive and integrated. The mosaic‑as‑computational-divination device is fresh, and the mentor’s flicker reads earned. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but they heighten coherence. It avoids template plotting while staying legible.</comment>
