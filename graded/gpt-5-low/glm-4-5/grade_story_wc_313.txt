<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thomas’s motive evolves credibly from stewardship to redress once the photographs reveal his aunt, and his concrete actions (calls, petitions) align. Interiority is specific enough (the label stirring a “forgotten memory”) but the internal tension is relatively smooth, with limited on‑page struggle. The admission that he had “unwittingly upheld” a false narrative gives moral cost, though the conflict remains largely internal and lightly pressured. A touch more embodied contradiction under pressure would deepen him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal turn: label → photos → aunt revelation → decision/action; the closure is a Decisive Change as he mobilizes to rewrite the narrative. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the ending’s dawn image closes the arc. Cost is mostly conceptual (risking status, admitting complicity) rather than dramatized; still legible. The two‑shard structure (ridgeway then cabin/action) is clean and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ridgeway, receding reservoir, wind chime, and dawn-lit rooftops create a vivid, selective atmosphere that filters through Thomas’s sensibility. The wind chime’s silence and the water level directly shape action, charging the final image of emerging rooftops. Detail economy is strong (sapphire label, single lamp), with consistent world logic. It stops short of 9+ because constraint is suggestive rather than acute.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (truth vs. institutional narrative), and escalation proceeds through discovery to commitment. The tightening is meaningful when the aunt is recognized, reweighting his responsibility. However, antagonistic pressure remains largely offstage, and prices are implied more than felt. The ending’s agency is clear but lightly tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motifs (silence, reflection, resurfacing) cohere into a meditation on memory, progress, and narrative justice, with a strong mirrored hush tone. The final image reweights prior material, but lines like “expunge the false narrative” and “spin silence into meaning” verge on stated thesis. Subtext operates in the chime’s silence and resurfacing roofs, though a bit more ambiguity would heighten resonance. Earnestness edges toward sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with controlled distance and consistent diction suits the reflective mode. The perceptual signature favors quiet, image-forward noticing (label, lamp, rooftops), and modulation toward action at the end is smooth. No head‑hopping or stance leakage occurs. Slight abstraction in thematic phrasing is the only tonal rub.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, rhythmic sentences with high information density and purposeful images; very little scaffold or loop. Occasional abstract formulations (“precisely humane,” “shared meaning,” “expunge the false narrative”) slightly blunt edge and feel summary-like. Figurative choices are coherent and not overstacked. The final cadence lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resurfacing-town premise is familiar, but the levee warden’s moral pivot via a preserved label and a photo trail tied to his aunt adds specificity. The wind-chime threshold and bureaucratic redress frame avoid sensationalism for a humane reorientation. Risks are modest but coherent, yielding an authentic synthesis. Greater friction or a less expected tactical turn would raise novelty.</comment>
