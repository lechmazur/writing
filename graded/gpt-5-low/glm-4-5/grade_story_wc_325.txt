<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (standing by the unremembered, haunted by her brother) is clear and embodied in micro‑choices under time and claustrophobic pressure. The contradictory impulses—fear of enclosed spaces vs. compulsion to guide—register on the page. However, she encounters minimal resistance while executing the ritual, so struggle feels muted. A stronger on‑page cost or falter during one transition would deepen credibility and impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a Situational clock; closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she completes the night’s crossings and recommits to return. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the ticking tide constrains options. The ritual cadence intensifies toward the Codex’s “sigh” and the shore reclaiming the door. Cost at climax is primarily conceptual/relational and somewhat off‑page, keeping the close strong but not crushing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The facility, cables, pipes, and tidal window are vivid and purposeful, shaping tactics and the ending image. The Codex and cable access cylinder function as charged micro‑settings, not décor. Weather and ocean hum align with her internal state without over-symbolizing. The environment constrains with the tide and reappears to seal the scene’s final cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide the unremembered within one tide) is clear, and the clock tightens. Yet the path is largely unopposed; she succeeds with seven crossings without a snag, so pressure reads measured rather than acute. The claustrophobia provides ambient drag but no tactical shift. A single failure, price, or near‑miss would sharpen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, stewardship, and liminal infrastructure (cables as afterlife conduits) emerge through image and action, not thesis. The “crashing hush” and the Codex’s closing “sigh” offer a resonant, quiet answer: service as sacred endurance. Occasional explicit lines (“Her motivation… had cost her…”) skim close to telling. Still, the final silence reweights prior images effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close maintains distance and diction consistently, with a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well with the tide’s clock and the facility’s hush. Slight purple edging appears but largely serves tone. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with varied syntax and solid information density; images often do double duty. A few metaphoric intensifiers verge on lush, but clarity holds. Minimal scaffold or loops; the prose carries momentum. The last line resolves by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Undersea cables as psychic conduits during tidal windows is a fresh synthesis; the Codex’s gold margins interacting with EM fields feels specific. The ghost‑guide premise is familiar but is personalized through setting and procedural ritual. The piece commits to its premise without hedging. A riskier on‑page cost or complication could have elevated ingenuity further.</comment>
