<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elion’s altruism and Aris’s trust are clear, but interiority and embodied conflict are thin; we’re told they act rather than feeling them decide under pressure. Aris’s “strangely trustworthy” trait enables bridge‑work but never meets visible resistance or cost. Elion’s constraint (noncorporeality) is noted yet not dramatized at a peak beat. The final communal shift is earned causally but not character‑particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: messages → reexamination → watering bell → revitalization → ritualized remembrance. Structure is coherent, but much is summarized, so the decisive turn (discovery and use) lacks on‑page cost or friction. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—communal identity reframed—without a felt price at the end. Orientation is clean; escalation is logical but soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, and nebula are vivid and memorable; the watering bell is a strong object with concrete function. World rules feel consistent and integrated into action (larvae mist, chalk at dawn). However, the environment rarely constrains choice; arches mostly reappear as ceremonial monuments rather than shaping tactics. Sensory texture is visual‑dominant but effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the failing orchards) is clear, but pressure is stated rather than dramatized, and setbacks are referenced (“brambled hope”) without a beat testing resolve. The one major tightening is Aris’s thorough reexamination leading to the bell; after that, success proceeds smoothly. Costs (risk of trust, labor) are implied, not felt on the page. The result reads assured rather than contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of communal trust, intergenerational stewardship, and cooperation across life/death cohere through recurring images (chalk script, arches, bell). The ending resonates conceptually—communal rituals and gratitude—but it leans on declarative summation that flirts with moralizing (“had saved them all”). Subtext is present but low‑tension; complexity is modest. The “brambled hope” motif is evocative but asserted more than earned in scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent omniscient voice with a gentle, fable‑like cadence; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Diction fits the mythic tone and remains steady. Compression is controlled, though the remove mutes urgency. Rhythm is smooth if a bit uniform.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clean sentences and clear sequencing; select images carry weight without purple sprawl. Some phrasing and concepts recur (“elegant script,” “floating arches,” “brambled hope”), creating slight echo without new pressure. Momentum is acceptable for summary mode but lacks sharp line‑level turns at peak beats. No major artifacts or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a ghost agronomist guiding via chalk, a butterfly‑larvae watering bell, and floating arches as monuments is imaginative and coherent. The rescue via pollinating larvae feels specific rather than generic magic. Risk is moderate (mythic sweep over scene friction), but the world’s texture stands out. A more contested, on‑page crisis would elevate ingenuity into inevitability.</comment>
