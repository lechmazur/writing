<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The weaver’s interiority is specific and embodied (lamp warmth, whalebone ledger, careful orientation), and the ritual exposes a credible contradiction: duty versus isolation. The micro‑choice to calcify their own burden underlines cost and care. The final reframe (“gift rather than a curse”) is earned, though the repeated label “boundary‑lessly trapped” reads slightly declarative. Strong, character‑filtered action with a modest hint of told theme.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual sequence deepens from king to farmer to self to civilization, culminating in a conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation is clear from the outset; single POV and scene are coherent. Cost is legible in the ongoing obligation and the delicate handling of the self‑burden. Slightly soft pressure, but closure lands on page without a causal break.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bronze grotto, starlight cracks, and the lamp integrate into action—orientation under starlight is necessary to “capture” weight, and the altar’s materials matter. Details are POV‑filtered and purposeful rather than touristic. The recurring objects (lamp, ledger) charge the final image. Rich atmosphere supports meaning without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collecting and measuring burdens) tightens at the self‑burden and peaks with the ancient civilization’s calcification and vision. Escalation is textural rather than oppositional, but the need for precise alignment and the risk of mishandling their own burden create a credible squeeze. The price—enduring the calling reweighted as connection—reads. Tension remains modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, geology, and the ethics of bearing and measuring burdens arise through concrete ritual acts. The final repricing of “trapped” into “connected” resonates with prior particulars (starlight, calcification, ledger). A couple of lines verge on thesis (“Every weight must be measured…”), but the imagery carries the argument. The ending lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction is consistent with the mythic/scientific ritual. Motifs (“orienting,” “shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) are taught early and reprise cleanly. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Minor repetition edges toward mantra but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, action, and thought—while maintaining clarity and rhythm. Figurative language is apt and not muddled; momentum sustains through the ritual. Some phrase repetition (“boundary‑lessly,” “orienting properly”) risks slight redundancy but functions as pattern. No major scaffolding or cadence artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conceit of calcifying burdens into geological forms in a bronze grotto under starlight feels fresh and internally coherent. The whalebone ledger and procedural exactitude give the myth weight. The closing civilization‑vision is an earned, surprising intensification rather than a gimmick. Strong synthesis with only minor familiarity in the self‑revelation phrasing.</comment>
