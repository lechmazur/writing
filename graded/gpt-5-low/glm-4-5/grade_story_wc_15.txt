<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to transform ruin into reverence via art—is clear and consistent, and her exhaustion supplies a modest cost. However, internal contradiction is thin; the sleepwalking reduces on‑page micro‑choices under pressure, softening agency. Embodied emotion appears in tactile details (thread/needle), but the piece leans on summary over in‑scene struggle. Still, her belief and actions cohere and culminate in an earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the labyrinth blooms and reweights the sacred space with social consequence (village pilgrimage) and personal cost (fatigue). Orientation is clean from the outset (wharf weaver, harbor, canyon), and the recurring plate→sleepwalk→sewing pattern tightens into the luminous finale. The causal chain is soft but coherent for the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful setting—misty harbor, red canyon “dragon spines,” orchid luminescence—filtered through Elara’s artistic eye. The labyrinth’s carved paths constrain and literalize her sewing, charging the final image. Details evolve with action (threads sprout into orchids), integrating world rules without exposition. A strong environmental presence that shapes meaning and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the sacred) is clear and the pressure deepens as the villagers discover the nocturnal work. Yet resistance is low and obstacles are largely internal (fatigue), with minimal friction or reversal. Escalation is a steady density build rather than a sharp tightening; cost is present but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of art as bridge, lineage, and re‑sacralization emerge organically through the plate, labyrinth, and orchids. Some thematic statements are explicit (“transforming ruin into reverence”), edging toward on‑the‑nose, but the closing image reweights prior motifs credibly. Subtext works best in overlaps—sleepwalking paths vs. ancestor routes. Emotional aftereffect is tender, if somewhat declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third‑person with a distinct tactile lexicon (threads, stitches, hum). Rhythm is controlled and modulates softly; no head‑hopping. Occasional slogan‑like repeats (“ruin into reverence,” “overlapping paths”) slightly flatten peaks, but the voice remains coherent and character‑filtered. Elision fits the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean, image‑rich lines with good economy; strong nouns and concrete verbs carry weight. Mild redundancy and motif echoing create a gentle loop effect, and some purple drift skirts sentimentality in the final third. Momentum holds despite summary spans. No grammatical noise or clarity breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: a wharf weaver sewing a canyon labyrinth so thread becomes living orchids, guided by a dream‑plate and sleepwalking overlaps. The transformation image feels inevitable in hindsight given the seeded motifs. Risk is lyrical rather than structural, but it coheres without gimmickry. High originality with thematic integrity.</comment>
