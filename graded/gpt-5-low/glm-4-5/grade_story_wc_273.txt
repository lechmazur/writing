<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, focused motivation drives choices (the experiment, stepping into the ink), and cost lands on return with destabilized vitals. Interiority is specific enough (“serene anger,” isolation, professional rigor), though contradictory impulses are lightly rendered. A few label-forward lines (“Their albinism wasn’t just physical—…”) flatten nuance. Still, actions align with motive and the ending registers an earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is solid from the start (who/where/when), and the causal chain is coherent: eclipse window → ink geometry → deliberate entry → displacement → return with cost. The closure functions as a conceptual repricing supported by on-page consequences. The hybrid lens holds, with causal beats carrying to a thought-turn ending. Stakes remain singular and resolve without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment, stone shelter, and drone/ink toolkit are vivid and POV-filtered. The site’s selection for magnifying temporal anomalies and the eclipse’s timing meaningfully constrain tactics. Details evolve with action (patterns flare as the final shadow passes; wind whispers at the close). Strong economy and integration without postcard clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates through a decisive, risky act that narrows options (stepping into the ink at the eclipse’s edge). The turn lands with tangible price (physiological destabilization, gasping, drone alarms). Pressure is coherent and agency-driven; no coincidence resolves the core problem. The final realization feels earned by the ordeal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonance arises from image and ordeal (ink patterns as time’s malleability), but the thesis is stated outright in the last lines, dulling subtext. The piece still invites reflection on perception vs. objective time through concrete particulars. The conceptual repricing is credible, just slightly over-explained. A touch less declarative moral would elevate the lingering effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident, with a distinct observational texture matched to a meticulous tracker. Diction occasionally leans abstract in thesis moments but generally stays grounded in sensory procedure. Dialogue is sparse yet functional and in-character. Rhythm holds under pressure without head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean, mostly lean lines with purposeful images (“woven into the fabric of the patterns”) and solid cadence. A few purple touches and minor redundancies (“impossible light,” reiterations of “serene anger”) slightly blunt momentum. Information density remains good, and sequencing is clear. The closing image is crisp despite a hint of explanatory echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Temporal displacement via disappearing ink patterns in a wind-carved research outpost is a fresh synthesis; the hummingbird drone adds a precise, non-gimmicky counterpoint. The eclipse as activator feels earned. Emotional truth mostly keeps pace with the novelty. Not revolutionary, but distinctly imagined and coherent.</comment>
