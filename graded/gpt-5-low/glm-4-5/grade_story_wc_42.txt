<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—transcending perception and saving the observatory—drives concrete choices (ignoring force for resonance, taking the clock outside). Interiority is specific to her craft and temperament. The internal contradiction (duty to stabilization vs. intuitive attunement) is present but lightly pressured. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of tremors → attunement attempts → outdoor listening → filter restructuring coheres and culminates in a clear RR/CR. Orientation is clean early (observatory, tremors, clock). Closure lands on-page as tremors subside through alignment rather than force. The price is subtle (a reframing of method and limits) rather than visibly paid, which tempers peak impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lunar observatory above clouds is vivid and functional; the deck “away from artificial sounds” directly shapes the tactic that unlocks the method. Professional detail (camera calibration, perception filters) is integrated through action. The clock-as-object charges the final image. Sensory selection supports tone without devolving into a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (stabilize/understand the tremors; expand perception), with escalation via repeated tremors and failed attempts. The meaningful tightening is Elara rejecting force for resonance and restructuring perception filters. Costs remain largely conceptual; no concrete loss or foreclosed path beyond the philosophical pivot. Still, agency drives the resolution credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme (resonance over force; escape velocity as perceptual transcendence) emerges from objects and choices, but the text occasionally states its thesis (“It’s not escape velocity in the physical sense”). The luminous-ache register yields a resonant final image of unseen phenomena. Subtext operates through the clock’s reweighting. Slight moralizing tones reduce subtlety at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a contemplative technician’s psyche. POV is stable and modest in scope, with clean focalization. Rhythmic variation supports pressure and quiet. A few diction choices verge on purple but rarely break stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Strong lines and imagery carry momentum, but there’s some overwriting and near-repetition (“luminous ache,” “ephemeral,” “changelessly constant”). Phrases like “leathered the boundaries” jar clarity. Overall density is good, yet trimming would sharpen force and reduce abstraction. No major scaffold loops, but the final explanations could be tighter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—sage repairer + anomalous clock + resonance solution—feels fresh and character-led. The clock’s redefinition from malfunction to map is an earned reweighting. While the cosmic-lyric mode is familiar, the particulars (perception filters, outdoor attunement) give it distinction. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural and largely pays off.</comment>
