<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clara’s desire to decode buildings is clear and consistently pursued, and the mentor–student dynamic with Mr. Abernathy is warm and specific. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost are light; she meets little resistance as she advances. The emotional reveal of kinship lands but avoids harder edges or flaws that would complicate choice. The final handoff of the seal reads earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers weekly teas toward the rooftop interrogation and lineage reveal. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with the seal’s transfer and a conceptual repricing of Clara’s “gift” as inheritance. Orientation is clean; causality is gentle but coherent. The cost (secrecy, demolished heritage) is present but understated, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Specific, lived‑in spaces—the cluttered study, the rooftop garden, the skyline “constellations”—build atmosphere that suits the premise. The meteor shower as “illumination” is thematically apt and gently functional, if not a hard constraint. The antique desk seal operates as a charged object tied to setting details in the district. Sensory variety is good without overloading.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Pressure accrues softly through intimacy rather than opposition; the key tightening is the rooftop “interrogation” leading to Clara’s articulation of meaning and the kinship reveal. Stakes (identity/heritage vs. secrecy) remain largely conceptual and not viscerally tested. The lies add a faint social hazard but never pinch tactics on the page. The ending is earned but low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, memory embedded in architecture, and protective falsehoods emerge organically from events and the charged object. Some explicit statements (“It’s inheritance”) border on telling the thesis rather than letting subtext fully carry it. The final image reweights prior details without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, though complexity is modest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lucid, and gently lyrical, with natural dialogue and clean POV control. Mr. Abernathy’s and Clara’s speech patterns are distinct enough, and the narration’s cadence suits a reflective, intimate tale. No head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythmic modulation at the rooftop moment is effective without showiness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and economical, with occasional familiar phrases (“constellations on earth”) that don’t derail clarity. Information density is solid; the line‑level supports momentum without scaffold loops. Figurative language is controlled and consistent with tone. Not many sentences do double or triple duty at peak beats, holding it below elite polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—dead languages taught as a way into architectural “speech,” sealed lineage, meteor‑lit reveal—feels fresh and coherent. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; the story avoids gimmickry and follows its implications. The familial interpreters’ lineage and the artifact as translator give it a distinct identity. Inventive, if not audacious.</comment>
