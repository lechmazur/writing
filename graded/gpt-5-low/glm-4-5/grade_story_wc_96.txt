<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority—his self‑molting and memory erosion create a credible, felt cost that informs every choice. Actions (scattering seeds, rebuilding shelves, sealing the tin) align with a mission rooted in the Elias bond. Internal contradiction (fragmented selves vs. unwavering purpose) reads, though pressure remains mostly atmospheric rather than forcing a hard dilemma. A touch more on‑page jeopardy or a sacrifice choice would elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat adds density—tin → seeds → banned words → rebuilding—culminating in a charged poise as he seals the tin and recommits. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the cost (eroded memory, ongoing risk, chosen endurance) is legible. Orientation is clean early and sustained. The structure lacks a singular decisive turn, but the final reprise reweights the stake effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the rusted, open‑roof library shapes tactics (open sky for seeds, ruin necessitating rebuild) and charges the last image. Concrete, selective details (“luminous fracture,” moonlight through a missing ceiling) are filtered through the poet’s priorities. Rules feel consistent and lived‑in. One explicit constraint‑driven choice (e.g., weather forcing adaptation) would push this into the 9s.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving/protecting knowledge through beauty—stays coherent and deepens via the reveal of seeds and banned words. Escalation is tonal and textural rather than confrontational, with one meaningful tightening as present resistance shifts from curation to planting. The cost is present but mostly conceptual; no live counterforce presses a concrete trade‑off. Still, the cadence shift near the end effectively narrows the stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of beauty as resistance, memory versus erasure, and identity’s cost emerge from objects and acts (tin, seeds, banned cranes). The Elias thread grounds abstract ideas in human connection. The line “Anarchy is simply truth without chains” tilts toward thesis‑statement, slightly blunting subtext. The final image nonetheless resonates, repricing “rebuilding” as insurgent cultivation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent to the POV; rhythm modulates with soft intensifications toward closure. Diction and imagery (“luminous fracture,” “Builder/Gatherer”) feel specific to the character’s psyche. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; quoted lines are sparing and purposeful. Minor risk of uniform elevation, but it remains purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images often do double duty (object, theme, action). Some repeated phrases and motifs verge on over‑insistence but don’t cloud clarity. Figurative language is rich yet mostly consistent; no mixed‑metaphor derailments. Momentum holds; sentences vary in cadence without scaffolding clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—itinerant identity‑molting librarian, prison‑born camaraderie, seeds as outlaw text—feels fresh and owned. Familiar resistance tropes are transformed through charged objects and a coherent ethos of “blooming.” Risks (lyric mode, non‑event closure) pay off with clarity. A sharper on‑page pressure or non‑obvious complication could push this higher.</comment>
