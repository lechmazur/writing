<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied through the ritual of renaming; Elias’s micro-choices (picking the tessera, finding the void, tracing patterns) align with his values. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he reads as serenely purposeful, with little on-page friction. Emotional embodiment is mostly atmospheric rather than conflicted. The final stance is earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece tightens through image density toward a resonant reconfiguration when the name is spoken and the plaza “responds.” Orientation is solid early; the single scene holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—renaming reweights ruin into potential—though the cost remains conceptual more than felt. The crowd’s silent witness and the charged tessera support the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful—the plaza, shattered sky, archways, and the mosaic stepping stone shape action and meaning. The tessera functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image. Details are POV-inflected and integrated into movement rather than static description. The world rules (ritual via patterns) feel consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming/renewing the plaza’s identity) is clear, and tension accrues as he prepares and performs the ritual. The meaningful tightening arrives when the tessera is placed and the name is spoken, shifting the crowd’s felt reality. Still, overt cost or a foreclosed path is lightly sketched rather than dramatized. Pressure remains coherent but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory-as-mercy and naming-as-salvage emerge organically through action and image. Subtext works through objects and atmosphere, but the line “We are not the fire” and the final moralizing phrase (“aberrant mercy… most enduring form of strength”) tilt toward telling. The ending reweights prior images (tessera, sky) effectively. Insight feels earned but a touch declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, controlled, and steady in close third; diction suits the mythic register. A small artifact (“触发”) and occasional elevated abstractions slightly disrupt the otherwise coherent texture. POV remains stable and confident, with measured modulation at the ritual’s apex. Dialogue is minimal but functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly strong, with purposeful variation and image density doing double duty. Some purple tilt and minor redundancy in abstractions soften propulsion, and the odd codepoint/typo hitches the read. The final paragraph leans declarative, dulling the image’s inherent charge. Overall clarity and rhythm hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The notion of renaming ruins as an act of mercy, focused through a single tessera and pattern-reading ritual, feels fresh. Post-cataclysm settings are familiar, but the specific tactic and object-centered liturgy distinguish it. The final reconfiguration grows naturally from earlier beats. Risk-taking is measured and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
