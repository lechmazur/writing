<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (repair as guidance/connection) is clear and consistent, and his tactile micro‑choices at the bench read credible. Internal contradiction is light; he faces pressure but little real doubt or error. The competence tilt limits felt cost, though the “steadier hands than yesterday” note gestures toward vulnerability. The teacher–apprentice bond is off‑page, so the relational crucible remains largely conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (depot at dawn; blind repairman; drone arrives), and the causal spine holds: diagnose → patch → confirmation text → ship departs. Closure lands with a modest cost via time pressure and effort, yielding a quiet RR/causal finish. The ticking clock (maiden voyage) could tighten further on the page. No teleports or rule breaks; scope fits the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misty depot, harbor sounds, and water bowl are vivid and POV‑filtered, with the bowl functioning as a micro‑setting that constrains the diagnostic tactic. Environmental detail evolves with action (steam thinning, anchor lifting), and the final calm reprises the opening atmosphere. A strong, selective sensory weave avoids postcard listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fix the drone in time to support the apprentice/ship) is clear, with one deepening turn when the cracked sensor is found and repaired. Escalation is gentle; the piece lacks a sharp reversal or pronounced price beyond time and precision. The resolution is earned by Elias’s agency. Pressure coheres under a hybrid (textural/causal) lens but never bites hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Repair as a metaphor for relational continuity accrues through particulars (conductive threads as “neurons,” water optics as sight). Some thematic lines tilt toward telling (“maintained a connection…”) but the final image of calm after aiding the voyage resonates. Ambiguity is modest; the piece favors a tender, affirmative answer over complexity. Still, the repair/connection motif is cleanly integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct tactile perceptual signature. Occasional visually framed lines (“surface reflecting the depot’s limited light”) slightly widen distance but don’t break stance. No head‑hopping; modulation suits the calm pressure. Dialogue is minimal but not needed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and mostly economical, with strong verbs and specific nouns shaping momentum. There’s some purple/repetitive diction (“magnetic calm,” “mist”) and a few adjective stacks that could be pared. Rhythm varies well, and information density stays high without scaffolding loops. The closure image is clear and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of a blind artisan using light refraction via water to diagnose electronics is fresh and memorable. The artificial hummingbird and rail‑harbor nexus add distinctive texture without gimmickry. The quiet mentor‑at‑shore arc is familiar but personalized through method and setting. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent.</comment>
