<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—protect, locate, and prepare the throne before sunrise—but internal contradiction is light. “Wisely adventurous” is dramatized in cautious yet bold moves (forbidden territories, methodical peeling). Emotions are mostly summarized rather than embodied under peak pressure. The renunciation at the end reads earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: gem → waterfall → orchard → layered murals → map → tree → descent → throne activation. Orientation is clean early; the clock tightens the sequence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she activates the throne for another, not herself. The cost is modest, and the elevator reveal edges toward convenience but remains set up by the tree recognition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, integrated worldbuilding (kaleidoscopic waterfall, digital orchard, crystalline circuitry) filters through Elara’s priorities. Environment constrains choices: the waterfall as gate, the orchard’s oldest tree as locus, and tech‑ancient interfaces that require the gem. Details serve action rather than stand alone. The sensory palette sustains the retro‑futurist atmosphere without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the ritual before sunrise—is present, with one meaningful tightening at the murals/map beat. Escalation is steady but gentler than the clock suggests; no true reversal or on‑page opposition tests her resolve beyond time pressure. The final act is her decision to awaken rather than claim, but the price isn’t sharply felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stewardship over sovereignty and honoring past/future emerge organically from image and action (peeling history to enable renewal). The ending affirms duty over power, though the phrasing edges toward declarative summation. The ruby/throne imagery provides thematic echo without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, if softly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a polished, slightly elevated diction suited to the subject. The perceptual signature—tech‑myth reverence—is coherent, with occasional purple flourishes that don’t derail clarity. Minimal dialogue; the lone whispered line rings true. Rhythm varies adequately through discovery and descent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clean mechanics and generally efficient sentences, though modifiers accumulate and some phrases double duty without new pressure. A few lush stacks (“shimmering curtain of light and prismatic water,” “futuristic nostalgia”) verge on purple but remain legible. Momentum holds through the murals to the final activation. No major scaffold or template cadence issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—retro‑futurist orchard, memory‑formatted forests, transparent‑wood throne—feels fresh and coherent. The quest frame is familiar but personalized by method (peeling paint as archive interface) and the gem’s behaviors. The final reweighting (preparing for another) avoids the obvious claim‑the‑throne beat, though the risk profile stays safe. Solid originality without radical risk.</comment>
