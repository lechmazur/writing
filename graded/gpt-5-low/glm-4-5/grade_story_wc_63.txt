<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alaric’s ethic of precision and his blind spot toward community are clear and consistent, and his public admission “I need helpers!” is a credible, motive-driven turn. Interiority is concrete at times (hands on the rake handle, heat through wood), but the emotional struggle resolves a bit tidily. The embodied cost is social vulnerability rather than physical, which lands but could be more contested. Some lines risk platitude, softening complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal flow is solid: inscriptions → realization → call for help → collective repair → bell rings. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant final image, and the cost is legible in the relinquishing of solitary mastery. The afternoon’s swift communal success feels slightly convenient but stays within the short form’s allowances. Orientation is clear early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The clock tower, pendulum, and the rake handle work as charged micro-settings that shape choices (he needs others to raise the bob; the handle’s inscriptions direct tactics). The tidal obsidian ridge frames the opening/closing images, enriching mood and coherence. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Alaric’s professional gaze. Not quite a 9-band because the ridge itself doesn’t constrain action beyond atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the clock/community trust) is clear early, and tightening occurs when the solution shifts from solitary labor to collective action. The legible cost is Alaric’s surrender of control/status; however, external resistance is minimal, making the path feel relatively unopposed. The escalation is more deepening than pressurizing, but it coheres. The final lift of the bob supplies a concrete peak choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of shared stewardship and balance emerge organically from actions, but they’re also stated outright via inscriptions and final declarations (“We are all time-keepers now”). The piece achieves genuine warmth and earned repricing, yet leans into moralizing in the last paragraph, reducing ambiguity. Strong symbolic braid (bob/handle/clock) supports resonance despite didactic edges. A subtler finish would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close-third with an artisanal lexicon suited to a meticulous clock winder; lyric passages largely serve mood and stance. Dialogue is brief and functional, with the cracked plea marking a tonal pivot. Voice remains coherent under pressure, though occasional elevated diction risks sentimentality. Distance control is clean and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with vivid images (“pendulum bob glinted,” “obsidian ridge”), and momentum mostly holds. Some purple phrasing (“searing reverie,” “incremental absolution wove itself”) and repeated thematic terms dull edge slightly. No major loops or syntactic monotony, and information density is decent. A touch leaner and less abstract in key beats would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The broken rake handle with guiding inscriptions is a fresh inflection on a familiar redemption/community-repair arc. The synthesis of technical precision and communal care feels specific to this setting and character. The arc’s turns are not wildly surprising, but they’re cleanly earned and the final image coheres. Strong, if not boundary-pushing.</comment>
