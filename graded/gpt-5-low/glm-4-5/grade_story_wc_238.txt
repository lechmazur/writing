<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Eloise’s guilt-driven motive to apologize and reconnect is specific and embodied in actions (perfume, wiring, rheostat), with credible ambivalence under pressure. The relationship crucible with Beatrice lands in subtext (“scissors cut clean… jagged edges”). Internal contradictions are present but lightly handled; we mostly get poise over rupture. The final acceptance-with-cost reads earned and forecloses easy absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence at the end: careful setup → apparition → brief communion → orchard activity breaks the moment. Closure lands as a charged poise: apology accepted, reunion ends, incomplete sheet remains as cost. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; props and rules stay coherent. The clock’s intrusion provides the decisive tightening that seals the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: archive dust, piano, copper/magnets, generator hum, and the orchard’s hush all shape tactics and tone. The perfume bottle and piano function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image (the lone sheet left behind). Sensory detail is selective and biased by Eloise’s vocation. World rules are taught via action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect/apologize before the orchard’s end) is clear; pressure tightens when the field intensifies and the orchard stirs. The price is the brevity of contact and the acceptance that healing is partial. Escalation is mostly lyric rather than combative, but the live clock and energy arc provide a concrete squeeze. Slight softness: ritual risk feels low beyond the countdown.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, repair, and “imperfect miracles” arise from concrete actions and images (scent as key, arc bridge, incomplete sheet). Subtext in dialogue avoids neat moralizing; acceptance “begins the healing” without pretending to finish it. One aphoristic line risks sentimentality, but the ending image reweights prior material effectively. Resonance lingers without didactic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with clean POV; diction fits the character’s profession and ritual focus. Dialogue carries gentle subtext and differentiated timbre (Beatrice’s “grit” cuts through the lyricism). Rhythm modulates well between setup and apparition. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are polished, texturally rich, and mostly multifunctional; momentum holds. A few aphoristic constructions verge on purple, but they’re anchored by concrete action soon after. Syntax and paragraph rhythm vary; no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors at the peak. Technical details (rheostat, induced currents) are precise without clogging the prose.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” with EM-field ritual and perfume-triggered revenance is a memorable synthesis; the orchard clock and sheet-music archive ground it freshly. The final incomplete composition as reconciliation emblem feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off cleanly. The piece commits to its premise without hedging.</comment>
