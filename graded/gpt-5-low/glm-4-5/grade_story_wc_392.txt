<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s professional rigor and personal lineage converge into a credible, propulsive motive; her calm exterior vs. stirred ancestry gives her a lived contradiction. Micro‑choices (noticing scratches, opening the lantern, documenting inconsistencies) reveal values under pressure. The final stance—risking career to honor truth—feels earned by prior beats. Occasional abstract labels (“controlling influence”) blunt texture slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal spine is clean: overlooked detail → lantern opened → note reveals corruption → choice to act despite risk. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when) and maintained. Closure lands as Charged Poise with a legible cost (“jeopardize her career”). External resistance is mostly implied rather than embodied, but does not harm the closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp, mildew, pooled water, and flood residue are tactically relevant (water levels vs. timeline, stained note). The lantern functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image and constraining action (forensic opening). Details are POV‑filtered and purposeful, avoiding tourist cataloging. Environment shapes discovery and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—truth vs. professional safety—and tightens as the note reframes the death into systemic negligence. The decisive deepening is Maya’s agency in opening the lantern and accepting career risk. Cost is stated rather than dramatized through on‑page pushback, keeping intensity just shy of peak. Still, the escalation reads as a clear because/therefore chain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of liberation, legacy, and institutional control are organically threaded through the lantern and ancestry links. The final image reweights the motif, but explicit statements (“The lantern’s light… now it would illuminate her path”) verge on thesis. Subtext exists in the historical echo but is partially overwritten by summary lines. Complexity is present but slightly tidied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Close third is steady and credible; diction suits a meticulous investigator with personal stakes. Rhythm varies and carries momentum, with minimal filter clutter. A few elevated phrases brush against abstraction, but the perceptual signature (forensic noticing) holds. Dialogue is sparse and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, economical, and layered—observations often do double duty (forensic and thematic). Minor telliness and a couple of echoing intensifiers (“reverberate”) slightly dull edge. No major loops or purple overload; sentences propel. Final cadence lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Investigator finds a historical artifact that reframes a modern corruption case is familiar, but the Underground Railroad lantern as both clue and moral compass is a fresh synthesis. Personal ancestry entwined with procedure adds specificity. The turn is earned and non‑gimmicky, if not radical. Risk‑taking is moderate and coherent.</comment>
