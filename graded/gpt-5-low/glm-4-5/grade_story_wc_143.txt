<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena’s motive is clear and steady, and her competence is believably embodied through gear handling and vigilance. The endurance choice (to stay, time, and shoot under pressure) is earned, with a felt emotional cost at the finale. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she manages sadness rather than wrestling with any destabilizing impulse—so the crucible feels contained. A touch of on‑the‑page lapse or doubt could deepen character specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the live clock (dawn) and the dissolving grain build toward a clean Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she gets the images as the creatures vanish. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and set‑ups (timing device, vantage, extinction stakes) pay off on the page. Cost is legible in the final beat as beauty disappears and the mining team’s arrival reframes the scene. The linearity is intentional and coherent, if a touch predictable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The moonlit summit and crater vista are vivid and functional: vantage, silence, and dawn’s light changes shape tactics and final imagery. Tools (camera, timing device) act as micro‑settings that constrain choice and cadence. Environmental evolution—night to sun, emergence to disintegration—integrates with the action. A broader tactile palette beyond visual and breath could push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the time constraint and the impending habitat loss; escalation arrives as the grain nears dissolution and the fireflies peak, then fade. The agency is endurance and precision under a narrowing window, with a visible price (witnessing extinction). There’s no reversal beyond density/swell; it’s effective but safe. A complicating hitch (equipment, visibility, emotional falter) might have sharpened the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of vanishing wonder versus progress—is woven through particulars (the grain, the lensing of dawn, the mining approach) and resolves in a resonant image rather than a moral. A few lines lean toward telling (“a testament to what was being sacrificed”), dulling subtext. The final charged poise—images as memorial, silence yielding to machinery—lands. Strong coherence, modest didactic leakage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt, with disciplined certainty and clean distance. Diction is controlled, but rhythm sometimes settles into similar sentence stems, and phrasing leans generic at moments (“purposefully curious,” “dawning hush” repeats). Still, the voice remains coherent under pressure and avoids head‑hopping. More idiosyncratic noticing would elevate distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line‑level is clear and largely efficient; information density is respectable with few stumbles. Some redundancy (repeated motifs and sentence starts) and occasional tell‑phrases slow momentum. The closure image is clean and unblurred, with no figurative muddle. Tighter compression and sharper verb choices could raise propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lunar fireflies and a chemical timing grain add concrete novelty to a familiar “last‑of” elegy. The synthesis is coherent and specific, with a memorable central tableau. Risk is moderate—structurally conventional with safe escalation—but the micro‑mechanics (dissolving grain cue) feel fresh and earned. A bolder ethical complication or unexpected turn could boost ingenuity.</comment>
