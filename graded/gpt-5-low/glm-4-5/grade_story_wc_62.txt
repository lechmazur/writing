<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives and craft-centered worldview are clear and embodied through tactile choices (thumb to stone, knots as stanzas). His grief history with the grandmother grounds the vocation, and his decision to retrace the mentor’s path gives him agency. Internal contradiction (empty and overflowing) is present but lightly dramatized; pressure rarely forces a hard trade-off. The visible cost at the end (ribbon depleted, mentor’s work complete) lands as credible endurance rather than a fraught change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns (ribbon, butterflies, poems) intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration as the monument is completed. Orientation is clean from the outset; the greenhouse/migration clock coheres. Closure lands with cost and repricing: mentor’s role ends, ribbon nearly gone, and the monument reframes grief as collective. Causality is soft but consistent with the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse at dusk and the butterfly migration are vivid and purposeful, filtering through a carver’s perception. Recurring objects (stone, ribbon) and weather sound charge the mood and final image. The environment subtly shapes cadence and ritual rather than forcing discrete tactical constraints, but it consistently pressures attention and time. The ending image (amber wings against ancient glass) is memorably charged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rendering collective grief) is clear, and pressure accumulates via ritual, migration, and the ribbon’s depletion. Escalation is more deepening than tightening; few real options close besides time and resource use. The retracing choice provides a mid‑story intensification but not a sharp reversal. The price is mostly conceptual/ritual rather than a hard trade-off under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres through objects and pattern-recognition (butterflies, ribbon knots, poems) reweighting grief as communal craft. The final tableau resonates, but the mentor’s articulated thesis (“What we carry together...”) states the moral, dulling subtext. Still, the imagery-driven repricing of grief’s shape is earned by the process depicted. Subtext operates well in the act of carving and the family ritual without over-explaining until the last line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third carries a distinct perceptual signature shaped by tradecraft and ritual. Rhythm modulates appropriately between stillness and movement, and there’s no head‑hopping or stance drift. Diction stays controlled and character-apt; elisions (time passing) are legible. Minor redundancy aside, the voice remains confident and specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Highly image-forward prose with strong sensory economy and clean syntax. Occasional overwriting and a small typo (“Thecompleted”) nick polish, and some reiterations of calm/thunder verge on pattern echo. Most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, theme, character) without sludge. Momentum holds despite reflective passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone craft, spectral mentorship, butterfly migration, and a ritualized ribbon—feels fresh and coherent. The final reconfiguration through a communal monument avoids cliché and reads particular to this voice and place. Risk sits in the accumulative design; it pays off, though it skirts sentimentality at the end. Specific craft details and the ribbon’s evolving function bolster originality.</comment>
