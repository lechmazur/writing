<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Eleanor’s motive—preserving vanishing arts by forging harmony—is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction and micro‑choices under pressure are largely summarized rather than dramatized. She reads steady, almost saintly, with few moments of simultaneous opposing impulses. The baton‑passing is meaningful yet arrives without on‑page struggle in the moment. The emotional arc from “expectantly resigned” to hope is told more than earned through scene pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterned returns (library, rosette, “subtracting noise”) accrue toward a Charged Poise closure as she gifts the rosette. The before/after is legible—she yields leadership while preserving the lineage—with a conceptual cost (relinquishment; the risk of traditions fading). Causality is mostly summary‑driven but coherent; the closure image lands. The price is felt more conceptually than viscerally, limiting upper‑band potential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumnal light create a consistent, tactile sanctuary; the zither rosette functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the ending. Environmental detail is selective and in character, though it rarely constrains choice. Sensory palette leans visual but suits the contemplative mode. The setting’s recurrence strengthens tone and closure even without exerting strong tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (preserve arts/unite divided singers) but rarely tested on the page; conflict and escalation are largely reported as already mitigated by her method. The key tightening is the eventual handoff—endurance giving way to succession—but it lacks a pressured decision beat. Tension remains gentle and thematic rather than scene‑driven. The cost is credible but softened by summary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres—harmony through subtraction, listening, and continuity—but it’s often stated outright (“music builds bridges,” “doesn’t eliminate diversity; it elevates it”). Subtext resides in the rosette’s reprise and the quiet of the library, which carry some resonance. Moralizing edges in near the end, tempering ambiguity. Still, the final gift image offers a non‑literal answer that reweights the whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, calm, and consistent with a measured lyricism; the occasional dialogue line fits the register. Distance and stance are stable; no head‑hopping or leakage. Aphoristic lines risk abstraction but remain within the voice’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates enough to maintain momentum in a reflective mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Clean sentences with reasonable variety and little scaffold; images like “subtracting noise” and “traveled stillness” stick. Some conceptual redundancy and telling dampen propulsion, and a few statements lean generic. Figurative language is contained and coherent; no purple sprawl or cadence templates dominate. The final image is crisp and unfussy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The choral‑harmony‑as‑social‑cohesion premise is familiar, but the “subtracting noise” pedagogy and the zither rosette lend specific texture. Structural risk is modest, relying on reflective accumulation rather than a bold scene engine. The closure’s symbolic continuity is apt though not surprising. Overall, solid craft with a few fresh inflections.</comment>
