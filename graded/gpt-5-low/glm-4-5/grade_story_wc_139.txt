<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya’s motives and contradictions (honesty vs inherited deception) are clear and embodied in choice under pressure. Her competence is credible, with small tremors (“fingers trembled”) that humanize her. The moral calculus is present but occasionally over-tidy (“laws must be bent to serve justice”) reducing messy ambiguity. Still, micro‑choices track well from observation to breach to stamping the seal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, each step (“waiting actively” → guard’s break → key → safe → seal → stamping) coheres cleanly to a decisive outcome. Closure lands with the forms completed and the return of the ink pot, with cost (risk of job/charges) made explicit. The plan proceeds with minimal complication, but the tightening is sufficient for this length. No orientation debt; props and information pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The funeral home’s “deathly vitality,” refrigeration hum, chemicals, and stainless tables are vivid and filtered through a professional eye. The setting supplies resources (access to director’s office, seal) and charges the final image, satisfying object‑as‑setting criteria. Detail selection feels purposeful rather than touristic. World rules remain consistent and plausible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (job/charges vs Thorne’s execution), and pressure coheres through the timed breach. Escalation is modest—no real setback or reversal—but the safe opening, seal weight, and stamping provide a credible tightening. The price is conceptual (breached trust) more than visceral; it lands but could cut deeper on the page. Agency drives every turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of redemption, ethical deception, and transition are organically linked to the setting and the ink pot, and the final image reweights them. Some lines verge on moral summary (“using the tools of deception to create an honest outcome”), trimming subtext. The “death as transition” motif aligns well with the asylum arc. Resonance lingers but is slightly didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited maintains a distinct, tempered lyricism that matches Maya’s methodical mind. Diction is consistent, with rhythmic control and clean focalization, no head‑hopping, and no gratuitous withholding. Prose modulates well between atmosphere and action. The absence of dialogue is not a deficit here.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are clean with good momentum; images carry more than one job and scaffolding is minimal. A few phrases tilt toward abstraction or repetition (“mathematics of a fair trade,” “laws must be bent”) and could be sharpened. Figurative language is mostly controlled and coherent. Final cadence is precise without purple spill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blend of a funeral home heist, a morally inverted con legacy, and a quasi‑magical ink pot feels fresh and coherent. The “inspiration well” idea adds distinctiveness without taking over. Execution is elegant but safe; the operation runs too smoothly to surprise at a high level. Still, the synthesis reads memorable and specific.</comment>
