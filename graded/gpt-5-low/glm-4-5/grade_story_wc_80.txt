<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The surveyor’s motive—documenting “interlaced absence” and preserving memories—coheres with his choices (diving, annotating, sealing a note). His “stoically sensitive” contradiction surfaces in tactile beats (inkwell, cold water), but internal friction is modest and mostly stated rather than dramatized. The felt cost appears as the inkwell’s “heavier than usual” burden, not a hard trade‑off. Strong presence, slightly under-pressured conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene tightens from observation to recovery (wresting the box) to a charged ritual (placing his own note), closing on a poised return tomorrow. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: his role shifts from surveyor to custodian of human longing, with the inkwell’s weight as cost. Causality is clean, though the price remains primarily conceptual.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion and drawbridge create palpable constraints (solitude after sundown; cold, current, and stone forcing tactical choices). Objects—inkwell, metal box, preservation cubes—are integrated and charge the final image (“click” closure). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, if occasionally leaning lush. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring and documenting lost human textures) escalates through the discovery and retrieval of the metal box. The “wrest” beat is the single tightening turn; after that, pressure settles into ritual, with limited additional cost. Stakes are largely internal and aesthetic rather than contested by an active counterforce. Earned but gentle escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance accrues through motifs (inkwell, drawbridge, preservation) to a quiet cadence of duty and witness. However, theme is sometimes told (“archeologist of abandoned dreams”) rather than earned solely through image, softening subtext. The ending’s conceptual repricing—measuring dreams like shores—lands with grace. Overall moving, slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence; diction suits a meticulous, reflective craftsman. Rhythmic control is steady, with a few heightened phrases that risk purple but largely remain within voice. No head‑hopping or stance drift. The “Tomorrow” triad provides intentional cadence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean sentences with good propulsion; concrete verbs (kneelt, plunged, wrest) anchor lyricism. Some redundancy and elevated phrasing (“hushed blaze,” “interlaced absence”) edge toward over‑ornamentation, and a few summary lines could be leaner. The final “click” is crisp. Overall solid line‑level craft with minor lushness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise—surveying as archaeology of longing—feels fresh, with preservation cubes and repair‑notes adding distinctive texture. The submerged pavilion and antique inkwell synthesize into a memorable ritual. Risks are tasteful rather than radical; the piece avoids gimmickry. Original and coherent, if not boundary‑pushing.</comment>
