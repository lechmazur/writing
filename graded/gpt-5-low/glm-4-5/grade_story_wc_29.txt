<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and competence are clear, and her obsession vs. caution provides a credible internal tension. We see embodied stress (hair rising, breath held) and micro‑choices culminating in the risky activation. The cost is mostly conceptual (risk of attracting tricksters, isolation), lightly felt on the page. Secondary relationship pressure (Merrick) is off‑stage, muting crucible potential.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the sequence is clean: modification → activation → destabilization → interference → signal stops → social effects. Orientation is firm early, and the decisive change is on‑page (monitor goes dark) with an epilogue shard showing consequences. Cost is present but soft; the piece frames future danger more than an immediate price. Still, the closure reads earned and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The university radio station and vintage equipment are vivid and functionally tied to action (modified transmitter, antenna reach, subsonic capability). Sensory details (blue pulse, crackle) deepen atmosphere without bloating. The environment constrains and enables her choice credibly. Not quite 9‑band because setting doesn’t impose a hard constraint or penalty at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are explicit (stop perception manipulation) and pressure tightens once with the risky activation and unstable surge. The reversal (signal blinks out) is earned by her agency. The on‑page price is modest; danger is anticipated more than paid, keeping escalation short of searing. Tension holds well at sentence and beat levels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of manipulation, perception, and institutional denial arise from specific choices and images (alignments, back‑channel messages) rather than pure abstraction. Some lines edge toward expositional telling, but the final Charged Poise (preparing for the next phase) resonates without moralizing. Merrick’s late pivot hints at power reconfiguration, adding nuance. The aftereffect is thoughtful more than gut‑punch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, with a controlled, slightly elevated register that suits a scientist under stress. No dialogue appears, avoiding contamination; the narrative cadence tightens during activation and breathes after. Occasional diction (“ethereal grit”) risks ornament but remains coherent. The perceptual signature is consistent if not highly idiosyncratic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly economical, with strong image work in the activation beat. There are a few purple or near‑redundant phrasings (“invisible fingers,” “cosmic tricksters playing humanity against itself”) and minor repetition. Information density stays decent, momentum rarely stalls. No major artifacts, but not razor‑honed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise blends familiar SF signals with a fresh subsonic‑interference tactic and a social‑division frame. The “cosmic tricksters” angle and radio‑station micro‑setting feel specific enough to avoid template fatigue. The ending’s shift to public awareness and academic rapprochement adds a mild twist. It’s solidly fresh without a truly surprising reconfiguration.</comment>
