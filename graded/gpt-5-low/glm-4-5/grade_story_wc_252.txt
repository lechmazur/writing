<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s yearning and “combative tenderness” are embodied through work-etched grace, the scrimshaw’s pull, and the final renunciation. Her motive—liberation from expectations—is consistent and intensifies toward the dive. The internal conflict (fear/hope) is present on the page, especially as the scrimshaw’s pieces reveal “aspects of herself.” A few abstract formulations (“true nature could find perfect expression”) slightly dilute the otherwise specific interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Global Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as a decisive transformation and resonant reconfiguration with cost. The chain—finds scrimshaw → text appears → whale call → detachment → island’s rise → dive—coheres and culminates on the page. Cost is legible: she leaves her shore-life behind and is taken with the island. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks mar the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sea-edge specificity (sublittoral fringe, cargo nets, mercury water, fog, whale song) is vivid and filtered through Mara’s body and work. The scrimshaw functions as object-as-setting that charges the final image and constrains choice. Environmental forces (tide, fog, depths) feel present, though not aggressively tactical. Strong atmospheric cohesion supports the mythic cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation vs. shore-bound expectation—is signaled and tightens as the object activates and the island appears. The decisive turn is the detachment sequence and the resulting option to dive, which forecloses her former life. The cost is credible and felt; escalation remains coherent under the accumulative lens. Slight softness in external pressure keeps it just shy of top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of self-recovery and remembering rather than remaking accrue through the island lore and the scrimshaw’s revealing fragments. The final submersion image reweights earlier emptiness with earned release. A few explicit lines (“where one’s true nature could find perfect expression,” and the closing aphoristic frame) edge toward stated thesis. Still, the whale-call ritual and dissolution imagery do most of the thematic work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person with maritime lexicon and measured cadence fits the tale’s mythic bent. Rhythm modulates well at the activation and dive beats. Diction occasionally leans abstract but largely remains sensory and character-filtered. No POV slippage or head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean sentences with strong image economy; the detachment passages carry momentum and clarity. Minor purple notes and a few familiar constructions surface but do not slow the close. Repetition (“where one’s true nature…”) and small phrasing tics are limited and not momentum-sapping. The final image is sharp and well-earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Whale-song-summoned island via scrimshaw feels fresh and integrated, and the post-violence world adds a subtle hue. The transformation’s logic is specific to this object and place, not generic magic. The frame could use the “violence impossible” premise more functionally, but the synthesis still feels singular. Risks are tasteful and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
