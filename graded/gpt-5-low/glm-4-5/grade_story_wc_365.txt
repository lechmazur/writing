<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear, specific drive (to uncover a withheld truth) and a distinct professional lens (“sensory map maker”) ground the POV. Interiority is embodied in tactile engagements with the shard and space, though contradictory impulses (risk vs. restraint) are only lightly dramatized. Agency surfaces in attempts to grasp the red shard and the door, but many transitions are summarized rather than pressured in-scene. The final Earned Stasis—accepting delay with renewed resolve—feels motivated but could carry sharper on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned transitions intensify toward the dream‑door, then deflate into a charged refusal as the shard dims. Orientation is clear early (abandoned repair bay; shard as vector), and set‑ups (forbidden weaving, cyclic spontaneity) pay off in the closing image. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with an evident constraint (power spent; revelation deferred). Some middle beats are told in montage, softening causal tightening, but the ending image still reconfigures options with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The repair bay is vivid and functionally dynamic: its alternate histories and the sudden appearance of the door make setting an active pressure. Detail selection (dust motes, tools mid‑project) works through POV bias, and the door’s emergence charges the final image. The shard as micro‑setting/tool constrains choices (heat prevents red shard; power drain). A few familiar visuals (“dust motes”) appear, but specificity predominates and serves action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is consistent, and pressure coheres around attempts to access withheld knowledge. The major tightening arrives when the shard heats to block the red shard and later when the dream‑door fades—both foreclose options and signal cost. However, escalation often occurs via summary of journeys rather than in-scene choices, moderating intensity. The final stance (try again tomorrow) is earned endurance but not a leap in consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, gatekeeping, and the ethical weight of knowledge surface through action (Archive prohibitions, shard’s protective refusal). Recurring images (shard warmth/dimming; alternating versions of the bay) accrue resonance and reweight the ending toward persistence over revelation. Occasional direct question lines verge on expository (“What importance did this hidden knowledge carry…”), diluting subtext. The closing image avoids a tidy moral while leaving a felt conceptual price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person voice suits the speculative texture and stays within the character’s perceptual range. Rhythm modulates effectively at the dream‑door and in the power‑spent ending. Some phrasing repeats (“cyclically and spontaneous” recurs awkwardly) and a few stock constructions appear, but control largely holds. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propelled, with strong image economy and minimal scaffolding. A few cliché textures and light repetition dampen freshness (“dust motes dancing,” reprise of “cyclically and spontaneous”), and some montage lines carry summary weight. Figurative language is mostly coherent and not overstacked; syntax varies cleanly. The final line lands crisply without bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “sensory map maker” and object‑mediated multiverse give a familiar premise fresh inflection, especially via occupational lens and tactile constraints. The red shard repulse and the dream‑door are effective, non‑gimmicky turns. Still, much of the multiverse travel reads as genre‑familiar montage rather than a distinct new calculus. Solid craft and a few specific risks, but not a breakthrough synthesis.</comment>
