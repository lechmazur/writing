<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (repairing a broken bond) is clear, embodied (“quartz eye ache,” sore fingers), and tied to concrete micro‑choices (opening the bag, building the bridge, planting the seed). Her feistiness appears in action (“challenged even empty spaces”) and persistence. Internal contradiction (guilt vs. hope) is present but often summarized rather than dramatized in live friction. The final choice—planting the seed—feels earned with a felt cost (labor, vulnerability), if somewhat gently rendered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp early (abandoned cathedral with orchard; mender with a quartz eye). The closure lands through a resonant reconfiguration: footprints/vanished ribbon/left seed reweight her project with real stakes, and her watering with tears shows cost. The turns are quiet and off‑stage, but the because/therefore chain of her actions → bloom → seed sustains coherence under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cathedral‑orchard is vivid and integrated: apples in rafters motivate the bridge; stained glass light stages the reveal; moss pews and carved columns charge the final planting. The environment supplies resources and constraints (height of apples; floor for planting) rather than postcard backdrop. World rules (apples/bloom miracles) stay consistent and serve theme. Specific sensory cues support tone without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection) is established and tightened as Elara converts keepsakes into a bridge and returns to test the world’s answer. Escalation is modest but functional: craft → illumination → overnight bloom → footprints/seed, each reweighting hope and cost. Prices (physical fatigue, exposure of grief, surrendering the ribbon) are legible though understated. The off‑page return of the daughter softens direct pressure, keeping this shy of a higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Recurring images (apples, ribbon, mosaic, seed) support a clear theme of seasonal promises and enduring roots. The final act (planting the seed near ancestral names) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about tending lineage. However, explicit thesis statements (“Some vows are deciduous, but roots remain”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. When the piece trusts image over declaration, it’s affecting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is steady and credible; the voice blends practical tactility (bent nails, porcelain shards) with gentle lyricism. Diction fits character and world; the brief dialogue line reflects her temperament. Occasional abstraction (“wisdom will connect across generations”) nicks the edge. Overall rhythm and stance are controlled and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and image‑dense without collapsing into purple; sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum. A few conceptual repeats (“deciduous vows” phrasing, theme restatements) add slight scaffold. Figurative logic holds, and information density is good. Final images are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The quartz‑eye mender in a cathedral‑orchard is a fresh synthesis, and the craft‑as‑bridge conceit feels lived, not gimmicky. The footprints/seed swap is a graceful, low‑volume turn. Some thematic framing leans familiar, tempering the risk. Still, the piece commits to its inventive premise with integrity.</comment>
