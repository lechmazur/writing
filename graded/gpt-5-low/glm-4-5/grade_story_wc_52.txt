<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clara’s motives and contradictions are clear: she’s “hauntingly practical” yet living with ghosts, channeling grief into carving under a self‑imposed clock. Embodied actions (testing the grain, first tentative cut, stopping with a serene lion) reveal her. The endurance at the end (choosing to keep making, “holding differently”) feels earned. Slight limitation: the pressure never forces a sharper micro‑tradeoff beyond attention and patience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: kettle as clock, rain patterning, and carving density build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The cost—ongoing grief accepted as practice—lands on the page when she places the lion with its “brothers” and names it “Here and gone.” Orientation is crystal‑clear early and never falters. The closure is resonant if quiet; a touch more pressure would have pushed it into the 9s.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The loft, rain‑beaded skylight, ash wood, and kettle are vivid and filtered through Clara’s sensibility. The environment and tools shape the scene’s possibilities: the boiling window constrains action; the carving tools charge the final image. Weather evolves (streaks to constellations) and mirrors internal change without blunt symbolism. Strong object‑as‑setting integration elevates the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent: contain what matters within the boil, continue living with loss by making. Pressure tightens via the kettle’s crescendo and the shift from tentative to confident cuts; the scream marks a peak beat. The price is quiet endurance and the foreclosed path of avoidance. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than decisively narrowing options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of presence/absence and “holding differently” accrue through particular images (mane, kettle’s clock, rain constellations) and reweight at the end. Subtext runs chiefly in object work and selection, not dialogue. One line edges toward thesis (“not the lesson of letting go, but of holding differently”), slightly reducing the feltness in favor of statement. Nonetheless, the final image resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythms modulate with pressure (from hush to kettle scream). Diction fits Clara’s sensibility and craft. Small blemish: the stray “指纹” moment jars the voice. Otherwise, stance and psychic distance remain steady and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished, sensory‑dense, and mostly efficient; images often carry multiple jobs. Occasional purplish lean and a minor redundancy do not swamp clarity. The “指纹” intrusion is a copy artifact that dents finish. Momentum holds, though a few lines state what images already imply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Widow of a lion tamer carving lions under a boiling‑kettle clock is a fresh synthesis that avoids template grief moves. Recurring objects are used with intention, and the “hauntingly practical” lens feels singular. The piece doesn’t risk a structural wild card, but it commits fully to its quiet, textural design. Emotional truth outweighs novelty and lands cleanly.</comment>
