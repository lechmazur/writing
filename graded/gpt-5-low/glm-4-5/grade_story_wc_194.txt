<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—he intends to reveal a hidden truth and acts toward it with focused competence. However, there’s little internal contradiction or visible cost; calm confidence (“heart steady”) undercuts pressure. Micro‑choices exist (positioning, fine‑tuning, approaching the compartment), but they don’t test him emotionally. The earned change is external (document found) more than internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: tuning the gramophone produces resonance, which triggers the ceiling glow and opens the hidden compartment, delivering decisive knowledge. Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when are clear), and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (truth obtained), but the cost is deferred and mostly conceptual; tomorrow’s council is off‑page. The drive lens reads primarily causal with light accumulative texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: “sepia reading room,” gaslight, ceiling carving as a disguised city map, and floorboards that physically yield are integrated with action. The gramophone and room function as a micro‑setting constraint, directly enabling the outcome. Sensory selection supports tone without devolving into a museum tour. World rules (modified gramophone/standing waves) are internally consistent for this piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (uncover the dynasty’s secret) and the pressure tightens as he dials toward resonance and the room begins to respond. Still, conflict feels low‑friction: no real obstacle challenges commitment or forces a trade‑off. The “thin veil” timing adds atmosphere more than pressure. The decisive beat is earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—truth via resonance versus power via deception—emerges organically through the gramophone method and charged images. However, direct statements (“truth would finally reign”) flatten subtext at the end. The final image (shadows following him) carries some resonance but lacks a felt price. Insight is present but a shade declared rather than discovered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close third with controlled diction; no head‑hopping and a stable stance. The perceptual signature favors tactile precision and ritual calm; cadence suits the solemn task. Occasional phrase repetition (“eloquently silent,” “bridge of intuition”) brushes redundancy but doesn’t break voice. Compression through action beats keeps it legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and rhythmic with purposeful imagery; mechanical errors are absent. Some purple tint and paraphrase tendencies (“eloquently silent” twice; declarative thematics) modestly slow momentum. Figurative density is mostly coherent, though a few lines tell what the images already show. Overall clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The gramophone‑as‑resonance‑key is an inventive angle; the carved ceiling map and timing add a fresh patina. The hidden‑document trope is familiar, but the sonic method personalizes it. The final reweighting (truth as frequency) is memorable if not radical. Risk is moderate and coherent.</comment>
