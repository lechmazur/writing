<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to recover memories is clear and consistent, with tactile, character‑specific actions (charting stars, touching mushrooms) revealing her under pressure. The tremble/caution vs. determination offers a mild internal tension, though the struggle feels relatively unopposed. Her folklorist competence informs choices without sliding into exposition. The change to “whole again” reads earned, if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clean, and the causal chain holds: study → alignment of seventh shape → visions → reinterpretation → reclamation. Closure lands on the page via a decisive act (touching each mushroom) and a conceptual reframe of “thieves” as preservers. The cost is largely retrospective (decades lost) rather than felt in the peak beat, trimming impact. Still, the sequence is coherent and satisfying at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse, shipwreck ring, and fairy ring are vivid, idiosyncratic, and filtered through Elara’s professional eye. Environment materially shapes the mechanism (sky–earth alignment) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful, not touristic, and evolves with action. Strong integration without overdescription.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming memory) is clear and tightens when the ring pulses and the seventh alignment triggers visions. The escalation is gentle and primarily knowledge‑driven; opposition is minimal, so the price feels conceptual more than dramatic. Agency is present in the comparison work and the deliberate touching sequence. A sharper on‑page cost or constraint would have deepened tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Folklore-as-memory, preservation vs. theft, and the reweighting of myth emerge organically from events and images (broken constellations, ring). However, late explicit statements (“folklore wasn’t just story…,” “The memory thieves hadn’t been cruel…”) lean toward thesis, softening subtext. The final image resonates but edges into moralizing summary. The conceptual repricing still lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical cadence suited to a seasoned folklorist’s perception. Diction is precise without register drift; patterned images (broken constellations, mushrooms) are handled cleanly. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Slight explanatory tilt near the end tempers the otherwise confident voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong nouns/verbs and efficient sensory economy; lines often do double duty. Minor redundancy and a few summarizing sentences in the final third slow momentum. Figurative language stays coherent; rhythm varies well. The ending’s tell‑leaning lines lightly dull the peak image’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks and the broken‑constellation method feel fresh, and the “memory thieves as caretakers” turn is a smart, humane reframing. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight given the sky–earth mirroring. While the recovery is somewhat easy, the conceptual twist and setting specificity deliver notable ingenuity. Risk‑taking is controlled rather than flashy.</comment>
