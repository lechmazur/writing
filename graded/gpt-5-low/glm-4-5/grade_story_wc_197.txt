<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mara’s goal and competence are clear and her micro‑choices (using the TrueComm key, deploying cables, following the puddle‑map) align with a resourceful, underestimated rebel. Interiority is serviceable but thin; she rarely exhibits contradictory impulses or degradation under stress. Theodor adds a light relational crucible but exerts limited pressure beyond exposition and a prompt. The ending stance—grim resolve—feels earned but low‑cost emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Stakes and anchors are clear quickly; the sequence (patrol escalation → puddle map → lagoon access via key → transfer under alarms → escape) tracks cleanly. Closure lands on the page: the archive is liberated/transferred as alarms close in, a Decisive Change with a conceptual cost (exposure, pursuit). The cost could be sharper on the page, but the chain of “because/therefore” holds without contradictions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The auric lagoon, the hidden podium, and the relic key are specific, tactile, and integrated into action, not just backdrop. The environment constrains choices (waterfront approach, hidden keypad, vaults below) and charges the final image (faces reappearing on the golden surface). Selective sensory details (bruised dusk, liquid gold) deepen atmosphere without stalling momentum. World rules remain coherent within the piece’s frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates plausibly: increased patrols, changing protocols, alarms at the climax. Mara’s agency drives the turn and resolution, and the live clock (dawn) plus discovery raise stakes. However, options never feel truly narrowed by a concrete loss or failure, and the escape is smooth, muting cost. The tightening is present but mild at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Memory versus erasure, indifference versus attention, and “coded freedom” recur through concrete images (reflections, the key, reappearing faces). The final image reweights earlier motifs, but the text slips into explicit moralizing (“first crack in their wall of indifference,” “foundation for rebuilding”), dulling subtext. Still, the thematic thread is coherent and earned through events rather than solely declared. Resonance lingers more conceptually than emotionally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident; the voice balances lyric description with forward motion. Dialogue is brief, functional, and distinct enough to serve plot without strain (“Only those with TrueComm keys can bypass it now”). Occasional register lift fits the dystopian, reflective mode. Minor odd lexeme artifacts aside, focalization stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is generally clear and rhythmic, with efficient propulsion through the action beats. However, there are artifact intrusions and garbles (“вони laughedнебр,” “toward theحراج'”) that jar clarity and tone. Some phrases edge toward purple or redundancy, and a few declarative theme lines flatten energy at the end. Tightening diction and scrubbing glitches would materially elevate the piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise uses familiar dystopian elements but freshens them with the puddle‑map, the auric lagoon, and the TrueComm relic as a literal key to memory. Turns arise from established specifics rather than late rule drops. The ingenuity lies in the nature‑coded guidance and the image of histories reappearing on water; still, the macro design remains conventional. Solid synthesis with a few distinctive inflections.</comment>
