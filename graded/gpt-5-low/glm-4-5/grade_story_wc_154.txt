<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive—to help Lina metabolize grief through “translation”—is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices (reading the cast, whispering, returning the coral) align. Interiority is specific (conflict‑zone translator lens) and embodied through how he handles the coral and cast. The internal contradiction is gentler than ideal (competence vs. ache), leaving limited friction. Still, the final renunciatory poise reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds from coral to smudged lines to the whispered promise, landing in a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is firm early (hospital atrium at twilight; Kaelen and Lina). The cost is conceptual/emotional—accepting reconfigured presence in loss—which is legible on the page. A clean single-scene cadence shift occurs in the final placement of the coral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mist‑clad atrium and the brain coral are vivid and POV‑filtered; the coral functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image. Tropical plants, mist, and twilight entwine with his role, giving atmosphere without list‑tour excess. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choice, the object’s return tactically seals the ending. Economy and specificity are strong for the length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—helping the child articulate grief tonight—is coherent and signaled early. Escalation is a textural deepening: deciphering the cast’s lines narrows interpretation and compels the whispered reframing. The price is subtle but present: he assumes the burden of hope while acknowledging death’s persistence. Pressure doesn’t sharply tighten, but the cadence shift is sufficient for this mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance arises from concrete particulars (coral, smudged notes, twilight), and the final act reframes absence as translation. However, thematic statements are sometimes declared (“His mission here was clear: to graft new meaning...”), edging toward sermonizing. The piece largely avoids sentimentality, but a few lines articulate the thesis rather than letting images carry it. The afterimage lingers despite those overt notes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close sustains a distinct perceptual signature tied to the translator’s profession. Diction is elevated but consistent with the chosen voice and scenario; no head‑hopping. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well from observation to the gentle final act.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong sensory texture and purposeful repetition (coral, mist, smudge). Some lines over‑explain theme or double a point (“shared anxieties,” “mission was clear”), creating light redundancy and faint purple edges. Information density remains high and syntax varied. The final image is clean and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The translator‑as‑meaning‑maker frame in a hospital atrium with a brain coral is fresh and well synthesized. “Decrypting a child’s cast” is a striking, specific tactic that lifts the concept above familiar war‑and‑grief tropes. The arc is quiet but singular in imagery logic. A touch more risk in on‑page conflict would push this toward exceptional.</comment>
