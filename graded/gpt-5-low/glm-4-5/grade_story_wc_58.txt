<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority with credible contradiction: his “projection of presence” is both gift and defense. Micro‑choices (unfolding the thread, turning from the gardener to himself) align with motive and reveal cost. Occasional abstract phrasing (“geography of healing”) distances feeling slightly. The earned turn to writing his own obituary lands as a believable, costly shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: details and motifs densify until the choice to write his own obituary reconfigures meaning (RR/CR). Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the palace thread persists as a constraint in the final image. Cost is legible in facing long‑avoided grief and culpable absence. Minor declaratives don’t undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The autumn garden and sensory palette are vivid and POV‑filtered, with the thread functioning as a charged micro‑setting. Environment doesn’t physically constrain but meaningfully charges the final image and tactility (scent, decay, starlight). Scale feels proportionate and consistent. A few echoes verge on symbolism overtly stated but remain effective.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: can he move from writing others’ obituaries to confronting his own absence. Pressure coheres and tightens via a meaningful deepening (from gardener’s elegy to self‑reckoning). The felt price is vulnerability and relinquishing a protective tactic. Escalation is quiet but clear under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of absence → presence and wound → path emerges through recurring objects and actions, not merely assertion. The thread’s shift from “anchor/burden” to “compass” reweights the whole. Some lines state thesis a touch on‑the‑nose (“mapping the geography of healing”), tempering subtlety. The final image invites reflection without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third with lyric texture and confident cadence; diction matches the meditative mode. Rhythm modulates as the pen “moves faster,” mirroring interior acceleration. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Elevated register is consistent with this character’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are polished, sensorial, and largely economical; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Minor repetition (“geography of healing,” “projection of presence”) slightly blunts freshness but doesn’t stall momentum. Sentence variety supports flow from hush to quickening. No mechanical or clarity errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living paired with a war‑salvaged thread—is fresh and integrated. The final repricing of the thread as compass feels earned and specific. Risks are taken in a quiet, lyric register without gimmickry. Slight conceptual labeling keeps it short of singular brilliance.</comment>
