<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena’s goal and tactics are clear and character‑specific (the rhythmic “quiet rebellion” becomes her method of escape and summoning). Interiority is embodied through touch, rhythm, and the garden’s sensory feedback, though contradictory impulses are muted—she rarely hesitates. The cost is felt as temporariness and risk rather than a concrete consequence. Relationship texture with Theo is moving but largely one‑sided in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: drumming creates the four‑minute blackout → corridor unlock sequences → tower performance → lagoon manifestation → systems return. Closure lands as a charged poise: brief reunion achieved with the cost of imminent loss and institutional pressure. The Hybrid lens holds (causal spine with textural crescendo in the garden). No orientation debt; anchors are early and consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and Resonance Tower are not decorative; they constrain tactics and enable the summoning bridge of sound/light, then charge the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered (vibrations as flora, ripples from footsteps). World rules are taught through action rather than dumped. The setting’s properties directly contour the climax.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconnection with Theo—tightens via the engineered blackout and the mounting performance on the tower. The main turn is Elena’s successful creation of the lagoon and Theo’s partial return, immediately counterweighted by the systems reboot. Costs are emotional and situational rather than punitive, but they’re legible. Pressure coheres without reliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Recurring images (drumming, auric lagoon, inhaling universe) accrue into a resonant meditation on defiance and love. One line edges into thematic exposé (“separation becomes merely an illusion…”), dulling subtext at the brink of closure. The ending still reweights the premise through image rather than moral. Earned melancholy avoids sentimentality overall.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close‑third with a tactile, rhythmic perceptual signature that tightens under stress. Scientific diction (“neural entanglement,” “containment cell”) integrates with voice and doesn’t jar. Minimal dialogue is apt and purposeful. Distance control is steady with no leakage or head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with clean rhythm; images are fresh and mostly disciplined. A few flourishes verge on purple but remain legible; no looped scaffolding or cadence templates stall momentum. The final cadence lands crisply on an image. Syntax and mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound‑as‑landscape and rhythm‑as‑key synthesize into a distinctive speculative conceit. The lagoon reprise is an earned, fresh turn; entanglement made tactile through performance feels new. While some tropes are familiar (corporate experiment, vanished subject), execution and imagery elevate them. Risk‑taking is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
