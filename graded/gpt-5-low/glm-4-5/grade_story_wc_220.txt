<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s motive (translate distance into closeness/find Elara) is clear, consistent, and drives his choices. His “bloodhound” perceptual angle personalizes interiority, especially in decoding the grooves. However, internal contradiction and on‑page emotional struggle are light; he rarely wavers or pays a visible interpersonal price. The final endurance/change is credible but low-friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The chain—riddle → leaf-filtered decoding → markers → coordinate reveal → course correction → reunion—holds cleanly and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing/resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is solid from the opening and the recurring object integrates the rule set. Cost at closure is more implied (ordeal and renunciation of safety) than dramatized, keeping it out of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scrapyard/wasteland textures and the phonograph/leaf micro‑setting are vivid and purpose‑driven. The environment and tools meaningfully constrain reading tactics (leaf as spectrum filter, cylinders as maps) and charge the final image. Sensory selection aligns with Silas’s professional bias. Pressure from the landscape is more atmospheric than obstructive, but specificity remains strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (find Elara/home) and there is one meaningful tightening at the coordinate reveal that forces a course change. Yet the journey is largely summarized without obstacles testing commitment, and no live trade‑off is dramatized on the page beyond leaving the settlement. Tension stays gentle; pressure coheres but barely escalates. The resolution feels earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—knowledge vs proximity, distance redefined—emerges organically through the decoding method and the reunion image. The leaf/groove motif shifts meaning at the end, but the explicit line “Home is not a place...” flirts with moralizing. Resonance lingers due to the charged objects and final poise, though complexity is kept safe. Capped by limited escalation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (“bloodhound eyes,” salvage lexicon) sustains tone without head‑hopping. Rhythm and diction are consistent and modulate with gentle pressure. Purposeful elision works; there’s minimal filter-verb drag and no dialogue to test. Minor repetition (“wild hush,” “tinted revelations”) doesn’t break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and economical; several lines do double duty with world and theme. Momentum holds despite summary passages. Some phrasing loops and explicit theme statements soften the edge, but no figurative muddle or scaffold obscures causality. The final image lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑war scrapyard, phonograph grooves as secret text viewed through a waxed leaf, a tracker’s spectral perception—feels fresh and coherent. Turns arise from established logic; nothing arrives late to save the day. The reunion is familiar, but the method and objects make it particular. Risk is modest but confident; the concept’s integrity carries it.</comment>
