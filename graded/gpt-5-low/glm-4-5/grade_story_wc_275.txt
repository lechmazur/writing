<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhiannon’s motives (to nurture amid collapse, in tension with her bounty-hunter lineage) are clear and consistent, with tactile choices like tending cuttings and repurposing the sandbag. Interiority is specific—humidity shifts, withered petals—yet the internal contradiction remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized under present pressure. The “burden” of her perception is told more than felt in a hard choice. The ending registers an earned endurance rather than a costly turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds a pattern toward a quiet closure (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as she finishes work and affirms her path. Orientation is clean, and the recurring sandbag and roses culminate in a reweighted final image. Cost is soft—more conceptual than dramatized—so the closure lands modestly rather than decisively. The single-scene coherence holds but lacks a pressing turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert heat, impossible-hued roses, and condensation “breathing” create a vivid, integrated environment filtered through her horticultural focus. Setting touches tactics (humidity, enclosure, material for cuttings) and shapes tone. It charges the final image but stops short of constraining a specific choice under pressure. Economy and specificity are strong with minimal tourist detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintaining a sanctuary of values post-collapse) is clear but faces limited on-page resistance. The most concrete tightening is the act of working with a new cutting and reassigning the sandbag’s meaning—more deepening than escalation. No option is foreclosed in scene, and the price is largely inherited rather than tested. Tension stays atmospheric rather than situational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of repurposing violence into care and weaving continuity through chaos resonate through objects and actions (sandbag, roses, “engraved quiet”). However, several lines state the thesis outright (“Her greatest achievement was not in the roses themselves…”) which blunts subtext. The final image still carries a genuine, quiet aftereffect. Complexity is present but not contested on the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, confident, and sensorially selective to a gardener’s mind; lyric without losing legibility. The POV’s certainty stays plausible and modulates with calm, attentive rhythm. No head-hopping or artificial elision. Slight abstraction creeps in at times but doesn’t fracture control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong cadence and image density; lines often do double duty (world, theme, character). A few abstract assertions and near-repetitions (“weave continuity through chaos,” “reminders of what humanity could be”) slow momentum. Figurative texture stays coherent with only light purple inflections. Final line lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-collapse horticulture that “inculcates” virtues, an airship sandbag turned cradle for resilience, and the coined “engraved quiet”—feels fresh and owned. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but they cohere. The originality comes from specific reassignments of purpose rather than a twist. It stops short of transformative escalation that would vault it higher.</comment>
