<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and particular—she risks herself so stories can flow, and the dust-tech discovery personalizes her mission. Interiority is steady but low-contradiction; we don’t see a live push-pull under pressure in the broadcast moment. Micro-choices (tuning, lyric crafting, packing) align with motive but aren’t tested by an on‑page counterforce. The earned endurance at the end reads credible, if quiet, with cost implied rather than felt in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear single-POV arc with an accumulative lens: prep → broadcast → reflection, closed by a charged poise image (dust whispering on). Orientation is strong from the opening (copyist, alcove, radio) and the world‑rule is taught early. Closure lands conceptually rather than causally; the cost is mostly stated (danger, censors) not stress‑tested in the present. Still, the ending reweights the premise with a coherent before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and selective—the ember alcove, mist, dial glow, and dust shimmer integrate with action and theme. The alcove as hiding spot and the bowls-of-water method tie environment to tactic. World rules (dust carrying stories) are explained cleanly and consistently. Final image of dust in moonlight meaningfully charges the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (defying the Narrative Control Bureau), but on‑page pressure is low; no complication or near‑discovery tightens her choices mid‑scene. The meaningful turn is mostly the start/finish of the broadcast, with cost implied rather than dramatized. The “cloaking” tactic is smart but meets no active resistance in the moment. Resolution is an endurance stance rather than a tested trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—stories as lifeblood and resistance—emerges through particulars (radio, dust, famine) rather than sermonizing. The dust mechanic bridges idea and action, creating resonant subtext about memory, residue, and voice. The ending image offers a non‑literal answer (quiet revolution persists) without a moral. Slight explanatory heaviness around the dust science trims the mystery a touch.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent, confident third-person with a lyrical yet controlled cadence. Diction coheres with the character’s sensibility; images recur purposefully (glow, mist, dust). No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Minor repetitiveness in explanatory passages tempers music under peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lines are mostly tight, with purposeful imagery and clean mechanics; rhythm varies. Some redundancy and adjective stacking (“thistled calm,” “secretly luminous,” repeated dust mechanism) nudge toward purple but don’t blur sense. Information density is good, though a few sentences tell what’s already shown. Final image lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dust-as-story medium via sound frequencies is striking and memorable, and the bowls-of-water release method feels fresh. Pirate-radio plus archival musician cover is a smart synthesis. The piece commits to its premise without gimmick; the quiet revolutionary tone fits. Limited on‑page antagonism prevents it from breaking into the topmost tier.</comment>
