<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s motives (self-forgiveness after her brother’s death) are clear and actions align (researching graffiti, descending to the tunnels, playing the accordion). Interiority is concrete and character‑specific, filtered through her river‑chronicler lens. Contradictory impulses surface (methodical caution versus surrender to grief), though a few theme-forward lines edge toward tidy realization. The final acceptance costs her emotionally and feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal spine: graffiti clues → tunnel → hidden river → music ritual; closure lands as an on‑page resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the surrender to grief and the relinquishing of numbing (tears joining the river). Orientation is strong and the single scene tightens cleanly toward the subterranean discovery. No major causality gaps or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station, bathroom graffiti, service tunnels, and the buried river are vividly rendered and discovered through purposeful action. The environment and the accordion (micro‑setting object) charge the final image and constrain available tactics (finding platform three’s tunnel via on‑site inscriptions). Sensory details stay POV‑driven, especially the auditory convergence of water and music. Strong economy avoids museum‑tour listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early; pressure coheres as research becomes embodied risk (descending into tunnels) and culminates in the ritual act. The tightening is credible and protagonist‑driven; the price is emotional exposure without chemical buffer. Lack of an antagonistic force limits external tension, but internal stakes escalate convincingly. The final act forecloses avoidance as a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of diversion, buried currents, and earned forgiveness are integrated through concrete motifs (railway vs. river, medication vs. grief). The closing images offer resonance without needing explicit moral. However, a few overt thesis-like sentences (“The train lines, like her medication, had been a diversion…”) slightly blunt subtext. Overall, the motif web still reweights prior material effectively at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with a textured, disciplined cadence that matches Elena’s mind and loosens at the end. Diction is consistent with her expertise and avoids head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Lyric turns are controlled and legible. Minor moments verge on aphoristic, but the voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly lean, with images doing multiple jobs (graffiti as archive, the accordion as grief‑object). One proofreading glitch (“Her市政府 papers”) and a few on‑the‑nose lines slightly mar the polish. Repetition is purposeful rather than looped, and rhythm varies well through the descent. Momentum holds without scaffolding bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—bathroom graffiti as clandestine cartography leading to a buried river and a grief-bridging musical rite—is fresh and specific. The accordion tie to the brother adds distinctive texture and necessity. While river-as-healing is familiar, the particular mechanics and setting elevate it. Risks taken are coherent and pay off in the final image.</comment>
