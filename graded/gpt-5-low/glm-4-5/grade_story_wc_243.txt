<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear interior drive—preserving “small moments”—is embodied in exacting ritual and the final renunciation. Contradictory impulses (“haunted euphoria”) act simultaneously and guide micro‑choices (mixing powders, timing the steep, drawing, sealing, leaving). The cost of endurance registers as obsolescence accepted with pain. Slight safety in always‑admirable competence limits the messiness of flaw under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the twilight‑to‑night cadence tightens toward a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis as he turns away from the jetty. Stakes are coherent (last analog act before digitization), and the ending image carries visible cost. Orientation is immediate and stable. Minor reliance on reflective assertion doesn’t undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is vivid and filtered through a professional gaze; objects (flowers, ink, journal, locket) are tactile and recurrent. The place both supplies resources (powdered flowers) and charges the last look back. Atmosphere deepens with the light’s fade, mirroring the archival transition. It stops just short of constraining tactics in a way that would lift it into the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates as daylight dwindles and “last act” urgency sets a soft clock. The tightening arrives via cadence shift to night and the sealing/packing, foreclosing a path. Cost is felt but the pressure remains largely internal and steady, with no serious test that forces adaptation beyond ritual control. The lack of a sharper on‑page pinch keeps it below higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Recurring images (walnut ink, locket, jetty flowers) accumulate to a resonant statement about memory and transformation. However, lines like “The regenerated covenant… is not between ink and paper, but between what was and what might be remembered” drift toward explicit thesis. The final turn reweights prior material effectively without a moral. Emotional aftertaste lingers as intended.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled lyric voice suits a meticulous archivist; diction (“proximate causes,” “regenerated covenant”) feels character‑plausible. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure, especially in the twilight-to-night glide. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Occasional abstraction edges toward authorial register but doesn’t fracture POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, with purposeful imagery and mostly efficient sentences. Some paraphrase/idea loops and purple inflections (reiterating “proximate causes,” “haunted euphoria”) slightly slow momentum. A few announcements of theme displace image when image would suffice. Clarity remains intact through the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archivist + botanical walnut ink + “regenerated covenant” offers a fresh inflection on art vs. digitization. The final charged departure feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are tasteful rather than bold, keeping within a familiar elegiac register. Distinct specifics prevent template drift.</comment>
