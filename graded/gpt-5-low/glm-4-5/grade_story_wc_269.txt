<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina’s motives (to witness, to understand “why some paths disappear”) are clear and consistent, with tactile habits (tapping, sleepless data work) grounding her interiority. The drift/moor contradiction gives her a credible internal tension that informs micro-choices. However, the pressure rarely forces a costly decision beyond acceptance; the arc leans contemplative over conflicted. Still, actions align with motives and culminate in an earned, quiet renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clues accrue (atlas, satellite data, tapping pattern) until a conceptual repricing lands (“Earth returning to a pre‑industrial state”). Orientation is swift and coherent, and the present‑tense observation frame is steady. Closure is on‑page with felt cost (foreclosed human “paths,” her role narrowed to witness). The structure is simple but purposeful, with one clean tightening during the sleepless discovery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sea level station, the continental shelf edge, the alarms, and the waves are integrated into action and outlook, not postcarded. The object-as-setting (atlas) and the environment charge the final image. While constraints are more atmospheric than tactical, the station’s tools and mooring meaningfully define her role and options. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a marine scientist’s priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—comprehending erasure—tightens through insomnia, pattern-matching, and the data/atlas interplay. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price is conceptual and personal (accepting loss and limits of human agency), but explicit foreclosed alternatives are minimal on the page. The final stance (logging data after repricing) reads as earned endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (paths, drifting/moored, delayed revelation, periodically eternal) cohere into a resonant meditation on change and stewardship. The ending reweights earlier images without sermonizing, though a few lines skirt direct thesis (“wasn’t merely rising tides…it was the Earth…”). Subtext lives in the witness posture versus urge to control. The rebirth/erasure paradox lands with honest ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close-third with a measured, marine-biased lexicon; rhythm modulates between lyric calm and analytic focus. No head-hopping or stance leakage; inferential certainty stays plausible for her expertise. Minor rhetorical restatements appear but do not cloud POV. The voice is distinctive without excess flourish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean sentences with purposeful cadence; images like “digital coastlines bled across paper ones” carry multiple loads. Occasional redundancy and abstract phrasing creep in, but momentum holds. Figurative language remains coherent to the ocean/data frame; no mixed metaphors that blur sense. The final line reprises rhythm and image effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of post‑ban climate witnessing, anachronistic atlas, and embodied tapping-as-analysis feels fresh. The conceptual pivot to “periodically eternal” cycles reclaiming human paths is non-trivial. While not radical, the integration reads authentic and specific to this character and station. The piece avoids template dystopia in favor of textured, scientific lyricism.</comment>
