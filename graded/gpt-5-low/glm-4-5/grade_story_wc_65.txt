<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (protect the villagers by mapping the future), and competence reads consistent with her role. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she doesn’t wrestle on the page with doubt versus duty beyond a stated resolve to “prevail over skepticism.” Emotions skew told rather than embodied, with limited sensory stress in the body. The final act (completing the map) is earned but pays little visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure gathers around the suspended moment before writing, culminating in a charged completion. Orientation is immediate and clear; the scene maintains a single window and stake. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she writes the map and accepts vigilance, but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized. The “cracks forming” gives a light on‑page tightening without a reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid and purposeful; the spire’s “amplifying” function and aerial vantage inform her action. The kingfisher quill becomes a charged object that bookends the scene. Sensory detail privileges sight but is generally well filtered through her vocation. Setting impacts options modestly rather than constraining them decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear (timely map to avert spring danger), yet escalation remains mostly declared. The only on‑page tightening is noticing cracks that align with predictions; no option is truly foreclosed or traded at cost. Internal and external pressures align but never clash to force a morally sharp choice. Resolution follows intention without testing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of innovation within constraint and the ethics of prediction emerge coherently from her practice and the community’s reliance. Some lines drift into thesis‑speak (“Her purpose was clear: to write the future”), reducing subtext. The final image reaffirms transformation and stewardship but avoids a reweighting with palpable cost. Resonance lingers, if quietly, more as affirmation than reconsideration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A steady close third with a clean, slightly formal lyric register suits the premise. Occasional academic diction (“predictive modeling,” “geological markers”) integrates with the quasi‑mystical tone. Rhythm is controlled, with a few repetitive sentence stems but no head‑hopping or stance slips. No dialogue is present to test voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong images (“dark tooth,” iridescent quill), and the lines carry momentum. There are minor paraphrase/redundancy loops (reiterating “groundedly imaginative,” “seed innovation within a constraint”) and some tell‑leaning scaffolds. Figurative density is mostly coherent, not purple, and mechanics are clean. The final line is tidy rather than cutting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Ignorance cartographer” plus a spire‑augmented predictive practice is a fresh synthesis. The conceptual frame (writing the future) is distinctive and integrated, though the dramatic arc is conservative. Specifics (kingfisher quill, seven‑degree shift) add texture and credibility. Greater risk at the pressure peak would elevate ingenuity from premise to execution.</comment>
