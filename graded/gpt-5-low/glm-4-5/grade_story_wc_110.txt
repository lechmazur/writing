<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Elara’s ethical drive is clear and consistent, and her renunciation of the lens reads as a character choice. However, interior conflict is largely narrated rather than embodied; her temptation and struggle feel tidy and low-friction. The line “test of her own integrity” states the arc instead of dramatizing it. More sensory embodiment under pressure would deepen the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: discovery → revelation → ethical decision → new practice. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/renunciation with a soft cost (foregoing power) and a reconfigured communicative tactic. Causality is simple and a bit convenient (hidden chamber, abundant lenses), but coherent. The cost at the end is felt conceptually more than viscerally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” is vivid and tonally integral; raindrop “murmurs” and moonlit surfaces enrich atmosphere. The setting facilitates the find (projector booth, hidden chamber) and charges images, though it rarely constrains action. Details stay coherent and filtered through Elara’s role. Strong mood, moderate functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transparency vs. privacy—tightens when the lens reveals private lives and the map leads below. The key turn is Elara choosing restraint; however, opposition remains abstract, and the price of refusing power isn’t sharply felt in scene. Escalation is more conceptual than pressured. The community thaw arrives smoothly, lowering tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of honesty beyond words is coherent and supported by recurring images (lens, doodles, hush). Yet several lines state the thesis outright (“true communication needs no words”), tipping into moralizing and reducing subtext. The final repricing favors clarity over complexity. The piece invites reflection but avoids thornier ambiguities of consent and surveillance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a calm, luminous cadence that fits the hush. Diction is controlled and mostly within the POV’s plausible lexicon; no head‑hopping. Occasional expository declarations flatten voice at peaks. Rhythm remains steady, with modest modulation at the discovery and renunciation beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and fluent with some elegant images; repetitions are minimal. A few abstract formulations and summary moves dilute immediacy, especially around the moral turn. Figurative language stays coherent, if slightly on the nose. Momentum holds without major loops or scaffolding bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The projector lens revealing doodles in a post‑verbal society is a fresh synthesis, and the hidden chamber expands the premise intriguingly. The ethical renunciation is admirable but safe, avoiding riskier, messier consequences. Still, the atmosphere-plus-tool blend feels distinct. The final image of the waiting lens carries a gentle, memorable charge.</comment>
