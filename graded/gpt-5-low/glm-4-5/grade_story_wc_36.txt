<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (atonement through insight) drives embodied micro‑choices (selecting driftwood, seating within the spiral, breath control on the flute). Pride vs. humility is dramatized via visions rather than told only. The transformation reads earned, though the emotional resolution leans a touch tidy. Tears and the ritualized return of the driftwood register cost credibly at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound, arrangement, and vision density build toward a reconfiguration where power is repurposed for healing. Orientation is early and clean, and the ritual sequence escalates coherently. Closure lands on the page with cost (grief released, relinquishment of old stance, object reweighted). No causality breaks; the because/therefore of the ritual’s stages reads motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Thunder‑echo range’s acoustics and telluric fissures meaningfully enable tactics and charge images; the flute and driftwood function as setting-objects that constrain and shape choices. Sensory detail is purposeful (echo behavior, pearlescent air) and filtered through Eldrin’s ritual focus. World rules stay consistent and are taught through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem failure by harvesting insight) tightens as the ritual shifts from a single note to glows/visions and a final relinquishment. Pressure is internal but escalates credibly via the ritual’s intensification and the confrontation with pride. The cost is largely emotional and conceptual; external stakes remain minimal, keeping the ceiling just shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of renouncing mastery for healing emerges through particulars (echoing mountains, glowing markers, returning driftwood). However, the final paragraph edges into overt moralizing (“To harvest insights from failure…”) that states what the images have shown. Subtext is present but occasionally overridden by explicit articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical cadence suited to a ritual scene; diction and rhythm modulate with intensity (from hush to pearlescent thinning). No head‑hopping or stance slips; certainty remains within Eldrin’s plausible perception. Elevated register feels voice‑justified for a former relic keeper.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Polished lines with strong image economy; rhythm varies and momentum holds. A few phrases trend purple or abstract (“washing away months of accumulated guilt,” some moralizing), and recurrence of coined descriptors risks slight redundancy. Overall, clarity and propulsion outweigh the occasional flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Relic‑keeper plus sound‑based liminality is familiar, but the driftwood‑spiral method and echo‑terrain integration feel fresh. The reweighting of the flute from control to bridge adds a non‑obvious turn. Not groundbreaking, yet confident and specific enough to stand out.</comment>
