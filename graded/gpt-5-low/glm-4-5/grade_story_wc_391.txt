<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent (to launch a “patient revolution”), but interiority remains largely abstract with minimal embodied conflict. The mapper’s key choices—waiting for the zenith, charting resonance, deciding to share with elders—are calm rather than pressured. Contradictory impulses (vigilante vs. patient) are gestured at but not dramatized in a moment of strain. The ending’s stance is earned but low‑cost, reading more as resolve than sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: details build toward the moon‑zenith hum as confirmation and beginning. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when) and the single scene flows into dawn. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—confirmation of theory and a start—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt, limiting impact. No causal breaks, but pressure never meaningfully narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake as mirror/amplifier, and the magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered and filtered through the mapper’s vocation. Environmental features matter (basalt hum, lake reflection, magnetic alignment) and charge the final image. Detail is purposeful without museum‑tour excess. The setting does influence tactics, though not under crisis conditions.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (initiating the revolution via confirmation) is clear, with a single tightening at the zenith hum. However, there’s little on‑page price or foreclosed path; success does not force a trade‑off, and alternatives aren’t pressed. Tension is atmospheric rather than oppositional. Resolution is earned but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres—unyoking from urgency through celestial attention—and motifs recur (moon paths, mirror lake, restrained wildness). Some lines slide toward moralizing (“humanity’s greatest achievement”) rather than letting images carry the weight. The final cadence reweights prior images but avoids deep ambiguity or counter‑pressure. Resonance is present yet declared more than enacted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and diction is consistent with a lyric, observant mind; no head‑hopping. Rhythms vary enough to sustain tone, and the “restrained wildness” texture is well‑kept. A few abstractions flatten urgency, but voice remains coherent and controlled. No dialogue to test subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and image‑rich with good sensory layering (hum through basalt, lamp shadow, lake crack). Some redundancies and abstract assertions slow momentum in the final third. Figurative language is mostly coherent, with minimal purple drift. Information density is solid, though a tighter line edit could heighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—“vigilante horizon mapper,” magnetic viaduct after rain, patient revolution via moon paths—feels fresh. The premise is pursued with conceptual integrity, avoiding rote plot beats. The quiet closure suits the risk taken, even if costs remain largely conceptual. It stops short of startling inevitability but remains distinctive.</comment>
