<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—is clear and embodied through concrete ritual (knotting moon‑flower silk, affixing the moth wing). Interiority is specific (grandmother’s stories, the “interrupted cadence”) and felt rather than labeled. The internal conflict is subdued but present: grief and futility versus purposeful action. The ending’s earned stasis—choosing transient signals that will dissolve—carries a credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → ritual construction → charged release as the monarch departs. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise): “We see you” plus the wing‑beacon and the heartbeat’s brief harmony against inevitable dissolution. Orientation is swift and clean; cost is on‑page (signals will dissolve; Aris must depart). The throughline is cohesive without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating grotto, mist, orchids, and “cloudlight” are vivid and filtered through Aris’s priorities. Environment subtly constrains tactics—moon‑flower silk, wind‑driven impermanence—and charges the final image (signals catching starlight before dawn erases them). Sensory selection and world rules are consistent. Strong atmosphere supports theme without heavy‑handed symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving/marking a vanishing pattern) tightens from witnessing to making and finally releasing the signal. The decisive deepening is Aris attaching the moth wing, converting memory into a live beacon that draws acknowledgment. The cost is elegiac rather than sharp, but legible: a one‑night reprieve against irreversible loss. Tension is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and ritualized witnessing arise from particulars (amber‑trapped wing, dissolving structures) rather than abstract statements. The line “History isn’t just in books” flirts with didacticism but is counterweighted by image‑driven beats. The ending reweights the premise with a tender CR: honoring as a temporary, costly act that still matters. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical close third maintains a distinct perceptual signature (“cloudlight,” “blushing stillness”) and modulates cadence toward the final hush. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference stays within Aris’s ken. Rhythmic control under emotional pressure is confident. Diction is elevated but coherent with the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled, with strong image economy and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is mostly precise; repetition serves motif rather than padding. Momentum flows through sentence rhythm into a satisfying cadence at the close. Minor purple edges don’t blur sense or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: an “esoteric realist” making dissolving sky‑signals with a fossil wing to call the last monarch in a garden above clouds. The tactical use of moon‑flower silk and the beacon wing elevates beyond trope. Risks in tone and worldbuilding cohere and pay off in the charged final image. The piece commits to its quiet, high‑concept vision without hedging.</comment>
