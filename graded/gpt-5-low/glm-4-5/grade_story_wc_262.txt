<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena’s motive—locating and releasing “unused love”—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile engagement with the film. Interiority is specific to her craft (sprocket holes, silver halide), though her emotional trajectory faces little counter‑pressure or contradiction. The promise “I’ll give you voice again” lands as a credible, character‑driven pledge. Cost is present but light (a tear, reverence), limiting the depth of change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the psychometry reading intensifies until the realization that the love is stored “in the liminal spaces,” culminating in the choice to project the letters. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise with on‑page cost (bittersweet recognition, vow, threading the projector). Orientation is early and clean (vintage projection booth, red light, film), and there’s one effective cadence shift when the projectionists appear. Stakes resolve without contradiction, though the cost remains largely internal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly and economically rendered (dim red light, dusty beam, reel handling, sprocket holes), and the machinery charges the final image. The environment is not mere décor; it supplies the conduit through which the “letters” travel and frames her choice. Sensory focus aligns with POV bias (celluloid texture, lamp illumination). A touch more constraint (e.g., mechanical risk/cost) could have lifted it into the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether Elena can locate and release embedded emotions; escalation is a density deepening rather than adversarial conflict. The turn arrives when past projectionists manifest and the “letters” are recognized as fused to the film, prompting the decision to project. Costs are gently felt rather than sharp; the scene forgoes a harder trade‑off or external resistance. Still, the tightening is legible and earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—love preserved in liminal spaces and art as conduit—emerges through objects and action (film chemistry, pauses before illumination). The final image reweights prior motifs without needing overt moralizing, though lines like “She had been chosen for this work” and purpose declarations edge toward didactic. Subtext lives in tactile ritual and the cathedral‑like booth. Resonance lingers, even if a hair too declarative at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric, sensorial voice is consistent and confident, filtered through Elena’s craft‑specific noticing. Psychic distance remains stable; no head‑hopping or register slips. A few repeated constructions (“hushed thunder,” “forgotten lyrics”) flirt with pattern monotony but do not undercut voice control. Dialogue is minimal yet purposeful and in character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is often strong and image‑dense, with purposeful diction tied to film and light. However, figurative stacking and motif repetition (“forgotten lyrics,” “hushed thunder,” “spaces between”) create mild redundancy and purple pressure in places. Momentum is maintained, and syntax varies, but trimming echoes would heighten precision. No major clarity errors, just excess flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Psychometry of film as a repository for unsent letters and “unused love” is a fresh synthesis, and the liminal storage concept is striking. The booth‑as‑cathedral and chemistry metaphors feel specific rather than generic. Risks taken in lyric mode largely pay off, with a memorable final reconfiguration. Slight sentimentality prevents a higher tier, but the core premise is distinctive and cohesive.</comment>
