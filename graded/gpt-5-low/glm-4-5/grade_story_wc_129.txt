<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s longing to belong is clear, embodied in tactile craft and the risky search she initiates. Her agency (proposing the quest, engineering pulleys, carving the sigil) aligns with motive. Internal contradiction is mild; she moves fairly smoothly from isolation to connection without a sharp in‑scene self‑conflict. Still, the closing dedication reads earned by prior actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Proposal → group forms → search tactics → discovery → reinterpretation → dedication lands a clean RR/CR closure. Cost is present but soft (treacherous terrain, exhaustion, vulnerability) and could be sharpened. Orientation is strong from the outset; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: reeds become pulleys, obsidian walls constrain access, the arbor anchors meetings and closure. Sensory specificity (luminescent fluid, gem‑like fruit) supports tone and action. World rules hold and evolve through use. The final image is charged by place and object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (belonging) are clear and escalate via the risky, collaborative search culminating in the sigil’s revaluation. The tightening is more epistemic than perilous; pressure rises but rarely bites with concrete loss. The final act (etching/dedication) is a credible stance crystallization. A sharper on‑page price would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Belonging reframed from external validation to ancestral, mutual weave lands thematically through the sigil. The arbor’s reprise converts aesthetics into community, avoiding overt sermonizing save for a near‑moral line (“not to found beauty, but to found belonging”). Subtext hums in shared breath and synchronized work. Resonance lingers without complex counter‑readings.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elara’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are consistent and confident. The lone spoken line lands cleanly. Minor register excess is mostly voice‑motivated. POV stays stable, with no head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are often lush and purposeful, but density occasionally tips into purple (“luminescent ache” recurrence). A visible artifact (“沟通推进”) jars tone and clarity mid‑search. Some near‑duplicate emphases could be cut for tautness. Rhythm generally carries momentum despite ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, reed engineering, and sigil-as-land’s promise feel fresh and integrated. The pivot from elusive “tag” to ancestral weave is an elegant, non‑obvious reweighting. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, yet the synthesis holds. Not revolutionary, but distinctly imagined and sincere.</comment>
