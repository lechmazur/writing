<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya’s drive—curiosity aligned with a civil engineer’s pragmatism—clearly motivates each action, and her agency powers the plot. Interiority is particular enough (tactile engagement with consoles, methodical rerouting) though conflict is light and largely unopposed. The “stoic wonder” texture is consistent, but contradictory impulses or visible blind spots are minimal. The closing realization feels earned but carries limited cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: discovery → decision to restore power → labor → switch throw → lights → sextant inscriptions reprice the premise. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the scene holds as one continuous window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (terminal reframed as navigation of hope), though the on‑page cost is modest. The payoff honors set‑ups without teleports or late rule changes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is concrete and functional—dormant transformers, corroded circuits, the main concourse lights flickering like “stars.” Details are filtered through an engineer’s priorities, and the environment provides both constraint and resource. The sextant as micro‑setting/object charges the last image effectively. Sensory range is decent, with a bias toward visual and tactile that suits the task.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (revive a system as an equation for hope), and there is one meaningful tightening at the moment of the switch throw. However, opposition is minimal: no credible obstacle, failure, or trade‑off tests the commitment. The price (time, solitude, risk) remains largely implied rather than dramatized. As a result, escalation feels smooth rather than pressurized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The navigation/hope linkage embodied by the sextant and revived lights offers a tidy, resonant answer to the story’s question. That said, the theme is sometimes told (“equations for hope,” “maze of intentions”) rather than fully earned through subtext. The final conceptual repricing is satisfying but a touch declarative. Still, the image‑driven close lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is steady, lucid, and tuned to an engineer’s sensibility; diction is controlled and consistent. Rhythmic modulation around key beats (throwing the switch, lights coming alive) is effective. Some phrasing repeats (“maze of intentions”) and edges toward summary, but POV containment is solid. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with selective imagery (“stars awakening”) and purposeful verbs. Minor redundancies and abstract restatements appear, especially around the motif phrases, but do not stall momentum. Information density is good; scaffolding is minimal. The final line resolves by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The blend of derelict spaceport systems with an old sextant is a fresh juxtaposition, and the engineering process grounds the wonder. The “equations for hope” frame risks generic uplift, but the object‑charged reweighting helps. Turn beats arise from character choice rather than gimmick. It’s thoughtfully executed, if not radically new.</comment>
