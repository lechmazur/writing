<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s motives—curiosity, service, and guarded affection—consistently drive her choices, culminating in the earned decision to protect the captain’s secret. The contradiction between professional detachment and personal tenderness is present in action (decoding, then re‑hiding the diary). Stakes are interior and quiet, which softens the felt cost slightly. Still, her “silent promise” reads as a credible renunciation with emotional weight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the floor‑by‑floor structure tightens toward the light‑through‑goggles reveal and the decision to keep the secret. Causality holds: prior observation → new tactic → transformation → choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an implied cost of secrecy and complicity. Orientation is clear early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, elevator, and windows create a charged environment that tangibly enables the solution (scattered light) and frames the final image. The goggles function as a tool‑setting hybrid, constraining and enabling action. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elira’s priorities. The world’s rules feel consistent within the scene’s needs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering and ethically handling the captain’s truth—tightens with the clock of ascending floors and the mid‑scene inspiration at floor nine. The key turn is protagonist‑driven, and the ending forecloses disclosure with cost. Pressure remains gentle; no external counterforce tests her decision post‑revelation. Even so, the escalation reads coherent and sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Light, lenses, and altitude mesh with the theme of finding joy beneath duty’s anguish, and the final act embodies affectionate detachment without melodrama. Some lines edge into stated moral (“affirmed her belief…”) which dilutes subtext. The closing image still reweights prior material effectively. The thematic aftertaste lingers but could trust implication more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The close third is steady, with a measured lyric cadence that suits the reflective ascent and pays off at the reveal. Occasional register slips (“化作”; “hadn’t just solve”) nick polish and momentarily disrupt the otherwise consistent voice. Patterned floor markers modulate rhythm effectively. No POV leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and efficient, with images doing double duty (ice patterns mirroring cipher). Minor errors and a touch of redundancy in theme statements slow momentum. Figurative language is controlled, though a few lines veer toward abstraction. The final sentence lands cleanly and recalls earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Airship culture, an elevator‑clock structure, and a literal optical cipher feel fresh in synthesis. The revelation via specialized goggles is a smart, character‑fit turn rather than a gimmick. The piece risks a quiet, non‑confrontational resolution and makes it resonate. Familiar tropes (lost captain, secret love) gain individuality through the method and setting.</comment>
