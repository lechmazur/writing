<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and motive—rebuilding a self from overheard stories—feels coherent and lived-in. Micro-choices (pilgrimaging at low tide, pocketing and keeping the label, sheltering in containers) align with that drive. However, internal contradiction is stated more than dramatized; tension between reclaiming a past self and renouncing it rarely bites on the page. The final renunciation (“Who was I before… doesn’t matter”) lands but without a visible moment of pressure forcing it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early (palimpsest, tides, containers) and held through to a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean, and the ending reweights the premise: identity as lived exchange vs. paperwork. Cost is legible—ongoing erasure and solitude accepted as the price of the chosen path. The structure lacks a sharp mid-scene turn but achieves a meaningful cadence shift toward an earned stasis.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The port’s container maze and the tidal clock infuse image, constraint, and routine—shelter during rains, movement at low tide—so setting is more than backdrop. The poison label functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the character’s bias, avoiding postcard tourism. The environment’s pressure is steady rather than dynamically escalating, but it consistently guides action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—constructing a viable identity after bureaucratic erasure—is clear, and pressure coheres via tides, isolation, and the port’s indifference. Escalation is more deepening than turning; the significant tightening is the acceptance that the prior name no longer matters. The felt price is the ongoing namelessness and endurance rather than a fresh loss. Effective, if quiet, under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (palimpsest, tide, containers, poison label) meaningfully converge on a theme of identity as communal memory versus institutional record. The final image rephrases the central question without mechanistic tying-off. Some lines tilt into overt thesis (“identity is not what is written on paper”), blunting subtext. Even so, the piece invites reflection through concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric voice with controlled rhythm and lexicon suits the liminal subject. Perceptual signature (“palimpsest,” attention to tones rather than words) reads specific and owned. Modulation is measured, with a clear cadence shift at the end. Minor abstraction drift appears but doesn’t fracture POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong line control with purposeful repetition and efficient images; most sentences do more than one job. Occasional redundancies and abstract restatements (“all histories are erased eventually”) slightly damp momentum. Figurative language remains coherent to the maritime/industrial palette. The final lines land cleanly without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bureaucratic-death premise gains freshness through the port labyrinth, tidal clock, and the poison‑label talisman. The synthesis of accumulative identity and commerce’s steel geometry feels organic rather than gimmicked. While not radically new, the execution shows specific vision and a credible, singular stance. Risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
