<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (solve the temple before oxygen runs out) and a credible internal conflict (training vs compulsion) drive specific micro‑choices like inserting the vial. Embodied stress reads in tremors, alarms, and lung burn. A touch of lofty diction blunts the particularity of her interiority at peaks, but her final choice feels earned. The rescue’s neatness softens visible personal cost but doesn’t undercut motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant causal chain is clean: vial fit → door opens → capture → escape; the oxygen clock supplies persistent constraint. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (she secures the temporal vial) with cost legible in the alarm and ascension pain. Some convenience (perfectly shaped depression, swift deciphering) smooths friction and slightly lowers felt risk. Lens: Causal, held through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly and economically rendered, and the environment (pressure, carvings, mechanism, oxygen) guides tactics and charges the final image. The vial operates as an object‑as‑setting that constrains choices and suffuses the last beat. Sensory detail is strongly visual but purposeful; occasional purple notes don’t stall momentum. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (oxygen vs unlocking the temple) are signaled early; the key tightening is the choice to override survival training and commit to the mechanism. The cost is present in the oxygen alarm/burning lungs and the door resealing, foreclosing retreat paths. Escalation is mostly linear and clean rather than multi‑reversal, but at this length it suffices. Convenience lowers the grind of pressure slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Time, memory, and the desire to fix the ephemeral accrue through concrete images (luminous particles, vial microcosm) and culminate in a resonant final ascent. A few on‑the‑nose declarations (“This was it—the ephemeral harnessed”) flatten subtext. Still, the reweighting of “gathered hush” into a tangible medium offers an earned, reflective aftertaste. Ambiguity around the distress signal sender adds a faint, intriguing echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a confident, lyrical cadence that modulates under pressure; no head‑hopping. Diction sometimes reaches for grandeur but remains character‑filtered and legible. Compression at peak beats stays coherent. Absence of dialogue is appropriate and not missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clear and propulsive, with varied sentence rhythm and solid noun‑verb choices. Some purple stacking and repetition (“finality” twice; abstract intensifiers) slightly dilute sharpness. Occasional explanatory assertions could be trimmed to let images carry weight. No major loops or muddled metaphors impede closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blend of a perfume vial as temporal vessel in an abyssal temple is fresh and imagistically striking. Core tropes (lost civilization, puzzle‑door) are executed cleanly rather than subverted, with originality arising from the “gathered hush/time as liquid” conceit. The conceptual turn feels earned, if safe. Risk is moderate but coherent.</comment>
