<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motivation and embodied feeling (the jasmine, the cork’s warmth) ground Elias, but he faces minimal resistance and little internal contradiction. His “screaming tenderness” is vivid yet untested by a meaningful obstacle. Captain Morgan offers status pressure, not true opposition. The ending shows change, but at low cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: intent → whisper → sensed return → captain’s repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the captain concedes the soft approach. The cost is largely conceptual/emotional, not dramatized as a sacrifice. Causality is clean within the fable‑like logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and night‑blooming jasmine create an evocative, tactile micro‑setting that feeds the action. The garden and western side guide Elias’s movement and ritual. The vial cork operates as a charged object‑as‑setting in the final image. World rules remain consistent within the magical‑realist frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate (reach the sister, prove the theory) but pressure doesn’t truly tighten beyond waiting and hoping. There’s no reversal or credible loss that forces adaptation; the method succeeds on first try. The captain’s skepticism doesn’t escalate into an obstacle. The piece reads as a gentle test rather than a contested trial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of gentleness over force and purified intent accrue through image and ritual, culminating in the sister’s distant stirring. However, the captain’s declarative moral (“the sea listens best to those who speak to it softly”) tips into on‑the‑nose statement, blunting subtext. The jasmine and cork do good thematic work. Resonance lingers but with a touch of sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with lyrical but controlled diction and clean focalization. Rhythm suits the contemplative mode and modulates well at the ending. Dialogue is brief yet distinct in register. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Language is polished with efficient imagery (“cobalt lighthouse,” “screaming tenderness”) and few redundancies. Minor repetition of phrasing and a handful of familiar notes (“protective aura”) don’t drag momentum. Sentences vary and carry multiple jobs. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The “cork that purifies intentions” is a fresh, specific twist on signal‑across‑water lore. The jasmine method adds a surprising sensory vector. Overall structure remains familiar and low‑risk in conflict, tempering novelty. Still, the synthesis feels coherent and memorable.</comment>
