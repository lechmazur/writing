<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive—exorcising by illuminating assumptions—drives his tactics with coherence and restraint, and his professional calm fits the method. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he never truly doubts or risks a wrong move, which limits felt struggle. The woman’s arc is present but largely functional to the conceit. The small renunciation—refusing to rush despite a time warning—helps earn the ending.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single scene, single POV, clear spatial anchor, and an accumulative/textural drive culminating in a conceptual repricing (“exorcism as illumination”). The looped rhetoric deepens pressure credibly and the palette’s final clatter delivers a legible before/after. Cost skews conceptual (comfort surrendered) rather than visceral, but it lands. No causality breaks or orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cathedral’s acoustics, loop pedal, and dimensional anchor meaningfully shape tactics and the final image. Details are specific, filtered through Marcus’s sonic sensibility, and recur with evolving charge (anchor holds; stones “confess”). The artist’s palette returns at closure to reweight theme. Strong integration without tour‑guide excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free the woman before completion) is clear, and pressure coheres via density—layered loops and paradoxes that unwind the demon. The decisive turn is the unraveling “like a sweater” as he modulates feedback and questions. Still, there’s little sense of near‑failure or loss beyond the relinquishing of certainty, keeping the cost mostly intellectual. One meaningful tightening is present; more risk would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—interrogation as exorcism; silence as architecture; stillness as held breath—emerges from actions and objects rather than lecture. A few explicit lines (“not a demon but a habit”) flirt with telling, but the final image (indigo as “the color of questions finally asked”) reverberates without moralizing. Recurring motifs (loop, anchor, palette) evolve in meaning. The piece invites post‑read reflection on certainty and doubt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a sonic/architectural lexicon fits the priest’s sensibility; psychic distance stays stable. Dialogue is purposeful and charged, functioning as action via rhetorical pressure. Elevated diction is consistent and legible; no head‑hopping. Rhythmic modulation supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies, and the metaphoric network is coherent (sound→architecture→stillness). A high figurative density risks purple, but pattern discipline and image consistency keep clarity intact. No scaffold loops or cadence templates slow momentum. The closing cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Exorcism via looped rhetoric and acoustical architecture is a fresh, integrated angle; the dimensional anchor and indigo palette feel singular rather than ornamental. The final repricing of “possession” as assumption is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Bold but controlled risk‑taking heightens meaning. The synthesis reads memorable and specific.</comment>
