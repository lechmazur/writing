<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s motives are coherent and embodied: the ivy, the bellows, and the graffiti all refract a guilt‑driven compulsion to document. The contradiction—methodical science vs. paralyzing remorse—surfaces in the Wheaton Bridge memory and culminates when he draws himself failing. The renunciation of map‑making at the end feels earned by the prior beats. A touch of therapy‑speak (“therapy sessions,” numbing meds) brushes the edge of label, but it’s grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the present‑tense exploration tightens through graffiti → self‑insertion on the map → decision to begin anew without a map. Orientation is clean from the opening and the scene holds unity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: acknowledging failure and foreclosing his data‑as‑absolution tactic. The “Mile marker zero” line provides an on‑page hinge without mechanical neatness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station, ivy, and bathroom graffiti are tactile and purpose‑driven, not postcard decor. The graffiti directly constrains and enables choices, and the bellows/dust charge the setting as action. Environmental recurrence (ivy, whistle, green overtaking gray) reweights the final image. The space shapes meaning and outcome, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can he move beyond guilt without numbing?—is signaled early and tightened by the graffiti’s aphorisms. The decisive deepening occurs when he adds himself failing to the map, narrowing options toward acceptance. The price is the relinquishment of his absolution‑through‑data strategy. Slight tidiness in the final cadence keeps it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of forward flow, guilt, and forgiveness grow from recurring particulars (maps, rivers, ivy). However, the text edges into overt thesis articulation (“Rivers don’t flow backward… the current… teaches us to let go”), softening subtext. The strongest resonance comes from image (no map, green overtaking gray), not the stated wisdom. Trimmed moralizing would heighten the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third with a clear perceptual signature—scientific lexicon braided with sensuous detail. Rhythm modulates well, allowing breath at realization beats and compression at memory spikes. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for this character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images like dust wheezing “like a confession” and tape “like scales” are vivid and apt. Figurative density is high but coherent and not muddled; momentum holds. A few near‑platitudes appear, but they are contextualized as graffiti or consciously reconsidered. Syntax varies and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The river/forgiveness frame is familiar, but the lens of a methodical river chronicler and the graffiti‑catalyzed turn add freshness. The bellows and station setting provide distinctive texture. The resolution’s specific refusal (no map) is a smart, character‑true twist on a common theme. It’s strong rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
