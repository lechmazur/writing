<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta’s quiet, facilitative motive (“tilted her head—an invitation”) is consistent and drives choices; Elena’s re‑voicing is credible and moving. Interiority is light but targeted, embodied through object handling and micro‑choices. Relationship dynamics (Marta/Jorge/Mrs. Chen/Elena) are clean and mutually shaping. Cost is mostly emotional and communal rather than conflicting, which slightly softens the arc’s rigor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: locket → identification → shelter visit → mobilization → recovery of letters → Elena speaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: community as “address,” listening reweights the world’s rules. Mild convenience (nephew at postal service resolves quickly) trims edge but doesn’t break pressure. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vivid, lived‑in, and returns to charge the final image as “this address.” The locket functions as a recurring micro‑setting/object that constrains choices (it leads them to Elena) and anchors the ending. Details are selective and filtered through Marta’s curatorial bias. Shelter and postal contexts feel plausible and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring Elena’s connection/voice) is legible with one meaningful tightening: recovering the letters. Escalation is steady but gentle; resistance is mostly situational, with little friction beyond time and systems. The quick postal resolution lowers felt cost despite emotional payoff. Agency is present (Marta’s decision to go, community coordination) and earns the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of listening as unlocking is coherent and image‑borne (locked mailbox → locket → voice), but several explicit thesis lines (“Objects know their stories. We just need to hear them.”) nudge into moralizing. Subtext surfaces effectively in silence and invitations to speak; Elena’s “My Sofia” is a strong understated pivot. The final conceptual reframing resonates, if a touch declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close third on Marta with a supple, confident narrative voice; dialogue feels natural and purposeful. Distinct idioms (Jorge’s “sandstorm calm,” Mrs. Chen’s practical warmth) give texture. No head‑hopping; distance control stays clean. Lyric compression is balanced with clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean, rhythmic sentences with good image economy; repeated motifs work without loops. A few familiar metaphors (“tears fell like rain after drought”) slightly flatten freshness but don’t impair momentum. No scaffold or redundancy; syntax varies with scene needs. Final lines land with poised cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The thrift‑curator/locket/mailbox triad gives a fresh angle on community‑healing tropes. The neighborhood network turning into “mission control” is lively and specific. Resolution’s convenience trims ingenuity at the peak, but the curatorial listening-as-method feels distinctive. Emotional truth reads authentic rather than engineered.</comment>
