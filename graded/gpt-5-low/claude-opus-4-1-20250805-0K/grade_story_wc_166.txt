<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—Mira chooses to “fledge” and risk capture to create a lasting verse—but internal contradiction is minimal, yielding less friction than the premise invites. Embodied detail (dew-slick stones, moon-drawn movement) grounds emotion credibly. Choices align with her values and culminate in an earned endurance stance. Lack of on‑page hesitation or competing impulse keeps this just shy of elite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural build lands in a charged poise: she imprints the garden and continues dancing, accepting detection by dawn as the felt cost. Orientation is clear from the outset; the causal line (dance → energy signature → inevitable arrival) coheres. The closure reweights the place and the body as document with undeniable price. Tight scope and a single dominant stake hold cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The twilight garden and wisteria are vivid and purposeful; the place becomes archive and conduit, charging the final image. World rules stay consistent, learned through action (dust, starlight, constellations woven). The garden’s soil literally holds her imprint, binding setting to outcome. Minor constraint-on-choice is implicit rather than explicit, otherwise superb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure grows through density: dust multiplies, starlight gathers, the “by dawn” clock surfaces, and the cost becomes inescapable. The tightening is protagonist-driven—her decision to perform the forbidden rite forecloses safety. While there’s no reversal, the accumulative escalation is clear and sufficient at this length. Stakes remain coherent and charged through the last beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Memory as resistance and exile-as-expansion resonate through concrete images (skin-script, seeded soil). The final stance reframes defiance as living text without tidy moralizing. One on‑the‑nose line (“This was what the Council feared…”) flattens subtext slightly. Overall, thematic cohesion is strong and earned by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature (“obsidian grace,” “gaps between heartbeats”) is consistent and controlled. Psychic distance and diction suit the mythic register without head‑hopping. Voice modulates with rising pressure into a confident cadence at the end. Occasional declarative theme lines are the only minor roughness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images evolve rather than stack incoherently. Rhythm varies, momentum holds, and sentences do multiple jobs. A few explanatory lines and high-density metaphors edge toward purple but stop short of muddle. Copy is clean and the final image lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—tide-dancing as celestial mechanics under a nostalgia ban with moonstone dust as catalytic script—feels fresh and specific. Familiar dystopic scaffolding is transformed by the ritualized, bodily lens. The imprinting of place as insurgent text provides a non‑obvious, memorable turn. Boldness is evident without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
