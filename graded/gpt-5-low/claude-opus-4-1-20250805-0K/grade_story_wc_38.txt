<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya’s motive and method are clear and embodied—she dances to decode, inheriting a role that fits her identity. Interiority is present but largely assured; there’s little contradictory impulse or cost as she proceeds. The destiny note lands, but without a frictional counterforce it feels less earned than accepted. Still, micro‑choices (beginning, intensifying, and reversing the dance) align with character and reveal resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: movement triggers reconfiguration, culminating in “Welcome home, granddaughter.” Orientation is clean early; the single‑scene spine remains coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing of self and system, though the on‑page cost is light. Beats link plausibly (dance → system response → reversal → reveal) without teleports or resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The flooded lab and green light are vividly integrated; water, skylights, console, and dice act as textured constraints and charge the final image (spiral water, glowing cube). Sensory detail is selective and tied to action, not postcard. World rules (system responding to choreographic inputs) stay consistent for this lyric mode. The environment subtly shapes tactics—knee‑deep water modulates movement and imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking forbidden data/legacy—is legible and escalates via an intensifying choreography and the required reversal sequence. The tightening is present (performing and then unweaving the dance), but the price paid is conceptual rather than felt; no tangible loss or foreclosed option is dramatized. Agency drives the turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve. The pressure stays coherent but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of vulnerability-as-strength, inheritance, and embodied knowledge emerge through particulars (dice balancing, spiral water, reversal). The final image reweights the premise—she is both lock and key—without needing a stated moral, though one line edges into explication (“Not how to transcend...”). Subtext carries through the choreography and journal marginalia. Resonance lingers even if the insight is a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to Maya sustains a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm varies with the dance’s cadence; diction fits the mythic‑tech register established. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elision is purposeful. Lines often carry image and action simultaneously without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong verbs and purposeful imagery; few redundancies, good momentum. Lyric figures (“spider spins its web,” “impossible geometries”) are mostly cohesive and not over‑stacked. Minor risk of purple is managed by clear action anchoring. The final cadence is crisp and image‑led.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—kinetic cryptography, a grandmother’s choreographic code, and a quasi‑oracular die—feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns arise from established premises (marginalia, reversal sequence), not late rule changes. The piece takes stylistic risks that pay off in atmosphere and concept. Emotional stakes could cut deeper, but the vision is singular.</comment>
