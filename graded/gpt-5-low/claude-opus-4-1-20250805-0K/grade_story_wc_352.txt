<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained—retrieve the “combinations” before gravity rights—yet interior contradiction is light; Orin’s prism-mind allows acceptance of paradox but we rarely feel fear or doubt in-scene. Micro-choices (kicking off the archway, pressing the node, returning to write) align with stakes. The ending’s Earned Stasis—choosing vigilance—lands with conceptual cost, though the struggle reads more competent than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density increases from margins to grotto to nodes to the “immune system” revelation, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration as Orin becomes the planter of warnings. Orientation is clean and the gravity clock provides a coherent pressure. Cost is conceptual (burden, secrecy, blood-ink lineage) rather than bodily, but it’s legible on the page. The closure image—writing new doodles that glow—reweights the premise credibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto under inverted gravity is vivid and tactically constraining (kicking off stalactites, water “falling” upward). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a professional eye. World rules (threshold effects, nodes) are learned through action rather than dump. The setting directly shapes movement and discovery, charging the middle and echoing into the final desk scene via the glowing ink.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find combinations before the inversion ends) is signaled early and tightened by environment and clock. The principal deepening is the discovery of nodes and the hidden method to reenter the sealed wing, which raises future stakes. Prices are mostly conceptual; immediate physical risk is implied more than dramatized. Still, pressure coheres and options narrow under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dangerous knowledge and ethical containment emerge organically from particulars (margin wars, plague of words), though one sentence (“civilization’s immune system”) edges toward thesis-stating. The final act of writing new luminous warnings offers a resonant, non-literal answer—acceptance of vigilant containment. Ambiguity remains productive around the sealed wing and future cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lexicon (“prism-minded,” “threshold effects”) and rhythmic control that flexes with action. Expository passages are absorbed by voice and remain legible. No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions feel purposeful. A few declaratives compress lore but do not break the focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Imagery is strong but controlled; lines do multiple jobs with minimal redundancy. Varied syntax propels movement through the grotto and softens into reflection at the end. A few abstractions (“layered truths,” “multiple awareness streams”) slightly thin immediacy, but clarity and momentum hold. No artifact loops or muddled metaphors at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: gravity inversions as archival windows, margin wars leaking into reality, and crystal nodes as memory repositories feel original and coherent. Turns arise from established logic (doodles → map → nodes → burden). The ending reframes the premise without gimmickry. Risk-taking in worldbuilding heightens stakes while staying clear.</comment>
