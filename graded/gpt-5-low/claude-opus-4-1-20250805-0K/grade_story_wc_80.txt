<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Edmund’s motives (official assessment vs. private memorialization) are clear and consistently embodied in small, tactile choices (opening the inkwell, documenting “interlaced absence,” sealing the bottle). His “stoically sensitive” nature is shown rather than told, with restraint guiding action and cost. Internal tension is quiet but legible—duty and time pressure against the need to honor his grandmother. The final renunciation of grand gestures in favor of hidden testimony reads as an earned stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation lands cleanly in the first lines (who, where, why, and the clock of the drawbridge/tide). The accumulative/textural drive coheres: observation → memory → ritual action. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: placing the bottle and leaving before sunset, with the pavilion’s condemnation as a persistent cost. The “click” of the inkwell and the promise to return reconfigure the premise from mapping loss to encrypting memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion and tidal clock shape every choice, constraining access and urgency; textures (barnacles, seaweed, chandelier kissing the waterline) serve function and tone. The inkwell and cornerstone operate as micro‑settings that charge the final image. Environmental pressure (shift, creak, rising tide) is integrated with action, not pasted on. Specificity stays POV‑filtered through a surveyor’s and grandson’s eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving meaning against water and time—is established early and tightens via the structural shift, tide turn, and drawbridge schedule. Escalation is quiet but real: the building’s groan and chandelier’s proximity to water push him to act now. The decisive act (sealing the bottle) forecloses alternatives and accepts the cost of smallness/futility. Consequences remain live (condemnation, possible loss) and charge the plan to return.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of absence defining presence is dramatized through particulars (empty seats, imagined music, cornerstone archive) rather than abstracted. The ending offers a resonant answer: preservation through covert, fragile acts in a drowning world. A near‑overt line (“This was how he honored the drowned world”) edges toward thesis but is earned by scene work. The piece invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically restrained, filtered through a surveyor’s precise sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. No head‑hopping; distance modulates subtly in memory beats without leakage. Recurring sonic cues (“click,” “groaned,” “lapped”) deepen texture without overplaying. The final cadence is measured and credible for this POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical; images carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, pressure). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and grounded; no mixed metaphors or cadence ruts undercut clarity. Minimal redundancy and strong verb choice keep momentum in a quiet piece. The closing image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The archivist‑surveyor preserving dreams within a climate‑ruined pavilion feels fresh and specific, transcending ruin‑elegy commonplaces through tools and ritual. The inkwell/cornerstone/bottle triad synthesizes craft and memory with originality. Risks are subtle rather than structural, but the commitment to smallness as ethic is distinct. Nothing feels gimmicked; choices grow organically from character and place.</comment>
