<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, character-driven stakes—Kira’s fear of collapse versus her need to integrate—are embodied in concrete actions (hovering under impossible weight, pressing the feared rune). Interiority is specific and image-led rather than diagnostic. The elder Kira’s intervention sharpens her ambivalence without removing agency. Minor abstraction in statements about “labyrinth of self” stays earned by tactile beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative pressure culminating in a decisive act) holds cleanly: the bridge’s stutter, darkening glow, and consciousness thinning escalate to the choice to press “collapse/unite.” Orientation is solid early (after-rain viaduct, tablet, floating constraint). Closure lands on-page with cost: integration requires letting alternate lives die/merge; the tablet’s disintegration seals the turn. No causality gaps or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The viaduct and tablet function as active environment and tool, constraining movement and forcing a stance (procedural rebuilding; gravity offset by impossible mass). Setting details are vivid, selective, and motivated (bioluminescent moss, shadows of might-have-beens, stuttering materials). The final image—touching down as the viaduct fades—directly charges the closure. World rules (periodic eternity, procedural generation) stay consistent through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—choose integration at the cost of unlived lives—is signaled early and tightens via pressure (darkening, grasping shadows, fragmentation). The elder Kira scene heightens the moral calculus and removes the refuge of indecision. The “collapse/unite” act is a credible, high-cost turn driven by her agency. Stakes remain coherent and internal/external pressures interweave effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of choice-as-sacrifice and integration over escapist multiplicity emerges organically from events and recurring images (drop/ripple window, darkening glow). The ending offers a resonant answer—walking on solid ground—without over-explaining. The line “Every choice murders infinite possibilities” edges toward thesis-stating but is tempered by the scene’s costs and imagery. Subtext carries through object fate and tonal shift rather than moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature (physics-weight versus float, procedural bridge as psyche). Diction stays character-plausible for heightened speculative lyricism and modulates with pressure (from wonder to urgency). Dialogue is minimal but effective, carrying thematic pressure without stalling action. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences are purposeful, with strong verbs and image density that mostly advances momentum. A few abstract phrases appear, but figurative language remains coherent and avoids purple stacking in peak beats. Rhythm varies well, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Minimal scaffolding; no paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks dulling immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: “periodically eternal” artifact, “between drop and ripple” time-window, and a procedural, psyche-responsive viaduct integrate tightly with character and theme. The reweighting from defiance to grounded integration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in conceptual framing pay off with clarity and cost. The specific combination reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
