<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motive and persistence are vivid, rooted in years of custodianship, and her micro‑choices (climb, align, accept “anti‑light”) align with that. Interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with the prism and pavilion. Internal contradiction is light—she’s largely steadfast rather than torn—so the arc reads more as endurance than contested change. The felt cost is mostly historic rather than paid on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning accumulative: the harmonic/silence pattern densifies toward the anti‑light ignition while causal beats (find shard → repair prism → align to drifted star paths) link cleanly. Closure lands with a decisive change (beacon rekindled; ships answering). Cost registers primarily as the weight of 17 years and the renunciation of the old light‑beacon paradigm. A slight ease—few obstacles in the ignition—keeps it shy of the absolute top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pavilion and beacon architecture are integral: the humming detects the shard, the tower’s ring and mirrors shape tactics, and the final image is charged by the environment’s re‑voiced song. Sensory specificity is consistently filtered through Mira’s sonic bias. The setting constrains the method (harmonics, anti‑light) rather than serving as backdrop. World rules feel internally consistent at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (call the lost ones home) is clear and escalates as silence fills the fracture and the sky answers. The tightening arises from reinterpreting the beacon’s purpose and compensating for drift. However, resistance is minimal—no meaningful setback beyond discovery—so price and narrowing are more conceptual than contested. The resolution feels earned but somewhat smooth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silence vs light and “coincidence as convergence” emerge through particulars (hush shard, anti‑light, wildflower beacons). The final image reweights earlier material without needing a spelled‑out moral. One line veers toward thesis statement (“The universe didn't speak in accidents...”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance lingers through the revaluation of absence as guidance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to harmonics and negative light. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and focalization stays inside Mira’s plausible knowledge. No dialogue to test, but narrative confidence holds without head‑hopping. Occasional high‑register flourish stays coherent with the mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are polished and purposeful, with strong image economy (“shadows that fell upward,” “structured darkness”). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent to the motif; minimal redundancy and good momentum. A few phrases flirt with purple or overt abstraction, but clarity at the peak remains intact. Final cadence lands cleanly on a recharged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Anti‑light,” “shard of hush,” and harmonic navigation synthesize into a fresh, cohesive cosmology. The twist that home requires structured absence feels non‑obvious yet earned. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring sense. Slight familiarity in the “lone keeper rekindles beacon” frame is transformed by the execution.</comment>
