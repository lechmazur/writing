<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marta’s motive—to defy quantified fate through practiced, nurturing deceit—is vivid and consistent, and her rituals (polishing marbles, training wires) externalize her inner ethic. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“lying to plants” as craft), with embodied gestures throughout. However, there’s little true internal contradiction or cost on the page; she never doubts or falters, so the change reads more as continuation than crucible-tested shift. The brief mentor moment adds relationship texture but doesn’t force a costly choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (maze, marbles, Ministry; time marked by “today’s reading”). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she passes a cracked marble and reweights “luck” toward relational craft, planning another loop in her monument. The cost is conceptual rather than concrete, resting on her sustained commitment to “beautiful deceptions” over public metrics; it lands but remains quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The garden maze, hedgerows, spiral of copper wires, and the tactile marbles create a lived, specific world filtered through a gardener’s priorities. Setting and recurring objects charge the final image (the planned new loop; the maze rustling “like laughter, like grief”). While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it permeates tactics and meaning. Consistent world rules (Luck Index) integrate without heavy exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—growing life against a low Luck Index—is clear and steadily pressured by “2.1” and prior inspection. Escalation is modest: present-tense stakes deepen via ritual acts and culminate in the mentor gift, not a sharpened dilemma. The inspector arrives only in summary, diffusing immediate pressure. The ending is earned but light on visible price or foreclosed options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: belief and caretaking can trump metrics; “mended deceptions” as ethical craft rather than fraud. Recurring images (cracked marbles, wires, roses) accrue and reweight at the end, inviting reflection without sermonizing. A few lines edge toward thesis statement (“The Ministry thinks luck is mathematics”), but the scene work largely carries the resonance. The final rustle braids growth with grief effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistently focalized through Marta’s perceptual biases; diction fits her craft. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with subtext in the marble’s transfer. Rhythm modulates well between sensuous description and crisp moves. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: vivid, economical images (“fruit ripening toward rot”; “a bloom that opened in darkness”) and purposeful recurrence. Minimal scaffolding; sentences do more than one job, and rhythm breathes. Occasional aphoristic phrases flirt with overtness but don’t clog momentum. No figurative muddle or pattern artifacts in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blend of bureaucratized luck with a gardener’s ritualized “lies” and cracked marbles as ledger of defiance feels fresh and integrated. The mentor handoff reframes the premise without twist gimmickry. Risks are quiet but committed; the world logic holds. Only the gentle pressure curve keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
