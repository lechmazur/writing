<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kira’s interiority is specific and embodied (bare feet, the hum in her sternum), and her motive—to find a new way to wake the sleepers—tracks cleanly. The “awkwardly confident” trait appears in motion but rarely constrains a choice with cost. Contradictory impulses are limited; once she recognizes the lull as an inhale, the path ahead carries little friction. The final stance shift is earned but soft on visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build is clear and oriented early; the circle’s hum and the repair bay’s resonance deepen toward a charged-poise ending. Closure lands as a reconfiguration: she reframes the “failed” uprising and commits to bring others tomorrow. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, which trims impact. The lens stays consistent with the lyric, textural escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The repair bay and the ancient circle are vivid, tactile, and integrated; objects (opera glasses, stones, bare metal) shape perception and the final image. The environment actively participates (machinery resonating; a forgotten engine coughing to life) and constrains choice (the circumscribed space and timing). World rules are learned through observation and action without dump. The setting charges the ending and cannot be swapped without loss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding a frequency to reignite resistance) is clear and deepens as the hum spreads to the abandoned machinery. The escalation is accumulative rather than reversal-based and culminates in a commitment to act. The price is implied (risk, exposure, patience) rather than on-page, keeping the tightening from fully biting. Still, the movement from private sanctuary to collective plan provides a credible narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Opera’s “pause before the crescendo” reframes the lull with elegant economy, and the reprise at the end (“next movement”) resonates without cloying. Images (starlight stored in stone, heartbeats, orchestra warming up) coherently build the thematic answer that revolution is a long song. A few lines verge on stated thesis, but they emerge from concrete particulars. The afterimage feels earned and reflective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently focalized through Kira’s sensibility; diction and rhythm fit the meditative pressure. No head-hopping or stance slippage; free-indirect textures are clean. Patterned cadences support the accumulative lens without obscuring clarity. The tonal modulation toward “thunderous serenity” reads intentional and persuasive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multi-function detail with few redundancies; sensory specificity is high without becoming purple. Occasional abstractions (“revolution was not a single act…”) are supported by concrete images nearby. Rhythm varies, and sentence choreography remains clear. Minor lyric intensifiers appear but do not blur logic or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sci‑fi repair bay with a prehistoric stone circle and opera as structural metaphor feels fresh and coherent. The use of vintage opera glasses as an investigative tool is distinctive. While the rebellion frame is familiar, its reweighting via harmony and resonance rather than violence is non‑obvious and apt. Risks are taken in tone and concept without losing legibility.</comment>
