<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Her motive—attending to “hidden effort” through mending—is precise and embodied in choices (the tower, the whistle, the steady work). Interiority is sensorial and particular rather than generic. However, conflict is largely philosophical; she rarely meets resistance or contradiction beyond endurance, limiting palpable stakes. The endurance feels earned, but the cost remains mostly conceptual (anonymity) rather than viscerally tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (whisk, fireflies, net, whispers) intensify toward a charged completion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the finished net and her anonymous departure reprices the premise with an implicit cost (erasure/quiet labor). Orientation is clear early, and the structure stays within a single, coherent night scene. The final cadence tightens cleanly with the farewell whistle and descent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The parapet after rain, the moonlit whisk, and fireflies create a vivid, tactile world filtered through her craft. The tower choice (avoided by others) grants solitude and charges the whispers that hum in the close. Setting is integrated into action—whistling, mending, watching paths—rather than postcard description. It stops short of a hard constraint, but it meaningfully charges the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on honoring and enacting invisible labor; escalation comes via pattern-density and the hum aligning with firefly wingbeats and tide pulse. The decisive tightening is the completion of the net and the deliberate choice to remain anonymous. Cost is legible but quiet, more conceptual than embodied. Within an accumulative design, the pressure coheres and deepens once as required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—anonymous care holding the world together—emerges organically through the net work, firefly choreography, and the whisk’s refracted moon. The final image reweights prior material: the fisherman’s unknowing catch as proof and price. A few lines verge on overt statement (“This was the hidden pattern she cherished most”), softening subtlety. Still, resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and sensorially biased toward craft and pattern; POV distance is stable and credible. Diction and rhythm modulate with quiet intensifications (the hum, the landing firefly). No head-hopping or explanatory crutches; elisions are purposeful. The register fits the contemplative, skilled focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-dense, and varied in syntax with strong verbs and purposeful motifs. Occasional abstractions (“invisible architecture of effort”) remain legible and anchored by concrete action. No noticeable loops or muddled metaphors; momentum sustains through line-level precision. Lushness is controlled enough not to swamp clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—net-mending as philosophy, a bamboo whisk as divinatory lens, fireflies as pattern—feels fresh and inevitably linked by the close. Risk-taking in quiet stakes and object-charged imagery pays off without obscuring sense. The anonymous-care repricing is non‑obvious yet earned. It stands out within the lyric short form.</comment>
