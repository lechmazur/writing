<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera’s motive is legible and particular (grandmother’s charge; a locksmith’s ethic), with embodied cost (bleeding fingers) amid a credible, steady determination. However, internal contradiction is light; she meets disorientation with acceptance rather than struggle, which trims complexity. The “courage DNA” idea externalizes her resolve neatly but also drifts toward abstraction. Final endurance feels earned but not conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing with Charged Poise (the idea loosed; dawn walk; price in blood and fatigue). Orientation is clear early, and the pattern (nexus shifts → star hint → impossible shadow → fear‑web) coheres. The cost is on the page, and the turn at the “last tumbler” cleanly lands the before/after. Slight abstraction in the middle doesn’t undermine the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The nexus and starlight through “impossible angles” constrain choices (which arch; the upward shadow) and charge the final image. Details are selective and purposeful (seven passages, ancient archway, blur and shift), filtered through Vera’s locksmith mindset. World rules remain consistent and learned through action. The recurring micro‑setting objects (archway, star, shadow) directly govern tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free the idea from fear) is clear; pressure tightens via the star’s selection, the fear‑web’s tactile danger, and the last‑tumbler moment. Agency is Vera’s endurance and deft “untangling,” with a visible price (blood, time dilation). Stakes remain a touch abstract, but the web’s physicalization keeps tension present. Resolution is earned by her persistence, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance arises from image and action (impossible shadow; last tumbler; dawn walk), but the theme is also stated outright (“ordinary people could reshape reality”), edging into moralizing. The final line’s “every revolution begins…” leans didactic, softening subtext. Still, the liberation image reweights earlier motifs effectively. The piece invites contemplation, though with less ambiguity than ideal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is steady and apt; diction suits the mythic register without head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates with pressure (calm watchfulness → intensifying untangling → quiet dawn coda). No dialogue to test, but interior perception carries action. Occasional high‑concept phrasing brushes abstraction without losing control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful; imagery is vivid yet mostly disciplined (“upward shadow,” “fiber optic cable” hair). Minor density spikes in metaphor do not blur sense, and momentum holds through the middle stretch. Little to no scaffold or paraphrase loops. The prose lands the final image crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A locksmith unlocking collective fear at a liminal nexus via a starlit cue feels fresh and integrated, transforming familiar “collective will” ideas through concrete, tactile craft. The matryoshka and web metaphors align with action rather than decorate it. Risk level is solid—quiet, conceptual climax with embodied price—without gimmickry. Slight thematic familiarity prevents the topmost tier.</comment>
