<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kaia’s motive—to transmute despair into communal wonder via craft—is clear and consistent, with concrete choices (teaching, repurposing materials, lighting the first device). Interiority is conveyed through the chant and sensory bias rather than labels, giving her a particular mind. Internal contradiction is modest; she moves from purpose to leadership without a real ethical or emotional snag. The relationship with the mosaic artist adds a light crucible but applies little pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through ritual, community gathering, and material transformation into a closure image of sustained light. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the Dimming and fortress rules stay consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“we make our own constellations”) with a conceptual price—the stars remain gone; endurance is the choice. Cost is felt but gentle; the sequence runs smoothly with minimal resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional: phosphorescent moss, mosaic, and fortress tools become resources that directly shape tactics (grinding stones, crushed tiles for color). Spatial and social context guide action (courtyard gathering, gate children, blacksmith, kitchen). World texture remains consistent, and the environment charges the final image of human-made constellations. Specificity is high without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—countering the Dimming’s psychic gravity—stays coherent and tightens as night falls to absolute black and the chorus forms. Escalation is achieved by density and communal buy‑in more than by obstruction; opposition is minimal. The launch functions as a meaningful deepening rather than reversal, with a sustained-burn payoff. Price and foreclosed options are present conceptually but not sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of crafted wonder as defiance and serious play as survival emerge organically from the chant, mosaic message, and communal labor. The final image reweights prior motifs without didactic moralizing, though “REMEMBER WONDER” and “This is just the beginning” approach explicit statement. Symbolic objects evolve (rag knot, tiles), integrating concept and action. Resonance lingers as chosen endurance rather than victory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and character‑specific, with professional lexicon (metals, burn qualities) blending with lyric cadence. Dialogue is lean, natural, and goal‑driven, nudging recruitment and trust. Psychic distance stays stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates well from hush to collective chorus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑dense, and purposeful; lines often do double duty (world and interiority). Repetition (the chant) is pattern‑taught and functional, not scaffolding. Minor lyric convenience appears (“hope that burns longer”) but doesn’t blur sense or momentum. Syntax and paragraphing create a smooth build to the launch without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis—pyrotechnic craft as communal ritual against a starless sky, with materials harvested from the place itself—feels both inevitable and distinctive. The mosaic note and kerosene knot add specific texture beyond trope. The Dimming concept isn’t novel, but its application through artisanal process and chorus gives it vitality. Risk is measured and coherent, landing a memorable final stance.</comment>
