<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—writing obituaries for the living to map loss—is clear and sustained through concrete micro‑choices (pulling the thread, writing in air, planning the weavers’ visit). Interiority is specific and character‑particular, with embodied perception (thread’s warmth, dust settling on instruments). Internal contradiction is gentler than ideal; she rarely faces a conflicting impulse beyond quiet endurance. Still, the Earned Stasis at the end (choosing to keep mapping with cost) feels credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from atmosphere to a charged poise: the warmed thread, Marcus’s translucent presence, and Elara’s final acceptance of her cartographer role. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing—healing becomes a map with a felt cost in ongoing, unfinishable work. Orientation is clean early, and the motif chain resolves coherently. The price is implicit but legible in the city’s “living dead” and her commitment to keep pulling threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting work is exquisite and purposeful: the shadowed garden, frost‑edged roses, dry fountain, and tapestry thread all filter through Elara’s sensibility. The thread functions as an object‑as‑setting that charges choices and the final image. Sensory specificity is layered without tourist listing, and the city’s abandonment inflects every detail. While the garden doesn’t physically constrain tactics, it deeply frames tone and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Elara can convert unraveling into mapped meaning; pressure deepens via the Marcus shard and the thread’s responsive warmth. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than decisively causal, with one key tightening when she sees Marcus in the garden and binds the thread to herself. The cost (ongoing duty amid decay) is clear, though not viscerally tested. A slightly sharper on‑page trade‑off would raise tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of presence/absence, grief as cartography, and the ethics of endings emerge organically from objects and actions. The final image (stars already dead, light still traveling) reweights the premise without a spelled‑out moral. A couple lines verge on explicit thesis (“Healing…was not about forgetting”), but they’re anchored by concrete particulars. Subtext hums through the city’s routines and the weavers’ anticipated silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with a consistent perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the elegiac aim. POV remains stable and confident; inferences read as inferences. No dialogue is needed; the narrative modulation tightens at closing beats. Elevated language feels character‑true rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line by line, the prose is polished, economical for its lyric density, and largely free of scaffold or loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and sensorially grounded (incense presence, dust on instruments, thread pulsing). Minor risk of overstatement in abstract thematic lines, but momentum holds. The final cadence lands cleanly without purple muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living via projected presence, guided by a palace thread—is fresh and integrated. Familiar grief motifs are transformed through specific, tactile choices (writing with the weft, mapping scars as coordinates). The ending’s synthesis feels earned and memorable. It takes a tasteful risk in committing to lyric accumulation over plot turns, and it works.</comment>
