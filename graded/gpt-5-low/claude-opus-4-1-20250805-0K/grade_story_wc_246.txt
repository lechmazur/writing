<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s guilt, professional rigor, and temptation toward absolution create credible, simultaneous cross‑pressures. The fountain pen as a talisman grounds her interiority and reveals values under stress. Her final act—transmitting both coordinates—fits her “confidently uncertain” nature without feeling evasive. Minor abstraction in explaining the anomaly slightly distances embodied emotion at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single‑scene pressure coheres: mistake → anomaly insight → rescue ship arrival → choice. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she refuses a binary, foreclosing unilateral authorship with conceptual cost. The cost is present but muted on the page (she feels “strange comfort,” while consequences remain offstage). Causal clarity and orientation are clean and sustained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The anomaly’s selective lensing and observer‑contingency shape options and make the setting a live pressure source. The station and sensor interface feel inhabited by a professional eye. The pen functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through vocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (save the colonists vs preserve discovery/knowledge). Escalation tightens with the rescue ship’s trajectory shifting, forcing a decision right now. The chosen resolution (sending both coordinates) enacts a real trade‑off: ceding control and accepting layered risk. Some tension dissipates in conceptual comfort rather than a felt immediate price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of uncertainty, authorship of reality, and responsibility vs knowledge arise organically from action and image. Recurring motifs (“editing,” pen, seeds/gardens) reweight at the end without tidy moralizing. A touch of explicit thesis (“its most important message”) slightly flattens subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled, precise SF voice with a distinct observational lexicon suited to her profession. POV is steady and modest in claims, with inference framed as inference. Occasional expository density around the anomaly’s mechanics edges toward telling but remains legible. Rhythm modulates well into the closing image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with clean syntax and purposeful imagery (“twisted starlight,” “revised background radiation”). Minimal scaffolding; momentum rarely stalls. A few abstract phrases and conceptual restatements mildly dilute pressure in the final third. Overall, prose is polished and propulsion is intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “cosmic editor” premise, observer‑contingent reality, and the ethical pivot to transmit both coordinates feel fresh and thoughtfully integrated. The heirloom pen as scientific and familial throughline adds specificity. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
