<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina’s motive—becoming a historian of small gestures—is distinct and embodied through her walking‑words practice and refusal to serve spectacle. The crisis‑actor backstory creates credible pressure and a principled stubbornness (“benevolently ruthless”) that guides her choice. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: desire to witness colliding with public demand for testimony. The renunciation at the call’s arrival reads earned and reveals a value hierarchy with cost (isolation, refusal of legitimacy).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the patterned walking, the echoing acoustics, and the pawnless chessboard accrete until the door/voice intrusion tightens choices. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when she refuses official witnessing and recommits to her practice, paying a conceptual and social cost. Orientation is clear from the outset; single scene integrity holds. The final cadence (“WE REMAIN”) reconfigures the premise with a felt before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vivid and functional: acoustics carry whispers, shape dialogue, and literalize the theme of witness. The chessboard and marble floor are meaningfully integrated, culminating in charged reprises (pawns’ absence; names walked into stone). Specificity is selective and POV‑true, avoiding tourist catalog. Environment charges the final image even if it only gently constrains options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent: what counts as legitimate witnessing in the interregnum. Escalation arrives via the door opening and the invitation, forcing a stance crystallization. The price is choosing marginality over sanctioned voice; while quiet, the narrowing is unmistakable. The conflict stays interior but integrates the external pressure credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of absence, witness, and power are organically built through recurrent objects and action (pawnless board; names walked; echoes). Subtext operates in the acoustics and the missing pawns’ “luminous absence,” culminating in a resonant reweighting of what a witness is. A few lines verge on direct thesis (“Tell them the real witnesses are the gestures no one notices”), but they’re earned by context. The ending image deepens meaning without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature and consistent POV distance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and the brief dialogue is natural, goal‑driven, and subtext‑laden. Metaphor use is precise and pattern‑taught early. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs, and the rhythm breathes between accumulation and pivot. Imagery stays coherent; repetitions feel purposeful rather than looped. A slight density of elevated metaphors risks lushness but remains clear and propulsive. Opening and final lines both function as charged anchors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—crisis‑actor survivor in a whispering gallery, walking words, a pawnless board as witness—feels fresh and inevitable by the end. Risks in structure and tone pay off without obscuring clarity. The “luminous absence” angle avoids cliché through specific, tactile choices. The closing reconfiguration feels earned and memorable.</comment>
