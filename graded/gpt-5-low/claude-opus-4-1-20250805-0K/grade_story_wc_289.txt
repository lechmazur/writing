<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and character‑specific (rejoining, pattern‑finding, reconciling with Chen), and her embodied attention to tools and light grounds emotion. The relationship pressure is present but gentle; Chen’s quick acceptance softens friction. Interiority is consistent and avoids therapy‑speak, though the resolution feels tidy. The final hand‑taking earns a modest change without showing much visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds patterned density toward a Charged Poise: the completed spiral, mirrored pond, and hand clasp reweight the premise. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the reflective sections are anchored by ongoing making. The closure lands conceptually with a cost of vulnerability and past secrecy, albeit lightly dramatized. The “we’re all writing the same letter” realization coheres the structure without a hard causal turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lotus temple, lily pond, and reflective weather are vividly rendered and threaded through action, not just posed. Specific tools (copper wire, tiny glass slides) and the spiral object function as micro‑setting that charges the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it deeply colors tactics and the ending’s mirror motif. Sensory selection feels POV‑true and economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Stakes center on reconnection and revelation of a unifying pattern; escalation is primarily tonal and accumulative. The main tightening arrives when Chen admits he kept her personal letters, enabling the hand‑clasp. Pressure remains low and without a forcing choice; costs and alternatives aren’t sharply narrowed. The installation’s completion functions as a deepening rather than a test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, translation, and communal longing emerge organically from making and motif. However, the text sometimes states its thesis (“we are all writing the same love letter”; “was always love”) rather than letting subtext carry it, especially near the end. The final image resonates, but the explicit moral dulls the afterglow. Still, the particulars (slides with fragments, spiral) ground the universals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—craft‑inflected diction, reflective yet concrete. Dialogue is spare, serviceable, occasionally on‑the‑nose but not stilted. Psychic distance is steady and well‑modulated, with no head‑hopping. Rhythm supports the calm build without monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong nouns/verbs, controlled figurative language, and few redundancies. A handful of phrases verge on purple or thematic reiteration, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Information density is high, with images doing double duty. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The love‑letter ghostwriter merging text and sculpture in a lotus temple is a fresh synthesis, and the thrush spiral is a memorable organizing image. The conceptual turn toward shared longing feels fitting rather than clever. Risk is moderate—comfortably lyrical rather than formally bold. Some familiar formulations temper distinctiveness, but the vision feels cohesive and specific.</comment>
