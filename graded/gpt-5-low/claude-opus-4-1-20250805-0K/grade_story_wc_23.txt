<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s motives are urgent and specific—restore contact and shepherd the compelled return—and her embodied struggle (moon-weakened arms, leveraging the censer foot) reveals character under pressure. Contradictory impulses are present: her own pull to return versus the choice to stay and serve. Micro-choices in the calls (the child, Diego at the sulfur fields) expose values hierarchy with felt cost. The closing endurance/renunciation (“some of us are meant to stay”) is earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with Situational dominant: one night’s pressure (failed hydraulics, stalled array, incoming calls) coheres toward a stance crystallization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses leaving and assumes the role of shepherd, with the censer foot and new scratches as concrete cost. Because/therefore links are clean (hydraulics fail → manual crank with censer foot; array angle improves → daylight signal) and no causality breaks. The final image reconfigures options with a price she accepts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The starlit signal station, manual crank, and poisoned corridor are vivid and functionally integrated; the censer foot as tool/micro-setting literally constrains tactics and charges the ending. World rules (toxins settling, drone shadows, hydraulics failure) are learned through action, not dump. Sensory selection is purposeful under stress. The final image of the warm bronze in her lap binds environment to calling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: re-aim the array and guide travelers; pressure tightens through successive calls culminating in Diego’s peril at the sulfur fields. She adapts tactics (levering the censer, satellite-shadow timing, quarantine road gambit) with visible cost (physical tremor, damaged artifact, relinquished path). Escalation is coherent without cheap coincidence. The resolution is a renunciation that carries ongoing price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of ancestral pull, duty versus longing, and building bridges from words arise organically from particulars (child’s constellation promise, salt pocket, quarantine road). Subtext of faith and inheritance is embodied in the censer foot warming as if prayers persist. A line or two edges toward overt statement (“this was her calling”), but it follows earned scene work. The ending offers a resonant answer: solace as stewardship amid loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is steady and character-specific; diction blends technical grit with ritual inflection without register slips. Dialogue is purposeful, indirect, and advances action (instructions laced with coded hope). Rhythm modulates well under pressure, and image choices feel native to Marina’s mind. No head-hopping or artificial exposition intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are lean yet lyrical, with images doing double duty (satellite shadows, toxins settling) and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and consistent; no mixed metaphors or syntactic monotony. A few phrases tread close to declarative summary, but do not dull momentum. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—reverse migration compelled by a dying earth, a censer foot as anchor-lever, and navigation through word-bridges—is fresh and memorable. Tactical details (salt, drone evasion via satellites) deepen plausibility and theme. The closing reweights the premise with specific cost rather than generic uplift. Risks in blending techno-rigorous survival with devotional artifact pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
