<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thomas’s purpose and method are distinct and grounded in long habit; his offer to “ease” rather than erase shows ethical calibration. The woman is sketched efficiently through the “shadow” of a broken promise, but her interiority is minimal. There’s little contradiction or struggle in Thomas—serenity under a ticking clock, not a conflict. The closing endurance (work ends when gutters stop) reads credible for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the rain’s ticking and fog density structure the scene until the lift. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she’s lightened, but the mark remains; he resumes the route. Causality is clean (he distills → essence returns to her → fog retreats → ride begins). Cost is legible in the limitation that nothing is erased and the temporal cut-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fog‑bound crossing, bridge, and rain gutters are tactile and purposeful; the environment literally contains the promises and imposes a clock. The yarn needle as tool‑setting hybrid charges the final image when tucked away. Sensory balance (sound of ticking, wet planks, mist) supports tone without excess. World rules are taught via action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and singular: can he distill her burden before the fog lifts. The live clock tightens pressure and culminates when the gutters stop. Escalation is gentle, with a deepening at her request (“Can you see mine?”) rather than a sharp reversal. The price is modest but present in the non‑erasure constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of promise, faith, and residue emerge organically through the distillation act and the “golden thread” returned to her breath. The ending reweights earlier imagery (fog, river, stars newly visible) without moralizing. Occasional explicit philosophy (“promises aren’t meant to accumulate like sediment”) edges toward tell but stays anchored in action. Resonance lingers via the kept/marked paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is supple, lyrical, and consistent with Thomas’s temperament; diction like “spindrift serenity” feels earned. Dialogue is spare, natural, and advances the scene with subtext. POV is steady and modestly close to Thomas, with inferences framed as felt rather than omniscient. Rhythm modulates well around the clock’s cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, world logic, and theme—without drag. Figurative choices (palimpsest, threads, sediment) cohere under the weaving metaphor and avoid muddle. Minimal scaffolding and no looped paraphrase; pacing matches the ticking clock. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The promise‑fog distiller with a yarn needle is a fresh synthesis, grounded in tactile craft rather than abstract magic. The palimpsest conceit reorients the commonplace “broken vows” trope into an embodied ritual. The quiet, procedural healing under time pressure avoids cliché catharsis. Risks are measured and integrated; the piece feels singular.</comment>
