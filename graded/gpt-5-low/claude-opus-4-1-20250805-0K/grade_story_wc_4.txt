<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and character‑specific—she “reads” objects and converts grief into communal design—but she faces little resistance, so contradictory impulses never bite. Her micro‑choices (designing a treasure hunt, inviting descendants) track with her skill set and values. The calm/urgent split gestures toward tension, yet no scene‑level cost forces a trade‑off. The change at the end is credible but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the pattern of photographs builds to the on‑page recreation and the shutter click, a resonant reconfiguration that reframes the ruins and the field. Orientation is crisp early (case under smokestacks; museum role), and the closure image is legible and earned. Cost reads primarily as conceptual/emotional (intergenerational pain surfaced) rather than a tested sacrifice, holding this below the top band. The council’s looming clearance supplies pressure but never materially complicates tactics on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory bones are vivid and charged, recurring as canvas and counterpoint that culminate in the final image. The dove gray case functions as micro‑setting/object shaping perception and the closing beat. Sensory economy is strong, especially visual and olfactory implied by “lavender,” with details filtered through Elara’s archivist gaze. The environment doesn’t hard‑constrain movement but it decisively charges meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve/transform memory before the site is erased) is clear, but escalation remains smooth—once Elara decides, the town arrives and everything works. The meaningful tightening is more conceptual (recognizing the spiral, then staging the reprise) than pressure‑driven. A credible on‑page obstacle or trade‑off would have deepened cost. As is, the resolution is earned yet relatively untested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme integrates through recurring images (arcs, spiral, lavender) that shift from grief‑mapping to healing blueprint; “We plant what the machines cannot make” resonates without over‑explaining. The final shutter click reweights the premise: bodies as brushstrokes, community as the factory’s “true production.” Occasional explicit phrasing (“collective healing”) edges toward telling but is grounded by concrete action. The piece sustains emotional honesty without tipping into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (archivist attuned to pattern). Rhythm modulates well between reflective catalog and present‑tense staging at the event. No head‑hopping; diction feels coherent and intentional. The voice pays off in the closing image without over‑ornamenting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean sentences with high information density; metaphoric patterning (maps, arcs, spiral) is consistent and legible. Minor lushness (“as vines climb,” “patient as memory”) remains purposeful and does not blur sense. No evident scaffold loops or cadence ruts. The prose drives momentum into the final click.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—industrial ruins, an archivist decoding decades of posed photographs into a communal spiral, then completing it via participatory design—is fresh and specific. The treasure‑hunt tactic adds inventive agency. It avoids template uplift by anchoring in tactile objects and intergenerational choreography. Slight risk aversion around conflict keeps it shy of the topmost band.</comment>
