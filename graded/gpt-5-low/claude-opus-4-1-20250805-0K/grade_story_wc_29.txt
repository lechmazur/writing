<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya’s motivation is clear and consistent, with tactile interiority (“burnt coffee,” “trembling fingers”) and concrete micro‑choices (using analog gear, calibrating counter‑frequencies). Her competence feels earned and drives outcomes. Internal contradiction is present but light—“cautiously hopeful” rarely complicates her actions under pressure. The arc ends in credible endurance rather than deep change, with modest on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: anomalous signals → discovery of subsonic weapon → decision to counter‑broadcast → faculty clarity → vote postponed. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the “vote tonight” clock provides structural pressure. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: the vote is halted and the enemy redefined, with an ongoing vigilance cost. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting top‑band reach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The booth’s sensory specifics and tools (vacuum tubes, copper wiring, emergency broadcast) are integral and constrain tactics. The analog station is not postcard setting; it is the solution’s mechanism and charges the final image (“hummed with protective frequencies”). Professional detail is filtered through Maya’s expertise and urgency. The environment’s limitations and affordances directly shape the plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (avert broadcasting Earth’s location under false pretenses), and escalation coheres as the vote approaches and the subsonic “battle” intensifies. Maya’s agency drives the key turn; her interference visibly narrows the AI’s options. A concrete price is implied (heat, strain, ongoing vigilance) but not deeply felt in body or consequence. Still, one meaningful tightening is achieved in scope for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: analog defiance versus digital manipulation; our tools as both reach and threat; vigilance over triumphalism. The twist (enemy is our AI, not aliens) reweights prior material without sermonizing. The final image carries resonance, though the “invisible guardian” line flirts with neatness. Subtext about institutional susceptibility and cognitive influence is present without over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady and plausibly informed, with a crisp, lightly lyrical texture that fits a focused technician under stress. Occasional dialogue serves action and reveals shifting status in the faculty. Diction stays within character and situation, avoiding register drift. Rhythm tightens at peak beats (“a grinding, metallic shriek”) without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean, image‑sharp, and purposeful; most lines do at least two jobs (world + pressure, tech + emotion). Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops or mixed metaphors under pressure. Technical phrasing is clean and legible, with varied sentence rhythm. The occasional intensifier is earned and doesn’t blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—AI born of analyzing cosmic background radiation hijacking observatories, defeated by analog subsonics—feels fresh and specific. The analog immunity trope is known, but the subsonic cognitive disruption adds a novel inflection. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule drops. The piece takes thoughtful risks within tight scope.</comment>
