<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and layered: protect the illicit bees, fear exposure, and a compulsion to honesty that both hobbles and frees her. Contradictory impulses act in scene (“Tower’s closed… Actually, it’s open…”) and culminate in the costly broadcast. Embodied details (the lacquer box’s warmth, racing heart) ground emotion. A few self‑labels (“I’m a thief and a liar”) edge toward tidy but are justified by the honesty curse.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal flow: blackout → drone collapse → food crisis → Mira’s secret chamber → riddle reframes duty → broadcast confession → communal response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she publicly commits to a path with social and legal cost while reweighting the city’s options. Orientation is strong from the opening image; single scene coherence holds. The swift communal acceptance is slightly convenient but doesn’t break causality or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower, coils, glass chamber, and charged objects are vivid and functionally integral: she siphons tower lightning, climbs seven hundred steps, and uses the tower’s broadcast to act. Environmental specifics constrain choices and charge the final image (candlelit chamber, lacquer box glinting). Sensory selection (amber sky, nectar air, liquid‑gold wings) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. World rules feel consistent at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens decisively when she activates the broadcast, foreclosing secrecy with clear risk. The honesty curse pressures tactics and removes evasion, forcing a high‑stakes choice. The ending’s gentle reception softens the edge of consequence, trimming peak tension. Still, internal and external stakes interweave credibly and escalate once as required.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Nature’s return versus technological dependence, and truth that “stings before it can heal,” emerge through concrete acts and images (honeycomb, bees’ dance, public confession). Recurring objects (box, bees) shift meaning from secrecy to revelation. A few overt lines (“The answer was always bees”) verge on theme‑statement, but resonance is earned by scene work. The final lighthouse‑of‑hope tableau reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical, sensory‑attuned voice that tightens under pressure. Dialogue sounds natural and advances conflict (the involuntary truth slips and the public announcement). Diction and rhythm feel controlled without drift into authorial omniscience. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from observation to confession.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is crisp, image‑dense, and mostly double‑duty: description advances mood, world, and stakes. Figurative language (“wings like drops of liquid gold,” “broken promises”) is apt and not overstacked. Minimal redundancy; momentum is steady through the climb, reveal, and communal arrival. No notable artifacts or loops dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—lightning tower, drone‑bee collapse, an honesty curse, and a clandestine living hive—feels distinct and purposeful. Turns arise from character choice rather than gimmicks; the broadcast is inevitable in hindsight. Freshness resides in tactile specifics (matchbox riddle, lacquer box iconography) and a humane, hopeful angle. Slight familiarity in “nature will save us” is offset by the candor constraint and charged setting.</comment>
