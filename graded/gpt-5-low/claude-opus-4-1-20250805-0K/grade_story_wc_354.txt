<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Viktor’s motives and values are clear and consistently dramatized; the renunciation (staying) is earned through the accumulated teaching ethos and his bond with Mira. Interior contradiction is present but gentle—he weighs return vs. hard‑won truth—without much acute friction. The transfer of the worry stone reads as a concrete, costly choice that forecloses the Academy path. Mira adds relational pressure and reveals his hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Situational lens: the covenant’s end forces a stance crystallization; the scene accumulates toward Earned Stasis as Viktor chooses to remain and passes the stone. Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is coherent with no leaks. The on‑page cost—relinquishing status and reentry—is legible in his explicit refusal. The aurora‑charged final image reconfigures prior material with conceptual weight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vivid and rules‑consistent; it concretely affects play (pieces leaning, sliding) and charges the closing image (aurora). Details are POV‑filtered through a chess master’s sensibility, not tourist listing. The environment subtly constrains action and metaphor, making the final stance feel native to place. Object‑as‑setting (worry stone) further grounds the space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: return to the Academy or remain. Pressure tightens once with the imminent end of the covenant, the charged game, and the passing of the stone. The escalation is quiet but coherent; the choice forecloses a live option with visible cost. A slightly sharper immediate resistance or counter‑pull could have heightened tension further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant themes—beauty in difficulty, silence translated into wisdom, exile as gift—emerge through concrete particulars (magnetism, the board, the stone). However, several lines tilt into thesis‑statement territory (“The Academy believes…,” “It was a gift disguised as exile,” and “Mira understood…”), softening subtext. The final moralizing sentence blunts the earned ambiguity. Still, the closing image retains emotional afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person close voice with consistent focalization; diction suits Viktor’s sensibility. Dialogue carries subtext and advances the choice without expository clunk. Rhythm modulates well between image and action. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean, high‑density lines with strong verbs and purposeful imagery; metaphor network (magnetism/chess/silence) stays coherent. Minor redundancies of theme language surface but do not stall momentum. Cadence varies naturally and supports the quiet escalation. No figurative muddle or artifact loops at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a magnetic nexus informing chess as cosmology, an exile’s pedagogy recast as truth‑seeking. The mentor‑student frame is familiar but individualized by tactile specifics (magnetite/quartz board, aurora’s correlation). The final renunciation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent rather than ornamental.</comment>
