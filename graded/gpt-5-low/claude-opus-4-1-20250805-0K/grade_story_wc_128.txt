<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Margot’s competence, quiet longing, and decisive choice to deliver the locket read as motivated and consistent. Interiority is specific (“breath caught,” the pull of the roofless library), though contradictions under pressure are gentle rather than fraught. Her shift from transactional broker to civic catalyst feels earned but lightly costed. Relationship dynamics with Martha are clean and moving, if swiftly resolved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The misaddressed envelope triggers Margot’s decision, which leads to Martha, to community teaching, to Margot’s repriced understanding; the because/therefore chain holds. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with a felt, if soft, cost (time, emotional labor, Samuel’s absence). Multiple time jumps compress beats but coherence and payoff remain intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harbor, roofless library, and night sky are vivid and POV‑filtered through a broker’s sensibility and the music’s afterglow. The library under stars charges the final image and the ongoing work. While setting doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, it meaningfully colors choice and theme, achieving strong integration. Sensory detail is economical and evocative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Margot remains a purely transactional broker or steps into stewardship—tightens through the delivery choice and its consequences. Escalation is modest; obstacles are minimal (Captain agrees; Martha is receptive), so the price is more reflective than contested. Still, the move from private ledger‑minding to public advocacy is a credible narrowing of identity. The final cadence reads as earned deepening rather than hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of unheralded labor, intergenerational teaching, and knowledge as “cargo” arise from action and recurring images (harbor, charts, books). The last paragraph leans explicit (“accounts balanced themselves…currencies beyond calculations”), bordering on moralizing. Subtext in the locket and estrangement carries real resonance, and the final image of pages’ whispers as symphony notes lingers. Slight over‑statement trims the top end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A steady close third with lyrical control; diction fits Margot’s pragmatic sensibility softened by awe. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, moving plot and revealing history. Rhythm modulates well across turns and compressions. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful lines with strong image economy (“knowledge weighed nothing in their holds”). Minor abstracting phrases appear late, but momentum and clarity hold. Figurative language is apt and not overstacked; no loops materially dull pressure. Copy is polished with varied sentence rhythms.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The roofless library and the broker reframing cargo as literacy offer a fresh synthesis. The misaddressed locket as catalyst is familiar but transformed by the maritime context and communal follow‑through. Emotional truth feels specific, if the arc remains comfort‑forward. A touch more friction would elevate originality’s bite.</comment>
