<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mae’s longing, embodied attention, and micro-choices (using the tear, the breath pattern, opening the camera to release images) are motivated and consistent. Internal conflict is gentle rather than oppositional, but the renunciation of her photographs registers as a credible cost. The ghost acts as catalyst rather than a competing will, keeping focus on Mae’s interior drive. Strong, if more devotional than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: sparks → ghost instruction → tear deployed → breath as key → door → choice to release images. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with tangible cost (surrendering years of images) and a charged final image. Single scene, clean anchors, and the hybrid causal/lyric lens holds. No unkept setups or contrived turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The viaduct, wisteria, and twilight are vivid and functionally necessary: the arch hosts the door and the blooms signal the locus. The camera obscura and lens become a micro-setting that literally changes what can be seen. World rules are learned by doing, and the final glow of the blooms recharges the last image. Sensory selection is precise and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes tighten from seeking to choosing: instead of taking revelation, she must give up her archive. The breath-pattern deepening and the door appearing constitute a meaningful pressure point. The price (releasing all the photographs and untold affections) is clear and irrevocable within this frame. Quiet tension, but escalates coherently under the hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of compassion, renunciation, and rechanneling unused love emerge organically through action and image. One line edges toward overt statement (“waiting to heal the world when it’s ready”), but the mothlike dissolving photographs do the heavier lifting. The final shift from “capture” to “release” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely tracks Mae’s perceptual signature—breath, light behavior, tactile handling of tools—without head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but charged and indirect. Rhythm modulates with pressure (breath shifts, humming viaduct) and remains controlled. Diction stays coherent with the piece’s sacred-technical tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with vivid images that carry multiple jobs (camera as revelation engine; photographs as offerings). Occasional high-register or mystical phrasing skirts purple but rarely clots momentum. Sentence variety and clean mechanics keep flow. No significant loops or scaffolding in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Camera obscura repurposed as a device for unveiling what light conceals, plus Kwan Yin’s tear and “unused love” as a repository, feels fresh and integrated. The turn from acquisition to offering is earned and non-obvious. Risks in tone and concept cohere and pay off in the final image. Memorable synthesis rather than a template collage.</comment>
