<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and role; her leadership and final unmasking register as an earned shift. Interiority is present but largely archetypal, with little contradiction or friction beyond duty vs. cost. The mask removal gives a tangible price and reconfiguration. Secondary characters apply minimal pressure, keeping the crucible narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the accumulative/textural lens holds: prophet → realization → night consecrations → protective response → unmasking. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a visible cost (exhaustion, vulnerability). Because/therefore linkages are clean even as pressure accrues texturally. The decisive turn to “act tonight” tightens the frame effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful worldbuilding (murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, crystalline pillars) filtered through POV priorities. Environment participates: the pavilion’s heart maps guide action; the parapet responds and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and cohesive; rules feel consistent. Setting meaningfully supports stakes and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“preserve the echoes”) is clear and tightened by the “act tonight” clock. Escalation is primarily accumulative—ritual after ritual—with little friction or reversal; success comes without visible resistance. The cost is mainly stamina and vulnerability at the end. A stronger on‑page obstacle would deepen pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of preservation, space‑making, and motion/stillness integrate with the action and recurring images. However, the prophet voices the thesis explicitly (“To preserve the echo…”), edging into didactic clarity and dampening subtext. The unmasking and “wind through infinite pages” give a resonant non‑literal answer, but some lines state what images already earn. Quiet ambiguity around price is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction is consistent and apt for the world. Dialogue is sparse but functional and aligned with status dynamics. Psychic distance remains steady; no head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between description and movement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong line‑level craft with clean syntax, varied rhythm, and efficient compression. Occasional repeated modifiers (“whisperfield calm,” “strangely honest”) and elevated diction flirt with ornament but don’t obscure clarity or momentum. Sentences often do multiple jobs without scaffolding. Final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet as memory, line walkers, and conjured clearings feel fresh and integrated. The ritual‑driven progression is elegant, though low resistance softens surprise. Conceptual synthesis of preservation via designed “spaces between” is non‑obvious and coherent. Risk‑taking is present in the invented lexicon and systems without tipping into confusion.</comment>
