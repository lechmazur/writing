<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s agency is clear and embodied through breath and laughter; her pause at the mirror‑ship and the harmonic decision register as a credible deepening. Internal contradiction is lighter—more awe than conflict—so the felt cost of the final shift is primarily conceptual. Still, her micro‑choices (calibrating laughter; choosing harmony) align with motives and reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: three‑ship pattern intensifies until the mirror‑twin forces a cadence break and the wick reverses. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the lighthouse’s function flips inward, redefining her role. The cost is implied rather than bodily, but the before/after is legible and charged.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Emerald Lighthouse and glass wick are specific, functional, and constrain choice—the TIR geometry channels and then reverses light to enable the resolution. Details (condensed starlight, emerald lens) filter through her practice, and the tool charges the final image. World rules stay consistent through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent: guide the lost and recover dawn’s function. Escalation is clean via the sequence of ships, with the mirror‑twin as the real tightening; the harmonic laughter forecloses a prior solo path. The price is more metaphysical than visceral, keeping tension elevated but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of navigation between potentialities, reflection, and shaping dawn from shadow arise organically from events and images, not thesis statements. The final reweighting—reality steering itself through her—resonates without moralizing. The headlines motif smartly refracts theme mid‑scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; scientific diction (total internal reflection) sits naturally inside her idiom. Psychic distance remains stable and modulates under pressure. No head‑hopping; brief dialogue is purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense but purposeful; images (standing wave, inverse laughter) are coherent and advance action. Minor risk of lushness, yet momentum holds and sentences vary in rhythm. Technical terms are accurate and integrated without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blend of physics optics with mythic lighthouse‑keeping and a mirror‑twin harmony is vivid and distinctive. Turns feel earned by the established pattern (ships 1–3 → reversal). The final inward‑shot light and “ancient shadows” dawn synthesis reads as fresh and inevitable.</comment>
