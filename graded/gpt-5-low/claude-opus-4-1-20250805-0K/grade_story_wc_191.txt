<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, and Anya’s methodical choices (scanner, laser, peeling layers) reveal character. However, internal conflict is minimal; she meets little resistance and experiences a relatively smooth realization rather than a pressured reckoning. Emotions are mostly conceptualized rather than embodied under stress. The dissolving flake registers as a modest cost but doesn’t test her in a fraught moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the layered murals, the ruby projection, and the dawn ritual accumulate toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is crisp from the opening and causality holds; each reveal reweights the quest’s premise. The cost is conceptual (renunciation of centralized power) with a tangible token (flake dissolution), landing cleanly. Pressure is gentle, but the end reconfigures the initial goal coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: kaleidoscopic waterfall, bioluminescent orchard, and the singing trees charge the final image. Environmental rules (UV paint, stored solar energy, dawn harmonics) integrate with the revelations rather than sitting as postcard detail. While the space doesn’t constrain tactical options tightly, the sunrise ritual meaningfully shapes the ending’s cadence. Specificity and atmosphere are consistently filtered through Anya’s task‑orientation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled (find the stairway by sunrise), and escalation occurs via successive, reweighting reveals. Yet pressure remains low: no counterforce, no narrowing of options beyond time, and the deadline reinterprets rather than presses tactics. The main turn (founders’ intentional refusal) lands but with limited on‑page price. The resolution is earned, if contemplative rather than contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of distributed power, communal knowledge, and restraint are strongly integrated with images (data‑throne, scattered fragments, orchard song). However, the text occasionally states the thesis outright (“not a place but a choice”), trimming subtext. The final image resonates and reweights prior material without resolving into banality. Good coherence; a shade didactic in lines that could have let images carry more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is steady and apt, the diction cleanly fused with a lyrical SF register. Narrative confidence stays within Anya’s plausible knowledge and maintains a distinct perceptual signature. Minor expository sentences flatten rhythm at peaks, but overall modulation supports the accumulative turn. Dialogue is minimal yet purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled, with vivid imagery and efficient action‑integration; sentences carry multiple jobs without padding. Occasional on‑the‑nose statements and a few elevated phrases nudge toward purple but do not blur clarity. Rhythm varies well from tactile action to reflective beats. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The data‑throne as a monument to refusal and the seeded fragments compelling interdependence offer a fresh, thoughtful angle. Familiar SF elements (orbital elevator, murals as archive) are recombined with thematic integrity. The closure synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Not radically risky, but confidently original within its frame.</comment>
