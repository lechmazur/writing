<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marlow’s motive (to find Elena’s journal and “the color of sound”) is clear and drives each beat to the ritual. Interiority is specific and embodied through synesthetic perception rather than labels. The final acceptance of the luminous vows forecloses her former hiding, though the felt cost remains subtle. Absence of on‑page interpersonal pressure limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing as lanterns become doorways and Elena’s dispersed consciousness reframes reality. Orientation is clean early; the sequence of discovery → reading → ritual → response builds coherently. The cost is conceptual (giving up concealment and taking on a calling) rather than materially dramatized but lands. No causality breaks or teleports under the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sunken ship library, barnacled hatch, and phosphorescent masts are vivid and tightly filtered through Marlow’s sensoria. Setting actively supplies the journal and frames the ritual, with the lanterns and key charging the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and balanced beyond the visual. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claiming or rejecting the luminous vows—is present early and tightens as the ritual escalates perception to revelation. The decisive turn comes with speaking Elena’s name and accepting the vows, which deepens options into responsibility. The price is more inferred than dramatized on the page, keeping the escalation strong but not searing. Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of revelation versus concealment and the ethics of perception emerge from concrete acts (key, lanterns, vows) rather than sermonizing, though one line (“The world wasn’t ready…”) edges toward telling. Subtext in “truth that hides behind truth” reweights the ending image. The final welcome reframes her work without tidy moral. Resonance is earned and lingers, if a touch declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (cross‑sensory diction) and controlled rhythm that modulates at the ritual peak. No head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience; inference reads as inference. The brief spoken lines fit voice and function as action. Lyric compression is taught early and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid but controlled metaphors (“meteor hush”) and few redundancies. Rhythm varies; images do double duty for mood and plot. One or two statements verge on abstraction, but clarity and propulsion hold. No significant artifact loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthetic ritual, drowned archives, and vows as wavelength contracts feels fresh and integral. Elena’s dispersed consciousness among frequencies is a strong turn earned by prior particulars. Risks in diction and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. A slightly deeper on‑page cost would push it into the exceptional band.</comment>
