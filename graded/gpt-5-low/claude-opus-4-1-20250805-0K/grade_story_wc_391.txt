<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kira’s drive is precise and embodied: the “wildness” versus chosen patience creates a credible internal contradiction resolved through micro‑choices (slow breathing, methodical placement of rods). Motivation is concrete (seventeen winters, lunar charts) and actions align under pressure. The visible cost skews conceptual and endurance‑based rather than immediate peril, but it reads earned for this scope. Tomás supports rather than dilutes her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative texture): rain → freeze → polarity window → rods → field shift → failed synchronization. Orientation is crisp by the opening paragraph, and the closure lands on‑page with the viaduct’s pulse and settled “new configuration.” Cost is implied (risk, exhaustion, social upheaval) more than dramatized in-scene, trimming peak impact. Still, the decisive change is clear and organically prepared.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and copper rods are not decorative; the freeze and basalt cracks directly constrain tactics. Sensory specifics (ice glaze, meteorite iron, moon angle) are purposeful and filtered through a mapper’s priorities. Weather/time and terrain charge the final image and the method. Rich without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (disrupt the Council’s synchronization) is clear and tightens through the timed window and circuit‑completion. Escalation is quiet but present: assembling the circuit, coordinating multiple sanctuaries, and the field’s palpable shift. The price is largely endurance and the risk of social fallout, with little pushback on the page, softening bite. Still, agency drives the turn and narrows options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The patient‑revolution motif accrues through water/ice and moon‑tracking and culminates in a soft, systemic change rather than spectacle. Occasional thesis lines (“The revolution would not be loud”) edge toward statement, but they’re supported by concrete ritual and final image repricing. The ending offers a resonant answer via transformation that feels both intimate and societal. The restraint keeps sentiment in check.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to Kira; diction and rhythm match a mapper’s measured attention. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and distinct enough to not blur voice. Psychic distance is steady, with purposeful cadence modulation at the climax. No head‑hopping or withholding artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image‑dense without tipping into purple; lines tend to do multiple jobs (world rule, mood, and intent). Minimal scaffold, strong verbs, and economical technical detail (angles, hours). A few aphoristic turns risk over‑articulation but remain anchored by action. Closure image is lucid and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of geomagnetic infrastructure, lunar cartography, and a stealth de‑sync revolution feels fresh. Stakes are large but rendered through tactile ritual rather than trope‑driven confrontation. The copper‑rod circuit and 73‑hour polarity window supply specific ingenuity. The originality grows from character method and patience rather than a mere premise twist.</comment>
