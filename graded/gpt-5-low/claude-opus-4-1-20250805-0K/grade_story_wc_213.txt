<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority grounds Mara’s choice—her preference for “listening over noise” is dramatized, not told, and culminates in choosing the bell over the switch. The contradictory impulses (modern system vs. tradition; clear skies vs. ominous readings) operate simultaneously. The cost is mostly reputational/credibility and remains implied rather than dramatized on the page. Still, her micro‑choices (kneeling, sensing vibration, selecting the bell first) reveal a coherent value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: anomalous readings and sensory cues therefore push Mara to ring the bell, therefore evacuation, therefore avalanche impact with mitigated harm. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. Closure lands on the page with the evacuation lights and avalanche, though the price is more conceptual than viscerally paid. “Zero hour had arrived” cleanly marks the tightening pivot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary above the clouds and the “solstice hush” are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered, and the bell rope functions as an object‑as‑setting that constrains choice. Environmental factors (sound travel, altitude, stillness) shape tactics and the final image (“ice crystals that chimed like a thousand tiny bells”). Details like absent cats/ravens deepen atmosphere and pressure. The setting charges both the decision and the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (lives vs. credibility/false alarm) are signaled early and escalated by the stone vibration and animal flight. The decisive tightening is Mara’s choice to pull the bell before flipping the switch, a trade‑off that risks being disbelieved in “perfect weather.” Cost is present but primarily implied, keeping this just shy of higher bands. Tension remains coherent and grows under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of old wisdom vs. modern certainty and listening vs. noise emerge organically through action (bell first, then sirens) and are reweighted in the final crystalline image. A single on‑the‑nose line (“they would understand why she had chosen to listen…”) slightly flattens the subtext. Otherwise, resonance is earned via particulars (stone hum, animals gone, rope in hand). The ending offers a quiet repricing of authority and trust.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is steady, third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to weather and sound. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. Elision is minimal and purposeful; inference reads as inference. The voice remains character‑bound and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑driven, and economical; sensory precision supports momentum. A few elevated phrasings flirt with purple but stay coherent and grounded in the POV. No significant loops or scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs. Opening and closing images align and land musically without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a high‑altitude sanctuary, “solstice hush,” and a storm‑siren tester choosing an ancient bell feels fresh and specific. The avalanche originating from within the mountain reframes threat origin intriguingly. Risks are taken in tone and concept without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads earned and memorable.</comment>
