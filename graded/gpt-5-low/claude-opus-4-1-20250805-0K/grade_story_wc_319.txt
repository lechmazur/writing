<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and embodied: homesickness and feral adaptation contend with duty. Micro-choices (revealing herself, surrendering the pendant, choosing to leave) align with those pressures. The internal contradiction—guardian versus exile yearning—feels lived rather than declared. Slight softness: the trust leap with the scholar faces minimal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: scholar arrives → request → guardian’s reveal and choice → pendant transfer → Codex opened → departure. Orientation is crisp from the first third, and each step narrows options. Closure lands on-page with cost: she abandons post and self-definition to risk “not knowing if you’ll arrive whole.” The persistent constraint of the sealed winter and the pendant’s rules shape tactics to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen garden and impossible library are specific, tactile, and rule-consistent. The environment constrains choices (sealing traps her; mist and topiary enable concealment) and charges the final image via thaw. Object-as-setting (pendant) and space geometry affect access to the Codex. Sensory selection matches urgency without touristic clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape/rescue vs. guardianship) is clear and tightens when the Codex can take “two,” forcing a trade: leave or remain. The cost is legible—surrendering pendant, post, and bodily adaptations for uncertain wholeness. Escalation is mostly internal and gentle rather than contested, but it coheres and deepens. Resolution stems from her agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Boundaries of light/uncertainty, exile, and guardianship weave into a resonant close without moralizing. Recurring images (frost, mist, obsidian, light) reweight meaning at the end as “light…dissolving” boundaries. The piece earns its insight: choosing uncertainty as home. Ambiguity invites reflection while avoiding vagueness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical third-limited voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias (cold, geometry, edges). Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at turns without leakage. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image-rich, and purposeful; lines often do double duty for world and mood. Figurative language is coherent (light boundaries, winter interiorized) without purple excess. Momentum holds; no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors in the peak beats. Rhythm varies well from lyric observation to crisp action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: feral librarian, dimensional parasites, pendant as light-boundary lens, and a thawing closure image. Turns feel inevitable from seeded particulars rather than gimmick. Emotional truth—yearning versus duty—grounds the speculative conceit. Risk-taking in tone and world pays off with clarity.</comment>
