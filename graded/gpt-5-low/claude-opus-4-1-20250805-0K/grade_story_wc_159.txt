<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motive and method are clear and character‑particular, and her actions align under pressure (rituals, swift adaptation to capture the name). Interiority is embodied through tactile work and the chime’s “foxglove regret.” Limited contradiction or flaw beyond solitude keeps her arc steady rather than deeply knotted. The final stance shift (“bridges to remembrance”) feels earned by on‑page effort and cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the chime’s altered resonance triggers a focused, because/therefore sequence toward capture. Closure lands with cost (the bamboo’s final split) and a reweighted understanding of her work. Anchors are clear early; the scene tightens from discovery to preservation without drift. The cadence shift at the end converts monument‑keeping into active rebellion against oblivion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Atmosphere and specificity are rich and functional: the opal library, glass orchids, and cracked bamboo aren’t postcards but working tools. The environment (resonance chamber, ceremonial lamp) constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered through a caretaker’s craft. World rules (preserving sensations in orchids) stay consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused: capture the name before the chime fails. Escalation is clean and on‑page—the lighting widens the crack, tightening the clock and forcing quicker, risk‑accepting work. The price (loss of the chime) is felt, and agency resolves the conflict. A single, strong deepening beat suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance versus oblivion arises from concrete acts (crafting the orchid, wall of names). The final reframe is resonant, though the line “not monuments to loss, but bridges to remembrance” edges into explicit statement. Subtext (solitude, ritual as resistance) is otherwise earned through particulars. The ending image lingers without sermonizing beyond that one tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with lyrical control and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction suits the world and pressures without head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates well from calm ritual to urgent capture. No dialogue is needed; voice carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly disciplined; metaphors like “foxglove regret” are precise and evocative. Minimal scaffolding, strong verb choices, and clean sequencing sustain momentum. A few lines approach thematic declaration but do not bog the cadence. No loops or figurative muddle at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass‑orchid archive of extinct sensations and the bamboo‑borne resonance feel fresh and integrated. The turn—name found at the cost of the instrument—lands as inevitable and specific to this world. The piece risks lyric density without losing clarity. Calvino‑adjacent vibes are transformed by concrete, tactile craft.</comment>
