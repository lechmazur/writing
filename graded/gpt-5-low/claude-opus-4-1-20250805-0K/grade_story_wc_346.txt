<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive (buying humanity moments) is clear and personal, and his micro‑choices—touching the puppet, climbing, placing it in the lens, singing—reveal character under pressure. The inheritance moment (“I vouchsafe this burden…”) credibly reconfigures his role. Internal conflict is present but soft; he accepts the burden with little friction or visible cost beyond fatigue and voice crack. A touch more resistance or price on the page would deepen credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → realization → ritual enactment → reweighted world image. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the doomsday clock moves backward and his method transmutes from calculation to lullaby; the price is the lifelong burden he assumes. Orientation is clean, and the puppet’s installation in the lens is a decisive act that pays off prior patterns. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of the absolute top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse and lens materially constrain and enable the action; the final image depends on the setting’s physicality (lens, beam, dusk). Sensory selection is vivid and purposeful (“bruised plum and copper,” “pane of hush”), filtered through Marcus’s pattern‑attuned mind. The world‑rule of refracted time through the lens emerges through use, not exposition. The object‑as‑setting synergy with the puppet head charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are dominant and coherent: adjust the manner of humanity’s end. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge and tactic (from microsecond adjustments to song) rather than clash; it tightens once around the vouchsafe and the climb. The lack of on‑page resistance or credible cost beyond acceptance softens tension. Still, the decisive act is protagonist‑driven and reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of inherited trauma, kintsugi‑like repair, and tenderness in ending arise organically from the puppet’s flaws and the lighthouse ritual. The lullaby avoids didacticism by being dramatized, though “you are not alone” edges toward sentimentality; it works as in‑world song rather than moral. The final image conceptually reprices apocalypse as care. Strong coherence without overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to nested patterns. POV remains tight and plausible; the diction, while elevated, feels character‑specific for a contemplative specialist. Quoted lines are sparing and purposeful. Minor risk of authorial glow, but it supports pressure rather than diluting it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with mostly clean rhythm; images often do double duty (cracks as map and conduit). A few metaphor stacks flirt with purple but maintain coherence and momentum. Minimal scaffolding and no damaging loops; syntax varies to match cadence shifts. Final lines land crisply without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—doomsday adjustment via lullaby through a lighthouse lens and a broken puppet talisman—is fresh and feels inevitable by the end. Risks (lyric register, mythic stakes) heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. Turns grow from prior particulars (cracks → refracted time; adjuster → singer). Memorable originality with conceptual integrity.</comment>
