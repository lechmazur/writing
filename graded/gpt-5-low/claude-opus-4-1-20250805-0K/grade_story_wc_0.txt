<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena’s motivation is clear and consistent, evolving from escape to devotion, with a decisive renunciation (resignation) that costs her status and security. Interiority is specific to her scientific lens, though the internal conflict feels a bit too frictionless given the career stakes. The supervisor’s “career suicide” call provides embodied pressure but the moment passes quickly without deeper contradiction surfacing on the page. Still, micro‑choices (skipping meetings, setting up stations) align cleanly with her reoriented values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterns of dust and decay build toward a Conceptual Repricing where observation replaces theatrics, with the resignation as the on‑page cost. Orientation is anchored early (greenhouse post‑flood), and causality is coherent across weeks. The demolition threat and subsequent postponement give the final cadence a tangible consequence. Closure lands through a reweighted paradigm with a visible price (career, community standing).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The storm‑damaged greenhouse is vividly rendered and functionally central—the broken panels, mud, and air currents shape what can be observed and learned. The butterfly dust physically charges the space and final image. Environmental specificity maps directly to her method and choices (abandoning lab tools for lived observation). Strong economy and plausibility with a scientist’s filter throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to practice science post‑catastrophe) tightens as butterflies multiply, patterns complexify, and institutional pressures mount. The renunciation of the neutron star project forecloses a live option with acknowledged cost, and the demolition clock adds external pressure. Escalation is quiet but legible under the accumulative lens. Some beats (colleagues’ “theatrical mourning”) tilt rhetorical, softening felt resistance in the decisive moment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thematically strong synthesis—patient observation versus performative drama—earned through concrete particulars (dust mapping air currents, predicting structural failure). Subtext works best in the observational method becoming an ethic. However, the closing thesis (“Decay is not drama. It is instruction.”) states the moral too explicitly, undercutting the resonance that the images already achieved. The piece invites reflection, but the stated moral trims complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is steady, lucid, and character‑specific, blending scientific lexicon with sensuous attention to environment. Rhythm modulates well between image and assertion, sustaining a contemplative cadence. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference reads plausibly. A few abstracted phrases skim the surface of essayistic register, but clarity and texture hold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑driven, and efficient; lines often do double duty (science metaphor grounded in mold and dust). Minimal redundancy and good momentum for a reflective mode. Figurative language stays coherent and controlled; no muddled metaphors in peak beats. Occasional concept restatements (“preprocess reality”) approach summary but don’t stall the final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original fusion of astrophysical sensibility with post‑flood botany and micro‑aerodynamics feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The butterfly dust as a data‑ethic is a memorable reframing. Risks (quiet, accumulative design; anti‑theatrics stance) pay off with coherence. Slightly didactic final line tempers the afterglow.</comment>
