<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific motives (severed ties to serve this calling) and embodied choices (placing the shadow against her chest) reveal a credible inner life. The contradiction—tender caretaker who must also be absence—adds tension. However, she rarely falters; high competence smooths struggle, slightly lowering stakes on her micro-choices. The relationship pressure is one-sided (shadows), limiting crucible effect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: encroachment → ritual → release → charged reprise with the ring. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she recommits to the costly role, with isolation and scars as price. Orientation is clean early; one continuous scene supports the cadence shift as another shadow begins. The cost is legible in “some teachers must become absence itself” and the ring’s heat at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: charcoal pillars, ashen sanctuary, absent roof with starlight that “defines the shadows” integrate with action. The doorknocker ring functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. While the environment shapes tone more than tactical constraints, it consistently filters perception and meaning. World rules (shadows with scars) stay coherent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one dominant stake—tend and transform a suffocating shadow—and tightens as she decides to act despite “not ready.” The ritual costs are conceptual (ongoing isolation) rather than jeopardy-driven, yielding a quiet but authentic escalation. A small cadence turn occurs when the shadow strengthens and another approaches, reweighting endurance as her stance. Lack of a sharper on-page trade-off or loss keeps it below top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thresholds, absence/presence, and breathing-as-release emerge organically through recurrent images (ring, scars, stars) and the enacted method. The final image reweights prior material without a tidy moral, suggesting necessary endings as invitations. Occasional explicit statements (“some teachers must become absence itself”) brush up against telling but mostly serve clarity. Resonance lingers through the cost of solitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature sustains throughout. Diction and rhythm fit the character’s solemn vocation, with brief dialogue that carries subtext. Psychic distance stays stable and purposeful; no head-hopping or unearned certainty. Elision patterns are taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, selective imagery, and motifs that do multiple jobs (scar, ring, breath). The figurative field is coherent (wounds, thresholds, breath) with minimal overwriting. A few near-repetitions (“breathing requires emptiness,” “loaded emptiness”) flirt with redundancy but maintain charge. Rhythm varies well, sustaining momentum without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “shadow keeper” vocation, doorknocker-as-threshold relic, and “linking through scars” method feel striking and specific. Risks in quiet, ritualized conflict pay off with a fresh synthesis and a memorable final image. Emotional truth (the cost of chosen absence) undergirds the conceit. Minor familiarity in “burning bridges” is offset by the reimagined application.</comment>
