<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—Elena seeks the “frequency of betrayal”—and her actions (activating the forge, imprinting absences) align. Interiority is specific, filtered through synesthesia and grief without therapy-speak. The change to acceptance feels earned, though internal contradiction (doubt vs. compulsion) stays mostly implicit rather than dramatized under direct pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (aurora, shipwrecks, orchard, cells) densifies toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure lands on the page with cost—she reweights betrayal/faith and accepts a reframed inheritance. Orientation is clear early, and the forge process provides a coherent because/therefore spine inside the lyric.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Arctic, sunken orchard, and ring of shipwrecks are vividly rendered and functionally integrated—the forge’s availability drives tactics; the hull’s groan charges pressure. Details are POV-filtered and evolve with action. The final image is environment-charged (hand on ashen forge, aurora’s “song”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused (hear betrayal’s sound), and pressure coheres via the forge ritual and the graveyard of ships as thematic counterforce. Escalation is a textural deepening rather than overt narrowing, but the imprinting step and the delayed “hearing” provide a meaningful tightening. The price is an internal reconfiguration of grief into acceptance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of absence, memory, and trust braid through concrete particulars (forge, negative space, cellular division) and culminate in a resonant revaluation: breaking and birthing share a frequency. It avoids sermonizing; the realization arises from enacted method. One line edges toward explicitness, but it remains earned by prior images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and image selection; the perceptual signature (sound-as-color) stays consistent. No head-hopping or stance wobble; the diction suits a meticulous, grief-tempered maker. Cadence modulates cleanly into the final charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; images multitask and momentum holds. A few dense metaphors (cell division, “tumors of stress”) flirt with excess but do not blur causality or the closure image. Sentence variety and line economy are strong, with minimal scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an underwater orchard, a forge that imprints absence, and synesthetic acoustics of betrayal. Risks (silence collection, cellular time) cohere and feel inevitable by the end. The conceptual turn is non-obvious yet grounded in enacted process.</comment>
