<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s duty-versus-freedom conflict is concrete and embodied: giving away the walnut binds her by choice while she longs to leave. Interiority is specific (“offhandedly exact,” clumsy but precise movements) and refracts through action. Micro-choices—lying to save, guiding with light, relinquishing the seed—align with motive and reveal hierarchy of values. The reluctance is felt without hedging into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: frost clock + birds + travelers → guide-through tactic → seed handoff → earned stasis at frost seal. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses leaving by ensuring the seed remains outside, with cost explicit. Orientation is clean early; the blueprint backstory tightens the stake rather than derailing scene. No major causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, inverted trees, and encroaching frost aren’t ornamental; they constrain options and drive tactics. The western gate and frost seal the scene’s cadence and final image. Details are selective and POV-colored, avoiding tourist catalog. The environment’s logic stays consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the travelers under time/bird pressure) is signaled and tightened by the frost countdown. The meaningful turn is the seed handoff, which imposes a lasting cost and resolves the immediate crisis. Escalation is quiet but coherent under a situational lens; no deus ex machina. A touch more on-the-page jeopardy in transit could have sharpened pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: lies that are also truths, caretaking as self-imposed bond, inversion (trees, duty). The walnut reweights meaning at the end, and the frost seal underscores earned endurance over neat release. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the charged poise of “perhaps tomorrow.” The blueprint adds a larger ethical frame without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is steady, lyrical without drift, and plausibly filtered through Mara’s perceptions and competencies. Dialogue is functional and natural, carrying subtext (the lie of shelter that’s true because she prepared it). Rhythm modulates with action; no head-hopping or stance slips. Elevated diction feels earned by the fable-like world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffolding; imagery is vivid but controlled. No significant loops or figurative muddle in peak beats; syntax varies to maintain propulsion. A few phrases echo (graceless/clumsy) by design, not redundancy. Copy is clean and momentum consistent through the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The inverted orchard, air-etched paths, and mechanical birds synthesize into a distinctive ecology of duty and constraint. The walnut’s ethical calculus feels fresh and character-specific. Risks are taken in concept and tone without obscuring clarity. The closure’s quiet charge feels earned rather than templated.</comment>
