<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Cassia’s motives (failed revolutionary turned guardian of an extinct people) are clear and embodied; her rekindled fire against “protocols” plays credibly against her tempered sorrow. Interiority is particular (“poems she'd written in prison,” reading temporal currents like tactical maps) and actions align with stakes. The relationship dynamic with Huang is legible, with a status shift when he moves from refusal to curiosity. The cost and inner contradiction are present but soft; she faces little real risk on the page beyond moral defiance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive: a causal negotiation deepens into a textural reveal (ghosts via shard) and resolves in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing as Cassia commits to “resurrection.” Orientation is swift and clean; the scene holds one clear arc. Closure lands with a decisive stance that reweights the collection and future actions, though the cost remains largely conceptual. The beats link because→therefore without teleports or resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific (Versailles-on-asteroid, visible timestreams, gilded cherubs, draped mirrors) and filtered through Cassia’s trained perceptions. The environment charges choices: the shard refracts visible time to produce the ghosts; the approaching temporal storm modulates urgency and image. Rules feel consistent and learned in action rather than dumped. It stops just short of physically constraining tactics on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control and reframing of the Venusian collection versus institutional protocol—is clear early. Escalation arrives with Cassia’s demonstration (ghosts) and proposal, shifting Huang to conditional acceptance. The price is ethical and reputational rather than immediate, so pressure feels gentler than the rhetoric implies. Still, the turn is protagonist-driven and narrows the path forward to a concrete plan.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of preservation, defeat reconfigured as seed for victory, and revolution as imaginative reconstruction arise organically from object, world, and choice. Subtext hums in the mirrors’ covered possibilities and Cassia’s prison-poet lens. A line like “the most profound revolutions happen…in the imagination” edges toward telling, slightly flattening the resonance. The final image (“sorrow…burnished bright by time’s passage”) restores nuance and charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and close-third with a distinct perceptual signature—tactical metaphors and lyric diction feel earned by Cassia’s past. Dialogue advances pressure and reveals status without slipping into exposition-heavy chatter. Rhythm modulates well at the ghost reveal and at closure. No head-hopping or register drift undermines credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; images like “ribbons of amber light” and “mirrors don’t show our faces—they show our possibilities” carry weight without clutter. Sentences vary in length and do multi-task (world, character, tone). A few declarative thematic lines slightly overstate, but momentum largely holds. No figurative muddle or scaffold loops dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Visible time, baroque asteroid Versailles, and alien souls in crystal memory maps synthesize into a fresh frame. The revolutionary-turned-poet mediator is a non-obvious, organic angle that reframes the archeological dispute. Turns arise from prior particulars (refracting time through the shard) rather than late gimmicks. Boldness is high without obscuring clarity.</comment>
