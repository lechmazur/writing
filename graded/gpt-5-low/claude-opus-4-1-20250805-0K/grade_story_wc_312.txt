<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and particular—restore the fish by re‑voicing a bell—and her choices under pressure are consistent with her modest power. Embodied details (palms on stone, exhaustion, burned savings) ground her. Internal conflict is limited; she largely believes and perseveres without a fraught contradictory impulse on the page. Still, the cost (social alienation, physical depletion) reads and the final stance feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: dew rate → viaduct resonance → suspended third drop → overlap of realms → partial restoration. Orientation is crisp early, and the single scene tightens around the “third drop” beat as the decisive turn. Closure lands with a concrete change (fish return) and a lingering cost (“not all of them,” Mira’s collapse). The Causal lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct functions as a massive tuning fork that constrains tactics (dawn humidity, dew rate), directly charging the final image of the bell humming. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through Mira’s acoustic/magical priorities. World rules are learned via action rather than dump. The object‑as‑setting integration is exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and pressured: can Mira restore the ocean without catastrophic collision. Escalation is cleanly staged through the three‑drop structure with the suspended third as a meaningful tightening. The price is present but soft (partial return, exhaustion) rather than a wrenching trade‑off. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not bail her out.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of precision over power, patience, and belief emerge organically through the ritual and her calibrated “weakness.” However, the final paragraph articulates the thesis explicitly (“Sometimes the cosmos needed not power but precision…”), blunting subtext and inducing a moralizing echo. The imagery otherwise carries resonance (broken bell as lighthouse) without needing the stated moral. The story invites reflection on cost and humility, but the spelled‑out takeaway trims its loft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical, confident third‑limited voice with a tangible perceptual signature (acoustic and material attention). Distance remains stable; no head‑hopping; exposition aligns with what Mira could plausibly infer. Rhythm modulates well at pressure beats (the drops, the shimmer). Slight explanatory tilt near the end is the only minor drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines are clean, vivid, and purposeful; the cadence accelerates through the drop sequence and breathes at resolution. Occasional elevated generalities and the thematic summation add a hint of overwriting but do not obscure clarity. Information density is high, with minimal scaffold. Imagery and syntax avoid muddle in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The acoustic cosmology—dew‑timed bells, viaduct as tuning fork, mediocre magic as the perfect tool—feels fresh and internally necessary. The twist that weakness equals precision is earned by particulars. Risks (scientific‑lyric fusion, single technical ritual as set piece) pay off without gimmickry. Concept and character cohere into a distinctive vision.</comment>
