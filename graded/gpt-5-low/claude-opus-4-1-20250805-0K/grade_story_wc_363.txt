<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mei’s motive—recovering her trafficked daughter—is urgent, concrete, and drives every choice on the page. Interiority is specific (the silence “tasting” memories) and embodied through what she surrenders. The tension between maternal resolve and the cost of losing her own memories creates credible internal conflict. The final Earned Stasis (smiling, nameless) is paid for by prior beats and lands as a believable price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning causal: bead → loom → weaving → memory cost → proof bead; the chain is coherent and escalates to an on‑page price. Orientation is clean early (orchard, bamboo canopy, heirloom loom), and the backstory blocks actively adjust present stakes. Closure is unmistakable: the message succeeds and Mei’s identity is the cost, crystallized in the new amber bead. No unkept setups or convenience resolutions undermine causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bamboo‑swallowed orchard and the loom/bead as micro‑setting are vivid and purposeful, filtering through a craft‑tuned gaze. Environment and objects constrain options—the loom is the only viable means; the bead anchors the message and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and tied to urgency (light through bamboo, rot of pears, the hum of the frame). World rules (weaving for memory) are learned through action rather than exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear from the outset and tightens as the silence actively tests and consumes cherished memories. Escalation is driven by Mei’s agency at the loom; each pass narrows her remaining self until her name is forfeited. The decisive turn arrives as she uses the amber thread to send her daughter’s name, after which her options are foreclosed. The cost is visible and lasting, with no soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of intergenerational sacrifice, communication beyond language, and the ethics of cost emerge organically from particulars (puzzle note: “She weaves what cannot be spoken”). The raveling silence functions as both mechanic and metaphor, avoiding sermonizing. The final bead reweights the premise into a resonant answer: some messages demand self‑erasure. Ambiguity lingers productively in the commodification of memory and legacy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensorially confident without overreach. Patterned diction (loom, thread, silence) is taught early and modulates under pressure. No head‑hopping; inference remains within Mei’s plausible knowing. Elevation fits the fable‑adjacent register while staying grounded in concrete action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum; images are fresh and coherent (“silence… raveled,” “amber bead… stoically sparkling”). No scaffold loops or template cadences dull pressure; rhythm breathes where needed and tightens at the loom sequence. Figurative density supports rather than muddies, and the final image is crisp. Copy is clean with precise verbs and purposeful repetition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaving, memory‑for‑message barter, bamboo‑claimed orchard, and amber proof feels distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. The rummage‑sale puzzle breadcrumb refreshes the call‑to‑quest. High‑risk lyric mode is executed with discipline, tying novelty to lived stakes. Turns and world logic are grounded in character choice rather than late rule drops.</comment>
