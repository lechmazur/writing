<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miriam’s conflicted return—skepticism versus the pull of recognition—reads specific and embodied, with micro-choices (following Yakov, fitting the gnomon, deciding to map) revealing values. The grandmother’s legacy exerts gentle pressure without absolving Miriam of choice. Emotional texture is credible and layered, though the turn toward recommitment edges tidy. The visible cost is subtle but present: she forecloses drift for labor and rootedness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, images deepen toward closure when Miriam fits the gnomon and reads the names, reweighting time and belonging. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/CR): she commits to months of rebuilding and mapping, accepting a new rule of time. Cost is implied but legible in her renunciation of wandering and embrace of work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and tactically present: careful steps around bones, roots as pillars, fruit falling among the dead. The sundial and light/shadow actively shape choice and the final image. Details are selective and charged (pomegranates against marble angels; bees in an ossuary), filtering through Miriam’s sensibility. The setting’s logic remains consistent and thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure tightens from passive return to active recommitment when the gnomon appears and the names are revealed. The conflict is internal and situational, cohering without an antagonist. Stakes are personal—purpose versus drift—and escalate appropriately under the accumulative lens. The price is quiet but real: choosing labor and rooted time over suspended journeys.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of cyclical time, diaspora return, and life interlaced with death arise from particulars (the sundial marked by names; roots as pillars). Subtext carries through Yakov’s method and the orchard’s adaptations. One line leans declarative (“faith not in the divine but in the persistence of growth”), but it’s earned by scene work. The final shadow image reanswers the opening’s uncertainty with layered resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third holds steady; diction and rhythm suit the material. Dialogue sounds natural and purposeful, advancing discovery and subtext (“We learned to read the new paths”). The perceptual signature (time, shadow, root, bone) is distinct without affectation. Psychic distance modulates smoothly at turns without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is taut and image-rich with minimal redundancy; figurative language stays coherent and grounded in the world’s logic. Variations in syntax and paragraphing support momentum from discovery to commitment. No notable scaffold or loop artifacts. A high-density lyrical mode risks saturation but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and sundial inscribed with diaspora names feel original and inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis of interrupted journeys with a literalized timekeeper is fresh and thematically tight. Risk lies in the quiet, image-led closure, which the piece executes with confidence. The final reweighting of “time” and “home” stands out as inventive and earned.</comment>
