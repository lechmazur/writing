<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s motives are clear and layered: grief, craft integrity, and survival catalyze a credible renunciation of her public life. Interiority is specific to a glass artist’s sensibility, with the frost/glass microstructures grounding emotion in craft detail. The choice to let the world mourn her reads as a real cost, not a rhetorical flourish. A few thesis-like lines (“Beauty born from poison”) edge toward neatness but remain earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the start (canyon, night, arson aftermath), and the scene holds a Hybrid drive with an Accumulative/Textural dominance at the end. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she elects to end the poisoned legacy and pursue a new, safe practice while remaining “dead.” Cost is on the page in the abandonment of identity and acceptance of danger in warning others. The ledger-to-frost turn binds causality and texture without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The canyon, frost, stars, and stone are tactically relevant: the isolation enables her to hide, the frost patterns inspire the new artistic ethic, and the final image is charged by environment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-specific (glass microstructures, kiln, sand). The setting evolves with dawn, mirroring her internal shift without feeling schematic. It stops short of physical constraint, but it decisively charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are unified around legacy and safety: destroy vs. use the ledger, hide vs. act. Escalation is internal but tangible: the uranium revelation deepens, then the decision to be “dead” forecloses a path with cost. The cadence tightens as dawn arrives, reweighting her options. The lack of a direct external antagonist on the page keeps pressure modest, but the ethical calculus lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of beauty vs. harm, inheritance vs. self-determination, and transformation through time accumulate organically through frost and glass motifs. The ending reframes luminescence as harmless, transient radiance, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. A couple of lines articulate the thesis outright, slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Marina’s technical lens; diction and rhythm suit a reflective, high-stakes lull. Psychic distance is steady; no head-hopping or register drift. Compression is purposeful and pays off in the charged final image. Absence of dialogue is fitting and not missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean syntax, varied rhythm, and strong image economy drive momentum without padding. A few lines reiterate theme (“No radiation needed. No poisoned legacy.”) a touch too declaratively, but they do not stall the scene. Figurative language is largely coherent and grounded in craft and weather. The final cadence is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Uranium glass as poisoned legacy, arson-as-erasure, and frost as a new aesthetic ethic feel fresh in combination. The pivot from deadly luminescence to ephemeral, harmless glow is a smart, surprising repricing that fits the character. Risks are taken in committing to a quiet, reflective closure without external fireworks, and they pay off. Familiar materials (grief, inheritance) are made specific through vocation and setting.</comment>
