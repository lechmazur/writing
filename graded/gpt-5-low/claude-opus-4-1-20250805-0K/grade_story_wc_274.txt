<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vera’s competing loyalties (oath vs truth) are dramatized through concrete micro-choices—the five-point biometric gauntlet, triggering the cascade failure—and culminate in a costly commitment. Interiority is specific and embodied (breath fog, gloved palm, steady pulse) rather than abstract labels. Her competence under pressure never erases conflict; the “terrible peace” at the end reads as earned stasis with visible cost. A hairline gap is the relative ease of her execution under active threat; a moment of stumble or near‑abort could further deepen character pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: illicit letter → decision → activation sequence → upload clock vs security clock → deliberate cooling failure → arrival of guards at completion. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she accepts the cost as security turns the corner while the release becomes unstoppable. Orientation is crisp from line one (who/where/when), and the drive lens remains Causal through the end. The cost is on-page and undeniable; only minor note is that external resistance arrives late.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cryogenic vault, quantum‑locked passages, titanium floors, and heat‑sensitive ink are vivid, functional, and constrain choices; the cooling system becomes a tactical lever at the climax. Environmental specificity (−196 degrees; harmonics the AI reads as breach/maintenance) feels plausibly integrated and charges the final image. Snow as recurring environmental pressure coheres tone and closure. The piece avoids museum‑tour description; details serve action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release of contraband truths vs duty and punishment) is signaled early and tightens via the dual clock (6 minutes upload vs 4 minutes response) and the irreversibility of the cascade. The meaningful turn is her choosing a destructive tactic (warming the vault) that forecloses retreat. The arrival of security as the bar completes makes cost legible. Escalation could sharpen slightly with one more mid‑scene obstruction, but the pressure holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus power and the ethics of preservation emerges through action, not sermon: archivist becomes liberator using the very systems of preservation to unfreeze suppressed history. The letter’s “conversation we never had” risks slight on‑the‑nose-ness but gains resonance when she fades the ink after it has done its work. Final image—snow covering the old world—offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Complexity is maintained without false symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, precise, and sensorially particular, matching a meticulous archivist under pressure. POV remains clean and stable; no head‑hopping or unwarranted knowledge. Lyric touches (“peculiar silence of frozen time,” “ghost‑light”) modulate with rising stakes without drifting into purple. Elevated diction fits the character and context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, action) with minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; momentum stays taut. Figurative language is selective and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Technical phrasing is clear without jargon bloat, and rhythm varies appropriately. A few high-register flourishes flirt with density but do not impede clarity or escalate into artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While whistleblower/archives beats are familiar, the cryogenic‑vault conceit, heat‑sensitive letter, and climate‑collapse tablets from Damascus give the piece a fresh inflection. The programmed thaw and dual clock elevate the frame beyond template. Emotional calculus (oath vs truth) is handled with specificity rather than generic rhetoric. It stops short of a radical formal risk, but the synthesis feels confident and distinctive.</comment>
