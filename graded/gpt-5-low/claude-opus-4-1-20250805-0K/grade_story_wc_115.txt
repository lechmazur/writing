<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s motives are clear and particular—skeptical yet reverent toward the stories places tell—and his micro-choices (frequency-tuning, following pipes, refusing to touch the wheel) reveal a credible ethical struggle. The internal contradiction (skeptic who honors haunting) is dramatized rather than declared. The final renunciation—photographing and leaving the valve—reads as an earned endurance with visible cost. Minor note: the “Methodist” line toes summary but is grounded by his conduct.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: radio confessions and environmental finds accrue toward the charged discovery and the refusal to remove the wheel. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: “Some confessions…are meant to be witnessed,” followed by the leave-it choice with cost. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when), and causal threads—radio fragments → valve’s legend → discovery—remain coherent. The price is legible in the final carry-forward image (“settling into his bones”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel, pipes, and mill detritus are tactile, and the object-as-setting (beaded valve wheel) decisively charges the final image and constrains choice. Sensory detail is economical and POV-filtered (“headlamp cutting through dust,” “pipes like the mill’s circulatory system”). The abandoned infrastructure guides his path and decision-making. No museum-tour bloat; world rules stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the ethical stake: exploit, take, or witness and leave. Escalation is a single but meaningful tightening—clearer radio signal → confession about theft → physical discovery—culminating in an on-page trade-off (public proof vs disturbance). The price is the relinquishment of claim and the acceptance of haunting responsibility. Stakes remain internal but tangible; no flab or soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of labor invisibility, guilt, and witnessing emerge through concrete particulars (ghost shift, rosary beads, call-in confessions). The final act reframes absolution vs witness without sermonizing in the narration, though the psychic’s explicit line edges toward on-the-nose. The beaded wheel reweights earlier material into a quiet, resonant answer. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is steady, textural, and character-specific: skeptical, observant, respectful of decay. Dialogue snippets feel authentic and carry subtext, advancing plot and theme. Rhythm modulates with pressure (sharpened alertness at discovery). No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive sentences with varied rhythm and high information density; figurative language is apt and not overstacked. Recurring images (dust, pipes, beads) do double duty. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding clunk; punctuation and mechanics are sound. A few metaphors push toward lyric, but clarity never suffers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—urban exploration meets late-night psychic radio as a guide to labor ghosts—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The beaded valve wheel (rosary through industrial hardware) is a distinctive, memorable turn. The refusal to “solve” the haunting by removal is an elegant risk that heightens meaning. Execution avoids genre cliché and keeps human cost central.</comment>
