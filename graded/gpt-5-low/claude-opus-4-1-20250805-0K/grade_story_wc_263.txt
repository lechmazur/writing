<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive and worldview are clear and embodied (the astrolabe as tether; “shadowed rapture”). However, internal contradiction is light: she moves from purpose to surrender with minimal on‑page resistance, so the choice reads inevitable rather than contested. The “sanity and divine madness” frame is strong but not dramatized into competing impulses in scene. Still, actions align with her aims and reveal character reliably.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive: a causal spine (align, cross threshold, rest, turn final ring) delivered in a lyric, accumulative texture. Closure lands decisively as the archway crumbles and creativity returns, with an evident cost as she fades. Orientation is clean from the start, and set‑ups (astrolabe, falling‑star map) pay off. Minor softness in on‑page resistance keeps it just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The aurora‑lit archway and cold snap materially constrain choice (the need to rest; the astrolabe as tether). Sensory specificity—ice crystals on eyelashes, the instrument’s heat and hum—supports mood and action. The tool-as-setting charges the final image (turning the last ring; leaving it behind). World rules are taught through observation rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—tightens as she crosses the threshold and accepts the cost of dissolution. The meaningful deepening occurs with the prescribed “rest” that changes available tactics and culminates in the final turn of the ring. Pressure remains mostly internal with limited friction, but the price is clear and paid. Stakes avoid telescopic inflation by tying the cosmic to her body’s fade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres around wonder versus control and the cost of releasing what was caged. The final image reweights prior motifs without a stated moral, though some lines veer toward thesis (“They had tried to capture wonder”) and dilute subtext slightly. Her dissolution into stardust offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the question of belonging and creativity’s nature. Ambiguity around the “terrible mistake” keeps reflection alive without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, consistent lyric voice shaped by Lyra’s perceptions; diction and rhythm suit the cosmic register without losing control. POV is stable, with sensory filtering that feels character‑particular (aurora through closed eyelids; heartbeat matching pulsars). Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure. No dialogue; absence is appropriate to solitude and scale.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with varied rhythm and high information density; images often do double duty. Occasional purple edging and motif reiteration (“remembered stardust”) flirt with excess but do not blur sense or momentum. No notable loops or scaffolding; syntax supports the pressure arc into the final ring turn. The final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>While the chosen-one–under‑aurora frame is familiar, the specific synthesis—astrolabe as tether, “rest” as tactic, freeing captured creativity—is fresh and integrated. Turns feel earned by set‑up rather than arbitrary rule drops. Emotional truth (costly surrender) grounds the spectacle. Not radically unconventional, but assured and distinctive.</comment>
