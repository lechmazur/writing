<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s reticence and obsessive love for etymology drive credible choices, culminating in the decision to testify in a manner that risks status and clarity. Interiority is specific (“grief-tender,” “time-drunk”) and embodied (breath fogging glass, crystal warming in her palm). The contradiction—shy scholar choosing a bold, non-linear testimony—reads earned. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details build toward a charged poise as the Committee arrives and she reframes testimony as silence and refraction. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the library-crystal pattern is taught then paid off. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—language as living garden reweights the Committee’s premise. Cost is conceptual/social rather than concrete, limiting the ceiling slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shadowed dawn library and the crystal’s interaction with light and sound meaningfully shape tactics (how she testifies). Specific, selective sensory detail (dust motes, breathing books, margins blooming) supports mood and theme without overstuffing. The environment moves with action as dawn strengthens, charging the final image. Strong integration without strain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving language lives) is clear; escalation tightens from solitary observation to facing the Committee and choosing a risky method. The deepening is primarily conceptual rather than confrontational, consistent with the chosen lens. A felt price is implied but not pressed on the page (no immediate consequences), tempering urgency. Still, the method-choice narrows options and defines the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of language as living organism emerges through action and image (refractions, margins blooming) and culminates in the silence-as-testimony turn. Some explicit statements (“Language wasn’t a monument…”) edge toward telling but are buoyed by strong image systems. The final image reframes the premise without a moralizing bow. Subtext in her stance toward authority and care for “dying words” adds depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a scholar’s perceptual bias stays stable under pressure. Compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off at closure, with no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying status dynamics and subtext in few lines. Rhythm modulates effectively from hush to quiet charge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is crisp and musical with high information density; metaphors are coherent and consistent with the prism/crystal motif. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding drag momentum. Figurative texture is rich but controlled, especially in peak beats. Minor explicit theme lines keep it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise (post-final-dictionary world) and sonically reflective crystal feel fresh, synthesized through a scholarly, gentle defiance rather than genre spectacle. The “testify through silence and fractured sequences” turn is inventive and thematically apt. Risks are taken in structure and imagery without sacrificing legibility. The cost remains conceptual, which slightly limits the upper range.</comment>
