<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear rituals (unfolding the swan, refusing speech, teaching the fold) reveal character through action, and her renunciation is consistent and particular. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she moves with serene acceptance rather than tension, so the internal crucible never truly bites. The cost—erosion of speech/self—registers, but micro-choices under pressure are few. Still, her embodied practice and worldview are coherently dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs densify (book-soil-moss-memory; the swan/map; mushroom-words) toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is a charged poise/CR: she has become the chronicle itself, with the cost of self-dissolution and lasting silence legible on the page. Orientation is clean from the start, and the pattern taught early pays off in the final image by the river. Slight softness remains in the beat-to-beat turn, but the ending’s reweighting lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The catacomb library, river, and obsidian alcove are vividly, selectively rendered and filter through her archival mindset. Setting is not postcard: it shapes tactics (silence to protect the ecology; the daily swan ritual in the alcove) and charges the final image by the river. Details evolve (books→mulch→moss→memory; philosophy-text mushrooms), reinforcing world rules through observation. The environment’s constraint is felt without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining witness without judgment—remains coherent, and the mushroom-words plus the swan-as-map form a meaningful deepening. Still, pressure is gentle; options aren’t visibly narrowed beyond the ongoing renunciation of speech/ecology protection. The final stance is an earned endurance rather than a hard trade-off, with cost implied more than dramatized in a turn. Effective for a lyric mode, but not sharply escalating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of impermanence, composted certainty, and regenerative silence arise organically from concrete practices and images rather than lecture. The folding/unfolding swan’s meaning shifts at the end, answering the piece’s central question non‑literally. A few sentences flirt with direct statement (“to witness change without judgment…”) but they’re justified by the ritual frame and do not displace scene pressure. Resonance lingers beyond the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in distance, with a distinct perceptual signature (archival, botanical, aqueous metaphors) that fits the POV. Elision is purposeful and taught early; no head‑hopping or register jolts. Rhythm modulates with the piece’s quiet intensifications. The diction sometimes nears incantatory, but it remains legible and character‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is polished: strong verbs and precise images pull double duty for mood and meaning. Figurative density is high but internally coherent (root, river, fold ecosystems), avoiding mixed metaphors. Minor risk of saturation in clustered abstractions is offset by tactile anchors (reed mat, water basin, paper swan). Momentum is steady with no visible scaffold or paraphrase loops dulling the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—an archivist in a living, decomposing library using an origami swan as a map of becoming, mushroom‑words as documentation—is striking and specific. Risks (lyric accumulation, concept-first closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. The final conceptual turn feels inevitable in hindsight given the patterned imagery. Emotional truth (renunciation as cost) grounds the novelty.</comment>
