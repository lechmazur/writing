<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mei’s motivation is clear and character‑specific—craft transmuting grief—and her actions (recording, then integrating gems into lanterns) align. Interiority is textured with embodied craft detail rather than labels. The internal conflict is more steady endurance than actively contradictory impulses, limiting peak complexity. The closing shift to acceptance feels earned through accumulated cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned labor, curated memories, and a cadence shift with the “possibility” vision reweight the dominant stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—acceptance as transformation—with felt cost embedded in the painful polishing and relinquished futures. Orientation is clean early; no causal breaks. The beat structure is cohesive though not tightly escalatory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tea garden, glass basilica, and dream‑gem tools are vivid and filtered through craft and grief; sensory choices feel purposeful. Setting returns to charge the final image (lanterns hanging in the basilica casting daughter‑shadows). While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain options, recurring objects function as setting and meaningfully charge closure. World rules remain consistent and absorbed through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief without erasing love) is clear; pressure deepens via the unexpected “possibility” glimpse and the move to public lantern‑shrines. The cost is felt but remains largely internal and artisanal rather than forced by external pressure. Escalation is a measured intensification rather than a sharp foreclosure. The resolution is earned through Mei’s agency and endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: grief as transformation rather than erasure, love reformed into light, and acceptance framed as an ongoing craft. Subtext lives in the act of polishing and hanging lanterns; however, Master Shen’s explicit statements verge on thesising (“You transform grief…”) which slightly flattens the resonance. The final image reweights earlier motifs without a moral. Emotional aftereffect is quiet and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident; the lyric narrative voice matches Mei’s artisanal sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate well; dialogue is sparse but apt and carries subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent—craft metaphors, material textures, and light. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry good momentum with layered information; imagery is rich yet mostly controlled. A few lines risk over‑explicit abstraction (“luminous torment”) but are anchored by tactile detail. No notable loops or scaffold; rhythm varies. The final paragraph lands with a clean, charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Floating tea garden, glass basilica, and dream‑gems could be archetypal, yet the synthesis with craft process and grief work feels fresh and integrated. The “possibility within the gem” turn is a memorable inflection. Paper cranes reframed as a unit of emotional labor is smart. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off.</comment>
