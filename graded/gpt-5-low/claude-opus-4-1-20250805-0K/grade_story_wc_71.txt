<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marina’s motive—compulsively tracking “small wrongnesses”—reads specific and propels her to the bay and the final offering. Interiority is embodied (the shard’s “violet warmth”) and distinct without therapy-speak. The relinquishing of her grandmother’s shard is a credible cost that aligns with her earned understanding. Internal contradiction is mild; the piece privileges serene clarity over friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: observed drift → liminal approach → shard‑enabled seeing → conceptual reweighting → offering. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page cost (she gives up the heirloom shard). Orientation is solid early; no causality breaks. The ending cadence tightens cleanly around the bay as repository of hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bay, streetlights, and orris root create a coherent sensory system that guides action and meaning. The environment actively constrains choice: the pattern points Marina to this particular shoreline, and the hush of the bay charges the final act. Object-as-setting (the shard) refracts the place into layered time. Specifics feel lived and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal—understanding and stewardship—and intensify as the shard reveals the bay’s function. The decisive tightening is Marina’s choice to place the heirloom on the sand, paying a personal price to join the sanctifying circuit. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A slight softness remains in on‑page resistance before the offering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of grief transmuted into place (“houses…learned to embrace”) are earned through concrete particulars and the displaced objects motif. The final image reframes absence/presence without sermonizing. A few “She understood” lines edge toward articulation but remain grounded in image and action. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“cartographer of the imperceptible,” “active presence of quiet”). POV remains clean and stable; no head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates well from noticing to revelation to release. Diction suits the character’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and minimal scaffolding. Occasional lushness (“burning away the day’s accumulated noise”) remains coherent and doesn’t blur sense. No paraphrase loops or pattern artifacts impede momentum. The final sentence lands cleanly, recharging prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “shard of hush” and living houses sanctifying via displaced objects is a fresh, integrated synthesis. The mechanism feels inevitable in hindsight once revealed by the shard. Risk‑taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The result feels singular and memorable.</comment>
