<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (seek and decode the library) and enacted through concrete micro-choices (slowing down to document, reading the watch, engaging the librarian). Interiority is particular (“cautious exuberance”) but internal conflict is light; she meets little resistance and seldom pays an emotional price. The identity shift (seeker → keeper) reads earned but largely frictionless. A sharper felt cost or contradictory impulse on the page would deepen character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → patterning of delays → cipher alignment → invitation from the future self. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with resonant reconfiguration: she was always both seeker and keeper, and her notes enter the system. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; cause/effect within the accumulative frame is coherent. Cost is present but subtle (selfhood and future role assumed rather than chosen under duress).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly particular (amber windows “like trapped constellations,” mist-woven librarian) and rule‑bound via propagation delays. Environment and tools constrain tactics: she must pace herself to the shelves’ rhythms and use the watch’s reversals to read. The final image is charged by place (glowing library responding as home) and object. Excellent economy and specificity without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (find/unlock the unspoken library) and tightens as the watch reverses time and the delays pattern into a decipherable logic. The meaningful deepening is knowledge‑driven rather than peril‑driven; the librarian’s validation accelerates decoding without adding new pressure. Resolution follows her agency (documentation) but the price is soft, so tension never fully bites. Still, escalation reads as a decisive cadence shift when the symbols align and the second letter appears.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of silence, latency, and the power in the pause accrue through concrete mechanics (propagation delays) rather than lecture. The line on the watch—“What remains unspoken speaks loudest in the pause”—skirts on‑the‑nose but is earned by object reweighting. The ending reconfigures meaning (potential over articulation) without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV and distance are steady; lyric diction is controlled and character‑colored. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, adding subtext (“the library…isn’t a place but a pattern”) without exposition bloat. Rhythm modulates with pressure as observation quickens into mapping. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and largely economical; images do layered work (mist, amber windows, origami time). Occasional flourish flirts with purple but maintains clarity and propulsion. No scaffold loops or templated cadence mar momentum. The final cadence lands with a clean, recharged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Borgesian echoes are transformed by the concrete “propagation delay” mechanic and the documenting tactic; the watch’s reversal purpose is a fresh inflection. The seeker/keeper twist feels inevitable in hindsight given the letters frame. Risks are cohesive and not gimmicky. Emotional stakes could cut deeper, but the conceptual ingenuity is strong.</comment>
