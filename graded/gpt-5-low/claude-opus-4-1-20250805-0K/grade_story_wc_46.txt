<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Marina’s drive to restore guidance after the lighthouse failure is clear and consistent, with tactile motives (gem‑polishing skill, grandfather’s charge) shaping action. Interiority is concrete (charts by touch, lens‑polishing echo), but internal contradiction is minimal; she’s largely competent and unconflicted. The late exchange with Tomás adds social dimension and choice (to teach), though pressure on that choice is gentle. The final renunciation (sharing fragments) reads earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal steps within a textural, image‑driven rise): polishing → glow → grotto amplification → beacon → communal teaching. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the outset, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a shift from solitary lighthouse to communal, soft light. The cost is conceptual (ceding singular authority to shared stewardship) rather than visceral, keeping stakes quiet. Tight, coherent progression without teleports or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto and mist are integral: acoustics, stillness, and vapor prisms enable the beacon and constrain tactics (using the amphitheater mouth, catching sun and reflected light). Sensory specificity is strong and profession‑filtered. World rules (luminescence via polish + environmental amplification) are learned through action. The setting charges the final image and is not postcard decor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guiding boats through fog) is signaled early and deepens when the fleet visibly adjusts course. Escalation is gentle, driven by Marina’s agency (discover → wield → teach), with one meaningful tightening (deploying the light at the grotto mouth as boats depart). Prices are soft—no significant sacrifice beyond time and relinquishing exclusivity. Tension operates more through wonder than jeopardy, limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of shared, patient light over heat/power and “stars in more places than the sky” emerge from repeated actions and the final communal teaching. However, the closing paragraph states the thesis a bit directly (“light could be shared without flame...”), edging toward moralizing. Imagery does much of the work (constellations in mist, gentle beacon), but ambiguity and counter‑currents are limited. Resonance is genuine yet tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third centers Marina’s perceptual bias (astronomer’s lantern, lens work, charts by touch). Rhythm modulates well between hushed grotto awe and the outward turn to the harbor. Dialogue is sparse but natural, serving action and subtext. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly economical; lines carry multiple jobs (world, memory, and action). A few metaphors verge on lush (“liquid starlight,” “zephyr bloom”), but they cohere and don’t muddle causality. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies with good ear. Momentum holds through the turn without purple spillover at the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sea glass as community beacon in a mist‑chamber is a fresh synthesis; the tactile craft of polishing as method is especially apt. The lighthouse‑to‑shared light pivot feels earned rather than gimmicky. Sentiment leans familiar, but the grotto mechanics and soft‑light ethics elevate. Risk is modest yet coherent.</comment>
