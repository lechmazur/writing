<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Margot’s motives—erasure versus reclamation—are clear and particular, embodied in acts like burning clippings and reorganizing letters by “the promises they preserved.” Her contradictory impulses (destroying her paper trail while preserving others’) operate simultaneously and culminate credibly in accepting her preserved past. The meteorite and dust‑mapping rituals reveal character under pressure without therapy‑speak. The cost—relinquishing total erasure—reads on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: dust, letters, meteorite, and seasonal shifts layer toward the envelope reveal and her reconfiguration. Orientation is swift (attic of Bellweather’s Books, skylight), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration when her own past letter returns, reweighting the premise of “paper trails.” The cost is conceptual but felt: she owns her past rather than escaping it. Tight, coherent progression without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The attic’s skylight, dust motes, ledgers, and the piano below generate a living micro‑ecology that shapes perception and mood. The environment charges the final image (music rising like pigeons) and her dust‑mapping practice, tying space to inner change. Details are selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding generic catalog. While not physically constraining a choice, the space meaningfully frames her tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can she reinvent without denial?—is signaled early and deepens as she chooses omission/reorganization over forgery. The meaningful tightening arrives when Theodore reveals prior knowledge and the preserved letter; it forecloses pure erasure and demands a stance. Stakes remain intimate but coherent under the accumulative lens; the price is acceptance of history. Quiet but earned escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Reinvention, custodianship of truth, and messages traveling through time cohere through recurring particulars (pigeons, letters, meteorite, songs, dust). The ending reframes “paper trails” from records to resonant carriers, answering the theme without moralizing. Subtext hums in what is preserved versus burned. The final music‑as‑return image delivers durable emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is supple, lyrical, and consistently focalized through Margot’s sensibility (bird‑training metaphors, pattern‑seeking). Brief dialogue is natural and subtextual; Theodore’s revelation lands quietly without exposition. Rhythm modulates well between image and insight. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with clean syntax and strong verbs; images recur with purpose rather than ornament. A rich figurative weave (dust as constellations, notes as pigeons) stays coherent and doesn’t smother clarity. Minimal scaffolding and no evident loops. The final cadence is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pigeon warfare craft meets archival ethics and a meteorite talisman—an unusual, organic synthesis. Dust‑mapping as training logic feels fresh and character‑true. The envelope twist is understated yet inevitable in hindsight. It risks lyric quietude and wins through specificity and conceptual integrity.</comment>
