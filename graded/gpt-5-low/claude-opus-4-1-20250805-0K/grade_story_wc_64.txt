<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta’s interiority is specific and embodied—tools, threads, and root‑system metaphors reveal a temperament that makes her choices legible. Her small but meaningful renunciations (letting the clock run down, planning to return the fragment to earth) align with a gardener’s ethic of care. Internal friction—ritual vs. discovery, keeping vs. returning—exists but remains low‑temperature. The piece earns an endurance/renunciation shift rather than a dramatic turn, scaled well to the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the decoding sequence intensifies meaning until the final stance—planting the fragment tomorrow, not restarting the clock—reconfigures time and custody. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and motifs (silo, clock, case, tapestry) carry through to closure. The cost is conceptual but present: surrender of artifact control and ritual certainty for circular tending. Closure lands as Charged Poise with Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, starlight, chess clock, and metal walls “like distant applause” are vivid and purpose‑selected, filtered through a gardener’s priorities. Setting charges the final image (silo sentinel; clock waiting) even if it doesn’t tightly constrain options. Objects function as micro‑settings that shape mood and meaning. The sensory economy is deft, with tactile engagement (threads, shears, lamp) grounding the lyric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily existential—how to hold and translate grief—escalating through the decoding into a stance about return and time. The meaningful tightening arrives when she doesn’t restart the clock and commits to planting the fragment, foreclosing possession. Pressure remains coherent but quiet; the conflict is internal and thematic rather than antagonistic. The visible price is surrender and patience rather than loss dramatized in action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grief-as-tending and the circular nature of intention emerge through particulars (rosemary, carved laughter, timing ritual) rather than thesis. A few explicit lines (“The shape of intentions wasn’t angular…”) flirt with statement, but they’re earned by the decoding labor. The ending reweights earlier motifs, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer: love’s organization is seasonal and must be returned to earth. The emotional aftereffect is tender without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident close third with a gardener’s perceptual signature—tools and textures lead thought—and rhythmic control suits the lyric mode. Diction is consistent and apt; no head‑hopping or register slips. Elisions (the dead appreciating company; the tapestry “speaking”) are taught and sustained. The voice modulates gently at the decision beats without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multi‑functioning images (“starlight that pooled,” “metal walls like distant applause”) with clean momentum and minimal scaffolding. Figurative density approaches lush but remains coherent and purposeful; little to no paraphrase looping. Syntax varies and breathes with the contemplative pace, and the final line elegantly recharges prior motifs. Minor abstract phrasing appears but does not dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—cemetery gardening, a cobalt grain silo, a chess clock ritual, and decoding grief woven into tapestry—feels distinct and memorable. Turns arise from character and craft logic rather than clever gimmickry. The risk is a quiet, accumulative design that relies on image‑logic; it pays off with a fresh conceptual repricing. The piece commits to its premise and follows it to an inevitable, graceful renunciation.</comment>
