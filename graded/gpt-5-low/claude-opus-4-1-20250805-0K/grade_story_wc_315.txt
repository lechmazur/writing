<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s motives and contradictions are clear: corporate duty vs. witness-ethic, culminating in a risky lie and the choice to share hidden data. Embodied details (parachute buckle habit, muscle-memory) reveal her under pressure. A touch more fraying at the edges (physiological stress or error) could deepen cost. Still, the micro-choices feel earned and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: a new voice during the narrow transmission window forces a stance. The decisive changes—altered report, strategic lie, release of coordinates—land with implied cost. Orientation is clean early; closure resolves to a charged poise/earned stasis. A sharper on-page consequence would push higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is vivid and particular (bioluminescent moss, aerial roots, fungal networks). Environment and tools constrain action: seven-minute clear window, canopy climb, radio interference. The final image among luminous branches is charged. One more moment where altitude or equipment directly forces a tactical compromise could elevate to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres: unfamiliar handler, the clock, and corporate stakes force Maya to choose allegiance now. The tightening turn is her reassessment upon hearing human breath and the subsequent lie. Costs are clear but mostly conceptual/oncoming rather than immediate and felt. The beat progression is clean without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of the watcher’s burden and trust under surveillance emerges through action and subtext (breathing, silence, fungal communion). The final stance reframes her role from technician to guardian. A few lines approach thesis-stating (“essential to planetary survival”), slightly blunting subtlety. Overall resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and character-specific, with professional lexicon integrated naturally. Dialogue carries subtext and moves the plot; the unknown voice’s brevity feels credible under tension. POV remains tight and consistent. Rhythm modulates well at the call’s peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong: varied syntax, purposeful images, minimal scaffolding. Occasional high-register phrasing fits the contemplative mode and field expertise. A couple of declarative tell-lines could be tightened into image. Momentum holds from opening to charged close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sky-forest premise with fungal communication and a weather-station guardian feels fresh and integrated with stakes. The infiltrator call is familiar but sharpened by the biophysical context and time pressure. The muscle-memory motif reprises cleverly. Not radical risk-taking, but a coherent, memorable synthesis.</comment>
