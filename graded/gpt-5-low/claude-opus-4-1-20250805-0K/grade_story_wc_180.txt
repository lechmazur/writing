<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-born vow and her choice to break it under Mira’s pressure are credible and moving; the blue ribbon and tools personalize motive. Interiority is concrete (trembling from memory, the lie about the bag), and the teaching moment reveals values under strain. The relationship dynamic is active and reshapes both characters (Mira learns; Elara yields tradition). Slight softness: mending proceeds a bit too smoothly, reducing felt struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: the urgent problem (dying quartz eyes) coheres pressure and forces a stance shift. Orientation is clean; closure lands with a decisive change (Elara resumes and teaches) and conceptual cost (defying the Council, relinquishing purity). The causal chain is tidy with no breaks, though conflict resolves without a hard on‑page setback, moderating impact. The final image reconfigures the premise convincingly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard‑in‑rafters cathedral is vivid and integral; rope ladder, branches, and hanging eyes shape action and imagery. Tools and environment charge the final image (rainbows through blossoms, eyes as fruit). Details stay character‑filtered through a mender’s gaze, avoiding tourist cataloging. Strong micro‑setting work constrains access and establishes tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving the eyes/legacy) is clear and tightens when the fading crystals and “only you can mend” pressure are revealed. The turn is Elara’s active renunciation of her vow and initiation of teaching; the visible price is defying the Council and opening old grief. Escalation is steady but low‑friction—once she decides, success follows without a complication that narrows options further. Tension remains warm rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of tradition vs. adaptive teaching emerges through concrete acts (using the daughter’s tools, instructing Mira, ribbon transfer). The deciduous‑vows motif reweights at the end with a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few aphoristic lines risk tidy moralizing (“The best wisdom usually arrives by accident”), softening subtextual power. Still, the final image earns emotional aftereffect without heavy exposition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled third‑person with lyrical texture suits the material; perception is plausibly limited and consistent. Dialogue advances goals and carries subtext (Mira’s defiance, Council pressure) while voices are distinct. Rhythm modulates effectively between reflection and action. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong, economical lines with vivid images (“roots threading through stonework like determined fingers”). Occasional aphorisms verge on sententious but do not clog momentum. Figurative language is mostly precise and not overstacked; syntax varies with good cadence. Clean mechanics and high information density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard‑cathedral and quartz‑eye craft feel fresh, and the “deciduous vow” conceit is memorable. The bag “accident” and teaching‑as‑healing synthesis provides a non‑obvious, organic turn. Resolution is gentle rather than daring, but the conceptual blend of nature reclaiming sanctity and crystal medicine is distinctive. Risks are coherent and pay off.</comment>
