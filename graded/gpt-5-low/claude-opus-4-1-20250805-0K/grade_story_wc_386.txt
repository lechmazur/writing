<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation is clear and consistent—she dives for voices and truth—and her micro‑choices (placing the globe, reading the angles, transcribing) align with that aim. Interiority is specific (reading frost‑faces as “windows”) and embodied (gloves, warped plastic), but internal contradiction is light; competence comes a bit too smoothly. The chemist’s brief presence adds pressure but doesn’t force a fraught relational turn. The earned shift is a stance crystallization toward a larger mission, with only modest on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (glacier shrine, recovered globe, Cassandra wreck) and the causal throughline holds: globe → shrine response → visions → formula → broader quest. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she secures the formula and assumes a new mandate (twelve globes), reweighting the premise. Cost is primarily conceptual/ethical rather than dramatized resistance, slightly softening impact. Exposition about the weapon and refugees is compact and integrated via the shrine’s visions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candles, and ice walls are vivid and functional: candlelight angle reveals the encoded pattern; the ceiling’s “constellations” map future wrecks. Setting integrates with action rather than pausing it, and object‑as‑setting (snow globe) is used tactically. World rules stay consistent in their uncanny logic. The environment charges the final image, though it constrains choices only lightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (recovering/decoding the antidote and bearing proof) are clear early, and pressure deepens through the shrine’s responses and the chemist’s timed fading. The meaningful tightening is the revelation of the encoded formula and the broader quest map. However, conflict meets little resistance—no on‑page obstacle contests her deciphering—so escalation feels contemplative more than testing. The dawn fade provides a mild clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of salvage, windows vs. walls, and transmitting the dead’s truths accrue through concrete images (melted city as “dream architecture,” borrowed starlight). The ending reweights the story from recovery to stewardship without moralizing. A couple of lines edge toward thesis (“salvage artist of impossible things”), but the imagery carries most of the load. Resonance lingers via the choice to carry burden rather than a neat solution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close holds steady, with a distinct perceptual signature (technical diver awareness braided with numinous noticing). Dialogue is spare and natural, functioning as action (the chemist’s disclosure). Diction remains consistent; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates well between vision density and purposeful sentences during transcription.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑dense without collapsing into purple; metaphors are coherent and scene‑anchored. Minimal redundancy; sentences do multiple jobs, advancing plot while toning atmosphere. A few elevated phrases flirt with abstraction but are grounded by tactile details. The final line reprises motifs cleanly without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of wreck‑diving, dream‑cameos, and a melted snow globe encoding an antidote feels fresh and specific. The shrine’s candle mechanics and “borrowed starlight” mapping add ingenuity. The risk is thematic familiarity (salvage/hope), but it’s made particular through craft choices and a credible occult logic. The turn to a global scavenger mission lands as an earned widening rather than a bolt‑on twist.</comment>
