<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyra’s tactile way of “seeing” yields specific, embodied choices (reading the coin, placing mirrors) that align with her motive to capture the library’s face. The prosopagnosia constraint is integrated rather than labeled, though the line “wasn’t a limitation but a different kind of sight” states a realization a touch too directly. Internal tension is present but quiet; she meets time pressure more than moral friction. Still, the final renunciation—walking away as demolition begins—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → interpretation → construction → charged witnessing. Orientation is clean early, and closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with the library’s fall imminent and the coin’s continuity in her hand as cost. The time clock coheres causally without forced reversals. No major causality slips or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tree’s hollow, carved shelves, gaps for moonbeams, and the coin operate as environment/tools that directly constrain tactics and charge the closing image. Sensory detail is tactile and acoustic as well as visual, filtered through Lyra’s perception priorities. The setting’s rules remain consistent and evolve with action (mirror placements, moonlight shifting). The demolition context saturates tone and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure is coherent: a dawn deadline and imminent demolition drive Lyra’s decisions, with the coin’s spiral reweighting her task. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, culminating in completion at 4:47 and the machines’ approach—visible cost. Conflict remains more inward and procedural than oppositional, but the narrowing options are legible. The guild’s arrival adds human stakes without diffusing focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of continuity, identity beyond faces, and “mirroring the sky inside walls” accrue through concrete acts (coin tradition, mirror craft) and pay off in the final image. One explicit statement risks mild moralizing, but most resonance arises from particulars (shadows, breath of centuries, charged coin). The ending reweights the premise convincingly. Emotional aftereffect lingers without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person limited voice with a clear perceptual signature (touch as primary) remains steady. Diction suits the character and pressure; brief dialogue at the end is economical and in-key. Rhythm modulates well from hush to charged poise. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry density and purpose; images perform double duty (craft detail and theme). A few lines edge toward tell (“not a limitation but a different kind of sight”), but they don’t stall momentum. Figurative choices (breath of wood, wind holding breath) are coherent and not overstacked. Mechanics are clean and rhythmic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of prosopagnosia, a coin engraved with fractal faces, and a moonlit optical portrait inside a living-turned-condemned library feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The coin-as-continuity and mirrors-as-sky synthesis is inventive without gimmick. Risks in method and tone heighten meaning and land cleanly at closure. The piece commits fully to its singular conceit.</comment>
