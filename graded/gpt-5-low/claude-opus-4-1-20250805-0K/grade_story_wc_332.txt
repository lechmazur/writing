<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—Mara’s devotion to her grandmother’s scattered dream drives credible, felt micro-choices. The internal conflict peaks when she senses “something leaving her own chest,” embodying the price. Her renunciation reads earned by seven years of patterned behavior. A touch of abstract diction (“luminous absence”) grazes generality but doesn’t undercut specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens cleanly from arrival to coalescence to refusal. Closure is an Earned Stasis: she sets down the palette, foreclosing resurrection with visible cost. Orientation is crisp early (archipelago at dawn; floating library; skiff), and causality holds. The price is on the page in the “warmth” leaving and the dissolving figure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archipelago, dawn light, and the glass‑filled palette are not backdrops; they constrain tactics (timing, angle, place) and charge the final act. World rules (memories vitalized by refracted dawn) are learned through action, not exposition dumps. Sensory specificity—“molten copper,” salt‑stained pages—serves mood and choice. The setting’s whispering function integrates with plot and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: complete the vitalization or protect her own capacity for love. Escalation is marked by the figure’s increasing solidity and the felt cost in her chest. The decisive turn is her refusal—agency that narrows options permanently. Consequences land in the soft but weighted aftermath on the row back.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The piece reframes longing from fulfillment to recognition without sermonizing, and the final image reweights the premise. “Not resurrection, but recognition” arrives earned via specific experience, not declared thesis. Islands as ciphers evolve from image to ethic. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistent, close third with a distinct perceptual signature—glass, water, breath. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the coalescence and relaxing in the denouement. No head‑hopping or withheld knowledge tricks. Lyrical diction suits the character’s sensibility and stays coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images are vivid without purple excess. Repetition is purposeful (“whispers”) rather than looped. Syntax varies and maintains momentum into the choice. A few elevated abstractions appear, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Painting with light” via glass shards to vitalize inherited, island‑encoded memories is a fresh synthesis. The turn from completion to recognition is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and tone cohere without gimmickry. Specific nautical‑library textures prevent template drift.</comment>
