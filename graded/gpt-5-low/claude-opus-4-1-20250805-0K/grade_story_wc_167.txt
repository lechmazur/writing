<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus’s vocation and perception shape credible motives and micro‑choices (tracing panes, throwing stones, deciding to document/teach). Interiority is sensorial and character‑particular to a glazier’s eye. The internal conflict—fight the development vs. reframing loss into instruction—is present but lands more as serene acceptance than a contested struggle. A few aphoristic lines edge toward tidy epiphany, softening felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear single‑scene arc with early anchors (who/where/when) and an accumulative/textural drive culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. The demolition letter and “last morning” frame a live constraint; the decision to document/teach is the closure unit with legible conceptual cost. Beats accrue via ripples and light intensifying to the sun’s crest. Minor limitation: the external stake never tests him on the page beyond contemplation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prism atrium, pool, mist, and dawn light are integrated tools, not backdrop; their physical properties generate the central images and the final cadence. Professional noticing gives specificity (stress fractures as “language,” interference nodes). Environment charges the ending as light floods, reweighting the stake. Detail remains selective and purpose‑driven across senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (imminent demolition) is clear, and pressure coheres as dawn advances and meaning concentrates. The tightening comes with the sun’s rise and his pivot to preservation/teaching. However, escalation is mostly internal; no on‑page reversal or hard trade‑off beyond renunciation of direct resistance. Cost is felt but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Recurring images (glass, ripples, spectra) organically develop the theme that boundaries generate possibility. The final image reweights prior material without needing explicit moral, though some lines verge on thesis statements. The noctilucent motif elegantly frames endings illuminating beginnings. Emotional resonance lingers as a credible, non‑sentimental acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A consistent, lucid lyrical voice with a clear perceptual signature rooted in craft and optics. Diction is elevated but coherent for a reflective artisan at dawn. Rhythm varies and tightens toward closure. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑dense, and generally propulsive for a contemplative piece; sentences often do double duty. A few aphoristic formulations and near‑repetitions (“surfaces”/“boundaries” definitions) flirt with over‑explaining but don’t stall momentum. Figurative language remains coherent to the established optics/water lexicon. Final line resolves by image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prism atrium/water‑as‑lens synthesis and “noctilucent reckoning” give a fresh angle to a familiar gentrification/loss frame. The method of reading interference patterns as communion feels specific and memorable. Risks are controlled and thematically integrated rather than gimmicky. The only familiarity lies in the development‑threat setup.</comment>
