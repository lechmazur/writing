<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mari’s motivation—embracing her bureaucratic erasure to become a “collector of lost stories”—is specific and consistent, and her final act of signing a new, in‑between name feels earned. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“memory’s texture,” the poison label’s “complex weave”). Contradictory impulses (dissolving vs. testifying) coexist on the page. The cost of choosing the in‑between identity is implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tides, maze, and annotations build density until the spring tide’s fresh inscription catalyzes Mari’s choice. Orientation is clear early (containers, dawn, harbor), and the single‑shard flow is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she joins a hidden congregation and reframes her death certificate as both true and false. The cost is conceptual and elegiac rather than sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and tidal schedule shape tactics (navigating by sound; visiting during high tides) and charge the final image (containers groaning with testimonies). Details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mari’s sensibility. The poison label functions as a micro‑setting object that carries meaning across beats. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claiming an identity among the erased) crystallizes under pressure when the spring tide’s message forces a stance, leading to her three‑part signature. The escalation is a density/recognition deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate for the lens. The felt price stays subtle—no external penalty, mainly the irrevocable self‑definition—which keeps tension refined but contained. Still, the tightening is real and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of erasure, testimony, and memory’s material residue emerge organically via containers, margins, and the poison label. The final image reweights earlier motifs: rust, tide, and documents become a choir of the nameless, not a moral. One on‑page aphorism (“We who don’t exist…”) risks explicitness but works because it’s diegetic and catalytic. The piece invites reflection beyond plot without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly focalized; diction matches Mari’s perceptual bias (textures, echoes, adhesives). Overheard dialogue is spare and natural, contributing subtext rather than exposition. Psychic distance modulation is controlled and purposeful, especially in the closing cadence. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and economical; images do multiple jobs (“adhesive paper and tiny print” compresses tragedy and theme). Rhythm varies, with no scaffold loops or metaphor tangles. Figurative density is high but coherent and paid off by pattern. Final lines reprise motifs cleanly without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Administrative ghosts, tidal labyrinth, and memory‑texture perception synthesize into a fresh, inevitable whole. The container‑journal congregation is a striking, non‑obvious turn that feels grounded in prior beats. Risks in structure and diction heighten coherence rather than obscure it. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
