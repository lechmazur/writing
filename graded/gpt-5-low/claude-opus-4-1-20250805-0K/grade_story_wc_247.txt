<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s ritual with the empty Leica, arthritic signing, and decades‑long project ground her motives with specificity; Chen’s presence presses and enables without stealing focus. The relationship is textured—advisor, interpreter, friend—and choices emerge from that bond (“Show me the map,” working until dawn). Interiority is embodied rather than labeled, with contradiction (grief/hope) carried through action. A touch of expository backstory verges on summary, but it still charges present stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through repeated gestures (clicks, signs, mapping) to a dawn reweighting: not music recovered, but a new medium embraced. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: acceptance of no audience, no sound, yet meaning found. Orientation is clean from the opening; the Leica and harbor recur to unify structure. The because/therefore is soft but coherent: mapping → interpretation → on‑site translation → charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor is not background; it becomes the concert hall and “spotlight,” directly charging the final image. The Leica functions as a micro‑setting/tool that constrains tactics (no film; only clicks and framing) and defines the language of performance. Vivid, selective sensory detail (“spilled mercury,” silver paths) is filtered through Maya’s visual listening. Environment and object jointly shape choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: can Maya render silence into shareable art and be remembered. Pressure coheres by density increase rather than antagonism, tightening when Chen proposes translation “tonight,” and they commit until dawn. The cost—forsaking sound and audience for a visual symphony—is felt. Escalation is gentle but genuine for this mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of translation, memory, and the space between loss and remainder accrue through concrete images (maps, gestures, clicks) rather than sermonizing. The final realization reframes “music” without a tidy moral, allowing a resonant conceptual repricing. A couple of explicit thematic lines (“This is music,” “visual symphony”) run close to telling, but they are earned by the scene. Subtext thrives in the partnership’s quiet reciprocity and the harbor’s witnessing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a lyrical yet controlled texture suits the subject; diction feels character‑bound and perceptual. Signed dialogue carries subtext and action (“You’re disrupting the composition”) with clean mechanics. Rhythm modulates well from moonlit hush to dawn recognition. No leakage or head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences do multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images recur purposefully without paraphrase loops. Figurative language is apt and not overstacked; cadence varies to maintain momentum. A few formulations verge on aphoristic, but clarity and propulsion hold. The closing triad (“No film, no sound, no audience”) compresses without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Translating silence via an empty camera and sign‑language scores is a fresh synthesis rendered with conviction. The harbor as concert hall and the map of absence feel singular rather than templated. The final reconfiguration—choosing a visual symphony—reads inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and quiet structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
