<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motives and worldview are clear and embodied through precise actions (catching the feather, retrieving the kite, reframing damage). Interiority feels particular rather than generic, with sensory bias consistent to a shoreline poet. Internal contradiction is present but gentle (yearning for wholeness vs. honoring fracture), so the pressure never forces a sharper, costlier renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm hush → kite struggle → snap → salvage and reframe → dawn repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (the kite remains broken; perfection foreclosed). Orientation is clean early, and each beat coherently builds toward the final image without soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain is vivid, specific, and integrated with action: wind and shallows shape events; light through tears charges the final image. Details are filtered through Mira’s sensibility, avoiding tourist‑catalog breadth. Environment and recurring objects return at the end to heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The snapping string provides a decisive tightening; Mira’s agency (salvage and reframe) responds to a real loss. Stakes remain intimate but legible: perfection vs. transformation, freedom vs. tether. Cost is felt but subtle, limiting peak intensity even as the turn is clean.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompletion emerges through objects and acts (feather, torn kite, weaving new paper) rather than sermon. The final poetic line fits character and reweights prior images, though it edges toward explicit statement. Subtext in the boy’s realization is delicately handled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and character‑plausible; diction and rhythm vary with pressure (gusts vs. hush). Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying subtext. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the perceptual signature (materials, light, texture) is distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is polished with high information density; images earn their keep and avoid mixed metaphors. A few elevated phrasings risk lushness but remain coherent and purposeful. Momentum holds through description without loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While the broken‑beauty motif is familiar, the drake’s feather/lagoon/kite synthesis feels fresh and lived‑in. The turn is quiet but inevitable; the risk lies in a restrained, lyric mode rather than plot pyrotechnics. A touch more unpredictability or sharper cost could elevate distinctiveness.</comment>
