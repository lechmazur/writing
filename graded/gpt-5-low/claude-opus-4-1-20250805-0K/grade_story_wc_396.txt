<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and consistent, and her final renunciation—carrying fragments as “seeds of transformation”—reads earned by prior beats. Interiority is specific (shadow‑weaving reframed as shields/bridges), though internal contradiction is gentle rather than pressure‑tested. The keeper provides a credible counter‑pressure without antagonism. The cost is conceptual (identity shift from enforcer to gardener) more than felt pain, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: mirrored glimpses and sensory cues build toward a conceptual repricing of the anomaly as a peace tool. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands on-page with a charged decision and reweighted mission. Some causality flows through explanation (keeper’s exposition) rather than dramatic testing, muting pressure. Still, the final image crystallizes a before/after with legible cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes and the mirror‑lined vintage store are vividly rendered and POV‑filtered; the fragment and apples recur to charge the ending. The setting doesn’t strictly constrain tactics but it meaningfully charges the final image (warmth vs. ice; descent back across floes). Detail selection is purposeful and consistent with the world’s rules. Minor lyric abstraction appears but doesn’t blur space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to engage the anomaly—exploit vs. cultivate) is signaled early and deepens via the mirrors’ revealed function. Escalation arrives through accumulating glimpses rather than a conflict turn; the tightening is Mira’s internal stance crystallizing. The price—foregoing enforcement posture—reads, but there’s little on‑page resistance or loss to heighten cost. Consequently, tension is elegant but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of empathy operationalized into action and compassion as heat are integrated through objects (apples, mirrors, shard) and culminate in a resonant revaluation. A few lines edge toward overt statement (“Every apple contains a seed of understanding”), trimming subtlety. The final image (shadows as invitation; gardener return) lands emotionally and conceptually. The piece avoids false equivalence and honors complexity within its quiet frame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, measured cadence; diction matches Mira’s disciplined, peacekeeper sensibility. Dialogue has aphoristic poise but carries subtext and advances meaning. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; psychic distance modulates lightly for lyric beats. A touch of sermonistic polish in the keeper’s lines keeps it from feeling fully lived‑in under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and carry multiple jobs; imagery (warmth in bark, copper apple) is fresh and controlled. Occasional platitude‑adjacent constructions threaten to purple (“map empathy onto action,” “courage to see others completely”), but rhythm and clarity hold. Minimal scaffolding or loops. The final cadence is strong without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard as empathic engine, mirrors as glimpses of alternate mercies, and warmth‑from‑understanding synthesize into a memorable, specific vision. The shift from enforcer to gardener is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric allegory, high‑concept metaphysics) pay off without muddling. Slight reliance on declarative thematic lines prevents a higher leap.</comment>
