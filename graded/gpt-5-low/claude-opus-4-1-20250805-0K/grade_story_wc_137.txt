<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elena’s skeptical rigor versus inherited mysticism generates credible internal friction, embodied in tactile moments (cold stone, warm tile, hands moving despite doubt). Her micro-choices—keeping the tile, centering it, transcribing—track cleanly with motive and pressure. The final acceptance feels earned, though the cost reads more contemplative than sharp. Slight safety in the arc (no real risk of loss beyond identity shift) keeps it from higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: whale songs, tile, and transcription accrue toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clear from the outset; the three-day migration creates a frame and clock. Closure lands as a reweighted understanding (“not magic…a lens”), with a felt cost of relinquishing strict skepticism. The cost is subtle but legible within this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower, cliff, and whales are sensorially vivid and consistently filtered through Elena’s scientific eye. The tile functions as object-as-setting, charging the final image and shaping choices. Weather and acoustics (vibrations up the cliff) affect perception and action. Strong integration without overdecorating.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to integrate mysticism and empiricism under a migration clock—is clear and tightens through the warming tile and escalating transcription. The three-day window and the “last whale” provide a meaningful cadence shift. Escalation is internal but coherent; cost is the foreclosing of a purely skeptical path. Pressure remains gentle, limiting peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of integration over repudiation emerges organically through recurring images (tile, songs, gaps between stars) and choices. The grandmother’s idea of “sculpting absence” is dramatized by Elena’s method change, not just asserted. A couple of aphoristic lines risk neatness but are grounded by action. The final image reweights the premise without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled third-person close sustains a consistent, lyrical yet precise voice aligned with a scientific mind opening to pattern. Rhythm modulates well from observational to epiphanic without head-hopping. Diction stays plausible for Elena, with restrained metaphoric reach. Minimal dialogue is apt and unobtrusive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, and action) with clean syntax and varied cadence. Figurative language (unheard symphony, sculpting absence) is purposeful and not overstacked. Minor repetition of thesis-like phrasing (“not quite music, not quite mathematics”) skirts redundancy but doesn’t stall momentum. Line-level clarity supports the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Whales-as-mathematics meeting constellations via a living tile is a fresh synthesis, with a non-obvious but inevitable-feeling reconciliation. The “lens not magic” turn reframes familiar mystic/science tension with specificity. Risks lyric mode without sacrificing legibility. Distinctive images linger beyond the read.</comment>
