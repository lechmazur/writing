<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marlowe’s motive—using a “duel” as covert negotiation toward resistance—is clear and consistent, with tactile traits (mechanical arm) grounding her intellect. Interiority is specific (questions as destinations; “intellectual jazz”) and her status dance with Reeves is legible. Contradictory impulses (iconoclasm vs. disciplined structure) are dramatized but the on‑page cost at closure is light. The endurance/renunciation component is implied rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: invitation decoded → duel intensifies → trinity of angles charges the final image. Orientation is clean early; single scene holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—the coded alignment reframes the duel as overture to revolution—with conceptual cost (risk, secrecy) more implied than enacted. No causality breaks, though the price is not sharply pressed in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass atrium, prismed light, brook, sundial, and mechanical arm are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Marlowe’s sensibility. The environment participates in meaning (angles, light, and space as code) and charges the closing trinity image. Sensory detail is economical and integrated with action. It stops short of constraining tactics physically, but it decisively shapes the aura and thematic charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conducting a covert revolutionary dialogue through a public duel—is clear and coherently escalates as their “fencing” densifies and names “Revolution.” The tightening comes via the alignment of codes rather than a hard turn; agency is present in the choice to encode and match angles. Costs are mostly conceptual and deferred; no on‑page sacrifice or foreclosed path beyond secrecy. Tension operates, but never bites down hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of inquiry as destination, structured improvisation, and resistance to dogmatism emerge through particulars (needle card, sundial, coded angles) rather than sermon. Subtext lives in the duel-as-overture and the respectful rivalry. A few lines state ideas directly (“intellectual jazz”), softening subtlety, but the final image reweights prior material without a neat moral. Resonance lingers as promise more than wound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical yet legible, with a distinct perceptual signature (angles, light, coded geometry). Dialogue feels purposeful with subtext (duel/negotiation) and differentiated idiom between Marlowe and Reeves. Psychic distance remains stable and apt; no head‑hopping. The register occasionally brushes the discursive, but remains character‑coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry good variety and momentum; images often do double duty (geometry as rhetoric). Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and consistent with the motif. Minimal scaffolding or loops; no muddled metaphors in the final third. Slight purplish glints don’t obstruct clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Philosophical dueling as covert code, the mechanical arm’s light‑tracing, and the sundial/needle‑card trinity feel fresh and integrated. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight and avoids gimmickry. Risk‑taking in form (accumulative, motif‑driven closure) pays off. Only the soft cost at the end keeps it from rarer heights.</comment>
