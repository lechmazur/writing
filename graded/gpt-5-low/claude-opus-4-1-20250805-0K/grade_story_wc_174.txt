<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motives and method are clear and character‑specific (calligrapher using shadow/ink to interrogate ethics). His serenity under attack reads as a defining flaw/virtue, though internal contradiction is muted—he rarely wavers after the collaborators leave. The tactile handling of the story stick and ink grinding grounds interiority. The closing choice to proceed, reframing the argument backward, feels earned by prior traits.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from the post‑argument hush toward a charged poise as he commits to a backward performance. Orientation is crisp from the first line (radar dome, who/when/where). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: ending→beginning ethics, with the price of losing collaborators and carrying responsibility made legible. Escalation is quiet but coherent; cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dome’s acoustics and ruptured panels shape tone and imagery, and the meteor view charges the final image. Tools (ink, brush) and the story stick are integrated into action rather than toured. The setting mirrors purpose (tracking echoes → translating stories) without heavy‑handed symbolism. It guides mood and meaning even if it only lightly constrains physical choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is ethical storytelling under reputational/relational pressure; the argument off‑page supplies external heat. The key tightening is his decision to invert the show’s causality, but on‑page conflict remains largely internal with limited turn pressure. Costs are implied (isolation, responsibility), not dramatized in confrontation. Tension sustains but doesn’t markedly ratchet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of narrative ethics, beauty as subversion, and cause/effect reversal accrue through objects and images, culminating in the meteor hush. Some lines tilt toward thesis (“the most subversive act…”), slightly reducing subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs without a tidy moral. The story’s answer arrives through image and plan rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady and textured; the voice is confident, with controlled lyricism (“cathedral echo,” “meteor hush”) and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction aligns with an urbane artist; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates well between reflective density and concrete action. A few grand abstractions flirt with over‑explanation but don’t breach plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean choreography; image systems are coherent (echo, light/shadow, reversal). Minor redundancy (“not mere entertainment—they were experiments…”) and occasional elevated aphorism slightly slow momentum. Figurative consistency holds; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. The final line is precise and resonant without fluff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: decommissioned radar dome + calligraphy‑shadow puppetry + ethical reversal is distinctive and purposeful. The backward‑told reconciliation‑to‑rupture plan reframes stakes cleverly. Risks in lyric tone and conceptual framing pay off with coherence. It feels singular rather than templated, with durable images.</comment>
