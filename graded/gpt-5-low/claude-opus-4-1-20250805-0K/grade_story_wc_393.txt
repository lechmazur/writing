<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eliza’s motive—to enact a repair as a way to metabolize grief—lands concretely in her hands and micro‑choices; Marcus’s long pursuit and decision to stay are consistent and purposeful. The sibling dynamic is refracted through action rather than exposition, especially when her movements echo Thomas’s. Internal contradiction appears in “He always broke things” versus her choosing to mend, but Marcus’s interiority is comparatively thin. The final stance (“maybe we deserve better...”) feels earned, though a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: causal delivery of the heart + journal, then a textural build through work that culminates in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis ending. Orientation is immediate; one scene; pressure tightens as they collaborate and the box comes alive. Closure lands on the page with cost—Eliza names Thomas’s deserving worse while choosing a different inheritance. The journal and repair serve as persistent constraints shaping tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shop, the weather, and the brass/copper specificity are vivid and woven through action, not static tour. The music boxes and the clockwork heart function as micro‑setting and charge the ending image. Light/shadow recur purposefully, though occasionally border on overt symbolism. Environment plausibly supplies the tools and context that enable the decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can an apology be made actionable) is signaled early and tightened by Eliza’s request for Marcus to stay. Escalation is quiet but real: the work itself becomes the test, and the ticking heart reweights options. The explicit price is emotional rather than external; low antagonistic pressure keeps ceiling just below elite tiers. Still, the on‑page choice to engage and continue constitutes credible agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Repair-as-forgiveness accrues through concrete labor, yielding a resonant final image of deliberate, non‑absolving grace. Subtext operates in silence, tools, and echoes of Thomas in Eliza’s movements. A few lines edge into on‑the‑nose theme statements (“neither forgiveness nor forgetting...”), slightly diluting the residue. Nonetheless, the piece invites reflection on earned stasis versus absolution without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV steadiness through Marcus is clean, with controlled free‑indirect distance that observes Eliza without overreaching. Dialogue is natural, coded with subtext (“second opinions”) and advances the scene. Diction and cadence are lyrical yet disciplined, modulating with the work’s tempo. No head‑hopping or explanatory crutches intrude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly efficient; sensory choices do multiple jobs. Minor purple notes (“blessing what was broken, celebrating what was whole”) and motif repetition nudge toward excess but don’t obscure clarity. Rhythm varies well and avoids scaffold or loops. Information density stays high with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The penitentiary‑learned repair guiding a sister’s hands is a fresh, specific angle on repentance. The “second opinions” frame for priesthood is a neat reframing that informs action, not just theme. While the forgiveness‑via‑craft trope exists, the execution feels personal and coherent. Risks are measured rather than radical, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
