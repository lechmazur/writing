<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and particular—staying to locate and “weigh” a swallowed truth—and her micro-choices (calibrating the magnetometer, drawing, smudging the signature, deciding to conceal) align with her fault-tolerance. Interiority is embodied and character-specific (truths “swaying like prayer flags,” “like altitude sickness”). The internal contradiction—holding multiple truths while navigating institutional scrutiny—feels lived, not declared. Stakes are modest but credible, with a felt cost in her choice to protect rather than publish.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is fast and clean (Station Seven, fever aftermath, single POV), and the accumulative/textural drive holds. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she accepts secrecy, smudges her signature, and reframes knowledge as survivable only in margins. The cost is legible (professional omission, self-imposed secrecy, isolation). The pattern of discovery → auroral witness → protective act coheres without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain weather station and its instruments are not decorative; they constrain and enable action (magnetometer calibration, auroral visibility, taped drawings in window margins). Environment and object-as-setting (the window, the illustration) charge the final image. Details feel selective and profession-filtered, supporting tone and theme. The setting’s altitude, cold, and tools shape what’s possible and what must be concealed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to handle an impossible truth—is signaled early and tightens when the aurora descends, forcing a stance between official record and marginal preservation. The reversal is quiet but firm: from seeking verification to choosing deliberate concealment. Cost (suppressing findings, accepting solitude of knowledge) is felt in the closing beats. Pressure is accumulative rather than antagonistic, but it coheres and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image rather than moralizing: truths surviving in margins, fault tolerance as an ethic, and the price of protecting the impossible. The aurora/flower motif reweights at the end into a conceptual repricing of knowledge ethics. The final image—“nothing and everything, depending on who was doing the measuring”—lingers without tidy closure. The fever as threshold enriches the theme without overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and grounded in Mira’s perceptual biases (instruments, weather, margins). Distance and tense remain stable; no head-hopping. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure, especially during the auroral witness and the smudging choice. Purposeful uncertainty reads as character-sourced, not authorial evasion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet clear; images are precise and layered (“grief made visible,” “fever dreams”), with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is consistent in vehicle (weather, magnetism, margins), avoiding mixed metaphors. Sentences vary in rhythm and function; line-level choices propel rather than stall. A few elevated turns verge toward purple but do not obscure sense or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of meteorology, oracle-like epistemology, and auroral botany feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “fault-tolerant” framework and margin-ethic transform familiar secrecy tropes into a principled, costly choice. Specifics (smudged signatures, window margins, magnetometer) keep the conceit grounded. Risk-taking in tone and concept heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
