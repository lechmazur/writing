<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (seek the stillpoint to refine her emotional cartography) is clear and her actions align. Interiority is textured through tactile/sonic perception, but contradictory impulses or visible on‑page cost are minimal. The shift to “becoming the destination” reads earned, if serene rather than hard‑won. The piece favors poise over conflict, limiting depth of micro‑choice pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density builds (languages via touch, ring’s hum, fragmentary melody) to a resonant reconfiguration at the stillpoint. Closure lands—she internalizes the compass and returns changed—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence holds. A slightly frictionless path to the stillpoint keeps this from 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vivid and purposeful—non‑aural song, bone‑level resonance, soil read by bare feet—integrated with action. The platinum ring and converging silence charge the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned in motion. Minor cap from the rubric gate prevents 9+ absent a category‑defining constraint at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the stillpoint to transform her mapping) tightens through the incomplete melody teaching her to “become the destination.” Escalation is coherent but gentle; pressure is more curiosity and calling than conflict. The ring’s intensifying hum and polyglot accrual mark one meaningful deepening. Price and foreclosed options remain soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of navigation through grief, language as emotion, and mapmaker becoming map cohere through image and action. The final repricing—carrying the stillpoint within—reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. One direct statement (“why she’d been born blind”) dulls subtext slightly. Overall resonance lingers with a quiet afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct sensory signature—touch and sound displace sight in diction and imagery. Rhythm modulates well; elevated register suits the fable‑lyric mode and remains character‑coherent. No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few high-flown lines flirt with abstraction but don’t break control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, and multi‑tasking sentences. Occasional purple flourish and conceptual reiteration (“quiet blaze,” “architecture”) lightly pad momentum but not clarity. Figurative network is consistent (sound, cartography, constellation pauses). No significant loops or mechanical artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis—ultrasonic arboreal languages, tactile polyglots, a compass ring keyed to emotional north—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The stillpoint as origin of all maps is a strong conceptual turn. Risk‑taking is confident and coherent. Slight safety in conflict keeps it from the topmost band.</comment>
