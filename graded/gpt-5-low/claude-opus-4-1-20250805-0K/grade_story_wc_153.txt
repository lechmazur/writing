<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority and a credible flaw (self‑protective silence) drive micro‑choices: she ventures into the labyrinth, commands “Show me,” selects the third window, and confesses. The maternal contradiction—gift as armor vs. love as risk—registers in tactile beats (shard pulsing, water, scars). The final choice is earned and carries cost (admitting fault, losing the shard). A slight drift toward declarative insight (“healing required exposure”) trims some messiness of emotion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid skewing Accumulative/Textural: ritual density builds to a single decisive act that reconfigures options (sending the dream‑message). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the causality is coherent: shard → windows → choice → message → shard crumbles. Closure lands with cost on the page and a new path opened (Marina coming). No plot amnesia or soft reset undermines the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth, moonlight, and spirits are sensorially vivid and purpose‑driven; the environment channels action (wading to the “heart,” condensation panes). The shard functions as a charged tool-object that constrains the ritual and culminates in the final image by crumbling. Setting details are POV‑filtered and evolve with the scene’s pressure. World rules remain consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (risking apology) is clear; tension tightens when the panes reveal three messages and she must choose, narrowing options. The escalation is internal but not static: choosing the third window and speaking the confession raises cost. The price is tangible (loss of the shard) and relational (accepting culpability) and drives the outcome. External antagonism is minimal, but the ritual pressure holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of vulnerability vs. isolation, guardianship that diverts vs. connects, and maternal atonement emerge organically through the shard’s function and the windows. The final image (shard turned to dust; message borne by spirits) reweights prior symbols without didacticism. One explicit thesis line about healing slightly overexplains what the images already earn. Subtext (fear masquerading as protection) reads in particulars, not labels.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (stone pulsing with heartbeat; “moonlight pooled like mercury”) remains steady and legible. Brief quoted lines carry subtext and advance pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the peak without head‑hopping. Diction stays coherent to the character’s ritual frame and avoids register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; sentences vary rhythmically and avoid scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and integrated with action. A couple of lines risk thematic telling, but momentum holds and the closure image is crisp. Mechanics are clean; no syntactic clutter obscures cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Notre‑Dame gargoyle shard as emotional conduit, unsent letters manifesting as condensation windows, and a mangrove spirit‑labyrinth. Turns feel inevitable once seeded (guardian diverting rain → diverting fear). The emotional calculus is specific to this mother-daughter bond rather than generic mysticism. Boldness is measured, not gimmicky, and serves the core choice.</comment>
