<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (descending during blackout, shifting tactics, accepting “enough”) align with her goal. Interiority is sensory‑driven and character‑particular (listening to frequencies), avoiding cliché. Internal contradiction is minimal; she operates with steady focus rather than visible ambivalence, slightly flattening the emotional dynamic. The endurance choice at the end carries a modest cost (partial truth, time pressure) that reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the accumulative/textural lens holds through the blackout clock and environmental constraints. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the preservation field returns, she loses her detection channel, but the marked truth persists for a future descent—at a cost of incompleteness. Because/therefore linkages are coherent (blackout → silence → detection → reactivation → loss), and the final image reweights prior actions. The cost is subtle but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater library, algae light, and preservation field are vivid and integrated; the environment both enables and constrains tactics (silence permits listening; EM field ends it). The antique stamp and algae wavelength deepen the micro‑setting with purposeful specificity. The final image (algae pulse guarding luminescent marks) is charged by place. World rules are learned through action rather than exposition and remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving authentic records before systems reactivate—is clear and tightens with the ticking blackout and discovery of more sophisticated forgeries. The meaningful turn is her “alternative hypothesis” leading to targeted page verification, narrowing options under time pressure. Cost is visible: she cannot finish; she accepts partial preservation and future risk. The pressure is coherent and grows without relying on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth versus manufactured history, analog resilience versus digital fragility, and the ethics of listening in stillness. The stamp/algae motif evolves from tool to charged emblem of patient guardianship. The final acceptance of “enough” reframes heroism as steady custodianship rather than triumph. No moralizing; resonance lingers through image and implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is steady, precise, and textural, with a distinct perceptual signature (frequency listening, tactile checks). Diction and rhythm modulate with the clock without strain; no head‑hopping. Purposeful elision is minimal and paid off by the blackout’s return. The lyric register suits the character’s sensibility and the setting’s hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, with high information density and minimal scaffold. Figurative touches (pulsing algae, humming spines) are consistent and grounded in the world’s logic. Repetition (algae glow) functions as motif rather than redundancy. Pacing accelerates naturally toward reactivation with no muddled metaphors or register slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—an underwater archive verified by acoustics during engineered silence, marked with algae‑visible ink—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The selective‑page forgery twist is specific and tactically consequential. The analog stamp as the reliable instrument against corporate erasure is conceptually rich without feeling schematic. Risk‑taking in image and method heightens stakes while preserving clarity.</comment>
