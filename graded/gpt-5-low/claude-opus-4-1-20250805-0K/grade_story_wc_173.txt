<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyralei’s motive is clear and particular—liberation through defying the Academy’s control—and her paradox (courtesan of celibacy) shapes how she acts and perceives. Interiority is embodied (“between sigh and smile” as tactic and belief), with the echoes affecting her movement in concrete ways. The main softness is struggle: she proves hyper-competent and encounters little resistance, so the felt cost remains largely conceptual. Still, the renunciation of obedience reads earned by her prior discipline and the accumulating echoes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story escalates via density—loosening threads releases echoes that reweight the final act; opening the prism and singing yields a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after (sanctuary emptied, self transformed). Orientation is clean and single-scene; causality is coherent. Cost is implied (defying the Academy), but not directly felt on the page, moderating the peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are vivid and recur with evolving function (threads as barriers; sanctuary as hoard; melted circles as final charge). Details are POV-filtered through her training, and the environment charges the last image. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action. Strong integration without over-touring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation vs institutional control—is signaled early and tightens as threads give way, culminating in the door opening and release of echoes. The deepening is real but largely unopposed; no counterforce tests her commitment beyond technique. The cost (becoming a fugitive figure, ending the Academy’s “sacred protection”) is conceptually present but not viscerally pressed in-scene. Tension is sustained by craft and cadence more than jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—devotion without submission; beauty serving itself—emerges from specific acts (untangling “possibilities twisted into chains,” singing a truer song). The “between sigh and smile” motif evolves meaningfully into the final repricing. A hint of didactic summation appears (“the dangerous knowledge that devotion could exist without submission”), slightly flattening subtext in the last third. Still, the ending image reweights the premise with satisfying resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature built from her discipline; rhythm modulates well between hush and surge. Diction fits the world and aim; images are largely controlled. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Minor moments flirt with purple, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, clean syntax, and good momentum for a lyric piece. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent and integrated with action; minimal repetition or scaffold. A few abstract formulations edge toward exposition in the final third. Overall, the prose carries both atmosphere and meaning without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The celibate courtesan academy, echo-harvesting threads, and serenity-as-revolt synthesize into a fresh, coherent vision. The method (bodily poetics used to undo constraints) feels organic rather than gimmicky. The risk lies in the lyric approach with conceptual stakes; it largely pays off, though a sharper on-page price could elevate further. Memorable images and a non-obvious reconfiguration at the end.</comment>
