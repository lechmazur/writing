<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chen’s motive—preserving a vanishing practice by teaching listening—drives clear choices (teaching the three modes, inviting others to find the rest, giving away the rosette). Her “expectantly resigned” stance plays against active generosity, earning the final renunciation. Embodied specificity (tracing mother-of-pearl, packing the zither) grounds emotion without gloss. Minor safety: her competence smooths struggle; internal contradiction could tighten under a sharper on‑page test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: arrivals and layered instruments intensify pattern toward a charged repricing at the end. Closure lands with cost: the program still ends, the zither goes to storage, and she surrenders the rosette as continuity. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the late guard’s “one hour” subtly tightens the window. The escalation is gentle rather than knife‑edged, but coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The velvet library and rosette are tactile and recurrent; space and object charge the climax (the exposed rosette, the building curfew). Seasonal texture (“autumn leaves,” “traveled stillness”) integrates with the sonic motif, not postcarded. The setting indirectly pressures choices (time limit, storage fate) while dignifying the listening practice. Slightly more physical constraint from the room itself could have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can communal practice outlast institutional loss—is signaled early and deepens as players arrive and the ensemble finds the five modes. The key tightening is her admission of limits and the collective tactic to “find the others,” culminating in the costly hand‑off of the rosette. Pressure remains coherent and grows through density rather than reversals. The conflict is quiet; one sharper beat of risk or potential fracture would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—art endures through gathered listening, not institutional sanction—emerges organically via action and the final image of shared modes. Subtext hums in “subtracting noise” becoming a social ethic; the cranes shift meaning. A direct thesis sentence (“arts vanish not when institutions abandon them…”) edges into moralizing and trims mystery. Overall resonance is strong, with image‑led closure carrying the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled third‑person close stays within Chen’s sensibility; diction feels lived, with musical and tactile noticing as her perceptual signature. Dialogue is economical and purposeful, carrying subtext (limits, communal recovery). Rhythm modulates well between lyric reflection and scene. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, with layered images that multitask (autumn/velvet/traveled stillness). Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked; sentences vary in cadence and avoid scaffold. A few aphoristic lines flirt with abstraction, but clarity and momentum hold. Final image reprises motifs without purple haze.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cross‑cultural ensemble and “subtracting noise” method feel fresh in execution, avoiding easy fusion clichés by foregrounding listening. The rosette/crane‑modes conceit is specific and memorable. The institutional‑cuts frame is familiar, but the hand‑off gesture and tone of earned stasis give it distinctive life. Strong synthesis over novelty fireworks.</comment>
