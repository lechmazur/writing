<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s competence and pragmatism ground the piece; her selections (seven mirrors, fog-silvered hand mirror) and the breathing ritual reveal character through choice. The astronomer’s desperation is credible, with a small but clear arc from skepticism to acceptance. Internal contradiction is light—Elara is steady rather than torn—so peak pressure shows limited inner friction. The final gift/renunciation (“carried, not captured”) feels earned, if emotionally gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence tightens cleanly: request → ritual → vision → break → repricing via the hand mirror. Causality is intact, with the broken breath collapsing the vision and necessitating Elara’s contingency. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a modest cost (abandoning capture for carrying). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fog‑preserved orchard and salvage workshop are vivid, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s craft‑bias. Environment and tools actively shape tactics (fog as prism and reagent; mirrors with “intentions”) and charge the final image in the hand mirror. Sensory detail is purposeful and integrated (sound resonance, frost prisms), not a catalog. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to recreate an annihilated vision—tightens with the synchronized breathing and climaxing revelation, then reverses when the pattern breaks. The price is conceptual (abandon capture), with a felt diminishment when the vision fades. Pressure is coherent but gentle; no hard trade‑off beyond acceptance. The turn is earned, if soft at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of permeability and chosen boundaries arise organically from mirrors, fog, and the failed attempt to “recreate.” The final image resonates, but the explicit thesis (“The dream isn’t meant to be captured. It’s meant to be carried.”) states what the images already show, blunting subtlety. Subtext lives in the craft vs. vastness tension and the reweighted tool. The emotional aftertaste lingers, though the moralizing note trims altitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to materials and process. Dialogue is spare, natural, and advances pressure without exposition. Psychic distance stays steady on Elara; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates well during the ritual and the fade.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete nouns, and images that do double duty (the sextant’s “singing,” fog as lens). A few lush metaphors stack but remain coherent; no paraphrase loops or cadence templates drag momentum. Syntax varies and carries scene pressure cleanly. Closing image is crisp without purple bleed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—mirror craft, fog‑memory, a shattered sextant, and synchronized breathing—feels fresh and internally consistent. The reconfiguration from capture to carrying is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off in image and tactic. Emotional specificity and object‑logic elevate it beyond trope.</comment>
