<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—restore the old rituals—is clear and consistent, and her choice to abandon tools for memory gives her agency. Interiority is lyrical and embodied (“weathered fingers… withered tendril”) but inner contradiction is minimal; she encounters little resistance once she hums. The shift from tinkerer to song‑keeper hints at renunciation but the cost is soft. The villagers’ arrival adds validation rather than pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single‑POV, one continuous scene (dawn to moonrise) with a clean accumulative/textural drive culminating in RR: the vine blooms and the community re‑aligns. Orientation is immediate and causality reads: humming → shiver → uncurl → communal singing → bloom. Closure lands on the page; however, the felt cost is modest and the success feels relatively unopposed, keeping it below the highest band. The “alignment” clock helps coherence without adding a true turn of jeopardy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arbor is vividly rendered and integral: dew, green cathedral, moonlight shaft, and the final silvered bloom charge the last image. Setting is not postcard‑only; the arbor focuses action and makes the remedy plausible within its world logic. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, especially the perfume of remembrance. Minor bias toward visual lushness is balanced by tactile cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (revival of sacred practices) and there’s a gentle tightening (tendril’s response, moon’s approach, communal voices). Yet resistance is minimal; the first tactic works and no meaningful trade‑off or loss alters tactics. Pressure remains coherent but soft, with little jeopardy or escalation beyond accumulation. The resolution is earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—repairing communal memory through embodied song rather than mechanism—emerges organically from action and images. The tinkerer’s reorientation toward old ways avoids sermonizing, though lines like “You remember when we knew why we sang” edge close to thesis‑speak. The final bloom reweights prior images with a resonant, non‑literal answer. Sentiment is largely earned, not syrupy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a distinct, confident texture; diction and rhythm are well‑controlled. POV remains tight to Elara without leaks; the sparse dialogue is functional and unobtrusive. Cadence modulates from hush to celebration without losing coherence. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that carry multiple jobs. Figurative language is lush but coherent; few, if any, muddled metaphors or redundancy loops. Occasional elevated phrasing risks purple but stays anchored in concrete action. The closing image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise is familiar (tradition restored by song under a harvest moon), but personalized by the whimsical tinkerer angle and object‑centred remedy. Fresh specifics—“fixed broken clocks with butterfly wings”—add texture. The turn from gadgetry to memory is elegant if not surprising. Overall, refined execution over breakthrough novelty.</comment>
