<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Calla’s motive—transforming ruin into reverence through stitching—reads clear and consistent, with embodied habits (sleepwalking, needle in hand) that reveal her. However, internal contradiction is mild; we don’t see a live dilemma or a pressured choice that costs her beyond endurance. The “neither fully awake nor asleep” state offers complexity but isn’t stress‑tested by opposition. Actions align with motive and earn the quiet endurance at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the illustration plate children animate and her stitching reframes the labyrinth as a bridge; the old rules drown and a new stance holds. Cost is conceptual and elegiac (accepting the old world’s loss and living between sleep and wake), though not sharply priced on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern of overlap teaches itself and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal labyrinth is vividly rendered and functionally constraining: shifting passages, red stone, barnacled petroglyphs, and lunar cycles shape her methods and the overlap sites. The setting charges the final image (children dancing on canyon walls) and informs tactic (sew where paths overlap). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered through a “weaver” mind. World rules (rising seas; desert meeting ocean) remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure accrues via pattern density rather than antagonism; the key deepening is the discovery/use of overlap points and the plate warming into animation. Stakes remain largely conceptual—transformation vs. restoration—so the price and narrowing of options are soft. The noon/tide window hints at a clock but doesn’t pinch tactics decisively. The escalation still coheres under the accumulative lens with a clear cadence shift when the children move.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of “broken precedents → transformed myths” emerges through action, not lecture, with the “not restoration, but transformation” line skirting but not tipping into moralizing. Recurring objects (needle, plate, labyrinth overlaps) reweight at the end. The piece invites reflection on making meaning after loss without false balance or neat fixes. The final orchid‑hued solace image resonates as earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is controlled and distinct, with a perceptual signature grounded in textile and tidal imagery. Psychic distance is steady; no head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates from dawn hush to mid‑day surge to drowsy cadence. Purposeful elision (impossible stitches) reads as rule‑consistent rather than coy withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images (nautilus overlap, stitching air) do multiple jobs. A few abstractions (“miracle,” “anything could take root”) edge toward telling but remain supported by concrete images. Figurative texture is lush without muddle; repetition is purposeful. Syntax and paragraphing maintain momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of wharf weaving, tidal desert labyrinth, and time‑thread stitching feels fresh and internally coherent. The nautilus overlap mechanic is an elegant, specific twist that earns the final reconfiguration. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. The only limiter is the gentleness of on‑page cost.</comment>
