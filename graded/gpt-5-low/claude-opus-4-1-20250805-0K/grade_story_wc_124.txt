<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—grief braided with professional caution—drives precise choices (careful uncorking; recorking; claiming the lantern). The internal contradiction between being “aromatically cautious” and choosing to risk temporal echoes reads earned. Embodied emotion (tears refracting into spectra) feels character‑specific, not generic. The renunciation/embrace at the end forecloses a previous identity (broker only) with a visible cost (bearing an archive of loss).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, fragrance waves, images, and tools (UV lamp, lantern) build toward a resonant reconfiguration: she becomes the archive. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/why-now). Closure lands on the page with cost in the final cadence—grief reweighted as permanent duty. Causal links (note → vial → scents → memories → transformation) are tight without over‑mechanizing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse and UV lamp are not decorative: spectral roots, nameplates as tombstones, and glass behaviors constrain perception and charge the ending. Setting is filtered through vocation; details are selective and purposeful (extinct flora, pressed glass, dying stars’ lanterns). The final image reactivates the place—“the extinct garden blooming invisibly”—making environment inseparable from meaning. World rules read consistent and are learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to open and absorb the vial’s cost, tightening as scents intensify and personal history surfaces. The escalation is a density increase appropriate to the chosen lens, culminating in a stance crystallization. The price—carrying the archive of losses—is legible and ongoing. A single sharper on‑page resistance beat could have heightened the narrowing of options further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: preservation as grief, tears as translations, light of lost things. The final repricing (“She was the perfume now…”) reweights all prior images without collapsing into didacticism, though a couple lines edge close to thesis‑speak. Subtext accrues via the mother’s inventions and the ethics of holding the last light. The resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, sensuous, and consistent with Elara’s vocation and restraint. Syntax modulates with pressure; the prose does not over‑explain. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference stays within plausible POV knowledge. Patterned diction (crystal, ultraviolet, lantern) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, image‑dense, and largely free of loops or scaffold; sentences often carry multiple jobs. Figurative language is vivid and coherent to the world (light, glass, scent) without purple drift. Minor risks of thematic overstatement are contained by strong imagery. Rhythm supports the accumulative build and the quiet, charged landing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lanterns infused with dying stars, UV‑revealed spectral botany, and a perfume of extinct flowers synthesize into a singular, memorable system. The transformation into an olfactory archive feels both fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise’s implications at the end.</comment>
