<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s abrasive calm, isolation, and principled distrust drive every beat, culminating in a credible pivot to collaboration that costs him his solitary rebellion. Interiority is specific (water‑damaged texts, cross‑referencing) and revealed through objects and stance. The dynamic with the historian shows legible status shifts. A slight didactic tilt in dialogue (“Truth isn’t democratic”) keeps it from an even higher mark.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens: confrontation → evidence dispute → reveal (“We know”) → proposition → decision (“Show me your method”). Orientation lands early and the closure is a Decisive Change with a felt cost (choosing secrecy over proclamation). Stakes hold to one thread—how to preserve the true history—and tighten with the reversal. A hair from 9+ due to a brief expository feel in the reveal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sunken city and sewer micro‑setting are vivid and tactically relevant (diving gear, tunnels, green water), and the chronometer gear/journal charge the final descent. Details are selective and POV‑filtered, never tourist‑catalogue. Environment mirrors and constrains choices without overt symbolism. Strong integration without a single set‑piece constraint to push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently: Marcus challenges the official narrative, the historian counters with complicating evidence and a hidden motive, and the stakes pivot to how truth will be preserved. The “We know” beat is a meaningful tightening that redefines options. The cost is implicit but legible in Marcus’s acceptance of secrecy. Slightly low on visible external jeopardy keeps it shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Competing narratives/time as location resonate through cog, chronometer, sediment, and the final descent; the last line offers a non‑literal answer (truth must be layered and hidden to survive). Some thematic lines are stated outright, trimming subtlety. Subtext persists in the method metaphor and the journal’s weight. The piece avoids platitudes, but a touch of moralizing rhetoric curbs the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature; dialogue carries subtext and intent and the two voices are distinguishable. Registers mostly fit background and stress; occasional thesis‑y lines read slightly written but don’t break scene action. Rhythm modulates with tension. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive sentences with strong verbs and purposeful imagery (“barnacles creep across marble statues,” “green‑tinted water”). Minor redundancy and a few declarative abstractions (“Truth isn’t democratic”) soften the edge. Otherwise high information density with minimal scaffolding. Final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a literally sunken “Athens,” plague‑era tech denial, and chronometer craft as epistemic ballast feels fresh and coherent. The turn—historians knowingly curating a lie while preserving methods—reweights prior beats in an unexpected way. Emotional truth (choosing to hide truth now to save it later) reads specific rather than templated. Not revolutionary, but confidently original.</comment>
