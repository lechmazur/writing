<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s meticulousness, caution, and integrity drive all choices, with clear stakes once she realizes her data is being weaponized. Fear versus duty registers in small, credible ways (lateral moves, hidden caches). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than deeply dramatized, keeping this shy of the top band. The decision to persist under surveillance reads earned and character‑true.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the pigeon arrival → official seals → first note → hidden note → decision → reply sequence coheres and tightens. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she recommits with new tactics under increased risk. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, but the threat of surveillance and appropriation of her work is clear. Orientation is crisp from the opening image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The courtyard, instruments, and dusk light are vivid and POV‑filtered by a weather professional. Tools and setting (anemometer, barometer, lamp) actively shape behavior and charge the final image of lamplight calibrations. The atmosphere of layered calm versus covert upheaval enriches meaning without over‑symbolizing. Strong economy and specificity throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving truthful records under oppression—is clear early and intensifies with the hidden note and surveillance memory. The meaningful tightening arrives with the second message, reframing her role and forcing a recommitment with new risk and tactics. On‑page cost remains mostly conceptual; no concrete loss or immediate consequence is shown. Still, tension rises at beat and story scales.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of integrity as resistance, the politicization of data, and memory (“the storms remember everything”) accrue through image and action. Final cadence reweights prior details into a credo without platitude. A hint of explicit thesis language (“scientific precision wielded against tyranny”) slightly blunts subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, precise close third with a distinct observational lexicon suits the protagonist and material. Rhythm and diction modulate between technical specificity and lyric calm without leakage or head‑hopping. Notes-as-dialogue are clean and character‑true. No gratuitous withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences are lean yet musical; details often do double duty (world + character). Minimal scaffolding, no paraphrase loops, and figurative choices stay coherent. Occasional elevated line risks overstatement but remains within voice. Final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Weather manipulation within a sealed zone, a dovecote of resistance, and data as insurgency feel fresh and organically fused to character. Turns arise from specific professional habits and tools rather than generic thriller beats. The hidden note reprise is satisfying without gimmick. Boldness is measured, coherent, and memorable.</comment>
