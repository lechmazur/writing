<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is vivid and specific—burning forgeries to defend a buried truth—and her tactile “volcanic tenderness” grounds emotion in body. However, internal contradiction is limited; she rarely wavers or struggles on the page, and micro‑choices under pressure are minimal beyond deciding to study the weave. The isolation cost and self‑recrimination read, but they’re largely asserted rather than dramatized. Still, the fusion of forensic acuity and ancestral pull feels character‑particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: breadcrumb revelations layer toward a Charged Poise ending where she commits to mastering the technique. Orientation is clear early (Prague monastery, limestone corridors), and the causal chain from vandalized art to archive is coherent even in summary. Closure lands as a meaningful reconfiguration—arsonist to keeper—with a conceptual cost (isolation, hunted status) implied on the page. The price is more conceptual than dramatized, keeping it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is sensorial and purposeful—the copper‑tasting air, carved shelves, and textile fragments shape her actions and final vow. The archive and tapestry are not postcard details; they function as tools/resources that steer her toward staying to learn the weave. World rules (forgeries, UV map, pigment formulas) feel internally consistent at this scale. A slightly stronger constraint from the environment at the end would push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reclaiming imperishable memory) is clear, and pressure deepens as she decodes the tapestry’s molecular secret. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than adversarial; the tightening occurs when she realizes the portraits were deliberate instructions culminating here. On‑page cost is muted—no live opposition or trade‑off beyond renunciation/solitude. The cadence shift to commitment works, but the test of commitment remains largely deferred.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of truth, erasure, and inheritance emerge organically through images (weaves, damaged art as maps) rather than lecture. The final reframe—destroyer to keeper—offers a resonant answer about making truth “imperishable,” though some lines risk overstatement (“power to preserve truth”). Subtext around genetic memory and moral ambiguity of arson is compelling. A touch less thesis‑forward phrasing could heighten lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyric, and coherent with Mira’s perceptual biases (forensic art/science lexicon). Distance remains stable, and the rhythm adapts well between tactile present and compressed backstory. Diction choices like “volcanic tenderness” recur with intention and pay off in the closing image. No head‑hopping or register misfires.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line craft is tight and vivid, with multi‑tasking sentences that advance mood and information. Minor abstraction creeps in near the end (“make truth permanent”), and the “volcanic tenderness” phrase repeats, though as motif rather than filler. Figurative language is controlled and legible; no scaffold loops or cadence monotony. The prose sustains momentum without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—arsonist of libraries as surgeon of truth, vandalism as encrypted guidance, textiles encoding molecular permanence—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The lost‑archive beneath a monastery is familiar, but the thread‑encoded chemistry and moral calculus lift it. Risks are thematic and conceptual rather than structural, and they cohere. A live, concrete price on the page would edge this toward exceptional.</comment>
