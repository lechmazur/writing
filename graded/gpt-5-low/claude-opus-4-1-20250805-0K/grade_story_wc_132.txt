<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive—studying to understand—credibly collides with his fear of losing control, culminating in the on‑page micro‑choice not to pull away as the leaf merges. Interiority is embodied (green nails, rootlike lines under skin) rather than labeled. The grandmother’s influence grounds his shift without feeling like a retrofit. The cost—relinquishing full human identity—is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via rain‑triggered anomalies to the decisive acceptance of merger, delivering a clear RR/DC. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (who/where/when are all clear). The closure’s cost—identity reconfigured—lands on the page in the final image. No causality breaks or soft resets; the scene coheres in one tightening arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The nursery and storm‑soaked trellis are sensorially vivid and consistently filtered through a botanist’s attention. Weather and moss aren’t postcard details; they catalyze and charge the final touch and transformation. The environment doesn’t just decorate—it participates in the rules of change. Minor caution: the setting pressures rather than strictly constrains tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to resist or yield—tightens as the leaf begins to merge, forcing a choice with visible cost. Escalation is internal but legible (glowing moss, prehistoric ferns, bodily signs) and culminates in a single, consequential action: releasing control. The lack of an antagonist doesn’t blunt pressure because the environment serves that role. A touch more external friction could have sharpened the price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Control versus communion is dramatized rather than preached; images carry the load, especially the linden merging and the moss’s “recognition.” The grandmother’s dictum risks explicitness but feels earned and transforms at the end into lived philosophy. The final image reweights earlier details with a resonant cost. Complexity persists: the gain entails a loss that isn’t tidily resolved.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is steady, precise, and character‑specific, with diction matching a lifelong plantsman’s sensibility. Lyric passages remain legible under pressure and modulate well into the climax. No POV leakage or head‑hopping; distance stays close enough for embodied perception. The few quoted lines fold naturally into the narrative texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, rhythmic, and economical; images do multiple jobs without bloat. Figurative language is fresh and controlled (“watercolor on wet paper,” “thorns that spiraled like DNA”) and doesn’t tangle sense. Minimal scaffolding and no looped paraphrase; momentum holds from first to last. A faint lyric saturation in mid‑paragraphs skirts purple but stays disciplined.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Plant–human metamorphosis is familiar, but the storm‑season trigger, occupational grounding, and tactile merger via a single leaf feel distinct. The “becoming with” ethos integrates premise and theme rather than serving as garnish. Risks are taken in maintaining a quiet, lyric closure with real cost. It’s not radical, but it’s confidently and freshly realized.</comment>
