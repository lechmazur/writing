<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marcus’s motivation—math‑driven escape entwined with regret for Sarah—is coherent and specific, and his micro‑choices (seven‑step cadence, rolling, recalculating) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The grim optimism vs. grief tension feels lived-in rather than stated. The final endurance choice (Charged Poise) is earned, though the on‑page cost remains mostly conceptual rather than freshly dramatized at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned action accrues until the closing charged stance. Orientation is clear early; the loop revelation and 17‑billion‑step cost provide structural gravity. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost rather than a decisive turn, which limits peak impact but remains valid for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The staircase and dice act as micro‑setting constraints that shape tactics and the final image; world rules (closed system, energy conservation) stay consistent. Sensory specificity is selective and POV‑filtered (“dice tumble upward,” “staircase hummed”). Strong integration without static cataloguing. Excellent, if just short of utterly transporting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the closed system—tightens via the seven‑step pattern, entropy accruing in the chip, and the terrifying loop length tied to Sarah. Pressure coheres, but escalation remains largely conceptual; no single on‑page beat forecloses a tangible option beyond the chosen endurance. The price (time, isolation, regret) is felt but not newly intensified at the final beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: perfection vs. necessary imperfection; determinism vs. chance; faith in proof vs. human loss. The chipped die’s evolving meaning reweights the premise, avoiding moralizing. The mathematics‑as‑theology frame integrates with character rather than floating as commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined voice—precise yet lyrical—matches a mind trained in proofs. Diction and rhythm stay consistent under pressure; metaphors align with the conceptual frame. No head‑hopping or stance drift; psychic distance modulates cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are lean with purposeful repetition and high information density; images often do dual duty (probability as both world-rule and grief-language). Minor near‑echoes are functional rather than filler; figurative choices stay coherent. Cadence supports the accumulative pressure without sludge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of Escher‑like architecture, proof‑born reality, and a chipped die as engineered imperfection. Emotional stakes (missed departure with Sarah) tether the high concept. Risk‑taking lands without gimmickry, though the ending’s restraint keeps it short of revelatory.</comment>
