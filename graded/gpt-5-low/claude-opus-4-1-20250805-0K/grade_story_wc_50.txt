<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—studying and documenting the temporal lock rather than fixing it—is clear and coherently tied to her locksmithing ethos. The internal contradiction (repair vs. document damage) subtly drives her micro‑choices and culminates in the choice to leave it unfixed. Emotions are embodied through craft‑specific perception (listening to silence, working peripherally) rather than labels. The cost is present but quiet, landing more as renunciation than a wrenching sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early via reflections and held through the noon acoustics shift to the closing renunciation. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: wonder is “preserved” by mapping its escape, and she leaves the device in place. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; cause/effect is coherent inside the piece’s rule‑set. The cost is the foreclosed path of immediate repair and possession, legible in her ascent and deferred return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern’s physicalities (veined stone, camera obscura at dawn, shifting acoustics, reflective pool) actively shape tactics and reveal states of the timer across time. Mirrors, angles, and surfaces constrain how she can look and work, charging the final image of ascent with chosen restraint. World rules are learned through use, not exposition. The environment feels indispensable to both method and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to fix or document as time phenomena intensify (dawn reflections to noon pre‑echoes). The noon shift tightens options by teaching repairs from the future, making her refusal to “fix” now a priced stance. Stakes remain intimate but legible; the cost is opportunity and ethical posture toward wonder. Escalation is measured rather than dramatic, consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of brokenness revealing deeper mechanisms and the ethics of preserving wonder emerge organically from concrete craft and observation. The ending reweights the premise without a tidy moral, though one sentence (“She would know that wonder could be preserved…”) edges toward explicit statement. Recurring images (mirrors, echoes, angles) accrue subtext about indirection and humility. Resonance lingers in the choice to leave it and keep a backwards manual.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, confident, craft‑inflected voice threads locksmith metaphors with temporal imagery without head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with Mara’s perceptual signature. Elision is purposeful; knowledge claims stay within the POV’s plausible inference given the story’s rules. Modulation tracks scene pressure from dawn to noon to departure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density; images like “veins of quartz like frozen lightning” and “listening to silence” are vivid without purple sprawl. Occasional abstractions in the final third slightly explain what the images already imply. Syntax varies and momentum holds; no notable loops or template cadence. Figurative language remains coherent to the established physics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Temporal locks read indirectly through reflections is a fresh angle, married to an artisanal, non‑grandiose approach to time. The blueprint‑of‑malfunction ethos reframes repair narratives with originality and integrity. Risks in structure and concept heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The final repricing—preserve wonder by charting its leak—is memorable and earned.</comment>
