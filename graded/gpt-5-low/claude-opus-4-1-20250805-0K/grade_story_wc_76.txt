<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—her craft and her grandmother’s legacy drive the attempt—and her choices align with those traits. Interiority is specific (“forty years crafting timepieces that ran backward”) and embodied in action. However, there’s limited contradiction or real hesitation under pressure, which softens the felt cost of the final choice. The single whispered line hints at empathy toward the stone but doesn’t test her values meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: reverse‑engineered yoyo → dismantling lens backward → wiring → inversion. The decisive change lands on the page with a clear before/after (consuming darkness → generating light). Cost is mostly conceptual (reversing a prison designed to prevent harm; summoning lost ships), not viscerally felt, slightly limiting impact. Orientation is clean and maintained in a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, hunger stone, and lens assembly function as lived constraints on action; the yoyo and copper wire act as micro‑settings/tools that determine tactics. Vivid, selective details (“water dripped backward up the walls,” “darker than absence”) are filtered through the protagonist’s craft‑biased perception. The setting charges the final image (reverse light across the sea) and integrates with world rules. Little wasted description; atmosphere is cohesive and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the single stake of inverting the stone, with one meaningful tightening as the latent radiance intensifies and the stone “writhes.” The escalation is clean but largely competence‑driven; risk and trade‑off feel muted. The reversal “sound like time itself cracking” delivers the peak, but the price paid is more inferred than dramatized. Still, agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of reversing purpose, fate/agency, and repairing the past emerge organically through the counter‑clockwise craft and the stone’s inversion. The final paragraphs tip into explicit statement (“Some souls were born to repair the past”), dulling subtext and introducing a Thematic Echo. The backward beam reweights prior images elegantly, but the spelled‑out thesis undercuts ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect remains, if somewhat managed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, selective, and character‑tuned; diction reflects a craft‑minded, lyrical sensibility without head‑hopping. Rhythm varies and tightens appropriately around peak beats. A single line of dialogue is integrated and purposeful. No withholding beyond purposeful reveal; the voice maintains confidence without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and largely efficient; metaphor choices are coherent with the premise (time, hunger, light). Momentum is maintained through action‑tethered description; minimal scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative density is high but controlled, with no mixed metaphors that blur sense. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—counter‑clockwise craft, a reverse‑engineered yoyo key, a hunger stone that inverts from consumption to generation, and “latent radiance”—feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns arise from established logic and character skill rather than late rule changes. The risk‑taking is tonal and conceptual rather than structural, paying off in a strong final image. Slight conventionality in the spelled‑out theme keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
