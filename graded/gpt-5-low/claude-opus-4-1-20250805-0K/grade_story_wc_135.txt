<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kessa’s motive—compiling fragments into meaning for a community marked by exile—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (staggered intervals, emotional curation, repurposing the valve). Interiority is embodied via tactile archival acts rather than abstract labels. The piece is light on contradictory impulses under pressure; she mostly operates with serene competence. Still, the small renunciations and quiet endurance read credible at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds patterned density (light strata, fragments, valve beats) toward a charged final image that reweights absence as grammar. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise in the last valve turn, with the conceptual cost of living with navigated absences intact. Orientation is clean early; causality coheres for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain, salt crystals, and the archives are specific and lived-in; the light through rain-washed windows functionally shapes tactics (staggered intervals). The herald’s valve as micro-setting/object constrains transitions and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a professional’s gaze. World rules stay consistent and economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes focus on whether meaning can be recompiled from absence, with pressure deepening via discoveries (light reveals, valve telegraph) and culminating in opening the archive and the final sigh. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; no sharp reversal, yet the cadence tightens into a ritualized closure. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral, which limits intensity but suits the design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of absence-as-grammar and communal reconstitution emerge organically from curation acts and object reuse; the ending reweights earlier motifs without didactic moralizing. A line like “absence has its own grammar” edges toward thesis-stating but is balanced by image-driven craft (constellations, water-marks). The final valve’s in-between sound offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person close maintains a distinct, lyrical yet controlled perceptual signature consistent with Kessa’s vocation. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual (Matthias’s “hearten” prompt). Rhythm and diction modulate gracefully without head-hopping or register slips. Elision is purposeful and legible under the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied rhythm; metaphors align with the water/archive lexicon and avoid mixed vehicles. Minimal scaffolding; no paraphrase loops or cadence templates. The prose propels gently without purple excess, and the last line resolves by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “ocean-spray archivist,” valve-telegraph, and light-strata method synthesize into a fresh, coherent vision. Risks in form (accumulative lyric, object-as-metronome) heighten meaning and closure without obscuring clarity. The premise feels singular and inevitable in hindsight, not a template.</comment>
