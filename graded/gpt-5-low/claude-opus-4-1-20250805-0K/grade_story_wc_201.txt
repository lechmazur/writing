<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s interiority is precise and embodied (angles, grams, vertebrae), with a credible contradiction between conditioned terror and chosen gentleness. Her decision to invert the strap’s fastening and to teach the child grows organically from earlier micro‑choices. A hair of over‑tidy articulation (“mathematics of mercy”) edges toward thesis, but action carries the turn. Cost remains present in persistent trauma and exile rather than erased.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and patterning build to a conceptual repricing where cruelty’s formulas find reciprocals. Orientation is clear early (recovery station, exile after treaty), and closure lands on the page with the strap’s removal, the walk into the forest, and the teaching act. External pressure is a touch soft (the rehab announcement doesn’t pinch later), but the persistent constraint of trauma shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The UV forest and the body-as-instrument function as setting and constraint, literally changing what paths she can see and how she approaches the child. Details (Fibonacci moss, spectrum layering) are POV‑filtered and purposeful, culminating in the final image charged by place‑specific visibility. The pewter strap also acts as micro‑setting that charges the ending. World rules are consistent and discovered through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming agency to transform pain into mercy) is established and tightens through the strap beat to the choice to engage the child. The escalation is a deepening rather than a hard reversal, suited to the lens, with visible price in owning trauma responses. Pressure could sharpen once more on the page, but the stance crystallization is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring math/reciprocal imagery and is enacted by inverted motions and calibrated gentleness. The final recognition reframes prior pain as a system that can be solved against, not erased, yielding resonance beyond the scene. A slight explicitness in stating the thesis tempers subtlety, but the images bear the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice’s perceptual signature—numbered precision, spectrum awareness—feels idiosyncratic and controlled. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head‑hopping; brief dialogue reads natural and functional. Elevated vocabulary matches an enhanced intelligence officer’s mind and remains consistent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet clean, with varied syntax and purposeful images that do multiple jobs. Figurative texture (inverse equations, Fibonacci spirals) is coherent to the POV and avoids muddle; minimal redundancy. A few abstract phrases brush the edge of thesis, but momentum and clarity are preserved through the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of proprioceptive math, UV ecology, and repurposed interrogation heuristics feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric science‑tinged diction; conceptual closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The core twist—solving for mercy’s reciprocals—reconfigures familiar trauma tropes with specificity.</comment>
