<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation and moral rot are crisply drawn, and his recognition of complicity grows credibly from tactile discoveries (the dates, coordinates). The decision to shut down his business is motivated and bears cost. Internal contradiction (profit from erasure vs. late hunger for truth) is present but resolves a touch tidily, with limited on‑page friction. A sharper moment of resistance or self‑serving rationalization under pressure could have deepened the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: the watch hand summons him, the carvings concretize his grandfather’s crimes, the implied accuser forces a choice, and he renounces his work. Closure lands as Decisive Change with a resonant final image (placing the hand among the carvings) and a stated cost. Reflection is anchored in present action and stays within scope. A live counterforce on the page could have intensified the turn, but the situational pressure holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, dusk light, and salt‑worn carvings create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere filtered through Elias’s gaze. Objects-as-setting (carvings, watch hand) charge the ending and carry thematic weight. The shore doesn’t physically constrain tactics, but it situates the moral excavation. Sensory balance and economy are strong without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continue selling erasure or confront inherited harm—is signaled early and tightens as the carvings cohere into a damning map. The arrival of the anonymous watch hand adds external pressure, and the recognition “someone knows” escalates stakes. The renunciation forecloses a lucrative path with cost. Slight softness stems from the absence of an on‑scene adversary or immediate consequence beyond resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. comfort, generational complicity, and the commerce of memory emerge organically from particulars. Recurring images (carvings, watch hand) reweight meaning at the end. A couple of closing lines verge on thesis statement (“Some weights…”) blunting the otherwise potent subtext. Still, the piece leaves a resonant afterimage rather than a sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled third‑person limited with consistent distance and a measured lyric edge. Diction suits a precise, ethically compromised professional without drifting into alien register. Rhythm modulates well as revelations accrue. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑driven, and efficient; sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum. Minor tendencies toward abstract summation in the final paragraph and a faint aphoristic tilt slightly dull the edge. Figurative language is apt and not overstacked. The last image lands clearly without syntactic clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The black‑market genealogist angle, the driftwood confession‑map, and the watch hand as summons feel fresh and integrated. The turn from fabricator of lineage to penitent archivist is earned and non‑obvious. Risks are tonal and conceptual rather than structural, and they pay off. A bolder twist in consequence or a more idiosyncratic cadence under peak pressure could lift it further.</comment>
