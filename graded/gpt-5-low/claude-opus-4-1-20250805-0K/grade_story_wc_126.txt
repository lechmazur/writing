<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent: to coax sound back from devastation without forcing it. Her embodied attention to acoustics and micro‑choices in pacing notes reveal character under pressure. Internal contradiction is light—she rarely wavers—so the arc leans more toward acceptance than contested change. The closing understanding feels earned but a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the music accrues, the hush is reweighted, and the community gathers, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is precise from the opening. Cost is legible on the page—loss of rainforest, damaged instruments, and the choice to embrace incomplete forms rather than restore what was. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing in the final image (“perfect incompletion”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s glass, water, and shipwrecks actively shape acoustics and thus tactics, not mere backdrop. Environmental features generate harmonics, wind percussion, and communal amphitheater functions that pressure choices and charge the ending. Detail selection is vivid and purposeful, filtered through an acoustically attuned POV. The final image is inseparable from this place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether sound—and by extension communal life—can reform from damage; escalation arrives through density: solo to ensemble to communal ritual. The tightening is quiet but real: a deliberate rejection of polished restoration in favor of incomplete emergence. Visible prices (damaged instruments, offerings instead of money, abandonment of “old songs”) register. A stronger moment of friction would lift pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect rebirth is organically embedded through acoustics, offerings, and altered tradition. Subtext hums in the greenhouse transforming the hush and in musicians playing damaged instruments. The grandmother’s maxim returns with reweighted meaning without lapsing into sermonizing. The final line edges toward neatness but remains emotionally honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person closely held to Mara provides a distinct perceptual signature (hearing “melodies in the spaces between sounds”). Rhythm modulates well as the ensemble grows, and diction stays aligned with the POV’s acoustic bias. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Silence and action carry subtext effectively without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑dense, and largely free of scaffold or loops; most sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative language is controlled and tied to sound and setting, rarely purple. Minor repeats (e.g., perfection/incompletion) are purposeful rather than redundant. The cadence supports momentum into the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a sunken greenhouse amphitheater, shipwreck percussion, and acoustically perceptive protagonist feels fresh. The accumulative rebuild of a music culture from damaged tools adds non‑obvious specificity to a familiar healing motif. Turns arise from place‑driven acoustics and community response, not a template twist. Risks are tasteful and coherent.</comment>
