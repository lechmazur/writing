<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (harvesting distinct “flavors” of silence to counter a bunker‑raised claustrophobia) is clear and drives concrete choices (refusing the tethered bed, staying on the deck, actively vialing hush). Interiority is specific to her history, and the doll connection to her grandmother personalizes risk. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she rarely falters once the inversion begins, so struggle feels low‑friction. The closing intention to bring a vial to her father reads earned, though the cost is largely conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the inversion’s onset, the doll’s sprouting, and the expanding cathedral of quiet build toward a reweighted understanding of “safety.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a resonant final image and a concrete plan (bring the vial to the father). The hour‑long window and choice to remain untethered supply light pressure, but the price on the page is soft. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the scene is cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The trellis above the clouds, gravity inversion, and crystallizing silence are vividly rendered and POV‑filtered; sensory detail (“honey-copper sweetness,” “liquid starlight”) feels purposeful. The environment and rules meaningfully shape options and timing, charging the ending. Spatial choreography (deck, beds, observation glass) remains coherent. Strong object-as-setting interplay with the doll as a garden anchor deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvest new kinds of safety/quiet before the inversion ends—is clear and tightened by the clock and the decision to stay exposed. The key turn (the doll sprouting) escalates both wonder and opportunity, and Mira adapts by aggressive collection. Pressure remains more wondrous than perilous; costs are implied rather than felt. Resolution arises from her altered stance, not coincidence, but the squeeze could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres (safety as expansion vs compression), and the final image reweights earlier material via the vial-for-father intention. However, explicit thesis lines (“Safety wasn’t about limiting exposure…”) and the explanatory final paragraph edge into moralizing, dampening subtext. The strongest resonance comes from images (crystallized silence blooms) rather than statements. Complexity is present but somewhat tidied by direct articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (tasteable quiet; musical groans of the trellis). POV distance is stable and apt; elisions serve mood without obscuring action. Diction aligns with a curious, world‑attentive focalizer and modulates gracefully under pressure. No dialogue needed; internal cadence carries momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and propulsive; sentences do multiple jobs and avoid scaffold and loops. Figurative language is rich but not muddled; images remain internally consistent and sensory‑grounded. Variations in sentence length support breath and lift during inversion. A few high‑gloss phrases risk purple, but clarity and momentum hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harvesting silence as tangible flora during a gravity inversion, mediated by a porcelain doll that blooms, feels striking and specific. The synthesis of world rule, object, and theme is fresh and cohesive, with a memorable final cadence. Risk‑taking is evident without sacrificing legibility. Minor thematic overstatement is the only brake on an even higher score.</comment>
