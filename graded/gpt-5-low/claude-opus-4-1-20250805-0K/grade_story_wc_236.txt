<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific and embodied—she “reads time through touch and sound,” and her micro‑choices (cleaning the screw, fitting it deliberately loose) align with her history and values. The relationship with Mrs. Huang contains charged subtext and a credible status dynamic. A minor neatness in how Mara completes the unsaid (“Before she couldn’t save her own”) edges toward authorial foreknowledge but is motivated by her practiced translation. The final endurance—choosing honest, imperfect time—lands with felt cost and consistency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from discovery of the screw to the arrival and tactile lesson, culminating in the choice to reinstall the screw loose. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: time is restored but altered to acknowledge interruption, with cost accepted. Orientation is clean from the opening sentence; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint (loss of smell) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shop, fogged windows, and water clock mechanics are not decorative; they constrain perception, govern tactics (touch/sound), and charge the ending image of water resuming with memory. Specific, plausible details (mineral deposits, copper vs. brass notes) integrate with action and theme. Weather/fog affects access and emotional choice (Mrs. Huang arrives only in fog). The final image fuses environment and object—fog meeting glass—into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether the clock—and by extension grief—will be “restored” or integrated; Mara’s decision to reassemble imperfectly forecloses the path of sterile precision. The primary tightening is the on‑page arrival of Mrs. Huang and the tactile reframe, leading to a concrete choice with a conceptual price. Escalation is quiet but effective for the chosen lens. Stakes remain intimate and legible throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of translation, grief’s rerouting, and time as water accrue through particulars (channels, deposits, clamp screw) and culminate in an earned reweighting of “repair.” Subtext is active in the pauses and tactile instruction. A few lines approach thesis‑statement territory (“This was what reading between lines meant”), slightly reducing subtlety. The ending’s redefinition of repair avoids moralizing and resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature built from tactility and sound; diction supports the lyric mode without drifting into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse, plausible, and carries subtext. Psychic distance modulates smoothly under pressure. No head‑hopping or withheld knowledge beyond purposeful, character‑bound inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum; lines often do dual work (image + theme). Figurative language is rich but generally coherent and grounded in the story’s physical logic; minor density peaks do not blur clarity. No noticeable scaffold or paraphrase loops; information density remains high. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—water clock repair as grief translation via a midwife’s tool and an anosmic aromatherapist—is fresh and inextricable from character and action. Risks (quiet accumulative structure, tactile epistemology) heighten rather than obscure stakes. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the setup. The piece asserts an authentic, singular vision without gimmickry.</comment>
