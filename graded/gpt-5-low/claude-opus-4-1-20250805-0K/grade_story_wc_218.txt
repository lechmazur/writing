<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and rooted in concrete tactics (the copper rigging, decision to confront trustees). Interiority feels specific to her craft and condition, but contradictory impulses are muted; she moves swiftly from shock to stewardship without much friction. The cancer-cost is present and ethically active, though her acceptance verges on effortless. Still, her choices align with her worldview and culminate in a credible renunciation of the trustees’ plan.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the wiring work, rule-learning via the diary, and final linkage cohere toward an on-page reconfiguration: the orchard activates and the role re-prices as “die at the correct frequency.” Orientation is clean early; who/where/when is never in doubt. Closure carries conceptual cost (her life) and a clear next action (confront trustees), earned by prior beats. Minor ease—no counterpressure on the page—keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The temple orchard, fused stone pillars, and copper rig actively shape tactics and the final image (pillars glow, copper sings); not postcard scenery. Details are selectively technical and lived-in (angles, tension, spiral directions) filtered through Mira’s task-focused perception. World rules (electromagnetic translation) remain consistent and legible through action. The environment constrains and empowers her strategy at every step.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (resort vs. recognition) and deepen through the night’s work to the final connection. The meaningful tightening arrives with the activation and the diary’s reframed role, with life-cost implicit in her diagnosis. Pressure is coherent but largely unilateral—no on-page pushback, which slightly flattens escalation. Agency, however, clearly drives the turn and outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: translation, respect across kingdoms, and death-as-bridge, with a resonant reweighting at the end. A few lines state thesis outright (“The caretaker’s role…”, “remodel human perception”), bordering on declarative moral. Subtext still breathes through images (phosphorescing pillars, leaf-rustle without wind) and the charged refusal of the resort plan. The final palm-to-pillar moment sustains a reflective aftereffect without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV voice is controlled, lyrical without drifting into abstraction, and consistent with a meticulous caretaker. Expository passages stay anchored to task and sensation, maintaining credibility of knowledge. Rhythm modulates well from nocturnal labor to dawning resolve. Occasional thesis-like sentences slightly dilute the voice’s subtext, but not its coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and well-paced; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) without padding. Minor repetition and a couple of declarative thematic lines add faint scaffold but do not drag momentum. Figurative language (“salt spray on a windless day”) is sharp and mostly disciplined. The final image lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—copper as translator, living stone as council memory, caretakers dying at a necessary frequency—is fresh and well-integrated. The redefinition of “remodeling” to perception is a smart, earned pivot. Risks are taken in concept and tone without obscuring clarity. Only the absence of on-page counterforce keeps it from an even higher band.</comment>
