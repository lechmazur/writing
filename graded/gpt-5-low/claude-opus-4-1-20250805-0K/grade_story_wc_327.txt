<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—preserve Thuvenli before dawn—embodied through tactile perception and tool‑use. Interiority is textured rather than labeled, but internal contradiction is light; she meets pressure with near‑flawless competence. The eventual cost (becoming a bone tower) lands more as epilogue than a dramatized choice. Still, micro‑choices with the diamond and bone towers reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and patterning build to the dawn cadence shift and CR—curse becomes translator, language’s death reweighted into a new tongue. Orientation is clean and the because/therefore chain within the lyric mode is coherent (diamond → birds’ gap → alignment → carving → dawn). Cost appears on‑page via her transformation (years‑later shard), linked to the tunnel of echoes. The closure feels earned and specific, though the decisive personal price is displaced from the peak beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and causally active: bone towers as resonant instruments she hums through and carves; canyon wind and echoes shape tactics and final image. The flawed diamond and copper veins function as micro‑setting tools that constrain choices and charge the ending. World rules are learned through use (curse activation, tuning via birds), not exposition. Final transformation of body and diamond decisively charges the place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve a dying language before dawn) is clear, with a credible clock that tightens options. Escalation deepens through the curse’s activation and the pattern recognition turn with the starlings, leading to all‑night labor. The price is the acceptance of hybridization and ultimate incorporation into the canyon’s system. Tension is more poised than perilous, but pressure coheres and rises under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of loss transformed through translation and embodied memory accrues organically via objects and acts. The ending reweights the premise: preservation demands metamorphosis and cost; curses can be tuned into instruments. Recurring images (starlings’ negative space, diamond’s crack, copper veins) shift meaning without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the paradox of feeling words rather than hearing them.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—texture as semantics—remains consistent and controlled. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (quiet watching → harmonic labor → elegiac epilogue) without head‑hopping. No dialogue; voice carries subtext in image logic rather than declaration. Confidence and certainty stay within what the focalizer can infer or feel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, and high information density with minimal scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and systematized (texture/sound/metal/bone) rather than mixed; cadence varies to sustain momentum. One or two lush lines flirt with purple, but clarity remains intact and the final image lands cleanly. No loops or template cadences dull the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Conceptual blend—texture language, cursed diamond as loss‑tuner, starlings as score—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (non‑aural language, object‑as‑translator) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns grow from taught patterns (the crack as negative space key; curse repurposed), not late rule changes. Freshness is earned through specific synthesis rather than ornament.</comment>
