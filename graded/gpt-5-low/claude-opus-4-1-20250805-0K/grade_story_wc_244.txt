<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sadie’s motive set—engineering reciprocity through rumor and trade—reads specific and coherent, with the “mask slipping” moment adding human contradiction. Marcus is thinner but legible: lonely, yearning to matter, and his micro‑choice to surrender the heirloom carries cost. Status play (thermos as offering; Sadie’s mock‑sincere bow) is crisp. The emotional interior leans declarative at times, but actions align cleanly with motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence at the end: the phone‑for‑moon‑rock exchange crystallizes into a charged poise as Marcus holds the phone and the station “waits.” Cost is visible: Marcus parts with an illegal family relic; Sadie parts with anonymity via binding Marcus into her network. Orientation is clean from the first line, and the rumor chain causality holds without seams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ivy‑drowned platform is vivid and POV‑filtered (“green cathedral”), and it returns to charge the last image (“ivy whispered”). The place frames secrecy and a liminal threshold between systems (station/forest; government/anarchy). It doesn’t materially constrain tactics, so its excellence is atmospheric rather than coercive. Object details (thermos, vial, sat phone) integrate smoothly into the space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether Marcus trades the moon rock for a monthly obligation; the offer tightens options. The cost is clear but the beat is low‑friction—he doesn’t truly waver or face a counterforce beyond his loneliness. Still, the deepening from rumor‑lure to binding purpose is a meaningful narrowing. Consequences (Bangladesh call) are credibly teed up.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Reciprocity vs. charity and “purpose as the cure for loneliness” resonate through concrete action (the trade, the phone). However, several lines state the thesis outright, especially near the end (“The cure for loneliness isn’t company...”), which blunts subtext. The ivy/station motif helps thematic carry without sermonizing. The final “polite anarchy” tag is on‑the‑nose but fitting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Confident, witty voice with clean focalization; Sadie and Marcus speak in distinct idioms (her barbed banter vs. his earnestness). Expository asides (“seventeen floods… one meltdown”) are compact and voice‑motivated. Dialogue functions as action and reveals status and aims. Minor aphoristic drift in narration doesn’t break POV confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lean, rhythmic prose with purposeful images; most sentences carry multiple jobs. Aphorisms risk didactic sheen but are balanced by tactile specifics and fresh turns (“metallic otherness,” “green cathedral”). No major loops or template cadences; momentum holds. Final image cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a clandestine barter of moon rock for a one‑number sat phone to weaponize loneliness into purpose via rumor networks. The overgrown station and “polite anarchy” frame an original moral economy. Turns feel earned by prior particulars rather than gimmickry. A few thesis lines are familiar, but the delivery is distinctive.</comment>
