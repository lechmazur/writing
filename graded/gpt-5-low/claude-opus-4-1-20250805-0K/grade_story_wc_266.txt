<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marina’s motive (control vs. release) is clear and embodied through the leash/dog pursuit and her confession. Micro-choices—stepping into the boat, admitting fear, accepting the star‑punched ticket—earn the shift. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy‑speak. The guides function as calm pressure rather than gurus, keeping her change credible with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the crossing sequence tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration: she relinquishes grip and returns changed, with “proof of passage.” Orientation lands early and the ritual logic holds (twilight‑only crossing, ticket punch, solitary return). Cost is legible in the foreclosed path of holding on and the requirement to make the return alone. The cadence shift at the shore crystallizes the before/after without mechanical exposition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The limestone ridgeway, mist, and hidden water are vivid and purposeful; twilight and the ferry’s ritual constrain options. The star‑punched ticket and oars recur to charge the final image and tactic (twilight passage, solitary return). Sensory texture is diverse (stone, water, birds, phosphorescence) and POV‑filtered. World rules are learned through action rather than explained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the choice to stop gripping and accept the crossing’s terms; the punch of the ticket marks the meaningful turn. Stakes remain internal but are dramatized (boat movement, twilight constraint, “return you make alone”). The price—relinquishing control in exchange for passage—is felt, if gentle. Escalation is subtle but sufficient for the length and lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Letting go vs. vigilance accrues through recurring images (leash, ticket, twilight vigil) and culminates in a reweighted final image. One line (“Unused courage waits…”) edges toward thesis, but most resonance arises from scene and object work. The ending reframes “dog” as unleashed joy without sentimentality. Ambiguity lingers in a satisfying, non‑didactic way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is steady, with a distinct shoreline cadence that tightens at key beats. Dialogue feels ritual and subtextual, matching the guides’ archetypal function without expository drag. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head‑hopping. Rhythmic modulation supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line work is graceful and efficient, with images doing double duty. A few metaphor clusters (“beard like kelp,” “evening birds called out coordinates to dreams”) risk saturation, but clarity holds. No scaffold or loops; syntax varies with momentum. The final lines are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Psychopomp ferrying is familiar, but the leash/dog and “unused courage” inflection feels fresh and coherent. The star‑punch object reimagined as apertures in the heart is a memorable turn. Risks are taken in tone and ritual framing without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
