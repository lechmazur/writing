<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—seventeen years training to defeat pattern‑tracking and to neutralize the memory plague—and actions align under pressure (erratic traversal, shattering the vessel, inhaling). Interiority is embodied through sensory invasion (“the texture of extinct fruit,” “weight of watching stars die”). The final renunciation (self‑sacrifice as living filter) is earned and carries visible cost. Slight shortfall in contradictory impulses; she feels anguish and awe but rarely vacillates in purpose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: pattern‑avoidance grants access; tiers escalate knowledge and cost; guardians close in; choice to absorb the plague effects closure. Orientation is immediate (who/where/what) and the scene holds one coherent window. Closure lands on the page with cost—“carrying ten thousand years of memory in her cells, forever changed.” The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds, culminating in a reweighted final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: crystalline walls, bronze prism pagoda, liquid‑amber tubes, and twilight refractive geometry all shape tactics and tone. Environment constrains choice (only absence of pattern unlocks the tier) and charges the ending (pagoda resonating with her transformation). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, layered through action. World rules are learned via use rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent the weaponized nostalgia from enslaving populations—tightens as tiers reveal moral rot and the guardians approach. The decisive escalation is Mira breaking the vessel and choosing self‑contamination; the price is explicit and persists. Internal and external pressures interweave without redundancy. A single, strong tightening beat suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, redemption through chaos, and the end of innocence emerge via particulars (atoms of nostalgia, trained unpattern). The final image offers a resonant non‑literal answer: possession transformed into stewardship at personal cost. Minor explicitness (“not as a treasure but as a warning”) edges toward telling, slightly softening subtext. Still, the closure reweights earlier motifs convincingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third maintains consistent distance and vocabulary, modulating rhythm as pressure rises. Perceptual signature is distinct (geometric light, sensory assimilation of others’ lives). No head‑hopping or stance leaks; purposeful compression reads clean. The voice avoids over‑explanation, trusting image and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; rhythm breathes between lush description and sharp action. Figurative language is largely coherent and scene‑serving; limited purple flourishes do not obscure clarity. Openings and structures vary, sustaining momentum. The final lines crystallize without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Atoms of nostalgia,” absence‑of‑pattern as both lockpick and purifier, and a living filter ritual produce a fresh synthesis. The pagoda’s refractive geometry recurs and recharges meaning at the end. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without muddling causality. The transformation reads inevitable in hindsight given the trained “unpattern.”</comment>
