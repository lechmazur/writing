<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—preserve meaning before collapse—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices (pressing the charm, holding position as the workshop tilts). She balances fear and determination credibly under a live clock. Internal contradiction is present but light (stubborn/broken vs. dutiful craft), yielding more purpose than friction. The final renunciation (life for the story) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene, tight clock, and clear causal sequence: match indentations → access memories → narrate to repair → extract crystal → fall. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis with undeniable cost (death) and a conceptual repricing (brokenness as beauty secured). Orientation is clean early; no lens slippage despite lyric density. The pressure set by the dissolving moorings persists and shapes every step.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gears-and-acid-sea environment is vivid and functionally constraining—snapping cables, tilting floor, corrosive risk. Objects (statue, charm, gears) are used, not toured, and directly charge the final image. Sensory texture (acid tang, hiss, groan) is purposeful and POV-filtered through craft knowledge. The setting’s rules stay consistent and drive consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve meaning before the workshop falls) is signaled early and tightens via successive mooring failures. Agency is sustained through narration-as-method and the decisive extraction of the crystal. The visible price—she plunges—charges the ending. No wasted beats; internal and external pressures interlock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres: kintsugi as an ethic of meaning-making from fracture, culminating in a reweighted final image. The statue’s explicit thesis statement slightly over-articulates what the imagery already earns. Still, the closing acceptance—that beauty arises through damage—feels organically derived from action. The resonance lingers without needing further explication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close sticks to Mira’s sensorium and lexicon; compression under stress reads controlled. Patterned diction (gold seams, acid, gears) is consistent and paid off. The statue’s multivoiced line registers as a world-consistent exception, not POV leakage. Rhythm modulates well with the ticking clock.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is muscular and economical despite lyric flourish; images carry multiple jobs. A few familiar notes (“lungs scream for air”) appear but do not cloud clarity or momentum. Figurative density remains coherent to motif (gold, fracture, machinery) without muddle. No noticeable loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemy of narration, kintsugi-as-cosmology, acid-sea workshop—feels distinct and inevitable in hindsight. Risky choice to have narration be the operative craft pays off. Familiar end-world textures are transformed by specific craft logic. The final transmutation of despair into artifact avoids gimmickry.</comment>
