<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s longing-driven agency is specific and embodied (the vial, the climb, the whispered absolution), and her months of refining “intentions” pay off in a decisive act. The internal contradiction—yearning to have him back while releasing the need to be protected—arrives credibly at “You don’t have to protect me anymore.” Emotional texture is concrete (scent, touch, light) rather than abstract labels. Minor softness: her flaw set is narrow, with little friction beyond grief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal escalation: purify intention → release jasmine → climb → confront guilt → beckon → embodiment. Closure lands on the page with a felt price: three years of vigil and the acceptance of a “not fully human” return (RR/DC hybrid). Orientation is anchored immediately (who/where/when), and the single-scene arc holds cleanly. Slight neatness in the absolution moment (“The accident wasn’t your fault”) keeps it just shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse is sensorially vivid and functionally active: the beam literally “catches” Thomas and charges the final image of “two shadows.” The jasmine scent operates as micro‑setting and tool, integrated into action. Spatial and atmospheric cues (dawn, cobalt, salt-crisp air) are coherently threaded. Superb economy; only held under 9 due to the global gate and a touch of lyric showiness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is tight (guide Thomas home), and pressure coheres through one strong deepening: Mara’s renunciation of being protected unlocks change. The cost is legible in accepting a partial, liminal Thomas. Escalation is primarily internal but paced by physical ascent and intensifying scent. A second complication or micro‑loss might have further tightened the vise.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (love/forgiveness reconfigures reality) emerges through objects and acts, culminating in the cork falling and the beam’s two shadows. Subtext hums in the bodily and sensory exchanges more than in exposition. Slight on‑the‑nose lines (“The accident wasn’t your fault”) nudge toward moral clarity, trimming lingering ambiguity. Still, the final image resonates beyond a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent, confident close third with a distinct lyrical grain; diction and rhythm modulate well as pressure rises. Dialogue is minimal yet purposeful and subtext-laden (“You don’t have to protect me anymore”). No head‑hopping or register drift; metaphysical elements remain grounded in Mara’s perception. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but stay voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful sensory layering, and images that do multiple jobs (cork, beam, jasmine). Momentum holds; no scaffolding or loops. A couple of intensified metaphors (“screaming tenderness,” “memory into molecules”) edge toward ornate, but clarity and propulsion survive. Variations in sentence rhythm support the ascent and climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis of ghost‑return tropes via “vibrations of intent” and scent‑borne beckoning, anchored in a cobalt lighthouse with tactile ritual. The cork and beam reweight familiar imagery in non‑obvious ways. Emotional truth feels specific, not templated. Minor conventionality in the absolution beat keeps it just below the very top tier.</comment>
