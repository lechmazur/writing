<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sarai’s motive—aberrant mercy complicated by guilt—drives concrete micro‑choices (placing tesserae despite painful visions). Her contradiction (compelled by the past yet choosing to repurpose it) is embodied in “strange, cold warmth.” Dialogue with the old man sharpens her stance without flattening her. A few lines edge toward thesis (“mercy isn’t about purity”), but the interior turn earns her final resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, each tessera action intensifies pattern and meaning until the mosaic renames her, reconfiguring the premise from curse to invitation (CR). Cost is legible: persistent painful visions, public risk from the Brotherhood, and a commitment to build under hostile doctrine. Orientation is clean from the opening and the final image tightens options toward action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plaza, frost, shattered sky, and spiral stepping stones are vivid and purpose‑driven; the tessera/minaret system acts as setting‑tool that constrains action and triggers visions. The environment directly charges the final image and the renaming scene. Details (ninety‑nine names, chipped patterns) are specific and filtered through Sarai’s priorities. World rules feel consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether Sarai will remain trapped in retrocognition or reclaim it; it deepens when the mosaic burns her and accepts her new name. The Brotherhood’s threat is credible but offstage; still, internal and situational stakes interlock and narrow her options toward risky public creation. The price—pain, visibility, and departure from restoration—is clear if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of mercy versus purity and transformation from ruins emerge through objects and acts, culminating in “not restoring anything” as a reweighted ethos. Subtext works via the ninety‑nine names becoming personal, and the future‑vision garden revalues loss. A couple of explicit thesis statements slightly over‑articulate what the images already carry, trimming some subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person limited remains steady with a tactile, lyrical signature; cadence modulates well at peaks (“hot iron” beat). Dialogue is lean, character‑specific, and adds pressure and recognition without exposition dumping. Diction is coherent to the world and POV, with no head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is concentrated, image‑rich, and largely free of loops or scaffolding; sentences multitask to carry world, action, and emotion. Metaphors stay consistent and grounded in the established palette (stone, fire, cold/warmth). A few thesis‑like lines momentarily trade image for statement but do not stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tessera‑triggered retrocognition and the mosaic adding “Sarai, the Gentle Radical” feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The ninety‑nine names device and shattered‑sky garden possibility synthesize genre and literary modes without gimmickry. Risk‑taking is evident in the quiet, conceptual closure that still lands with cost.</comment>
