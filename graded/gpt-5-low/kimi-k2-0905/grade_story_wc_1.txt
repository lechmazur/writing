<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—the kiln “exhale,” the ledger burning her lips—and her contradictory impulses (pursuit vs. refusal) play on the page. Micro‑choices (dropping glass beads, waiting at the ash circle, crushing the ledger) reveal a hierarchy of values. The renunciation forecloses a path with felt cost. A hairline neatness in the final calibration slightly softens messier human fray.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: images and actions compound until the renunciation (crushing the ledger, turning back) reweights the premise. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the closure lands with cost—the map destroyed, the pursuit abandoned. One clean tightening at the ash circle and dawn wait precedes the decisive shift. The bus and new studio pay off the lens without mechanical wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon, frost, and star‑blade sky aren’t postcard; they constrain tactics (tracking cart marks, narrowing walls) and charge the final image (sun igniting glass fragments). Professional gaze filters detail (glazing, enamel dawn), integrating setting with action. Environmental elements recur as tools and pressure rather than backdrop. World rules stay consistent and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continue the pursuit or find meaning in the pause—is signaled early and tightens at the ash ring. The decision to wait, then renounce, is a credible, costly narrowing of options. External and internal threads interweave (smugglers’ camp vs. her conscience). Slightly soft external jeopardy keeps pressure more inward than mixed, but it remains coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of pause, purpose, and non‑erasure arise through recurrent objects (ledger, frost, beads, obsidian) and culminate in a non‑literal answer: step off the path, host quiet dawn hours. The final image reweights earlier material without moralizing. A few explicit statements (“discover purpose in the pauses”) brush the edge of telling but are largely earned by scene work. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person close is controlled and character‑specific; diction (kiln, glaze, pontil) is apt and consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and patterned elisions are taught and paid off. No head‑hopping; certainty tracks what she can infer. The voice sustains intensity without tipping into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished—many sentences do double duty with concrete image and thematic charge. A few dense metaphor stacks (“drifting resonance,” “scorched testament”) recur and flirt with overwriting, but clarity holds and propulsion remains. Syntax varies, and paragraphing breathes with scene needs. No loops or scaffold that dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glasswork craft meets smuggling, with beads as breadcrumbs and a ledger turned braille and then ritual. The renunciation reframes pursuit tropes without gimmickry, and the final studio premise is an original conceptual turn. Risks in imagery and structure heighten stakes while staying legible. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
