<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirage’s flaw—commodifying intimacy—drives every choice, from uncorking the bottle to the forbidden act of writing the confession. Contradictory impulses (performing vs. truly apologizing) are dramatized rather than told, and her renunciation of writing about this encounter lands with cost. The status dynamic with Julian shifts credibly as she yields control. A hairline ding: the self-advice-in-metaphor tick skirts mannerism without altering tactics much.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clean: perfume → currents → confession-as-sound → renunciation → dissolution. Closure (Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis) is on the page: she will not exploit this, he departs, and the archive’s hum is altered. Stakes and costs are enacted, not explained; the orchard clock and “imperfect miracle” rule constrain the attempt and ending. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and never lost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive and orchard are not décor; they shape tactics (forbidden pen, staff paper that hums) and charge the final image (hum permanently detuned, chainsaws starting). Sensory specificity is vivid across modalities—ozone/bergamot, copper taste, fluorescent Morse. Recurring objects (perfume bottle, scores, lights) evolve functionally and thematically. The environment constrains and reweights the last beat, satisfying the 9‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—delivering a real apology without re‑exploitation—is tightened by the imperfect miracle’s costs and the ticking orchard. Escalation is agency‑driven: uncorking the bottle, risking the forbidden pen, and placing the bottle as offering narrow options. The confession’s playback/erasure creates price and consequence, culminating in her choice not to publish. Pressure coheres to the final renunciation with no soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of exploitation, ownership of pain, and the limits of atonement emerge through material choices (sound as apology, fading notes) rather than sermon. “Pain is public domain” edges toward explicitness, but the surrounding images keep it earned. The “imperfect miracle” reframes forgiveness as partial, costly circuitry—conceptual repricing that lingers. The last images reweight earlier motifs without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled voice marries tabloid lexicon to liturgical lyric, staying consistent in distance and idiom. Dialogue carries subtext and power shifts, avoiding expositional crutching. Rhythm modulates with pressure; metaphoric elisions are taught early and paid off. No POV leakage or register drift despite the density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, with high information density and purposeful metaphors that generally cohere to music/electricity/storm motifs. Variations in sentence rhythm keep momentum; images earn their keep (the treble clef smudging; the hum dropping half a step). A touch of lushness risks over‑saturation, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts detectable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—gossip‑column exorcist, sheet‑music archive, apology as sound artifact, orchard clock—feels freshly inevitable. The perfume‑induced current and “imperfect miracle” rule integrate concept and cost with originality. Turns arise from character flaws rather than gimmick. Bold choices heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
