<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s yearning for meaning after anosmia is concrete and drives tactile, specific choices (loupe work, reorienting the clamp, telling Horace “It breathes now,” pocketing the screw). Interiority is character‑particular, avoiding labels and showing embodied conflict between loss and craft. The change is earned: she reframes purpose without regaining smell, with a felt cost. Minor ding: the late keepsake move risks undercutting her earlier choice to nest the clamp back in the base.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and motifs intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration where absence becomes method and the clock “breathes.” Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (accepting loss while claiming meaning). However, a prop‑state inconsistency—reassembling the clamp inside the base, then later pocketing the screw—introduces a causality seam. Orientation is otherwise clean and the scene’s one‑window structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The water clock shop and fog are tactile and functional; the clock’s gurgle and drop shape beats and charge the final image. Tools and objects (loupe, clamp screw, float) are used, not toured, and the body’s attention filters setting plausibly through anosmia. Environment subtly constrains perception via occlusion and sound, aligning with theme. Slight penalty for the clamp/screw handling ambiguity limiting full 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (recover meaning vs. live hollow), and pressure coheres through a deepening focus on the screw and the clock’s breath. The meaningful turn arrives when absence becomes aroma, reweighting the object and compelling the reassembly choice. Cost is acceptance of loss rather than cure, with a quiet but definite foreclosure. Escalation is subtle but present; the prop inconsistency blurs the late tactical choice a touch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of loss-as-instrument and ordinary miracles arise from particulars (fog, float, clamp, newborn gasp) rather than thesis statements. The final images reprice the world’s texture without scent, avoiding sentimentality. One slightly on‑the‑nose sentence (“her motivation accomplished…”) trims the edge of purity. Overall, subtext hums through gesture and object rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature holds steady; diction and rhythm fit a tactile, sensory‑deprived artisan. POV is clean and modest; inference reads as inference until paid off by the tactile epiphany. Dialogue is minimal but apt and charged in its brevity. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered jobs with strong verb/noun choices and varied rhythm; images are fresh and legible. Minimal redundancy and no mixed metaphors despite density. Minor scaffolding (“motivation accomplished…”) and the prop‑state seam slightly dull peak precision. Otherwise, propulsion and clarity remain high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—anosmic aromatherapist reading a water clock via a midwife’s screw under morning fog—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mode, object as moral pivot, sound replacing scent) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The newborn‑gasp drop is a memorable, earned flourish. Small continuity slip prevents a higher band.</comment>
