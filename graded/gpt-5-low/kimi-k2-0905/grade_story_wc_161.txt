<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motives are concrete and embodied (meteorite chip in cheek; balancing under the skylight) and her flaw—compulsion to both erase and preserve—drives choices. Micro‑choices (hiding the chip, accepting Blackwood’s sanctuary, launching pigeons) align with a credible inner conflict. Relationship pressure with Blackwood is understated but effective, tilting her from secrecy toward collaboration. Minor deduction: internal contradiction is more thematic than dramatized in a single pressured beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: from entry/hiding to alliance, dissemination of melodies, raid, and charged absence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she’s gone; the etched lullaby and children’s rope‑song reprice identity at real cost. Orientation is clean early; pattern taught and paid off. Slightly soft causal pin at the escape (off‑stage), but the cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The attic and skylight aren’t postcard décor—they shape tactics (balancing practice), concealment (floorboard cache), and the final image (dust‑chord). Sensory economy is expert, with details filtered through Mirela’s musical/archival bias. The environment’s constraints and tools (atlases, copper plate, loft) matter. The closing light‑angle reprise charges theme and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—evade capture while re‑authoring memory—tightens through alliance, public dissemination, and the raid. The meaningful deepening is the decision to risk exposure by sending music into the city; cost is the necessary disappearance. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and culminates without requiring a set‑piece reversal. External conflict remains largely off‑stage, but internal/external braid well.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Identity as migratory music and paper trails reweighted into air: the final children’s humming and dust‑chord earn a non‑literal answer. Recurring images (skylight, birds, sheet music) accrue meaning without moralizing. The mother’s erased lullaby returns with cost and grace. Complexity lingers: preservation requires erasure of the self.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical close third sustains a coherent perceptual signature; syntax and diction modulate with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful (Blackwood’s tacit recognition). Minor line noise (“learning to trust again” repeated) slightly scuffs polish. Otherwise, distance is controlled and voice credible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with vivid figurative control; most metaphors cohere to music/paper/air. One noticeable redundancy (“learning to trust again across learning to trust again”) and rich modifiers flirt with excess but do not blur meaning. Rhythm varies, and nearly every line does double duty. Copy‑clean overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Courier pigeons as carriers of micro‑melodies, a meteorite as seed‑memory, and a vintage attic as an instrument—fresh synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric structure and motif knitting heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns grow from character and pattern, not gimmickry. The vision feels singular and fully committed.</comment>
