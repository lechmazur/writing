<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calyx’s motives (to reweave what’s broken) are clear and embodied in choices: surrendering to the dream, sewing the plate into the loom, and paying blood as price. Interiority is vivid and particular without therapy‑speak, though conflict mostly manifests as ritual surrender rather than contested will. The contradiction—surrender vs. agency—adds texture but remains gentle. The final renunciation (letting the loom and precedents sink) reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual acts compound until the sea returns. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when), and the closure lands on the page with cost (blood, dissolution of the plate, loom submerging). The before/after is legible and irreversible. Minor softness in causal resistance keeps it just shy of the 9s.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon labyrinth is exquisitely integrated: petroglyph forks, crumbling switchbacks, and the driftwood loom constrain path and tactics. Setting details evolve causally (walls shift, passages open) and directly charge the ending image of water reclaiming stone. Sensory specificity beyond the visual—“orchid solace,” salt, hush—enriches atmosphere. The environment decisively shapes choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (restore what was unmade), and pressure coheres via a deepening cadence: loom discovery → memory‑release stitches → blood sacrifice → bridge and tide return. The cost is present but inward and ceremonial rather than contested; escalation reads as density increase more than obstruction. The decisive act (pricking his palm, final line) narrows options and pays off. Tension is felt even without an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of repair, precedent, and reverence emerge through action (weaving, blood, dissolution) rather than thesis. Recurring orchids reprice meaning from funerary sweetness to regenerative power at closure. One sentence edges toward moralizing proof (“proof that broken precedents…”), slightly on‑the‑nose, but the imagery carries the weight. The ending lingers with earned ambiguity and grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third‑person with a confident perceptual signature; diction and cadence are consistent and character‑specific. Patterned elision is taught and paid off; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from hush to crescendo. A few lush runs flirt with purple but remain coherent and voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is strong: varied openings, high information density, and images that do more than one job. The figurative web is coherent (looms, tides, orchids) with minimal redundancy. Slight saturation of metaphor risks over‑richness but rarely muddies sense. The final images are crisp and unencumbered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—wharf weaver, illustration plate, labyrinth as tailor, orchids as solvent and seed—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (ritual lyricism, non‑literal mechanics) heighten resonance without losing clarity. Turns arise from established pattern rather than late rule drops. The vision reads authentically its own.</comment>
