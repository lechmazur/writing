<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent: protect her haven and guests while honoring innovation. Her choices (planting, then actively guiding the growth) align with that drive and reveal competence under pressure. Internal conflict—control vs. surrender—is present but lightly dramatized, with limited on‑page cost. More embodied contradiction at the planting beat could deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causality is clean: envelope → planting deadline → architectural upheaval → tactical guidance → guests’ riddle → repriced ending. The closure reads as a conceptual repricing: she accepts the labyrinth as co‑author, with tomorrow’s empty envelope sealing the new rule. The cost is mostly conceptual (ceding control), not strongly dramatized as a sacrifice. Orientation is firm from the outset and the drive lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mill, glass‑floored chamber, storm, and brook are vivid and functional; the reversed brook powers the riddle and shapes tactics. Environmental logic evolves coherently (roots re‑geometrize, doors spiral) and charges the final image. Detail selection matches urgency and POV bias. Setting constraints actively guide choices rather than decorate them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (keep the haven safe and escapable) is signaled early with a live clock (“second thunderclap”). Escalation tracks through the seed’s takeover and Mira’s decision to direct growth instead of resisting it. The danger feels largely managed once she syncs with the levers, softening felt cost at the peak. Still, the tactical redirection of vines into clues is a credible tightening under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coherently marries innovation with surrender: a creator becomes steward of a living system. Recurring images (seed, brook’s flow, storm‑born hush) shift meaning by the end, reweighting “safeguard” from control to co‑evolution. A slight whiff of articulation in the final sentence edges toward meta, but remains earned by scene work. The pollinator exit image extends resonance beyond the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is steady, textured, and properly biased by Mira’s sensibility. Diction (“orthogonal,” “notably receptive”) risks programmatic repetition yet stays coherent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with pressure—brisk during lever‑work, expansive at closure. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry multi‑tasked images with good momentum; metaphors (gears like teeth, walls like gills) are apt and legible. Occasional intensifiers and motif reiterations brush purple but do not blur causality. Syntax and sentence openings vary, avoiding loops and scaffold. The final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blend of escape‑room craft, corpse‑flower biology, time‑skewed note, and architectural re‑geometry feels fresh and internally consistent. Key turns arise from established premises rather than late rule drops. The pollination of future puzzles via guests is a sharp, non‑obvious extension. Risk‑taking is high without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
