<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (protecting her haven and guests) are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices under pressure—planting, then surrendering control to guide growth—reveal a credible hierarchy of values. There’s a palpable internal tension between control and co-creation, embodied in tactile beats (the pulp on her skin; the lever work). The final acceptance—letting the labyrinth rewrite itself—reads as an earned change. The only shortfall is a relatively soft on-page cost; danger is signaled but not materially felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the causal chain holds: seed arrival → planting under a ticking clock → reconfiguration → puzzle run → repricing of the haven’s role. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a cyclical image (“tomorrow’s envelope… empty”) that reweights the premise. The “never let anyone leave” threat heightens stakes but never materially constricts options, so escalation feels controlled rather than tight. Still, the single-scene arc coheres and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mill, glass-floored chamber, and brook are vivid, purpose-driven, and filtered through Mira’s practical attention. Setting constrains choices (the only soil under glass) and actively informs tactics (the brook powering a backward waterwheel to cue “Midnight”). World rules evolve legibly (reversed flow, spiraled doorways) and charge the final image. Atmosphere and specificity work in service of plot, not as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are signaled early (guests trapped vs. sanctuary preserved), and the meaningful deepening is Mira’s decision to guide, not resist, the plant’s takeover. The storm clock and building’s shifting geometry provide a credible pressure line. However, solutions unfold with limited friction—no beat forces a hard trade-off or visible loss beyond surrendering control. Tension is steady and elegant, but rarely bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—innovation as a living, co-authored system requiring surrender—is dramatized through concrete acts (planting, guiding “orthogonal” growth) and images (lantern seeds casting futures). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing, reframing the haven as an organism that writes its own riddles. Recurring motifs (flow, hush, storm-born silence) transform meaningfully by the close. It’s resonant and confident, with complexity over instruction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, sensuous, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical textures, vegetal pulse, water logic). Diction modulates cleanly with pressure and never slips register. Lyric density is purposeful and taught early. A slight tendency toward lushness remains disciplined enough to maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The line-level work is tight, image-rich, and multi-tasking; sentences advance action, mood, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is coherent (flow/geometry/organism) and doesn’t tangle itself at peak beats. Minimal scaffolding, good rhythmic variety, and precise verbs give propulsion. A few leitmotifs repeat, but as design, not loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Combining escape-room mechanics with a corpse-flower, time-tinged seed mail, and architectural “orthogonal” botany feels strikingly fresh. Turns are earned from established particulars (glass-soil constraint; reversed brook as clue). The cyclical, self-authoring haven is a non-obvious, coherent synthesis. The piece takes formal risks while keeping narrative legible.</comment>
