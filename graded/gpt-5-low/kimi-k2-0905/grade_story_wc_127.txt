<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (to feel something real) is clear, contradictory to her professional detachment, and dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (taking the petal, not stopping the chemist). Embodiment is specific and character‑particular (“pulse lied often and well,” the bruise‑bloom scent). The relationship with the chemist applies focused pressure without stealing POV. A couple of thesis‑leaning lines flirt with on‑the‑nose (“insight without empathy was just surveillance”) but the change lands credibly with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the scent layers intensify until a resonant reconfiguration occurs. Closure is on‑page and costly—she relinquishes her armor and accepts pain as proof of reachability; the “vial cracked” and dusk sealing the grotto give tangible price. Spatial and temporal anchors are clean from the outset; no orientation debt. Setups (petal, static, resin) pay off in the final image with coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The amber grotto is sensorially vivid and integrated (resin, fossilized sap, amber dust, static air). It actively charges choices and the ending image: dusk, cooling amber, and the earth’s hum frame her acceptance and foreclose retreat. The blend of scent craft and environment feels particular to this world rather than postcard‑generic. Detail selection is purposeful and POV‑biased.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake: whether she will surrender detachment for empathy. Escalation is a density increase consistent with the lens—the petal’s unfolding strata push her past observation into embodied consequence. Agency appears in both the initial acceptance (pressing the petal) and the final endurance (letting it hurt, not stopping him), with a visible cost. Stakes remain intimate but sharp; no false reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: commodified feelings, half‑truths, and the insufficiency of insight without empathy. The ending reweights earlier material without sermonizing; “They had fused her” offers a resonant answer. A couple of explicit lines nudge toward statement but are buffered by strong images (bruise‑bloom, cracked vial). Subtext in the chemist’s “You’ll feel what they felt. But not why.” deepens the ethical frame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is controlled, with a distinctive sensory lexicon and rhythm that tightens under pressure. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and functional; characters’ speech has clean idiom and does work. Diction stays consistent with the POV’s sensibility (perfume craft, electricity, resin). Psychic distance modulates with purpose as the transformation advances.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, varied syntax, and images that mostly carry clear physical logic. Refrains (static, resin, amber) recur as charged motifs rather than decorative churn. Minor thesis‑leaning statements don’t stall momentum, and there’s no paraphrase looping. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—counterfeit emotions, a fragrance chemist, static‑mediated empathy, and an amber grotto—feels fresh and inevitable in retrospect. Turns arise from established elements rather than late rule shifts. The quiet risk (a purely interior, accumulative climax) pays off with clarity and cost. Emotional specificity avoids template arcs.</comment>
