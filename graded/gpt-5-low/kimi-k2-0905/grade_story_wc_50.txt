<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motivation (restore stolen hours; “store wonder in the cellar of reason”) drives concrete choices. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft and sensory bias (peripheral focus, calipers of shadow). Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt—curiosity vs. restraint—yet it culminates credibly in the renunciatory lock. Minor softness: pressure rarely forces visibly painful trade‑offs until the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative pressure leading to a clean on‑page turn: feeding silence backward restores time. Closure lands with cost—he seals the device, keeps the key singular—and the world reconfigures (villages’ clocks resume). Orientation is crisp from the outset; causal steps (study → pattern match → reverse assembly → release) are legible. The persistent constraint of the sealed, non‑reflective plate charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not décor; its reflective delays and echo‑conductive stone dictate tactics and enable the solution. Specifics (veins of quartz, heartbeat‑delay mirrors, percussion craters) are POV‑filtered through a locksmith’s craft attention. The object‑as‑setting (timer) and environment mutually charge the ending (echoes nesting in stone, silver plate reflecting nothing). Atmosphere is dense yet purposeful, never museum‑tour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering time) tightens through investigative beats to a decisive reversal (silence fed into the mechanism). Escalation is primarily textural, but the knowledge deepening narrows options and culminates in a meaningful renunciation (locking wonder away). The cost is felt though quiet, aligning with the mode. Slightly low threat level mid‑piece keeps it from a higher tension band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around the ethics of wonder vs. control, memory’s thinning returns, and the labor of making time obedient. Recurring images (reflections, echoes paying a toll, the blank silver plate) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The spoken line about “storing wonder” risks on‑nose but is earned and then dramatized by the locked cellar choice. The final orchard‑echo image expands the inquiry beyond plot into elegiac aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice with a locksmith’s perceptual signature (tools, angles, torque, scalloping) remains stable and apt. Modulation under pressure is controlled; no head‑hopping or register drift. Patterned diction (peripheral focus, hush like pages) is taught early and pays off. The single direct quote integrates cleanly without breaking the cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density and varied syntax maintain momentum; images often do double duty (reflection as memory as method). Figurative language is lush but coherent; very few stacked metaphors strain clarity. No scaffold loops or redundancy; transitions are clean. Slight purple tint in a line or two keeps this a notch below the 9.0s.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Harvesting echoes as mechanical energy, measured by “calipers of shadow,” feels genuinely fresh and integrated. The reverse‑engineering with silence and the non‑reflective silver plate sharpen the conceptual turn. Risks in lyric mode and conceptual physics pay off with clarity and resonance. The synthesis reads singular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
