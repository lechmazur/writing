<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive—a “creeping normality noticer” who seeks grammar over eviction—drives specific micro‑choices (shoe turned, frame skewed, paper boat). Interiority is filtered through sensory ritual rather than labels, giving character‑particular texture. The main limitation is minimal internal contradiction; she seldom hesitates or pays a visible emotional price beyond restraint. Still, her renunciation of possession and covenant gesture read as an earned, character‑true endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the house’s “daydream” hum stacks to the realization of loneliness for choreography, then to the ritual that quiets it. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise): the cottage settles, the shard is embedded, options reweighted. Causal threads between orris, displacement, and the stop of vibration are legible and motivated. The cost is subtle rather than acute, which keeps it just shy of the uppermost band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: dawn bay, sodium streetlights, cedar‑scented dust, and tactile yard objects guide choices and charge the ending. The orris shard functions as micro‑setting/tool that constrains tactics; streetlights’ hum/time modulates pressure and punctuates closure. Sensory selection feels POV‑true and purposeful across smell, touch, and sound. World rules (sentient choreography via displacement) stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate around understanding and preventing a spread of sentient choreography; pressure intensifies via the house’s louder “breathing” and the decision to offer a pattern. The decisive ritual (self‑displacement, paper boat toward marble) narrows options and resolves the hum. Consequences are primarily conceptual/atmospheric rather than materially costly. Nonetheless, agency clearly drives the turn and closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of loneliness, ritual, hospitality, and ethical witness emerge through particulars (iron taste of “vanished birthdays,” covenant shard). The final image reprices the premise: a world “learning to feel its own edges” invites care without possession. No moral is stated; meaning accrues in image and action with lingering ambiguity (what if the city asks to be held?). The violets/“hush” motif evolves from tool to ethic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a stable close third maintains confidence without over‑explaining. Diction and rhythms align with Mireille’s sensory‑ritual attention; metaphors are coherent and patterned (“streetlights daydream,” “hushed blaze”). No head‑hopping or stance drift. Elisions are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing multiple jobs; images evolve rather than repeat. The lushness occasionally risks saturation, but coherence holds and scaffolding is minimal. Syntax varies to match pressure; key sentences remain clear at the peak. Final cadence is clean and image‑resolute.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Sentient architecture as choreography via displaced objects, sanctified by orris “hush,” feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Specific images (pension slip boat, marble as moon) transform tropes into singular moments. The closure synthesis is both surprising and earned.</comment>
