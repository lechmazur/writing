<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority (“kite string pulled by two storms”) and a consistent motivation (curiosity) drive concrete micro‑choices: pressing the clipping to a scar, refusing pruning/grafting, and protecting the bloom. Contradictory impulses are embodied and persist through the gardener’s test. The final stance (choosing the “now that grows between them”) reads earned with a mild, felt cost (accepting a wound as root). Relationship pressure via the gardener is brief but effective.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive lands a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant rekindled as photosynthesis and the maze blooming from the narrator’s scar. Because/therefore links are steady (heed whisper → enter maze → gardener’s offer → chosen “now” → communal rooting). Cost is conceptual but legible on the page: surrendering paved time and hosting a living hedge in a wound. Orientation is taught early and retained; closure feels clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt glade, sky‑maze, and the clipping function as setting‑objects that shape options and the ending image (constellation of miniature suns). World rules are learned through action (linking via scars) and remain consistent. Sensory specificity is vivid yet purposeful; the environment constrains and permits the central act. The final image is charged by place and object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single tightening: the gardener’s question forces a stance between future/past; the choice forecloses those paths in favor of the “green minute.” Stakes are primarily spiritual/temporal, and escalation is more deepening than jeopardy. The cost is soft but present (hosting the hedge, feeding fears to the sky). The communal circle amplifies consequence without dispersing the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of time as cultivated versus paved, wounds as doors, and communal dreaming develop through concrete images and acts, not lectures. The ending reweights the premise (covenant as photosynthesis; time “growing wild”) with emotional aftereffect. The gardener’s dictum is slightly declarative but supported by prior particulars. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric first‑person voice with consistent perceptual bias; metaphors feel native to the narrator’s mind. Distance and stance remain stable; cadence modulates from anxious elation to steady pulse. No head‑hopping; purposeful elision is taught and paid off. Diction stays coherent and character‑plausible despite high lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High‑density figurative language remains coherent and propulsive, with minimal scaffolding and strong verb choices. One copy blemish (final word truncation “coven”) and occasional lushness risk purple, but clarity and momentum hold. Sentence rhythm varies and supports scene turns. Proofing slip slightly dulls the tail but not closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative synthesis—time as horticulture, scar‑linking, sky‑maze dreams—feels singular and earned. The gardener’s midnight shears and communal root‑network avoid genre cliché and reconfigure familiar motifs. The final constellation image is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Bold choices heighten resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
