<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—sustaining bodies and memory under sanctions—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete micro‑choices (felt‑wrapped bell, collecting offerings, teaching tile patterns, saffron ink on bread). Fear vs duty surfaces viscerally when the bell slips its felt and she freezes. The interiority is largely conveyed through action rather than deep reflection, keeping her human but a touch under‑contradicted. Secondary figures (Lila, youths) sharpen her purpose without on‑page interpersonal contest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The accumulative structure is coherent and escalates via the bell’s chime, tightened checkpoints, flour scarcity, and Lila’s death; tactics adapt causally. However, the piece ends mid‑sentence (“Together they read the”), so no on‑page closure unit lands; the before/after cannot be charged with cost at the end. Without the final cadence, the drive lens can’t crystallize into RR/CR. This truncation materially undercuts structural satisfaction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the terra‑cotta arbor’s tiles become a language map; the ridge wind, harbors, markets, and curfew architecture shape tactics and tone. Tools and environment constrain choices (patrol windows, numbered tiles, saffron as ink, flatbread as carrier). The silver bell functions as micro‑setting, charging the final acts (archive in bell). World rules hold steady without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (survival and cultural continuity) are signaled early and tighten credibly: an exposed chime risks discovery, checkpoints increase, flour vanishes, and Lila’s death removes a living archive. Mara pays visible costs and alters tactics (ink on bread, sealing the chronicle in the bell). The convening declaration marks a stance crystallization, though the missing ending line blunts the culminating price/image. Escalation remains coherent and agency‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (bell, tiles, bread, saffron) accrue a compelling theme of communion over smuggling and investment in future voices. The reframing of donations as “investment” effectively reweights prior beats, and the bell becoming archive marries body and memory. Occasional declaratives (“We are not waiting…”) skim toward thesis, but subtext mostly carries meaning. The truncated final moment deprives the theme of its closing reverberation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature sustains an “amplified quiet” tone; sentences flex with pressure (the dropped‑felt chime quickens the line). Diction and imagery are consistent with the world and stance, and dialogue snippets feel purposeful. No head‑hopping or unjustified stance shifts. Purposeful compression teaches its pattern and remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images carry multiple jobs (saffron as spice, currency, ink), rhythms vary, and verbs are strong. Figurative language is fresh and grounded (“chime … like a dropped star,” “the ridge itself became a text”). Minimal scaffold or loops; transitions are efficient. The only real ding is the abrupt textual break, not the prose itself.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Conceptual ingenuity is high: encoding language via numbered tiles, ingestible maps (saffron ink on bread), and transforming a bell into an archive feel original and inevitable in this world. The donations‑as‑investment turn is smart and human. Risks in structure and lyric compression largely pay off, though the missing final cadence keeps it shy of the very top tier. The piece reads as a singular vision rather than a template.</comment>
