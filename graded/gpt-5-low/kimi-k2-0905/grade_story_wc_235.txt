<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and contradictory: she both clings to narrative control and surrenders to erasure. Micro‑choices—feeding the stove, writing the soot line, stepping into moonlight, weighting the scroll—externalize motive under pressure. Jealousy of past selves and the professional duty to “distill chaos” sharpen a credible internal conflict. The Earned Stasis at the end feels motivated by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images (scroll, stove, wind, footprints) build to a closure where erasure is chosen and reinterpreted as continuation. Orientation is clear early (cabin, date, grave) and the final act—setting the scroll to be erased—lands a cost on the page. The pressure coheres around whether to fix an ending versus accept the wheel. The scroll’s dissolution functions as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cabin and mountain are tactile and functional: stove heat, cedar smoke, wind, snow, and stone all guide choices. Weather and terrain literally erase the text, charging the final image. Professional texture (ranger archive) filters what she notices. Environmental constraint is inseparable from the ending’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—impose narrative order or accept cyclical time—tightens through the scroll’s instructions, the grave vision, and the footprints. The culminating choice to let snow erase her words forecloses a path (tidy ending) with felt cost. Internal and external pressures braid (dreams pawing at windows; mandate “do not land”). The escalation is quiet but unmistakable under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image: time as wheel vs ladder, narrative futility, and erasure as continuation. Recurring motifs (scroll, eagle flight, wind as a page turn, stone) reweight at the end. A few explicit statements (“every story ends mid‑sentence”) risk over‑articulation but are earned by scene pressure. The final stance offers a resonant answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The close third voice is distinctive—lyric yet disciplined, with consistent perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates with pressure; figurative choices track her profession and state of mind. No head‑hopping or distance slips; the pattern of elision is taught and paid off. Diction stays coherent to the narrator’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is controlled: high information density, varied syntax, and purposeful imagery. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and seldom mixed; minimal redundancy. Core lines do multiple jobs (e.g., “Snowflakes landed like white ink...” both images and theme). No loops or scaffolding distract from closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—lucid dream chronicler in a ranger cabin, feral nostalgia, birch bark scroll dated forward—feels singular. The erasure-as-continuation turn is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten coherence and stakes rather than obscuring them. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>
