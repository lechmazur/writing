<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive and a string of tactile micro-choices (placing cranes, dissolving the vellum) ground her grief. The internal contradiction—preserving vs. allowing transformation—is present but voiced more as thesis than dramatized conflict. Emotion is embodied through craft but occasionally abstracts into aphorism. The final choice to leave reads earned with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative drive is clean: the ritual of placement intensifies toward the decisive act of folding the last figure and choosing to leave. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and closure lands on-page with cost (renouncing the observatory's stasis). Set-ups (stencil, coordinates, curtains) pay off without teleports. The causal thread is soft-lyric but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, orreries, acoustic dome, and “curtains of intention” are vivid and integrated into action. Environment constrains and enables choices (where to hide messages; extracting water from the curtains) and charges the final image. World rules are consistent and learned through use rather than exposition. Tone and space fuse to thematic effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether she will remain in preservation or accept transformation; the pattern tightens as each placement commits her to a departure. The decisive narrowing arrives with dissolving the vellum and setting the “most important coordinate.” Pressure stays internal and steady rather than sharply escalating, but the cost is legible. Resolution arises from her agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wither/bloom motif, “genuinely artificial” memorials, and coordinates-as-moments coherently develop a theme of grief reconfigured rather than conquered. However, several lines articulate the thesis directly, culminating in a near-moral in the final sentence, which blunts subtext. The recurrence of objects does real thematic work. Emotional aftereffect is present but slightly over-explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, assured lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual filter shaped by craft and loss. Rhythm modulates well between image and action; no head-hopping or stance drift. Diction suits the metaphysical setting without register slips. Minor tendency toward thesis statements doesn’t disrupt control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, with purposeful image density and good propulsion for a lyric piece. Some redundancy (“genuinely artificial,” restating the lesson) and abstract phrasing soften impact, particularly near the ending. Metaphors stay coherent and world-true. Syntax varies and momentum is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mourning jewelry as vocation, soul-tracking observatory, and origami coordinates form a fresh, integrated synthesis. The use of the curtains’ water and the constellation of paper stars feels original and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity. Only the thematic stating keeps it from the very top band.</comment>
