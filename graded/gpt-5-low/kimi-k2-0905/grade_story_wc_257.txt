<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and tactile—her folding, dissolving vellum, and hairwork ground grief in embodied choice. The arc from preservational obsession to acceptance feels earned by the final renunciation (leaving). Internal contradiction (clinging vs. releasing) is present but sometimes explained more than dramatized. Still, the micro-choices (where to place each figure; using the stencil itself) credibly reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: each placement intensifies toward the decisive act of folding the final figure and choosing to leave. Closure lands on the page with cost—the mother exits the sanctuary, reweighting her craft from preservation to celebration. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/why) and the pattern is taught early and paid off. Minor softness in causality (few obstacles or reversals) keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory and its mechanisms (curtains of intention, orreries, acoustic dome) are vividly particular and used as tools, not wallpaper. Environment constrains tactics—she tucks figures in specific instruments; extracts water from the curtains; the dome’s maps match the stencil. The final constellation of lit paper stars is charged by the setting’s logic. Slightly lush description at times, but it stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal: whether she remains in preservational stasis or accepts transformation. Pressure coheres through an accumulative ritual, meaningfully tightening when she dissolves the stencil (sacrifice) and fixes a coordinate for her own departure. Lack of a bracing external counterforce or on-page resistance keeps the escalation gentle. Nevertheless, the final choice carries a visible price and resolves the dominant stake.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonance is strong in images (hair, vellum, coordinates, candles), and the ending reweights the premise without mechanical neatness. However, explicit thesis statements (“death was not the opposite of life…”) verge on didactic, reducing subtext. The best thematic work is embedded in action—the sacrificing of the stencil and redefinition of her craft. A touch more implication and less declaration would lift this.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric third-person closely tracks a singular perceptual signature—craft-based diction and ritual cadence fit the character. Rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum across a meditative piece. No dialogue to test, but focal distance is controlled and consistent. Minor repetition of thematic phrasing keeps it shy of the highest tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, image-rich, and mostly efficient; the prose often does double duty (world + emotion). Some lines edge toward overstatement and paraphrase thematic ideas already shown, softening propulsion. The final image sequence (lighting the figures, constellation) reads crisply. Overall, strong line craft with modest excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—mourning jewelry craft, a soul-observatory, origami coordinates, and “curtains of intention”—feels distinct and coherent. The choice to dissolve the daughter’s stencil as a sacrificial medium is a fresh, character-true turn. While the grief-to-acceptance arc is familiar, the execution’s specificity and cosmology render it new. Risk is taken in a quiet, ritual form that lands clearly.</comment>
