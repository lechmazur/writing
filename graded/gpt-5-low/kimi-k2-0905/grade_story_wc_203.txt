<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (retrieve the mainspring; manage ghosts like stalled cars) are crisp and her competence feels earned through tool use and micro‑choices. “Unwilling ghost‑seer” versus her professional firmness gives a credible internal tension without speechifying. The realization about cracks inside her reconfigures her stance with a subtle price (agreeing to carry and redistribute the burden). Stakes are more contemplative than perilous, but her choices consistently drive the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: lights die → ghosts arrive → ceiling spiral → ladder → cupola → mainspring unwound → release → partial re‑coil and carry. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she accepts the burden and alters the rule by exporting it via elevators. Cost is legible in her self‑diagnosed “cracks” and the choice to carry tension forward. No orientation debt; pattern holds under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The circus ticket office and clock cupola are tactile and tool‑constraining: vents, lath, iron stakes, and gigantic gears shape her tactics. Professional gaze filters details (dust patterns, ratchet teeth, tape measure) and the mainspring charges the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. The environment decisively charges and constrains the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake (freeing/containing time and ghosts) with one decisive tightening at the unwinding choice. The building’s “bargain” and the ghosts’ needs complicate her aim without undercutting agency. Costs are more conceptual than visceral, and opposition is gentle, keeping tension elegant but not maximal. Still, the final choice narrows options credibly (half‑recoil; carry the mainspring).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Repair, vertical desire, and time’s coiled burden interweave through recurring particulars (ceiling, dust spirals, gears). The ending reweights the premise: she will distribute the ghosts via elevators—stories as cargo—without moralizing. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“the cracks…were not in the walls but in herself”), but it pays off the established imagery. Subtext hums in the calliope burst and “weightless burden raining upward.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third‑limited voice with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical metaphors, technician lexicon) stays consistent. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying status and method (“Show me what you need fixed”). Rhythm varies cleanly; image density supports pressure. A single near‑overt thematic sentence keeps this just shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs: image, action, and theme (“a weightless burden raining upward”) while staying clear. Figurative devices are coherent (time/vertical/mechanical) without muddle or excess; no scaffold loops or filter stacks. Syntax and paragraphing modulate pace from hush to calliope to charged quiet. Diction is precise, concrete, and proofread.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elevator repair/horology fused with circus ghosts is an original synthesis executed with internal logic and emotional truth. The dust‑as‑schematics method and exporting the burden via elevators feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric tone, quiet conflict) heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. Key turns arise from prior particulars rather than late rule changes.</comment>
