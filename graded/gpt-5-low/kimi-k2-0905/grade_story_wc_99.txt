<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied—his slow, deliberate choices (burying the compass for the bonsai, dyeing the lace with breath) reveal a specific moral calculus. Contradictory impulses (hesitation vs. action) surface as he carries regret yet initiates return. The cost is felt: he leaves talismans behind and faces the academy with a “banner of surrender.” Minor softness: emotional conflict is largely internal, with little live pushback beyond the mist‑students.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: compass → lace map → dyed proof → crossing → offering, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration on the dock. Closure lands on the page with cost and a before/after: he reframes severance and returns under a new stance. Orientation is clean from the opening, and set‑ups (lace instructions, compass quiver) pay off. The single scene transition is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The islet’s weather, tide, and mist actively shape events (tide licking the lace, mist coalescing into students) rather than serving as backdrop. Objects as micro‑setting (compass, lace) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting evolves causally with each beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are personal but tangible—he needs proof of apology’s color before he can return—and pressure tightens via the lace’s hidden map and the mist arrivals. Agency drives the turns: he chooses to bury the compass, depart, and publicly surrender. The cost is legible in the relinquishments and risk of return. Slightly low external opposition keeps peak tension muted, yet the accumulative lens holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through concrete motifs—pruning, navigation, color—as the ending reweights “severance” into a pruning that preserves memory. Subtext runs through action and image (banner of surrender; roots tasting metal) rather than thesis. One explicit articulation (“severance had never been exile…”) edges toward statement but is earned by prior particulars. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close has a distinct perceptual signature—measured, image‑driven, aligned with the tutor’s temperament. Dialogue is sparse yet charged with subtext (the pupil’s “I kept space”). Distance control remains steady through the crossing and arrival. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and precise; images do multiple jobs (compass scratching the lace both reveals map and sonically marks time). Rhythm varies well between hushed and propulsive beats; no paraphrase loops or figurative muddle. Diction remains consistent with the established voice. Final images land cleanly without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost‑compass meets bonsai tutor meets woven‑lace instructions is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction pay off, avoiding gimmickry and sustaining emotional truth. The reconfiguration of “severance” through horticultural logic is inventive and thematically tight. Specificities (cerulean, hair‑thin blue map) distinguish this from template lyricism.</comment>
