<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corin’s motive chain is clear and consistent—debt clock, descent, reclamation of a tool, refusal—and his blacksmith knowledge credibly shapes tactics. The “meek” to resolute progression is earned through micro‑choices (folding the mouse, cutting the cable, measured gong strikes). Interiority is mostly shown via embodied action and material attention rather than labels. Slight ding: his inner contradiction is implied more than dramatized in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal flow: barter → descent → jam → cut → smelter/mural projection → gong → confrontation → arches tremble → capitulation. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (collectors yield) and a cost (loss of the silk, risk in the fall). The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric inflection and holds through the ending. The collectors’ quick reversal is the only soft spot, though the arch tremor provides sufficient forcing pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The environment is integral: floating arches, plex‑citrus orchards, shafts, smelter, and mural constrain choices and enable the strategic reweighting. Tools and objects (silk, lift, gong) are used tactically, not decoratively. Sensory specifics are vivid and POV‑filtered by a smith’s attention to weight and metal. The final image is charged by setting: arches now “sing,” remapping fear into resilience.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (the debt at moonrise; planet’s posture toward fear) and pressure tightens through the jam, the fall, and the confrontation. Corin’s agency drives turns, and the gong plus mural escalate from stealth to open defiance. Visible costs and narrowed options are legible. Antagonistic pressure is credible but briefly resolved, slightly lowering peak strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of resilience from rubble, unmaking weight, and awakening are embedded in concrete acts and objects. Recurring images (silk, hammer/pick, arches) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The “bartered awakenings” concept gains ethical weight when he demands their return “with interest.” The final tonal naming risks neatness but harmonizes with the reconfigured world.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely tied to Corin’s material sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and purposefully modulated. Patterned phrases (“azure,” “resilience”) recur meaningfully. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Elevated language matches the fable‑SF mode without breaking POV plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet propulsive; images often do double duty (e.g., “mural’s cords” as both device and theme). Minimal scaffold or redundancy; sentence variety supports momentum. A few lush metaphors approach purple but maintain coherence and do not blur action. Mechanics are clean and transitions clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: orchard planet with floating arches, a smith’s physics of weight, and the economy of “bartered awakenings.” The silk’s evolving uses feel surprising yet inevitable. The gong and mural tactic reframes resistance through art‑as‑engineering, a fresh turn. Risk‑taking enhances clarity rather than obscuring it.</comment>
