<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motives are clean and embodied: she gathers others’ burdens to stabilize the valley yet resists naming her own until the lamp sputter forces a choice. The confession and the blood-on-wick price reveal contradiction and cost without therapy-speak. Micro-choices (orienting breath, tilting flame, touching sheets) track a credible progression toward the vulnerable act. Relationship pressure is deftly externalized via the sister memory and the grotto’s listening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual → resistance (silence tightens, flame falters) → confession → violet flare → opening. Closure lands with cost on the page (finger cut, blood to wick) and a decisive reconfiguration (space unfolds, valley settles). Persistent constraint (heat to keep walls from seizing) shapes tactics and the final image (lamp left as a sun). No causality gaps; each beat escalates purposefully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: bronze tiles, sevenfold symmetry, and shingled hush constrain actions and stakes. The kerosene burner’s heat against the metal is a practical mechanic, not mere image, and the spatial recursion pressures choices. The final image (roof peeled, starlight shaft, lamp left) is charged by place-specific properties. Sensory selection is precise across sound, sight, and texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (save the valley via the lattice) and tightens when the lamp sputters and silence grows heavy. Agency peaks in her confession, which exacts blood and forecloses avoidance. Internal conflict and environmental pressure interlock; the violet flare and unfolding space feel earned. Cost persists in what she leaves behind and in the scarred vulnerability she accepts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonance is strong: burdens transformed into threads, reciprocity of sorrow and release, and the necessity of risking one’s own wound. The final reweighting—leaving the lamp and carrying only “memory of their weight”—lingers. However, the last sentence states the lesson explicitly, dulling subtext in the closing breath. Without that moralizing clause, this would sit in the 8.8–9.0 band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person is confident, textural, and consistent; no leakage in stance or distance. Diction (“shingled hush,” “antler and starlight”) feels native to the consciousness and modulates under pressure (shorter, firmer beats at the sputter and cut). Patterned elision is taught early and pays off cleanly. Rhythm supports escalation without blurring sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; most lines do double duty (world rule plus emotion). Figurative language is lush yet coherent; images recur with purpose (calcification, reflections, tiles). A hair of purple risk is present but never derails clarity. Syntax variety and clean sequencing maintain momentum to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The “fractal weaver” concept, the metallic cavern ecology, and burden-as-material are striking and integrated. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (the system demands her own weight to balance the lattice). The lamp‑as‑sun reprise is fresh and memorable. Risk‑taking in diction and cosmology heightens stakes without obscuring read.</comment>
