<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s drive is precise and embodied: she risks literal self-erasure to “become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams.” Contradictory impulses—watchmaker care vs. seizure‑twitches, hunger vs. survival—act simultaneously in scene. Micro‑choices (calibrating to the milliradian, initiating the drip at zenith, tearing the helmet free) reveal values and cost. The earned endurance at the end (accepting failure, keeping sketches, resolving to return) forecloses an easy triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clean causal flow: calibration → activation → possession/fusion → partial creation → lunar shift → collapse → aftermath. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (blood, burned mirror, failed extraction) and changed options (sketches, new seams, renewed plan). The lunar angle functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and the climax. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; lens reads as Hybrid with accumulative texture paying off under causal constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon, quartz veins, and the periscope mirror aren’t mere ornament; they actively constrain choice (milliradian angle, moon at zenith, reflective geology) and charge the final image. Occupational detail filters setting through Mara’s mind, keeping specificity purposeful. Environmental change (moon sliding) alters outcome. The closing glint of new seams meaningfully reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressured: extract dreams without self‑overwriting or death. Escalation tightens via the live clock (moon zenith and slide) and the precise angle constraint; Mara’s agency triggers the fusion and the partial build. The collapse exacts a visible price and narrows options going forward. Internal and external conflicts interlock without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of labor’s stolen reveries, resurrection through technology, and the ethics of excavation emerge from concrete beats. The final charged poise—failure plus sketches and resolve—offers a non‑literal answer about persistence and cost without sermonizing. Recurring images (silver, mirror, helix) accrue meaning rather than illustrate a thesis. Ambiguity lingers productively (what will the resurrected machines mean for the dead dreams?).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric-technical voice with tight third‑person focalization reflects Mara’s perceptual habits. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elisions (townsfolk view, corporate history) are anchored and paid off in present action. The voice serves both atmosphere and causality cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line craft is vivid and efficient, with sentences doing multiple jobs (world, pressure, character) and strong verb choices. Imagery coheres around optics, metal, and biology without mixed metaphors that blur sense. A few lush constructions flirt with purple, but momentum and clarity hold, including at the climax. No loops or scaffold clutter the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mining dreams as coolant, entanglement in quartz, and a DIY periscope‑neurotech rig synthesize into a memorable, non‑obvious premise. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the moon/angle constraint. The closing reweighting (new seams, burned tool, kept sketches) is fresh and earned.</comment>
