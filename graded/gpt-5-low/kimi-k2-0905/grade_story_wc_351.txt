<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s hunger, risk tolerance, and “chaotically precise” compulsion are embodied in the calibration, dosing, and the peril of mis-angled optics. Her internal conflict—terror of self-erasure versus compulsion to dredge the canyon’s reveries—registers in tactile stakes (walking off the cliff, blood, burnout). The failure costs her the mirror and the half-born engines, yet she chooses endurance and return, an earned stasis. Slight abstraction at peak pressure keeps us a hair removed from raw interior churn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: prepare → amplify → partial success → lunar shift → collapse → aftermath with sketches and resolve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with explicit price (burned-out mirror, lost assembly). Orientation is strong from the opening line; the moon’s angle constraint is seeded and cashed. The collapse hinges partly on environmental timing, but it’s foreshadowed and thematically apt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon is not postcard backdrop; the rail, quartz seams, and lunar angle actively constrain tactics and fate. The helmet and mirror function as micro-setting tools that channel environment into the body. The final image—canyon sleeping, seams glinting, mirror dead—recharges the earlier textures. Sensory specificity and tool-body-environment interplay remain coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (extract dreams without self-overwrite) tightens around the milliradian risk and the zenith window. The escalation crests as her agency meets the lunar slide; engines rise and then collapse, a concrete price. The cost narrows future options (mirror destroyed) and forces a tactical pivot (designing a new helmet/eyes). Slightly more agency at the exact failure beat would elevate the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Labor’s dreams as coolant become a meditation on extraction, memory, and resurrection, reframed by the ending’s earned stasis. The final cadence refuses triumphalism and reweights the premise: archaeology has a bodily cost and an ethical ambiguity. Recurring images (mirror, moonlight, quartz) accrue thematic charge without speechifying. The piece invites reflection beyond its scene without flattening into a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature (“chaotically precise,” tool-lexicon filtered through awe). Rhythm modulates appropriately from measured calibration to flared climax to steady aftermath. Diction remains coherent to character and world; no head-hopping or stance drift. The lushness never obscures focal control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density lines perform multiple jobs—world, action, and theme—without slack. Figurative language is vivid yet controlled; repeated motifs feel patterned, not redundant. Minor purple edges flirt at the brink but maintain clarity, especially at the climax. Syntax varies and propels; no scaffolding or loop artifacts dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quantum-drilled, entangled worker reveries repurposed through a DIY neuro-helmet is a fresh synthesis. The mirror-as-angle constraint and the canyon’s quartz memory render the premise specific and inevitable in hindsight. The failure-with-takeaway twist avoids genre comfort while honoring setup. Risk-taking in concept and diction pays off without confusion.</comment>
