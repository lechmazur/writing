<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Distinct, embodied interiority and a coherent motive (to feel time’s texture) guide concrete choices: visiting the silo, climbing, building the cairn, trading the shard. The urn fragment trade reads as a meaningful cost and reveals value hierarchy. Internal contradiction is light; curiosity dominates with little friction against fear or doubt. Secondary characters apply gentle, not acute, pressure, keeping the crucible modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: from discovery (time capsule, tags) to experiment (noon taste) to exchange (garage sale trade) to conceptual reframing. Causality tracks and the damaged capsule cleanly motivates the tag‑economy. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—time becomes story/currency—though the final line (“By dusk, the sale dispersed”) feels clipped, softening cadence and cost on the page. Orientation is strong early and consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The emerald silo and its environs are vivid and functional: ladder rungs as sentences, rim vantage for noon, sale at the base shaping movement and choices. Recurring objects (urn fragment, price tags) act as micro‑settings that charge the final exchange. Sensory range is rich (dust, light, taste of iron) and POV‑filtered. The setting subtly constrains tactics without grand set‑piece stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redefining time’s texture) tightens via the move from observation to embodied test to social exchange. The urn fragment trade is a credible price with felt loss, and the noon experiment deepens knowledge. Pressure is measured and interior; no sharp reversal, but the escalation suits the accumulative lens. A slightly firmer final beat would heighten the cost’s afterglow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres: when numbers fail, stories and sensations become currency and time’s texture. The urn fragment’s reweighting and the tag‑economy dramatize meaning rather than assert it. The realization precedes the ending, so the last line doesn’t further reprice, but resonance persists. No sermonizing; images carry the argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“blood from a bitten minute”) remains consistent and character‑bound. Rhythm modulates well between drift and focus; the brief dialogue is natural and textured by subtext. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Elision patterns are taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and controlled figurative language that mostly clarifies rather than clouds. Occasional purple edges are anchored by concrete action and sensory tethering. Syntax varies and momentum holds; minimal scaffolding or loops. The final clause feels abruptly plain after sustained lyricism, softening the cadence but not obscuring sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: numbers on strike, tags as ledger, urn shard as portable hour, and the garage sale as time market. The conceit follows implications without retreat, and the noon taste is an inventive embodiment. Risks feel organic rather than gimmicky. Minor cadence softness at the end is the only notable restraint.</comment>
