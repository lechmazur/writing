<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and through‑line are clear and consistent, but much of her interiority is summarized rather than dramatized. We get a few embodied beats (“fingers trembled”), yet contradictory impulses under peak pressure rarely collide on the page. The final choice reads earned, though the cost stays mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal drive is solid: discovery → plan → eclipse window → interference → retreat. The climax lands with a decisive change (entities veer away) and some resonant repricing (trust as battleground), though execution leans expository. The truncated final sentence is a polish flaw but does not break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The university station, headphones, mixing board, and subsonic gear are specific and functionally constrain choice. Astronomical charts recur with evolving meaning and help time the eclipse. Atmosphere balances cosmic strangeness with tactile radio detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (trust, autonomy, social fracture), and pressure coheres toward the eclipse. The meaningful tightening is Mara’s timed interference against an active counterpush by the tricksters. The price is stated (becoming their enemy), but on‑page felt cost remains light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of belief as resource, false dichotomies, and the politics of trust are integrated and reweighted at the end. However, several lines state thesis outright (“They are coming for your trust,” “third option of simply walking away”), which blunts subtext. The altruism insight at climax lands but could be more earned through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is steady and controlled, with a consistent register that suits the premise. Voice tends toward expository clarity over idiosyncrasy; few lines carry distinctive rhythm under stress. Absence of dialogue (beyond the broadcasted warning) limits subtextual play.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and readable, but relies on declarative summary and repeated sentence shapes. Moments of paraphrase‑like redundancy and didactic phrasing slow momentum. The cut‑off final sentence and occasional slogan‑like lines reduce polish and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Radio‑engineered subsonics as an anti‑manipulation tactic against belief‑feeding tricksters is a fresh synthesis. The government “power plays vs. trust economy” frame adds bite, though the delivery can feel essayistic. The eclipse‑timed counter‑broadcast is a strong, specific turn that makes the premise feel lived‑in.</comment>
