<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear motives drive both figures: her debt and his survival. Interiority is lyric but specific—fear “bright as lantern light,” and the “lovingly venomous” ethic refracts through both. The boy’s hesitation on the ice and choosing the ghost’s hand shows credible contradiction and cost. Some emotional distance remains due to the elevated register, but choices read earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: bead → appearances → altar crisis → escape through glass → ice ritual that erases the tumor’s “blueprint.” Closure lands on the page with cost (her dissolution, bead lost, orchard fails to bloom). The drive lens reads Causal with a lyric surface, held through the end. No orientation debt; the rule‑set (bead/greenhouse/masters) is consistent and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse’s endless night, alchemical roots, and frozen river directly constrain tactics—escape method and the drowning of the tumor’s pattern. Sensory specificity is vivid and purposeful (mercury rain, copper watering can) and filtered through the story’s priorities. Recurring objects (bead, veil) function as micro‑settings that charge the final image. Spatial and world logic remain coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the boy/lineage) tightens at the altar, then forces a higher‑cost choice on the river. Agency is decisive: she intervenes; he chooses the cold hand and the ice. The price is unmistakable—her dissolution, his near‑drowning, and the orchard’s loss. Escalation is clean and singularly focused without cheap coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mercy as poison, forgiveness across lifetimes, and the ethics of care culminate in “a mercy that looked like murder.” The bead’s “resonant awakenings” reweight the past and present without thesis‑telling. Final images—the bead sinking, the orchard’s spring failure—offer a resonant answer to the debt question. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, incantatory third‑person voice holds steady, with purposeful cadence shifts at turns (altar/river). Diction is unified and character‑apt for a mythic‑lyric mode; no head‑hopping or distance slips. Lyric compression is taught early and paid off. A hint of purple is present but rarely blurs intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density: images carry plot and theme simultaneously (bead as memory, clock, and key). Figurative language is lush yet coherent; metaphors seldom clash. Minimal scaffold or loops; rhythm modulates with pressure. A few stacked modifiers flirt with overrichness but do not impede clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost bride/apothecary care ethic, tumor as cultivated pearl, and blueprint drowned under ice synthesize into a strikingly fresh frame. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the bead’s rules and the orchard’s logic. Risks in tone and worldbuilding heighten stakes without obscuring closure. The final reconfiguration (orchard’s failure as salvation) is non‑obvious and memorable.</comment>
