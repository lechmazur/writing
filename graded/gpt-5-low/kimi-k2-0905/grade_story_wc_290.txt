<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Arin’s prudence versus claustrophobia animates concrete choices under pressure, from humming sea shanties to anchoring the compass despite panic. Micro-choices (staying through the organ, stepping into the circle) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The closing renunciation (tunnels sealed forever) lands as an earned cost aligned with her flaw. Interiority is embodied and specific without therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: compass quivers → organ catalyzes spatial mutiny → transfixing the shadow opens the shaft → the key is taken → tunnels foreclose. Closure is on-page with a felt price and a final confirming image (missing pane circle). The organ’s impossibility remains purposeful rather than a patch. Single-scene structure maintains coherence and pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nexus, rails, cracked glass, and organ acoustics are tactile and rule-bound within the piece’s logic. Tools and environment constrain choice (compass point as pivot; rails bowing; mirrors cracking) and charge the last image (perfect circle missing in the roof). Sensory balance is strong across sound, touch, and smell, filtered through Arin’s cartographic mind. World rules are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (get the key vs. claustrophobia) is clear and tightens as the organ and mutiny compress space, forcing endurance and a trade-off. The decisive act (stepping into the circle, then accepting the bargain) forecloses a path with cost. Internal and external pressures braid well without overcomplication. Stakes remain personal yet consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Wistful rebellion” is dramatized through choosing to carry the mutiny within and foreclose the tunnels; the compass/rail/key imagery evolves to reprice maps, control, and fear. The final walk west reframes cartography as self-authored. Insights arise from particulars rather than moralizing. Mirrors and meridians echo identity fractured then recomposed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close with a cartographer’s lexicon and cadences that tighten under stress. Patterned diction (geometry, rails, meridians) is consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or stance drift; compression serves pressure. Rhythmic control enhances escalation without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; most sentences do more than one job. Lyric figures are precise and coherent (“transfixed its own shadow,” “notes sliding like slow rain”) without purple muddle. No noticeable loops or cadence templates. A few lush lines push density but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spatial mutiny rendered through acoustics, compass mechanics, and rail geometry feels singular. The “transfixed shadow” pivot and mirror-meridian shatter are striking and earned. The costed bargain reframes exploration and fear non-obviously. Risk-taking in image and concept heightens stakes without losing legibility.</comment>
