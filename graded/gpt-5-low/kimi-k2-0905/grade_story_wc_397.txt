<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are distinct and embodied: she rejects “spectacle” for grief-as-teacher, refuses to record final words, and ultimately gives away the heirloom. Her internal contradiction (witness vs. act; hold vs. hinge) drives micro‑choices under pressure. The boy adds relational pressure without stealing focus. The only soft spot is that some later-life consequence is summarized rather than felt in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clean: the horn’s call, the boy’s misrecognition, the chime, and the offering of tea build toward a reweighted stance on endings. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (hinge over delay) with cost visible on the page (relinquishing the heirloom and original plan). Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the mosaic coda coheres under the same lens. No causality breaks; each image earns its place in the chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina is tactile and constraining: groaning plates, skidding boots, quilted cloaks, and the ice crack that holds the parasol tip. Environment and object charge the final image and shape tactics (the chime at the rail, the planting in ice). Sensory breadth and POV bias are excellent without cataloguing. The world’s rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around how to meet approaching endings; escalation pivots on the horn and the boy sprinting for the ship. Mara’s agency tightens options: she chooses to intervene with the chime, then to renounce witnessing and the heirloom. The cost is quiet but legible and enduring. The piece remains gentle rather than tense, but the pressure still deepens under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: patience reframed as a hinge, grief as teacher, listening over spectacle, and solace as a communal, windborne practice. The parasol tip and horn return reweighted, offering a non‑literal answer to the central question. No moralizing; the aphoristic line about umbrellas stays character‑true. The final cadence lingers with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third‑person close maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (the horn’s fold vs. the hush at the end). No head‑hopping or register slips, and elision patterns are taught and paid off. Dialogue absence fits the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line craft is lush yet controlled, with strong verbs and purposeful images (“folded the air like linen,” “a chime thinner than moonlight”). Rhythm varies and sentences carry multi‑tasking weight. Occasional density risks purple but remains coherent and propulsive. No loops or scaffold clutter dulling the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The euthanasia‑ship frame, “fold in patience,” and the parasol tip as sonic compass feel singular. Turns arise from established images and choices, not contrived twists. The piece takes aesthetic risks that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
