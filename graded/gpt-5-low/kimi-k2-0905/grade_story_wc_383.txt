<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s contradiction—professional skeptic obeying a haunted shell—drives concrete choices and pays off in a costly renunciation (her color vision). Interiority is embodied (the three-note lullaby, fever image), and micro-choices escalate toward humming and paying the price. The earned shift from private reclamation to public release reads as credible and character-specific. Minor hedge: secondary relationships are off-page, so pressure is largely internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each because/therefore step (shell → gate → pond → hum → archive) tightens toward a clear on‑page cost. Closure lands with a decisive change (color loss) plus a conceptual repricing (memory made communal). Orientation is clean within the first lines, and no causal seams show. The discarded shell as a period seals the structural cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The velvet garden is vivid and functional: hedges, foxglove droplets, and the pond constrain discovery and enable the tactic. Environment and recurring object (gate, pond) charge the final image as the garden becomes a public archive. Sensory detail is specific and POV-filtered (chlorophyll mist, vinyl-black surface) without static touring. World rules stay consistent through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming a quarantined memory—tightens as the resonance requires payment per syllable. The escalation is protagonist-driven, culminating in a visible price that reweights options. While opposition is systemic rather than personified, pressure coheres and grows under the chosen lens. The public-archive turn credibly transforms the conflict’s scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, ownership, and communal inheritance surface through concrete images (flowers carrying copies; commuters humming). The final repricing—“some ghosts are futures”—lands without sermonizing and reweights the premise. Minor abstraction appears (“translate isolation into independence”), but it’s backed by on‑page cost and action. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature sustains tension without head-hopping. Diction is consistent with the character’s mind and stakes, modulating at peak beats (the humming, the payment). No withholding tricks; certainty matches plausible knowledge. Slight density in metaphor occasionally brushes ornament but rarely blurs intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is assured: strong verbs, layered images doing multiple jobs, and clean rhythm with purposeful sentence variety. The lushness risks excess in places, but coherence holds and momentum never stalls. No loops or scaffolding; the closure beat is crisp. Figurative logic remains consistent with the world’s rules.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a bureaucratic memory quarantine meets resonance‑driven archival botany via a broken seashell key. The public archive twist converts haunting into communal anthem with felt cost, reading inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual frame) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The vision feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
