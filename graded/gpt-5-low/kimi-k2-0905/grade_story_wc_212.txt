<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and specific (reopen time by decreasing entropy; protect lineage), and her choice to reject both “preservation” and “surrender” for “circulation” reads earned. Interiority is embodied through tactile objects (the warm acorn cap, sap) rather than labels. A subtle internal contradiction—duty to safeguard vs. willingness to bear cost—surfaces in the bead’s offered choices. Minor limit: interior conflict is elegant but not deeply torn; she moves decisively once the mechanism appears.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal flow is tight: egg → vortex → seeds orbit → sap application → bead’s choice → split spiral. Closure lands on the page with cost (“half into her own heartbeat”), producing an unmistakable before/after. The drive lens stays causal even within a lyric surface, and the final image reconfigures options without handwaving. No orientation debt; stakes are set early and resolved cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and starlight aren’t decorative; the frozen orchard, fountain-vortex, and glass dome constrain and enable tactics. The acorn cap functions as a tool-micro-setting that charges the final image. Environmental details evolve with action (frost reversing, ice retreating), maintaining spatial coherence. Tone and world rules are consistent and learned through observation rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tight; pressure coheres from vortex awakening to the bead’s triadic choice. The decisive split of the spiral forecloses simpler paths (release or swallow) and binds a cost to the body. Escalation is a purposeful deepening rather than pyrotechnics, fitting the length. If anything, the external counter-pressure could register one notch sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, legacy, and time as circulatory rather than linear emerge organically from concrete acts. Recurrences (acorn cap, lullaby, frost) reweight at the end without sermonizing. The “borrowed time” sensory realization avoids platitude by anchoring in touch and breath. Slightly declarative phrasing in the final lines trims the ceiling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with stable close-third focalization; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to lift at the bead’s pulse) and remains character-true. Diction is purposeful and cohesive across images. A few high-color metaphors push toward lushness but stay legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-by-line, the prose carries high information density with minimal scaffold or loops. Figurative language is fresh and mostly coherent (“silk soaked in dawn” lands), and syntax varies with momentum. Occasional stacked metaphors (“lullaby shouted across a storm,” “furiously tranquil”) flirt with excess but don’t blur action. Mechanics and sequence are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “vortex inheritance” fused with seed-saving practice and entropy reversal feels singular. The choice to split the spiral (circulation) is a non-obvious turn that reframes time and duty. Recurring objects are reimagined rather than merely repeated. Risk-taking in concept and imagery pays off without losing clarity.</comment>
