<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character-specific motive (save and re-order inheritance) drives concrete choices: scattering seeds, surrendering heat, holding steady, refusing the doorway. Contradictory impulses (“furiously tranquil”) are embodied in breath, cold, and restraint. The renunciation—remaining as archivist—lands with felt cost. Slight abstraction in places keeps us a half-step from deeper biographical specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat concentrates order against chaos (seeds → breath → cap → oak) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with cost: she pays heat, foregoes passage, and accepts the archivist role as the dome reseals. Causality is clean and motif-powered, with no teleporting props or late rules. The future-doorway deferment reads intentional and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound atrium, starlight, and glacier materially pressure tactics (entropy, heat exchange, ice cracking) and charge the final image. Details are selective and POV-filtered (seed types, tooth-marks on the cap) and evolve with action (ice retreats, dome breaks, reseals). World rules are taught through use, not exposition. The setting constrains and empowers every choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: coax the vortex into memory of an oak to reopen inheritance without unleashing chaos. Escalation is a purposeful tightening: she pays with breath/heat, then seeds, then steadiness as the atrium groans and the oak cracks stone. The earned stasis—choosing to remain—forecloses the tempting path. Stakes skew conceptual but translate into tangible costs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance-as-debt emerges organically through seed-saving, entropy work, and renunciation; the final acts reweight the opening promise-breaking image. Subtext sits in actions and objects (library before shelves burn), with a resonant conceptual aftertaste. The explicit sapling line (“Every inheritance is a debt...”) edges toward moralizing, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall coherence and image-led meaning remain strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains through pressure with precise diction and image logic. Psychic distance stays steady; no head-hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates with escalation (shortened beats at the oak’s emergence). A hair’s breadth from over-elevated in places, but the pattern is taught and maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do multiple jobs (world, action, theme). Figurative language is abundant but coherent and purpose-driven; repetition (“borrowed time,” “furiously tranquil”) functions as motif, not loop. No scaffold or cadence artifacts visibly slow momentum. Minor risk of purple excess is balanced by clarity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—seed saving as entropy craft, “vortex inheritance,” an acorn-cap key, and a wind-hatchling—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual stakes) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established objects and rules. Final reweighting is fresh and memorable.</comment>
