<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rich, character‑particular interiority ties craft, guilt, and forgiveness to concrete action. The smashed‑organ backstory complicates motive and makes the night’s gentleness a credible reversal. Micro‑choices (warming strands, threading holes) embody care and restraint under pressure. The change—reframing preservation and relinquishing guilt—reads earned with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—the card dissolves; the keeper becomes carrier—while the environment charges the final image. Orientation is clean from the first line, and set‑ups (rope, card, aurora) pay off. The final cadence reweights the premise without mechanical tying‑off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctum, black ice pylons, frozen braids, and aurora are vivid and tool‑like, constraining choices (warming, rebraiding) and charging the climax. Sensory range is balanced (taste of copper, sub‑audible hum, snowflake voices). World rules are learned through action. The environment decisively shapes tactics and the last image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes—preserve names before the glacier erases them—are clear early and deepen through the ritual’s procedural tension. The key tightening is the rope remembering and the circuit closing, leading to the aurora’s flare and voices. Costs are internal (relinquished guilt, dissolving relic) yet legible. While pressure is quiet, the accumulative escalation is precise and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: memory as vibration versus object, forgiveness as access to preservation, craft transmuted into stewardship. Recurring images (bells, rope, aurora, melting) culminate in a reweighted ethic of carrying rather than owning. One line (“preservation is not a bronze bell...”) edges toward thesis, but it’s earned by concrete particulars. The ending’s river‑borne names deliver lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, singular lyric voice with controlled cadence and striking yet legible imagery. POV distance stays stable; diction matches a reflective artisan steeped in ritual. Rhythm modulates at peak beats (circuit closing, aurora flare) without blur. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with few wasted lines; images do multiple jobs (rope as tool, history, and conduit). Figurative language remains coherent to the world’s physics and ritual logic. Slight lushness never stalls momentum and avoids mixed metaphors or synonym loops. Final images are crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—punch‑card lullaby mapped into braided rope under aurora to resurrect communal names—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and ritual mechanics heighten coherence and stakes. Turns arise from established objects and vows rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth (guilt transmuted to stewardship) grounds the strangeness.</comment>
