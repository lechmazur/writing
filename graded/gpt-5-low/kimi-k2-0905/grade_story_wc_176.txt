<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-POV interiority is specific and embodied, with the lost-wax caster’s guilt and tenderness driving each micro-choice (warming hemp, threading holes). The violent past (smashing the master’s organ) complicates the present “technically gentle” approach, making forgiveness feel earned rather than declared. Emotional shifts land through tactile acts and sensory perception, not labels. Only minor note: internal contradiction is more resolved than contested on the page, keeping it just shy of a 9-band peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual actions escalate coherently to the humming pylons, aurora flare, and release of voices. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the card dissolves; guilt is reweighted; preservation shifts from bronze to vibration. Orientation is clear from the outset (aurora, sanctum, caster, goal). The persistent constraint (fragile card; glacial erasure) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, black-ice pylons, and skylight actively shape choices and the climax (snowflakes speaking names; pylons humming). Sensory detail is vivid across registers (taste, touch, sound) and consistently filtered through the caster’s craft-minded gaze. World rules are learned through action (rope mechanics; card-as-phonemes). The setting charges the ending’s image and is inseparable from the story’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving names before glacial erasure) is signaled early, with tightening via the ritual’s assembly and the sanctum’s response. The decisive intensification is the circuit closure and aurora flare; the price is letting the object dissolve and carrying the voices forward. Escalation is character-driven under the accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves it. Slight softness in on-page jeopardy keeps it from a perfect peak, but the cost is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of preservation, transmission, guilt, and repair develop through concrete particulars (lost-wax bells vs. living vibration; rope braids absorbing a lullaby’s pattern). The explicit line “preservation is not a bronze bell but a continuing vibration” risks statement but is earned by the ritual’s demonstration. The final cadence reweights everything: memory as moving air and river-song, not artifact. Ambiguity lingers without confusion, resisting tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first-person voice with controlled diction and rhythm; metaphors are craft-and-weather-grounded and consistent. Psychic distance holds steady, modulating with pressure at the ritual’s peak. No dialogue needed; the prose carries subtext and action. Elision and reflection are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with little scaffold; images do multiple jobs (e.g., snowflake voices are both setting and chorus). Figurative language is abundant but coherent and purposeful; no mixed-metaphor muddle at the climax. Syntax varies and supports momentum from preparation to activation to release. Minor lushness never stalls clarity or cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original fusion of craft (lost-wax, organ card), ritual rope astronomy, and auroral acoustics feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring sense. Core turns arise from seeded specifics rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth—guilt transmuted into stewardship—grounds the novelty.</comment>
