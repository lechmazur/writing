<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The poet’s motives are clear and embodied—“to tend the horizon with words”—and he makes concrete micro‑choices (drawing the spiral, tearing his sleeve, giving the feather) that reveal values under gentle pressure. Interiority is rendered through sensory perception rather than labels, and contradictions (preserving the incomplete while shaping it) are lived rather than explained. The relationship with the woman adds a crucible of collaboration that slightly reframes his task without melodrama. Stakes are quiet but credible, culminating in an earned renunciation (letting the tide erase his line).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first image through closure: fragments accrue, music joins, spiral unwinds, and the final repricing lands in the erasure. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid with visible costs (sleeve torn, feather given, words surrendered) that reweight his ongoing practice. Orientation is clean from the opening; the storm and snapped kite seed the later reconfiguration. The final “door left ajar” image crystallizes the before/after without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lagoon after rain, tideline shards, wet sand, and tide are not postcard detail—they supply tools and constraints (drawing the spiral; inevitable erasure) that shape action and ending. Sensory specificity is high and filtered through the poet’s noticing; weather and water materially affect choices. Recurring objects (feather, zither) operate as micro‑settings. The tide’s erasure charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal/artistic—whether he can find a stance toward damage—and escalation arrives via the woman’s discordant instrument and his choice to alter it (tuning the buzz to a sigh). The tightening is modest but clear: from solitary tending to a collaborative weave that risks altering the brokenness he cherishes. Costs are small but legible (sleeve, surrendering feather/words). Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, though the conflict never sharpens into a hard binary.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of beauty in incompleteness emerges organically through torn objects, partial music, and the spiral’s unwinding into tide. Subtext operates through image and action, and the ending reweights prior motifs. The explicit thesis line (“Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use.”) borders on moralizing, softening the purity of the image‑led resonance. Still, the piece avoids sentimentality by letting erasure stand as answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and suited to the lyric mode. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful and carries subtext. No head‑hopping or stance drift; psychic distance modulates gracefully with pressure. The voice maintains confidence without explanatory overreach.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant, with varied syntax and high information density; images do multiple jobs (e.g., “burnished hush” as sound and light). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern‑taught; no mixed‑metaphor muddle undermines clarity. Momentum holds despite lyricism; no scaffold or loop artifacts. The final images land cleanly without prose thicket.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a broken zither strung with fishing line, a torn feather used as stylus, and a spiral that gathers fragments into a “loom of almost.” The kite’s return and braided sunrise feel earned by the established pattern rather than convenient magic. The piece takes aesthetic risks in a quiet register and carries them through to a precise, resonant close. Specificity prevents the concept from drifting into abstraction.</comment>
