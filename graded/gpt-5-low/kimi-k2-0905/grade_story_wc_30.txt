<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (“preserve wonder in routine”) drives concrete choices (smelting, planting the creel). Interiority is specific to her hybrid body and work; the litany reveals lived contradiction rather than tidy epiphany. The resistance of identities offers mild on‑page friction, though the struggle resolves without much costed hesitation. Lacks a relational crucible, but the self‑division functions as a credible internal pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lunar tide and catalog entropy mount toward a Charged Poise closure. The decisive act is planting the creel to anchor memory against her future forgetting; the cost is legible in “feeling the hollow adjust around absence” and the acceptance of releasing the ribbon later. Orientation is clean from the first line; pattern is taught early and paid off. The final image reweights the premise without mechanical wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium, moon, brass body, net, and creel are not mere décor; they constrain tactics (work while wintersun lasts, net mesh set by phase) and charge the ending. Environmental logic is consistent and integrated into action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with the water/metal interface shaping choices. The creel rooted into the tile constellation meaningfully binds setting to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guarding wonder/identities against dissolution—tightens as the moon “pulls contradictions outward,” compelling the irreversible planting of the creel. The escalation is a deepening of pressure rather than reversal, fitting the lens. Cost is present (risk of self‑forgetting, planned future release), though the on‑page resistance is mostly lyrical rather than perilous. Agency drives the resolution with an earned renunciation of perfect control.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of identity as motion versus preservation emerges through particulars: net mesh, mutable ribbon, routine as wonder‑engine, water as memory. The ending offers a resonant answer—guard the unfinished still point now, release later—without stating a moral. Recurring objects reprice meaning (creel’s expansion ring) and resist platitude. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged, not confusing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature rooted in her mechanic/nautical sensibility. Distance control is steady; compression and patterned diction are taught early and sustained. No head‑hopping or register drift; metaphors align with established world logics. Rhythm modulates to land the closure image without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do multiple jobs (world, motive, action). Lushness flirts with excess but generally stays coherent to the metal/water lexicon; minimal redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum through a quiet design. A few stacked figuratives (“foam,” “wax,” “skylight sky”) crowd slightly but do not muddy closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The conceit—a titan‑gear librarian forging migrating identities under tidal time—feels singular and integrated. Risks in diction, object logic, and cosmology cohere; the process mechanics (accepting contradictions) are fresh and consequential. Turns are earned from world rules rather than late invention. It stops short of radical structural innovation, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
