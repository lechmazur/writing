<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s motive (to risk grief through scent) is precise and sustained, with contradictory impulses—aromatic caution vs. the urge to uncork tears—active in scene. Micro-choices (uncapping, measured breathing, offering a drop to the orchid, deciding to stop selling lanterns) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The occupational texture (broker of lanterns) meaningfully reframes his renunciation at the end. The cost—abandoning his trade and the safety of numbness—reads on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: UV activation → vial opened → orchid resonance → conceptual repricing and vocational shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he becomes a broker of “invisible gardens”). Orientation is clear early and consistent; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint (olfactory collapse/engineered fungi) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse and UV panels are integral, not wallpaper: they reveal molecular “architecture,” enable the orchid’s response, and charge the ending’s vigil. Specifics (ghost orchid, iron/meteor dust soil, engineered fungi) are character-filtered and purposeful. The environment constrains choices (breathing tactics, offering the drop) and reweights the finale. Sensory economy is excellent, with scent-centered detail leading perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether he will risk inhalation and surrender to grief; escalation arrives with the UV reveal and the experiment on the orchid. The new note (hospital bracelet) deepens stakes by forcing a more acute memory-cost. Resolution is earned through his agency and renunciation (“He would sell no lanterns tomorrow”). The price is felt without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as curation of extinct perfumes, memory’s pressure arriving through scent—emerges from concrete acts and images. The final shift from light to “invisible gardens” offers a non-literal answer to the central question. One sentence edges toward thesis (“every tear…”) but is embedded in sensory causality. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is singular, controlled, and scent-attentive, with metaphors consistent to character and world. POV distance is steady and confident; no head-hopping, no explanatory crutches. Rhythm modulates well between incantatory images and decisive actions. Diction suits a poetic, scientifically literate mourner without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly disciplined; images often do double duty (worldbuilding and emotion). Minor repetition of the “ultraviolet revealing” phrase and a few high-density metaphor stacks flirt with purple but don’t blur sense. Momentum is maintained with strong verb choices and clean syntax. The final image crisply recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The olfactory collapse, lantern economy, UV-revealed vapor architecture, and orchid resonance synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling system. Emotional truth is specific; the hospital bracelet note is a striking, non-obvious turn. Risk-taking in premise and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation from light-broker to scent-gardener feels both surprising and earned.</comment>
