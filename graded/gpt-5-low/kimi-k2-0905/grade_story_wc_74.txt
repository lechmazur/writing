<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—to coax a lost language and finish an uncommissioned mural—drives concrete choices (mirror, indigo brew, brushwork) and culminates in a credible shift from blade-like fatigue to blanket-like rest. Interiority is embodied through sensory obsessions rather than label-speak, and her realization that the mural is “for lungs” reads as earned, not declared. The relationship with Jules is quiet but meaningful, adding communal pressure without stealing focus. Internal contradiction is subtle (compulsion vs. care for others), not strongly dramatized, which trims the ceiling slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: moon, brush, breath, and city-kindness build to a resonant reconfiguration where the mural becomes communal respiration. Closure lands on the page with cost—four nights of insomnia and an on‑page earned stasis (she finally sleeps) while the city carries the price and promise of remembering. Orientation anchors early and remains clean, and the rule-set (moon/ink/greenhouse) is consistent. The persistent constraint of night/moon shapes tactics and the final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is tactile, olfactory, and mechanistic: glass, peat, marigold bruise, mirror placement, and lunar angle actively shape options. The calligrapher’s brush and improvised indigo function as micro‑settings that constrain action and charge the final image. World details evolve with events (bristles hum, orchids open; city erased by steam), never as a postcard. The environment’s transformation into “a lung” decisively charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure accrues via pattern: insomnia → brush ignition → greenhouse thickening → communal breathing, with the moon’s rise/set narrowing the window. The key tightening is the discovery that the mural is for lungs, which reweights the stake from solitary making to civic memory. Costs are felt (exhaustion, surrender of ownership to the air), though no hard dilemma is forced. The escalation is consistent with the accumulative lens rather than reversal-led.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Memory, kindness, and language intertwine through images rather than moralizing; “coins warm from palms that still remembered giving” and the sandwich reflection embody the thesis. The ending reweights earlier images (breath/marigold/indigo) into a communal ethic without dictating a lesson. Subtext runs through action (breathing the mural) and quiet reciprocity (marigolds on windshields). Ambiguity lingers productively about how far the city can change.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“saffron quiet,” “match struck in a library”) maintains steady distance and confidence. The voice modulates with pressure (from careful setup to humming crescendo) without slipping registers. No head‑hopping; Jules enters as a silent foil without contaminating focalization. A hair shy of the top band only because the diction leans lush throughout rather than varying more sharply at peak stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is vivid, concise enough for momentum, and free of loops or scaffolding; images do double duty in scene and theme. Figurative density is high but coherent; metaphors align (breath/lung/syllable/pollen) without contradiction. Rhythm varies across sentences and paragraphs, and the final line cleanly reprises prior motifs. A touch of purple could be trimmed in places, but it doesn’t obscure causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lost language as breathable mural in a greenhouse-lung under a moon using a thrifted calligrapher’s brush—is distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, concept magic) pay off in coherent world logic. Specificities like indigo brewed from morning glories and rusted nails ground the marvel. The closing social ripple (marigolds on wipers) elegantly extends the premise beyond the room.</comment>
