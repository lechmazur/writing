<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jin’s motive is clear and particular—he’s hunted the color of sound—and his choices (leaving the ladder, diving, handling air pockets, playing/sealing the cylinder, returning to light) align with that drive. Interiority is sensorially embodied (e.g., vermilion flare from the lily), with profession‑specific detail grounding him. Internal contradiction is lighter—duty vs. obsession is present but not sharply contested on the page. The ending’s renunciation/return reads earned though the felt cost is modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → key → wreck → safe → cylinder → repricing → return, with each beat intensifying pattern and meaning. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: sound becomes light “still searching for an eye,” and Jin’s return to signify vows reframes his vocation. Orientation is crisp from the first sentence; the through‑line never tangles. Cost is implied (risk, abandonment of post) rather than dramatized at peak stress, keeping this just shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor, festival, and sunken library are vividly tactile and govern tactics (air pockets, careful breaths, bolted shelves, key‑safe interface). Recurring tools and objects (lamps, ladder, key, cylinder) charge the final image of multi‑tinted wicks. World rules are learned through action (bioluminescent plankton as “star‑smoke”), not exposition. The environment constrains choices and powers the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the color of sound vs. duty to guide) is signaled early and deepens through the dive and the safe’s recording. A meaningful tightening occurs at the cylinder’s play and the captain’s instruction, which forces Jin’s stance to crystallize. The price—risk of drowning, potential dereliction—is present but not pressed into a hard dilemma. Resolution stems from Jin’s agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of vow, memory, and guidance emerge organically through objects and ritual, culminating in the image of sound as light that needs an eye. The festival, key, and cylinder braid into a coherent meditation on how promises persist and are witnessed. One line edges toward thesis‑statement (“every human sound is merely light…”), slightly reducing the subtlety otherwise achieved. The final lamps “singing” in color delivers a resonant, earned answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Jin’s sensoria with a distinct idiom (color‑sound synesthesia, meteor hush). Diction is consistent and precise; patterned phrases recur intentionally. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; the whispering woman’s line lands as action, not exposition. Rhythm adjusts to pressure (quicker during dive, expansive at repricing) with confidence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with few redundancies; imagery is vivid yet coherent to the world’s logic. Occasional flourish (“hiding behind truth”) repeats but reads as motif, not churn. No mixed metaphors or template cadences blunt the climax; syntax breathes with the scene. Minor purple edges remain under control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—lamplighter, sky‑lantern festival, drowned library of vows, synesthetic listening—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric register, concept‑forward CR) heighten rather than obscure. Beats grow from established particulars (key → safe → cylinder), not late rule changes. Emotional truth (duty reframed by vow‑witness) keeps the novelty grounded.</comment>
