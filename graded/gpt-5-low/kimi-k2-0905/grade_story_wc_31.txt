<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jin’s longing to “discover the color of sound” is specific and embodied, and his micro-choices (abandoning the ladder, breathing air pockets, playing the cylinder) align with it. A modest but credible tension exists between duty (lamplighting) and pursuit (diving), paid off when he returns changed. Interiority is sensorial rather than diagnostic, with synesthetic perception revealing character. The internal contradiction could be sharpened a touch—duty versus desire is present but not heavily stressed in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lanterns → key → wreck → safe → cylinder → reconfigured return. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—sound as light—paired with an earned stasis in his resumed duty now transformed. The enabling coincidence of the woman’s key is accepted within the mode and paid off causally at the safe. Cost is legible (risk underwater, suspended duty), and the final image tightens the frame back to the pier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drowned library concretely shapes tactics (air pockets, bolted books, safe), and the tools/objects (lamps, key, plankton) charge the ending. Sensory detail is vivid across modalities without museum-tour bloat. The environment’s rules stay consistent and learned through action. Final image draws power from setting logic (plankton trail, colored lamps) rather than abstract symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and deepens through the dive and the decision to play the final recording. One meaningful tightening occurs at the safe, where agency and risk converge; the cost is modest but present, and consequences reweight his duty on return. Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist. Slightly softer visceral jeopardy keeps it below the very top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of vow, guidance, and synesthetic perception interweave through concrete images (lanterns, pressed lily, plankton). The final repricing answers the quest non-literally—he is painted by sound rather than mastering it. One sentence leans toward explicit thesis (“every human sound is merely light…”) which slightly blunts subtext. Overall resonance lingers and avoids tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is consistent, textured, and plausibly filtered through Jin’s sensibilities. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (surface hush vs. underwater velvet) without losing clarity. No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful. The voice maintains distinctiveness without over-ornamentation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is controlled and propulsive, with images doing double-duty for plot and theme. Occasional high-flown phrasing remains coherent and does not tangle metaphors. No scaffold loops or template cadence; syntax varies with scene needs. Minor purple edges are balanced by clarity and precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A striking synthesis—lamplighter, drowned library of vows, synesthetic sound-as-light—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in conceit and diction heighten meaning without obscuring it. Turns arise from established motifs and choices rather than late rule changes. The reweighted final duty image lands as memorable and singular.</comment>
