<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Calla’s goal is clear and embodied through concrete micro‑choices (drawer, envelope, spoken call mark, tearing the scarf). Her interiority is specific and character‑particular, with occupational texture informing perception. The cost—surrendering the scarf/time—lands credibly. Slight softness: conflict is mostly internal with limited contradictory impulses dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: each step (polaroid → mirror/endcap → catalog number → door → shell‑room) tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on‑page with cost (scarf torn; time released; geometry relaxes). Orientation is clean early and used to charge the ending image. Minor note: causality is lyric rather than obstacle‑driven, but coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scientific‑poetry library is vivid and integral (“Thermodynamic Elegies,” mirror endcap, door the color of silence). Environment and recurrent object (scarf) constrain and charge choices, culminating in a final image that the setting uniquely enables. Spatial choreography of the warped corridor is legible and purposeful. Sensory selection matches Calla’s professional bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via density and pattern shift: ordinary stacks → hyperbolic corridor → door → shell room → tearing the scarf. The price is unmistakable and resolves the dominant stake through renunciation. Tension is quiet rather than adversarial but remains coherent under the accumulative lens. A touch more friction or a near‑miss would have heightened the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stories as resonance between observer and observed accrues through particulars (page‑friction as analog memory, charged catalog number, nautilus room). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing; the lingering “tactile whisper” extends meaning beyond the scene. One line names the thesis directly, but it’s earned by scene work. Subtext ties guardianship to cost and time.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, confident lyric voice with controlled metaphoric lexicon; POV distance stays steady and apt. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and diction aligns with Calla’s sensibility. Purposeful elision (the not‑quite‑Euclidean rules) is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, with images doing multiple jobs (“door the exact color of silence,” “polaroid’s white border” as knob). Figurative density is high but coherent and scene‑advancing; minimal repetition and no muddle at the peak. Cadence breathes at turns, sustaining momentum. A few lush constructions skirt purple but remain precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry as portal in a scientific‑poetry library, with analog memory as the animating principle, feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The scarf’s transformation into time‑cost is an elegant, specific synthesis. Risks in concept and diction heighten coherence rather than distract. The piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>
