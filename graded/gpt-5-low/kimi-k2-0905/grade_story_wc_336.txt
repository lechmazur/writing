<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Arin’s motive (preserve wonder) is concrete and consistent, and his choices (build, capture, then release) align under pressure. The decisive renunciation—“the loom was not a cage but a shuttle”—earns the turn and carries cost (collapse, aging, relinquishing the orchard). Interiority is embodied through craft-detail and sensory bias rather than labels. Minor limitation: the internal push‑pull before the release choice could show a touch more friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive with clean causal steps: build → attune → capture → backlash/door → renunciation → seeding the world. Closure lands on‑page with conceptual and felt cost (sacrifice of the loom, personal aging, life-direction shift). Orientation is clear by the first lines, and the lens holds to the end. The persistent constraint (the veil widening) shapes the peak choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The parapet, waterfall veil, mist-radius, willow loom, and heirloom tools are not ornamental; they constrain tactics (mist’s reach, tuning fork’s hush, veil-as-door). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (orchard craft, sap/soil, dew vials). The setting charges the final image (sapling half in soil, half in dream). World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: trap and replant wonder before it drains away. Pressure tightens when the weave pulls back and the veil becomes a door, forcing a trade-off between preservation and release. The chosen resolution is a renunciation with visible cost and wider consequence. Slightly soft on pre‑decision resistance, but escalation remains coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship versus hoarding arises from acts, not sermonizing, and the “shuttle” realization reweights prior images. The final sapling/rooting-in-air offers a resonant answer: wonder survives by circulation. Emotional aftereffect is earned through particulars (tools, droplets, laughter crossing the gorge). A single near-explicit thematic phrase skirts didacticism but doesn’t undercut the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical close third with controlled cadence and a distinctive perceptual signature (craft lexicon, sensory synesthesia) remains stable. Modulation at stress points (fork strike, veil widening) is precise without head-hopping. Compression is purposeful; no dialogue needed. A hair’s breadth from purple in places, but the voice remains disciplined.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do multiple jobs and rhythm breathes with the scene. Figurative language is lush yet coherent, with few mixed metaphors. No loops or template cadences dull momentum. Slight saturation of imagery at peak beats keeps it just shy of pristine.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The willow loom as shuttle between worlds, tuning-fork “radiant hush,” and snipping droplets of wonder are fresh and integrated. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the world-logic. The final graft onto air marries concept and image with memorable specificity. Bold choices heighten coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
