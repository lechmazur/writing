<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arin’s motive is vivid and consistent—preserve wonder—and his micro-choices (building the willow loom, pruning, singing, snipping, finally releasing) align under pressure. The internal turn from trapping to sharing reads earned by the widening veil and the city’s response. Interiority is embodied through craft and sensory bias rather than labels. Slightly limited contradiction on-page before the pivot keeps it just shy of exemplary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: preparation → summoning → capture → the door opens → renunciation and release. Closure lands on-page with cost: the loom collapses, Arin is “suddenly older,” and he relinquishes the hoarding solution. Orientation is precise from the opening (who/where/when) and the causal progression holds. The final sapling and graft-to-air form a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The verdant parapet and waterfall veil are not postcard backdrops; mist proximity enables the loom’s function and the veil’s widening forces the choice. Tools and materials (willow shoots, tuning fork, dew vials) are integrated as lived setting. Sensory detail is layered across sight, sound, and touch with POV-specific selection (orchard craft). The final image is charged by place: the sapling rooted half in soil, half in dream at that parapet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens when color resists capture and the veil widens into a door, forcing a trade-off. The key reversal—release rather than contain—forecloses a path and exacts a price (loss of the loom, aging). Tension escalates through density and cadence rather than adversarial clash, appropriate to the lens. Stakes remain concentrated; no soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: wonder cannot be hoarded; it survives by being shared. The shift from loom-as-cage to loom-as-shuttle functions as the thematic hinge without moralizing. Final images (silent fireworks, chiming leaves, graft to air) recast prior motifs with lingering resonance. The piece invites reflection on stewardship versus control without flattening into a sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person is steady, with a distinct sensory lexicon rooted in horticultural craft and ritual. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to swelling release) while remaining controlled. No head-hopping or stance slips; inference stays within Arin’s plausible knowledge. Diction feels earned by the world and task.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful; images often do multiple jobs (e.g., snipping air as both action and conceit). Variation in syntax keeps momentum, and there are no noticeable loops or scaffolding. A high density of figurative language skirts purple but remains coherent and legible under pressure. Closural lines are clean and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of orchard craft with metaphysical loom-work and tuned dew feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from established materials (tuning fork, willow loom, veil) rather than late rule changes. The “graft to air” and color-as-droplets cut from the world are striking inventions. Risk-taking elevates resonance without harming clarity.</comment>
