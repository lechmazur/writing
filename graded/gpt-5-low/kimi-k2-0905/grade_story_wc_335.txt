<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (refusing to forget), embodied contradictions (save the library vs. not becoming a text), and micro‑choices under pressure (reading, sealing clauses, mentoring without words) build to an earned endurance. The cost—bearing memory and remaining in service—reads without overstatement. The child’s arrival productively tests her stance. Slight remove from deep interior feeling keeps it just shy of extraordinary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: tea leaves → sealing ritual → library’s response → mentor’s name → child’s choice → repriced exile. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: exile rewritten into a loop with a conceptual and emotional cost for Lira. Orientation is clean from the first line. Persistent constraints (reversible exile, pinned shadow) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library and its objects constrain and enable choices (pinned shadow, ribs‑like shelves, swing ghost). Setting evolves causally (library shudders, exhales) and charges the final image (teacup with perfect circle). Details are selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. Environment feels indispensable to action and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: save the library vs. personal cost of reversal. Escalation deepens through ritual acts and the library’s tangible responses; the child’s entrance narrows options and forces stance crystallization. The price is felt—Lira takes on the remembering burden and forecloses an easier path. Quiet, but the tightening is unmistakable under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Resilience, mentorship through absence, and memory vs. forgetting are woven through objects and action rather than stated. Recurring images (backward walking, blade‑smile, pinned afternoon) reweight in the ending. The final annotation (“Resilience is walking backwards until the path agrees to follow you.”) functions as conceptual repricing without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person close with consistent diction and rhythm; images feel character‑borne. Dialogue is minimal and carries subtext cleanly. Psychic distance control is steady, and patterned elision is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or register drift; the prose modulates pressure with precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing double duty; figurative language is vivid yet controlled, rarely straying into muddle. No paraphrase loops or mechanical scaffolding; cadence varies to match pressure. Final images are crisp and load prior motifs without bloat. Copy and syntax are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The shard‑mirror archivist, captured afternoon, and reversible exile premise synthesize into a fresh, inevitable‑in‑hindsight design. Risks (lyric logic, ritualized action, mentor‑by‑absence) heighten stakes and remain coherent. The piece commits fully to its rules and implications. Specific turns (rewriting exile via backward circuits) feel original and earned.</comment>
