<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and embodied in micro-choices (adjusting the pulse, opening windows, garden descent, the cork ritual). Interiority is particular—“screaming tenderness” and scent-anchored memory—though internal contradiction is more tonal than decisional. The endurance cost (a life spent transmitting softness) feels credible. A sharper on-page clash between her belief and an opposing pull could deepen the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the heat break enables subtle signal; tower → lamp room → garden → fountain → beam → boat builds cleanly to a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands with the boat’s response and her reframed understanding of the mother’s “drowning.” The cost is implied (lifelong transmitting) rather than sharply priced on the page, keeping it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: cobalt tower, salt air, night flowers, and dawn actively condition tactics and the ritual. The garden scent and dawn’s cool break are not postcard detail; they govern when her method can work and charge the final image. Object-as-setting (vial cork) is integrated across locations. A minor note: lighthouse mechanics remain lyric rather than technical, which suits the mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early—prove whispers surpass shouts—and escalate through density rather than opposition. The meaningful tightening arrives when she commits to the garden ritual and then beckons in rhythm with the beam, producing the boat’s course change. Opposition is largely atmospheric, so price is felt but soft; still, the ending reweights options convincingly under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of softness vs. force is organically built through objects, scent, and rhythm, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of what “drowning” means. However, the thesis appears verbatim (“The softer we become, the farther we reach”) and is echoed again in the finale, edging into moralizing and reducing subtext. The images themselves carry the idea well without those declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (scent, vibration, metal, and light). Psychic distance remains stable; elision is taught and paid off. Rhythmic modulation tracks pressure effectively. A few repeated high-register phrases skirt self-consciousness but stay coherent with the speaker’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet purposeful; images do more than one job and cadence varies. Occasional phrase recurrence (“screaming tenderness,” “purifies intentions”) risks purple notes but doesn’t muddy sense or closure. No significant scaffolding or synonym loops; propulsion is maintained through sensory linkage and action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse technology with scent, vibration, and an heirloom cork feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The risk of a fully lyric, low-antagonism design pays off with a concrete boat response. Conceptual leap (mother traveling on subtle vibrations) is distinctive without gimmickry. Minor deductions for a stated thesis keep it below the top band.</comment>
