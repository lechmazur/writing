<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (“prove whispers travel farther”) drives concrete micro‑choices—waiting out the heat, tuning the beacon, whispering into the cork, and beckoning. Interiority is sensorial and embodied rather than diagnostic, with tactile focus on scent, glass, and pulse. Internal contradiction is subtle (need to reach out vs. acceptance of loss) but could press harder. The closing endurance stance feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: waiting → ritual assembly → release → response → repricing of the mother’s fate. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the boat’s slight course change and the mother’s “vibrations” recast the world’s rules with emotional cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp from the first line; no causality break. The price—lifelong transmitting in solitude—registers on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, salt air, and night garden are not postcard; they constrain timing, method, and belief. The heat break and dawn enable the scent mechanics and “soft frequencies,” and the tower’s controls become tools of intent. The cork, fountain, and windows are used tactically, not decoratively. The final image is charged by place and object working in concert.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible, with one meaningful tightening: from internal vow to an external test (the boat’s course shift). Pressure deepens via ritual specificity rather than reversals, consistent with the chosen lens. Cost is implicit endurance and relinquishment of louder, easier tactics. A touch more external resistance could heighten the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Softness vs. force emerges through recurring particulars (pulse‑tuned light, scent language, cork prism) rather than lecture. The realization about the mother reframes love, loss, and communication without closing ambiguity. Slight thematic overstatement appears in the spoken maxim (“The softer we become…”), nudging toward didactic. Still, the ending’s image carries the resonance more than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical single‑POV voice with a distinct sensory lexicon (salt, jasmine, mercury glass, pulse). Rhythm modulates with scene pressure, and certainty stays within what the focalizer could infer. Recurrent paradoxes (“screaming tenderness”) feel voice‑true and controlled. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, motive, pressure). Imagery threads (vibration, scent, pulse) are coherent without mixing vehicles. Minor repetition is pattern‑taught rather than looped scaffolding. Momentum holds through long, balanced sentences that breathe with the piece’s quiet tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—perfume‑cork as transmitter, lighthouse tuned to a remembered heartbeat, garden scent as guidance—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Magical rules are taught by use, not exposition. The risk (a lyric ritual guiding a real boat) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final repricing of “drowning” is original and earned.</comment>
