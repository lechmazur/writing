<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—duty-bound rescue despite hatred of the orchard—is clear and deepens under pressure. Contradictory impulses (“she hated the orchard” vs. “graceless beauty of saving strangers”) act in scene and inform tactics. Micro-choices (arrow impressions, then the kernel-smeared handprint) reveal a values hierarchy with cost (spending the last gift). Interiority stays concrete and embodied through sensory action rather than labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene structure with a clean clock, consistent rules, and a tight causal chain culminates in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. The decisive image—the travelers’ escape as frost seals her prints—lands with felt cost (she remains bound; the seed is spent). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the drive lens (situational pressure with causal tactics) holds. No stray setups; all introduced elements pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The physical world constrains choices: forbidden stones, razor-feather birds, frost deadline, cliff shadow/frost line exit. Details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara’s practical gaze (warmth depressions, “seven lies,” smugglers’ stair). Recurring objects (nut/blueprint, birds, frost) charge the final image. World rules are consistent and learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure tightens via the ticking frost, the “seven lies” fork, and the birds’ surveillance; options narrow visibly. Escalation flows from Mara’s agency—switching from arrows to the kernel-smeared handprint when voice and proximity fail. The kernel’s sacrifice and the roused birds sharpen cost and risk in the peak beat. Resolution is earned without coincidence, rooted in the established constraints.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Duty without love, the economy of sacrifice, and the oxymoron of “graceless beauty” emerge through image and act, not declaration. The final cadence reweights the world: salvation for others is bought with her continued imprisonment and the spent seed. Subtext in mechanical rituals (birds folding like untaught prayers) enriches the moral texture. No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The close third voice is lyrically precise yet grounded in Mara’s sensorium and constraints. Diction is stable and character-specific, modulating under pressure without register drift. Purposeful elisions (curse-swallowed sound, blueprint vision) are taught and paid off. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, action, and emotion intertwined—without scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is fresh and controlled; images like “warmth-ghosts” and “wings folding like prayers” clarify rather than blur. Rhythm varies with tension; no padding or mechanical cadence. Copy is clean and sequence is lucid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: warmth impressions as guidance, a seed bearing a micro-etched blueprint, and mechanical birds enforce unique constraints. The tactical use of the kernel to create a luminous handprint is an elegant, specific turn. The orchard’s curse and earned stasis feel singular rather than templated. Risk-taking serves coherence and stakes.</comment>
