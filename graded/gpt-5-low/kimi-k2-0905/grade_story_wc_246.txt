<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and particular—she seeks to repair meaning while accepting uncertainty as method—and her choices (unbending the event, planting spiral-questions) arise credibly under pressure. The internal contradiction (“confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied her hand”) is dramatized rather than told. Cost is modest but present: power drain, gravity slackening, and the accepted burden of future echoes. Relationship pressure is mostly with the cosmos, not another person, keeping the crucible largely internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly flare → pen activation → contingent-filament editing → reweighted scroll and final stance. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (station dims, gravity shifts, acceptance of echoing edits). Because/therefore linkage is soft but coherent within the taught rules. The ending’s charged poise (“I am listening”) reweights options without false neatness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and objects are integrated and constraining: the anomaly’s physics alter stakes and options; the pen functions as a rule-bound tool; the comm-garden shapes tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (recycled air, dimming lights, stuttering gravity). World rules are consistent and learned through action (filaments, quantum buffer, contingency-as-ink). The final image is charged by place and tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring legible communication and reconfiguring a prior mistake—is signaled early and tightened by the anomaly’s flare and the dated‑tomorrow coordinates. Escalation proceeds via a decisive action (unbending the event) that exacts a price in station resources and future vigilance. The conflict remains primarily internal/procedural, so the felt peril is gentle, but the cadence shift is clear. Resolution is earned by her stance change rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around uncertainty as a disciplined practice, not a shrug; motifs (seeds, gardening, filaments, lullaby) evolve meaningfully to support that idea. The mentor’s line risks explicitness but feels earned by context. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: “strange comfort translated into bone” and planting spiral questions embody the philosophy. Ambiguity remains purposeful without muddying.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with technical lexicon that fits the character’s mind and station milieu. Psychic distance is stable; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates aptly from descriptive density to charged poise at closure. Dialogue is minimal but the few lines (“I am listening”) carry weight and subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent metaphors; lines often do multiple jobs (worldbuilding and emotion). Occasional lushness skirts purple but stays legible and purpose-driven. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates slow momentum. The final third is clean and focused, preserving the closure image’s clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—comm-garden, contingent filament editing, a history‑editor’s pen that writes absence—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without losing clarity. The reweighting of “wrong seeds” to “early fertilizer” is a non‑obvious, meaningful turn. Emotional truth lands through specific images rather than thesis.</comment>
