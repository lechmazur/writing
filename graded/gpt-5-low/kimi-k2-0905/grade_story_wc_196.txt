<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rowan’s motive—to stay for the stipend but truly to seek proof that the past wasn’t waste—reads specific and contradictory, and her micro-choices (dust-reading, database entry, placing the button with a note) align. The embodied details (smells, textures) ground emotion. The cost is subtle (risking professional detachment and reopening personal loss) rather than overt, trimming peak impact. Still, her final stance is earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: discovery → recognition → ritualized reading → archival act → snow-toned charged poise. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: “archives are futures disguised as pasts” becomes operational when she files the button with marching orders for whoever comes next. The cost is felt conceptually and emotionally, if muted externally. Orientation is clean from the first line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The file room, dust, lamp, and snow are vivid and POV-filtered, with sensory precision that accrues meaning. The environment and objects constrain choices (she uses proper archival tools and procedure) and charge the final image (button afterimage; snow as small-kindness accumulation). The specificity remains purposeful without museum-tour excess. Setting is inseparable from theme and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (can one act of care redeem the archive and her past?), and pressure tightens from found object to committed act (placing the button with a directive note). The escalation is primarily internal and textural; there’s no external counterforce or concrete risk, which slightly softens price clarity. Nonetheless, the choice forecloses detachment and reweights her work’s purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: dust as script, “Unknown, but breathing,” and snow as accruing kindnesses culminate in a non-didactic answer about making futures from neglected pasts. The final images reprice earlier material without sermonizing. A couple of thesis-forward lines (“archives are futures disguised as pasts”) flirt with overt statement but remain earned by action. Resonance lingers through the button’s afterimage and the spoken name.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close carries a consistent, character-apt diction (archival precision married to elegiac sensibility). Rhythm and syntax modulate well; metaphors feel organic to Rowan’s attention. No head-hopping; stance stays steady. Occasional heightened phrasing skirts purple but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: strong verbs, layered images doing multiple jobs, and purposeful compression. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and disciplined; no loops or scaffolding bog momentum. A few high-register flourishes risk density, yet clarity holds and propulsion fits a quiet piece. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of foster-care bureaucracy with archival ritual, dust-reading as divination, and a wartime button as conduit feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The narrative avoids template beats, advancing an original ethical calculus about custodianship and kindness. Risk-taking in method and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The closing reweights the premise with memorable specificity.</comment>
