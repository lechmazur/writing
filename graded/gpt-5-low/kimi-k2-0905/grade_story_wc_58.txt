<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained: she seeks the “geography of healing” and chooses to kneel, wind, name, and finally plant the thread. Interiority is vivid though largely assured; there’s little on‑page hesitation or contradictory impulse before surrendering the thread. The cost—ending her vocation—is felt but the struggle toward it is smooth, not contested. Still, actions align with motives and the final renunciation reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the thread shortens, presences surface, self appears, and she plants the final inch. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with Earned Stasis—she gives up the tool and role, empties the notebook, and reenters the world changed. Cost is legible on the page (“notebook empty... work complete”), and orientation is clean from the outset. The beat‑to‑beat because/therefore chain is lyrical but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden is specific and functional: leaves pattern words, shadows become portals, the fountain grounds action, and the ship horn times the ending. Environment charges the final image without devolving into postcard description. Sensory balance is mostly visual, but the setting’s rules are consistent and discovered through action. Strong integration though not fully constraining tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on release versus retention: each turn tightens via the thread’s diminishing length and the mounting apparitions. The reversal when her own younger self emerges is a clear deepening that narrows options, leading to the planting choice. Cost is the surrender of her instrument and identity; pressure remains internal but coherent under the chosen lens. Escalation is subtle yet undeniable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motifs (thread, leaves, portals) evolve into a resonant answer about presence within absence. However, several explicit thesis lines (“about the lonesome splendor of choosing one’s own ending,” “courage to be witnessed”) overstate what the images already earn, edging into moralizing. Subtext otherwise operates well in the reconfigured memories. The ending image reweights prior material convincingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyrical signature; diction and rhythm suit the meditative pressure. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Voice remains confident without head‑hopping or register drift. Minor explicit theme statements are more a thematic than a voice control lapse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are elegant, image‑dense, and largely precise; the thread/leaf imagery carries multiple jobs. Some repetition and abstract phrasing soften momentum, and a few sentences tilt toward pronouncement. No muddled metaphors or cadence failures in the peak beat; overall clarity and propulsion hold. Small trims could further sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise—living obituaries as maps to healing via a palace weft thread—is fresh and synthesized with unusual coherence. The final self‑reveal as first client feels both surprising and inevitable. Risks in structure and trope blending heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The recurring object and environment recharge the ending image with genuine ingenuity.</comment>
