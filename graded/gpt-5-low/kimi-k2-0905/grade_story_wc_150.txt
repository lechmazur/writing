<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Her motive—rebuilding a shattered faith—drives concrete choices (kneeling to whisper the hymn, excavating, using the rib as gnomon), and the earned renunciation at the end (“She never left the island again”) lands as real cost. Interiority is embodied via tactile noticing (fossilized petals, myrrh air) rather than labels. Minor shortfall: limited on‑page contradiction under pressure; the boy’s challenge pricks but doesn’t force a fraught trade‑off beyond the final staying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with a causal spine: discovery → alignment rituals → reliquary → root‑road → dawn activation → rebuilt chapel. Closure is on‑page and costly (decisive rebuild plus the life choice to remain). Orientation is clean from the first lines; set‑ups pay off (sundial base, hymn, mirrors, rib as gnomon).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and bone‑root ecology both constrain and enable action (root arches direct them; bones supply the gnomon). Sensory and object specificity charge the ending image (shadow animating ruins; bell ringing without a tongue). The world’s rules feel consistent and learned through doing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (restore faith/prayer house) with one meaningful tightening: the reliquary hum and root‑road catalyze the dawn choice that can’t be retaken. The price is a life reoriented to this place. Tension is more devotional than perilous, but pressure coheres and gathers toward the sunrise act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of restitution, diaspora return, and colonial desecration emerge through particulars and ritual rather than argument. “Interrupted journeys” refracts through mirrors and ancestor‑roots, then reweights in the final receiving of travelers. The ending’s breath‑not‑thunder returns faith without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are steady and textured without drift. Dialogue is spare but functional and subtextual (boy’s “rebuild or rob?”). Psychic distance remains stable; patterned elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (rib as gnomon = faith rebuilt through bones). Figurative language is lush but coherent and purposeful; no loops or scaffolding. Cadence shifts appropriately at key beats (dawn rebuild, bell without tongue) to accelerate clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—catacomb orchard, mirrors of diaspora, sundial rib—feels singular and inevitable by the sunrise turn. Risks in tone and mythic logic heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration reads fresh and earned.</comment>
