<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Garnet’s motive—obedience tipping into invention—is clear, embodied, and drives every micro‑choice from picking the lock to deceiving Voss. The internal contradiction (sentinel vs. saboteur) is present and dramatized rather than told. Luce and Voss apply targeted pressure that sharpens her choices. Minor note: her competence faces few setbacks, so struggle reads slightly cushioned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout → sundial code → infiltration → seed‑light → Voss interruption → misdirection → chain‑room transfer → barges free → dawn reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with the barges drifting and the fort “unlocked,” a decisive before/after. The cost is conceptual (identity risk, institutional betrayal, live danger) rather than bodily, but it’s felt in the mask removal and the deception scene. Orientation is precise from the start; lens reads primarily causal with lyric inflection.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort, blackout, and sky‑barges are not postcard details; they constrain stealth tactics, enable the plan, and charge the final image. Tools/objects (quill holder, generator, sundial) operate as micro‑settings that shape choices. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through Garnet’s priorities. World rules (aether, gears, chain‑room) remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (spark a silent revolution) is signaled early and tightens through the interrupted generator scene. The Voss reversal forces a tactical pivot (false report) that narrows options and risks exposure. Stakes pay off in the barges’ release and the fort’s reconfiguration at dawn. The price is more implied than dramatized in flesh, but tension runs at sentence and beat levels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of light versus imposed “ink,” obedience turning to invention, accrues through specific objects and actions, culminating in the charged dawn. Subtext often lives in gesture (the mask drop, the waltzing gears) and the reweighted fort. However, “Tell the ministry that their ink has dried; we write tomorrow with light” edges into thesis articulation and slightly flattens the resonance. Even so, the final image largely earns its aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature and clean focalization; dialogue is minimal but purposeful and carries subtext. Diction fits the world (aether, gnomon, quill holder) and the cadence modulates under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance drift. A touch of elevated flourish risks sameness in texture but rarely blurs clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with strong verb choices; images often do double duty for world and emotion. Figurative language is frequent yet mostly coherent, and momentum seldom stalls. One or two grand abstractions (“the face of every child…”) flirt with purple but do not obscure cause/effect. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding artifacts impede the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Steampunk‑adjacent elements feel newly combined: a half‑painted sundial as code, a bronze quill holder as spanner, “cradle of sparks” as both ethos and mechanism. Turns arise from character tactics rather than late rule drops. The final reweighting (fort unlocked in every sense) is earned and memorable. While the rebellion frame is familiar, the specific synthesis reads fresh and intentional.</comment>
