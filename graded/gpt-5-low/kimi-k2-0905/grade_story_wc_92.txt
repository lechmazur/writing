<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Garnet’s motive (“stand, watch, report nothing; instead… spark a silent revolution”) drives decisive, escalating choices, including deceiving Voss. Interiority is vivid and embodied (mask, breath, “cradle of sparks”), though internal contradiction is light; she is largely resolved rather than torn. The Luce relationship functions as crucible without overshadowing her agency. The final renunciation (dropping the mask) credibly forecloses obedience.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout → meeting → sundial code → lockpick → seed transfer → Voss interruption → barges free → dawn reconfiguration. Closure lands with a decisive change (fort unlocked, barges adrift) and a resonant reweighting of power. Cost is mostly conceptual (risk, deception, repudiation), not a concrete loss, which slightly limits impact. Orientation is solid from the opening image; the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere and tool-as-setting are richly integrated: the luminous fort, blackout, chain-room, aether, and sky-barges constrain and enable tactics at every beat. The bronze quill holder and sundial function as environmental levers and charge the final image. Sensory specificity and world rules are taught through action, not exposition. The returning breeze and light shift the fort from prison to commons, powering the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ignite revolution/free barges) is signaled early and tightens with Voss’s arrival and the risky misdirection. The reversal (killing the seed to pass its “heartbeat” to Luce) shows adaptive tactics under pressure. A visible price is implied in risk and the irreversible stance shift, though no concrete sacrifice lands on the page. Tension scales coherently to the charged dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Light versus ink/obedience reframes into invention and communal ownership; motifs (quill, sundial, “cradle of sparks”) evolve toward a re-authored future. Subtext operates through objects and hush more than speech. The line “Tell the ministry that their ink has dried” drifts toward thesis-stating, softening subtlety near the end. The final image (mask dropped, fort unlocked) resonates without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is lush, controlled, and character-filtered; diction and syntax carry a consistent conspiratorial hush. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with subtext and action value. Psychic distance remains stable within Garnet’s lens; no head-hopping. Rhythmic modulation under pressure is confident and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language (“star caught in a jar”) that advances scene and theme. Occasional metaphor stacking skirts purple but remains coherent and cadence-aware. No scaffold loops or cadence templates drag momentum. Syntax varies to serve propulsion at key turns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a steampunk polity where a bronze quill holder is both relic and tool, a half-painted sundial encodes sabotage, and “cradle of sparks” bridges metaphor and mechanism. Turns feel earned by character choice and established world logic. Risks in tone and imagery pay off at closure. The vision reads singular rather than stitched.</comment>
