<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s motive is clear and particular—new heart, new drive—and his micro‑choices (catching the wing mid‑fall, following sun trails, opening the flask, knotting the thread) reveal values under pressure. Interiority is embodied (terror/tenderness in the borrowed pulse) with credible contradiction. The recognition of why some people “magnetize stories” reads earned by on‑page experience. Slight tilt toward a stated insight keeps this just short of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: tea house → bridge crisis/vision → meadow discovery → absorption → return, delivering a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Costs are emotional and conceptual, scaled to length, and the journey’s because/therefore links are coherent. However, the final line truncation (“—an ir”) blunts the closure image and cadence. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: rope ladders, floating rock tea house, sun trails, and bridges all guide action and constrain choices. The blue morpho wing as tool/object‑as‑setting charges the final image, and weather/mist dynamics shape mood and movement. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action. Slight cap due to the global final‑third artifact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal—finding the donor’s final tale to understand story‑magnetism—with one strong tightening when the wing falls and yields the miners’ vision. The methodical tracking and the flask’s release of voices deepen pressure toward the absorption moment. Cost is felt but quiet; the piece favors deepening over hard reversal, which fits the lens but limits intensity. Consequences carry into the return image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: story as exchange, bodies as vessels, and hollows that invite narratives. Recurring images (wing, sun trails, thread) shift meaning by the end, with the wing becoming a lamp to guide future travelers. One explicit thesis line (“He understood then why…”) slightly reduces subtextual power, but the surrounding images do the heavy lifting. The aftereffect is tender and reflective without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with Kael’s sensibility; sensory selection fits a dye master’s attention to color and texture. Distance control is steady; the single line of dialogue is effective and characterful. Patterned diction is purposeful and legible. A minor cadence bruise from the truncated last word prevents higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong—dense yet purposeful images, varied rhythm, and high information per sentence. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains controlled. The final line is truncated (“—an ir”), an artifact in the closing beat that dampens cadence and image resolution. Otherwise concise with minimal scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High originality in the synthesis of sky‑isles, a dye master’s lexicon, sun‑trail cartography, and a morpho wing as compass/lamp. The donor‑heart premise is reimagined with surprising yet inevitable turns (the wing drinking voices). Risks feel organic, not gimmicky. The closure image would be exceptional if not for the clipped final word.</comment>
