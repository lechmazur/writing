<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mireya’s motives and competence are vivid and consistent, and her invitation to Corin is a decisive, character‑driven turn. Interiority is embodied through tactile tools and thermal “breath,” avoiding label‑speak. The compromise (70/30) crystallizes her ethic under pressure with a felt cost (defying the Council, risking sabotage). Corin’s shift undercuts a simple hero/obstructor dynamic and reframes their relationship as the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: measurement → spectro finding (3.7 mm) → confrontation → collaborative recalibration → on‑time installation → public test. The closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the gate quivers between open and shut, with both factions witnessing the controlled breath. Cost is legible (political risk, altered specs, fragile alliance). The final sentence is truncated, a minor textual seam that slightly blurs the last beat but doesn’t break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The amphitheater‑volcano “breathing” world rules constrain tactics (37‑second cadence) and charge the final image of regulated breath. Tools (chain, spectroscope) are integrated as micro‑settings with agency. Sensory detail is selective and pressure‑aligned (sulfuric sighs, steam curtains) rather than touristic. The environment shapes choices throughout, not just as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are tight from the outset (seal vs. irrigation) and escalate with the Gardener’s threat, then deepen via the collaborative solution under a dawn deadline. The meaningful narrowing comes with the calibrated 70/30 compromise and syncing to the volcano’s breath. The price is emotional/political rather than bodily, but it’s present and alters future options. A sharper on‑page repercussion from either faction would push this higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Encrypted compassion” is not mere rhetoric; it’s enacted by decoding data into an ethic of shared risk and benefit. Recurring images (chain as boundary/bridge; breath as regulation) reweight meaning at the end. The piece resists moralizing, letting the duet and the quivering gate answer the question. Slight neatness in the 70/30 ratio brushes the edge of tidy but stays grounded in scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is texturally confident and consistent with a machinist‑poet’s perception; dialogue is minimal, pointed, and changes the situation. Diction (“language of teeth,” “dappled resolve”) feels earned rather than grafted. Rhythm modulates well under pressure. A few high‑ornament lines approach purple but maintain clarity and POV coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with strong verbs and concrete objects; imagery is vivid and largely coherent. Occasional density (“slyly heartfelt,” “nervous confession”) risks over‑saturation in places. The truncated final sentence is a noticeable seam in the last beat. Overall momentum holds and syntax varies, keeping propulsion intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—volcano as lung, machinist engineering a moral compromise via envelope adhesive and an antique chain—feels fresh and specific. The bridge/boundary transformation is memorable, and the cadence‑tuned gate is an elegant non‑obvious turn. Risks (lyric texture + procedure) cohere and heighten stakes. Minor conventional beats (council vs. guild) are elevated by execution.</comment>
