<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mireya’s competence and motive are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (decoding, singing, proposing the cycle) align with her values. However, interior contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or reveals conflicting impulses under pressure. The delegation’s presence applies external pressure but doesn’t expose a sharper internal cost. Still, her method and reverence for tools reveal character distinctly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative texture) holds: adhesive → coordinates → keystone → lullaby → acoustics-mediated compromise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the amphitheater’s harmony transforms discourse, and the cycle proposal forecloses absolute victory. Cost is present but modest (both sides accept limits; Mireya commits to an ongoing mediator role). Orientation is crisp from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The volcano amphitheater is integral: breathing air guides the decoding and the music’s function, and acoustics tangibly shape tactics and outcome. Sensory specificity and professional noticing are excellent and purposeful (copper tint, pollen, obsidian, tuning-fork tremor). The final image returns to place and tool, charging the setting with meaning. High craft with setting as operative constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (prevent bloodshed; river’s fate), and pressure tightens with the delegations’ arrival and the single-shot decoding act. The lullaby’s activation is a meaningful deepening that changes options from debate to embodied listening. The price is a compromise rather than a triumph, though the danger of violence remains mostly implied. Escalation remains coherent and protagonist-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Compassion-as-system and harmony-as-mediation emerge organically through object and place, not lecture, culminating in a reweighted end image. The “trust ingenuity more than victory, compassion more than decree” line edges toward explicit moralizing in the final paragraph, slightly dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the lullaby’s function and the moon-breath cycle carry the theme with emotional honesty. Symbols (chain, breath, copper) evolve rather than decorate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely held to Mireya is stable and confident; diction and rhythm fit her perceptual signature (tool-minded, material-aware). Sentences modulate with scene pressure without head-hopping or register slips. Dialogue is minimal but the reported exchanges read cleanly. Recurrent phrasing (“dappled resolve”) is controlled rather than tic-like.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines do multiple jobs with efficient imagery; figurative choices are coherent and tactile. Lushness is balanced by momentum—steps, chain, socket, tube—avoiding paraphrase loops or scaffolding. A few elevated turns risk mild over-sheen but don’t impede clarity or pace. The closing cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Encrypted compassion” embodied in acoustics, adhesive forensics, and a surveyor’s chain is striking and specific. The mediation-by-architecture turn feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Bold, cohesive synthesis without gimmickry; only the slightly tidy resolution tempers the shock of newness. Overall, memorable and publication-ready in concept.</comment>
