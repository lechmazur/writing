<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mercy’s curiosity and tenderness motivate each step cleanly, and her occupational habits (“tenderly organized”) pay off as capability. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets each threshold with near-frictionless competence. The identity shift into “keeper of the spiral” lands, but the emotional price is implied more than contested. A single on‑page hesitation or competing duty would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear because/therefore chain: coin → cipher → drawer → map → targeted dig → descent and sealing. Closure lands on the page with cost: she shuts herself below as the surface locks, assuming a charged, altered role. The causal thread holds without teleporting props, and set‑ups (chess clock, spiral, tapestry) pay off. Minor softness: the puzzle solves smoothly, reducing felt jeopardy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cemetery, marble lamb, and cobalt silo are vivid and tactically determinative (ladder, skylight, hidden drawer, iron rungs, locking door). Objects constrain choices and charge the final image, especially the silo sealing as she descends. POV bias is consistent with a gardener’s attention to tools, threads, and seed packets. Sensory detail is economical yet lush without disorientation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unfolding the dead’s intention) is signaled early and tightens through the cipher and map to a consequential descent. Escalation is primarily discovery‑driven; resistance is low but the final lock supplies tangible cost. Agency drives each turn rather than coincidence solving pressure. A single complication or false lead could raise pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonant motifs—memory vs hours, gardening as stewardship, and the spiral—cohere into a meditation on tending the past. The final role acceptance reweights the premise without a didactic moral. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“The living wager hours, the dead wager memory”; labeled seed packets) which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the images carry genuine emotional charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third‑person lyric voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent with Mercy’s sensibility; diction choices feel purposeful. Patterned phrases (velveteen gloom, chess clock) are taught early and reprise cleanly. Distance remains steady; inference stays within plausible knowledge. Minor risk of ornamental elevation, but it serves tone rather than showboating.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet mostly multi‑tasking; images carry plot and theme without redundant scaffolding. A few near‑purple touches and explicit labels nibble at momentum, but clarity remains high. Rhythm varies and supports turns (cipher work, drawer reveal, descent). No loops or muddled metaphors impair the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a gardener in a glass‑roofed missile silo, tapestry‑cipher keyed by a coin, and a chess‑clock night reframed into custodianship of memory. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight because each object is re‑used rather than introduced late. The closing “infinite” clock is a bold, fitting reframing. Risks in imagery and structure heighten rather than obscure stakes.</comment>
