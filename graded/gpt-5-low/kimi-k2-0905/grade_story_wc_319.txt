<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular, with credible contradictory impulses (guardian vs. feral, paw vs. hand) driving micro‑choices like licking the sundial and yielding to being “interiorized.” Motivation—learning to “wait within the questions” and befriend uncertainty—intensifies and culminates in a costly self‑redefinition. The emotional turn is earned through repeated tactile engagements (rose, perimeter, sundial) rather than abstract declaration. A slight remove from concrete interpersonal pressure keeps the crucible purely internal, limiting ceiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: recurring objects and sensations (mist, pendant, sundial) ratchet the pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page when the pendant cracks and she accepts dissolution into attendance—an earned stasis with felt cost (identity surrendered, prowling foreclosed). Orientation is clear early (feral guardian, frozen garden at night), and the ending image cleanly reframes the premise. The before/after is legible in the shift from guarding books to guarding boundaries as self.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden, mist, sundial, and ice‑bound rose are vividly tactile and integrated with action, not mere backdrop. Environment directly shapes choices and the final image, e.g., the shadowless sundial and the ice preserving the rose’s “exterior” dramatize the central method. Sensory range (taste of iron and parchment; breath as commas) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. World rules stay consistent within the lyric’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate around whether she endures uncertainty as absence or attendance; pressure deepens through thicker mist, the pendant heating, and the sundial’s refusal to cast a shadow. The key tightening is her decision to stop prowling and let the garden interiorize her—foreclosing the old identity. Cost is visible in the self‑dissolution and abandonment of “guardian” as role. Escalation is more textural than adversarial but remains coherent and cumulative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete motifs—waiting as attendance, interiorizing exteriors, homesickness reframed as arrival—without relying on expository moralizing. The final light “that had forgotten it was light” reweights the central concept with poignancy. A couple of lines skate close to thesis‑statement (“To make friends with uncertainty…”), but the surrounding scene work earns them. Resonance lingers via the boundary/membrane imagery tied to cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and a stable close third POV; the perceptual signature (cataloguer feral, commas of breath) remains coherent. Diction modulates under pressure (perimeter counting, heat branding, cracking pendant) without register drift. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off at closure. Sparse dialogue lines carry subtext rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet mostly precise; sentences carry multiple jobs and propel the accumulative cadence. Figurative density is high but patterned and legible, with few redundancies. A minor risk of purple tilt is managed by tactile anchors (paw/hand, frostbite, metal taste). No loops or template cadence undercut closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—feral librarian, pendant, boundaries of light, interiorizing exteriors—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, especially in the final repricing of “waiting.” Familiar motifs (guardian, cultist) are transformed into a precise metaphysic. The closing reconfiguration is fresh and memorable.</comment>
