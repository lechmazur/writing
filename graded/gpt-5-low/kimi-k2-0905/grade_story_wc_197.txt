<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s motive and tactics are clear and consistent, with concrete micro-choices (timing drones, threading tape, wiring the ringer). Interiority is embedded in sensory attention (boardwalk, puddles) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is light—she’s resolute more than torn—so complexity under peak pressure is somewhat limited. The ending shows credible cost (hands raised, risk of arrest) earned by prior choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp by the first lines (who/where/when anchored), and causality holds: drones reappear → sprint → booth activation → broadcast → confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the city’s soundscape is reweighted with a cost on the page. The “because/therefore” chain stays intact without convenience, and the final hesitation by officers pays off the build. No loose props or rule slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon, starlight reflections, and phone booth are not decorative—they constrain tactics (puddle-map navigation, timing via Orion) and charge the final image. Environmental rules stay consistent and are learned through action. The glowing surface becoming a “path” reweights the stakes at closure. Tool/body/object integration (key, reels, copper) further roots setting in choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: reclaim erased histories under active surveillance. Escalation tightens through concrete beats (reappearance of drones, sprint, threading/azimuth adjustments, citywide patch-in) and culminates in a visible price (exposure, surrender posture). Agency drives turns; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. One more on-page hazard or trade-off inside the booth could have sharpened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres—memory vs. institutional indifference—through specific actions (reverse-broadcasting truth via copper). Subtext accrues via images (Morse starlight, puddle frequencies) rather than exposition. The aphorism “Indifference is a lock; memory is the key” tilts toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing subtlety. Final reconfiguration lets the city “hear itself,” offering earned resonance beyond a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close with a confident, lyric texture maintains consistent distance and bias through Mira’s perceptions. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head-hopping. Elevated imagery fits the piece’s coded/techno-lyric frame. A few lines flirt with ornate compression, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with strong cadence and sparse scaffolding. Figurative density is high but coherent to the motif (phones/copper/starlight/signal). No disruptive loops or mixed metaphors; momentum is maintained through syntax variety. Minor purple notes don’t blur causality or the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: revised histories broadcast backward, starlight-as-signal puddle maps, an obsolete booth weaponized into a public counter-archive. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the seeded objects and rules. Risk-taking in conceit and image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final auditory reclamation of erased voices lands as both concept and feeling.</comment>
