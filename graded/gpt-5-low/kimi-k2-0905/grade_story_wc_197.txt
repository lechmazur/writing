<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—reclaiming erased voices—drives every choice, and her resourcefulness reads particular (timing drones by Orion, azimuth tweaks). Interiority is clear if a touch idealized; fear and resolve co-exist but rarely complicate each other in scene. The grandmother thread personalizes the stakes without digression. The final stance (hands raised, broadcast launched) feels earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: drones reappear → sprint → key/maintenance mode → discovery of backward broadcasts → rewiring to emergency tower → confrontation. Closure lands as a charged poise: she triggers the citywide ring at personal risk, and the officers’ hesitation marks a real reconfiguration. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when clear), and no key setup breaks. A slight plausibility stretch in the tech remains within established world rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon, boardwalk, booth, drones, and starlight are integrated as constraints and resources (puddle-map navigation, Orion timing, spotlight pressure). The environment actively shapes tactics and charges the closing image (puddle reflection reveals a new map). Sensory choices are purposeful and filtered through Mira’s priorities. World rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate: secrecy to exposure, retrieval to public broadcast. The drones’ return tightens options, and wiring the booth to the emergency tower is a bold escalation with risk of arrest. The ending doesn’t resolve safety but crystallizes consequence through the officers’ hesitation. A single deepening beats multiple reversals and reads earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of resistance to institutional erasure emerges through action and image (reels, backward broadcasts, puddle-map). The final chorus and city’s self-recognition reweight prior motifs without over-explaining. The on-the-nose line “Indifference is a lock; memory is the key” slightly telegraphs the thesis but remains justified as diegetic propaganda. Subtext in lullabies and erased footsteps lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—technical precision alongside imagistic noticing—without head-hopping. Diction is controlled and consistent with Mira’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well at stress points (sprint, booth activation). No stance slippage or unearned certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density and momentum; images do multi-duty. Occasional flourish edges toward purple but stays coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy; syntax varies to fit pressure. Mechanics are clean, and the final cadence lands without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—revised histories broadcast backward, puddle-reflection cartography, a TelStar key—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric-tech hybrid, conceptual closure) pay off cleanly. Specific details (azimuth, emergency tower reroute) ground the speculative premise. The closing reconfiguration offers a memorable, non-obvious turn.</comment>
