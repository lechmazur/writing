<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Calla’s motive and tactics are clear and character‑specific (music as agency; the shell as memory), with embodied perception (“tasted of iron and apricot”). Internal contradiction is present but light—the “gap between knowing and understanding” is evocative yet doesn’t force a fraught trade‑off. Her competence borders on ease, so struggle is brief and cost is mainly relinquishment (shell dissolves, bridge gone) rather than a bruising moral price. Still, micro‑choices under pressure (skipping every fourth beat; playing the lullaby backward; uprooting the seed) feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene causal chain is tight: music disrupts statues, access opens, seed is uprooted, orchard transforms. Closure lands decisively on the page with cost (shell sacrificed; bridge dissolves; Calla leaves), and the final image reconfigures meaning (statues become trees; rumor replaces presence). Orientation is clean from the first sentence; no teleports or soft resets. The drive lens reads predominantly causal with a lyrical finish, held coherently to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard/bridge/statues are vivid and functional—patrolling guardians and the swaying glass span constrain movement and tactics. The locust shell’s veins mapping to cables ties micro‑setting to action; the bridge parts like water to yield the seed. Environment charges the final image (bridge into dawn ribbon; statues rooting as trees). Sensory selection is purposeful beyond the visual (iron/apricot taste; clanking footfalls).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the orchard’s living beauty) is signaled early and escalates through concrete turns: rhythmic signaling, lullaby inversion, seed extraction. Resistance from the statues is brief but coherent and answered by adaptive tactics. The price is felt more in relinquishment than harm, so pressure is strong rather than punishing. The cadence shift at closure tightens options (no bridge to return across; she departs) credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Breaking free” evolves from gardener’s molt to orchard’s exhale to a child’s seed, with the shell reweighted as memory‑map and then sacrifice. Subtext of beauty vs. mechanism stays in image and action, not thesis; the heartbeat motif becomes communal rather than individual. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (beauty propagates as rumor and seed). No sermonizing; ambiguity invites reread without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person is controlled and particular, with consistent perceptual signature and measured rhythmic variation. Elevated diction matches the fable‑like register without slipping into abstraction at peak beats. Purposeful compression (e.g., gravity reversal) is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and momentum; images often do double duty (music as physiology and politics). Figurative language is lush but largely coherent; a few stacked metaphors flirt with excess without clouding action. No scaffolding loops or cadence templates; syntax varies to fit pressure. The final image is clean and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sky‑bridge violinist + locust‑memory map + mechanical orchard yields a distinctive synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The method (arrhythmic heartbeat signaling) and reversal (backward lullaby) refresh familiar “music‑as‑magic” tropes. The closing rumor/seed transmission reframes heroism with quiet ingenuity. Risks in imagery and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
