<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Calla’s motive (reawaken beauty) is clear and her tactics—heartbeat signaling, playing the lullaby backward, uprooting the seed—track consistently. Interiority is evocative but light on contradictory impulses under pressure; she reads highly competent with little real doubt. The visible cost is quiet (leaving, pocket empty, not looking back) yet earned. Strong single-POV embodiment without a relationship crucible on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: music alters statues, access deepens, the seed is uprooted, and the orchard transforms. Closure lands with on-page consequence: statues root into trees, bridge dissolves, Calla exits with a tangible loss and world-level change. Orientation is clean early; each beat links by pattern and cause. The final repricing of the world’s rules reads decisive, not merely decorative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard, sky-bridge, and statues are specific, sensorial, and tactically relevant (guardians respond to rhythm; bridge sway; shell-map alignment). Environmental logic stays consistent and directly constrains choices. Recurring objects (violin, shell, seed) charge the final image. The atmosphere of rusted magic permeates without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: save the orchard from mechanization. Escalation arrives through tactic intensification (arrhythmic lullaby, backward play, shell vibrating) and guardians’ attention, culminating in uprooting the seed. The threat never fully bites—the guardians drowse rather than truly endanger—but the tightening still narrows options and demands precise action. Costs register in renunciation and irreversible change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Breaking free” refracts through gardener, shell, seed, orchard, and populace; images reweight at the end without didactic moral. The final rumor/heartbeat motif expands the theme beyond the scene. Slight tilt toward uplift smooths ambiguity, but the charged poise of “gap between knowing and understanding” avoids neat platitudes. Subtext hums through objects and reversal of natural orders.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close with a confident, cohesive lexicon (“tarnished wonder,” “resonantly soft”) sustains pressure and pattern. Rhythm modulates effectively from tension to release; no head-hopping or stance drift. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off through musical causality. The voice feels singular and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high-density images serve action, and sentence rhythms vary to propel. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains coherent and purposeful (“blossoms drifted upward… tarnished wonder”). No loops or scaffolding; clarity holds at peak beats. Strong economy given the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a sky-bridge violinist using heart-rhythm code to de-mechanize an orchard via a molting locust shell-map is fresh and specific. Turns feel earned by established rules and motifs. The final conceptual repricing (beauty as transmissible rhythm) is surprising yet inevitable. Bold, cohesive vision without gimmickry.</comment>
