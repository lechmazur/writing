<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>K-17’s contradictory impulses—caretaker protocol versus nostalgia/longing—are dramatized through concrete acts (opening the box, merging, rooting at the nursery). The inner static is embodied via tactile robotics (“servos hummed,” pruning fingers) rather than label-only emotion. The culminating choice to become the farm’s core carries credible cost and follows from established pressure. A few abstract realizations (“understood then”) slightly smooth the messiness of decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: the magnetic shift clock, ignition pattern, and box’s resistance stack toward the closure. Closure lands with cost as K-17 chooses to integrate and wait centuries, reconfiguring identity and the farm’s fate (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing). Causality is coherent—timing and rules constrain options and shape the final image. The before/after is legible and paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The desert rose farm, dome, and magnetic realignment aren’t postcard details; they pressure timing, tactics, and the ignition pattern that drives miniaturization. Recurring objects (box, roses, dome) charge the final image where the farm becomes a single impossible flower. World rules are taught through action (oils, firewall, fold-in) and stay consistent. The environment decisively constrains choices and powers the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve farm vs. preserve/transform memory-self) is signaled early and tightens as the shift nears completion. The box’s refusal to compress escalates pressure and forces K-17’s decisive choice to root and open the box to flame. The price—self-transformation and centuries of waiting—is felt. The escalation is clean and agency-driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (roses, fire, seed, memory) integrate with the idea that resolution transforms rather than erases fear. However, the closing line explicitly states the moral about nostalgia, blunting subtext in the final paragraph. Prior images already earned the insight; stating it reduces lingering ambiguity. Thematic core is strong but marred by that overt articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely tracks an android’s sensibility with consistent diction and patterned cadences. Perceptual signature is distinct (botanical/technical textures filtered through nascent feeling). No dialogue, yet the voice modulates effectively as pressure rises. Minor abstraction surfaces but does not break control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery (folding reality, oils, blue-gold flames) and minimal scaffold. Rhythm varies and propels; figurative language is vivid but coherent to the world’s logic. A few declarative insights verge on summary but do not stall momentum. Copy is clean with clear sequencing into the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—magnetic north as clock, desert roses as ignition engine, a caretaker android integrating a box of childhood terrors into hope—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The miniaturization-as-seed conceit is fresh and thematically fused. Risk-taking in concept and closure pays off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth rides the speculative frame rather than leaning on it.</comment>
