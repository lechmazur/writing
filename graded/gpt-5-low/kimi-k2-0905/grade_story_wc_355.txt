<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mirelle’s pacifism concretely governs tactics (refusing to force the lock; choosing resonance), and her interiority is embodied through the radio, safe, and fireworks. The “velvet patches over bullet holes she had never earned” gives a credible contradiction that shades her vow to carry others’ pain. Micro‑choices escalate—waiting, tuning, naming varieties, then singing back—showing a value hierarchy under pressure. The cost is conceptual but legible: she pledges to carry the archive “in her bloodstream.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each tuned frequency deepens pressure toward the clasp opening. Closure lands on page (clasp sighs, mirror/poppy reprice the premise) with cost reframed as chosen burden. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when and the fireworks clock). If anything, the obstacle yields a touch smoothly, but the internalized price maintains stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop under stars, the safe, and the crystal radio function as micro‑setting constraints and tools, not mere décor. Fireworks and radio conditions shape tactics and cadence, and the diode’s glow charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑driven (stickers from munitions plants; guitar‑string coil). World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking a testimony without harm—is signaled early and tightened by the fireworks countdown and the diary’s “frequency.” The meaningful turn arrives when she sings back, converting curation into participation. The resolution is earned through her ethos rather than coincidence, though resistance is minimal and largely internal. The price—becoming an archive—reads, if quietly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Empathy as resonance emerges through concrete acts (tuning, naming silences, echoing the final hush) rather than thesis alone. Recurring images (safe/lock, radio, fireworks) reweight at the end with the mirror/poppy. A slight tendency to declare (“She would spend the rest of her nights teaching others…”) brushes sentimentality but doesn’t collapse subtext. The final exchange (“Thank you for hearing me home”) closes the theme without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—sound‑centric, tender, and precise—without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure (measured tuning vs. the fireworks’ surge). Diction is coherent to character and world; metaphoric weave stays in register. The felt line (“a voice—not heard but felt—”) shows confident distance control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; sentences propel rather than stall. Figurative language is frequent but coherent to the listening motif; no mixed metaphors that blur sense. Minimal scaffold or loops; the prose breathes at turns without slack. A few lines verge on purple, but clarity and momentum hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Using a crystal radio to “tune” silences and unlock a diary through empathy is an original, integrated conceit. The pacifist ethos transforms a familiar “opening the lock” beat into a nonviolent, sonic ritual with conceptual cost. Fireworks as peace’s noisy twin sharpen the counterpoint without gimmickry. The mirror/poppy reveal reconfigures meaning with inevitability in hindsight.</comment>
