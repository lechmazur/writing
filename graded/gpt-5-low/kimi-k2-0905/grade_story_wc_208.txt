<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maela’s motives (gift vs. geas; escape reimagined as arrival) are clear and embodied through tactile choices: wedging the slide, carving with the wood’s “memory,” and drowning the GPS. Interiority is specific to a craftswoman under storm pressure, with sensory bias and lived technique. The final renunciation is earned, with a felt cost in relinquishing technological certainty. A minor softness: the transformation borders smooth, but contradictory impulses (control/surrender; map/hand) do act concurrently on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: storm, slide, archway patterns densify into a charged reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page via the sculpture’s creation, the slide dissolving into wood, and the GPS refusal (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise), with conceptual cost legible. Orientation is clean from line one; no lens ambiguity. The final image reweights the premise (arch as ledger; Maela as scribe) without an explain‑everything coda.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storm‑tossed archway is not backdrop but instrument: a ledger that is activated, constrains sight, and shapes tactics (moon/lightning “duel,” tide line placement). Environmental forces pressure choices and charge the ending image (two voices: stone and sculpted). Tool‑and‑setting integration (chisel, skiff, slide) is tactile and purposeful. Specificity remains POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (whether to accept the slide’s call and recode her navigation), with a meaningful tightening as projections thicken and her pulse is recruited to the “gears.” Agency drives the turn: she commits to the carving method and later refuses the GPS, foreclosing a path. Cost is understated but present as surrender of technological assurance for a mythic, relational ledger. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but cadence shifts are decisive under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of reciprocity, ledgered rescue/debt, and craft as ethical attention emerge organically through action and recurring images (spiral, fleet, barnacles, wood curls as “words forgiven”). The ending offers a resonant answer—choosing unmarked maps and shared time over instrument certainty—without moralizing. Subtext in the sailors’ layered gestures enriches communal stakes over solitary genius. Ambiguity remains meaningful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice filters perception through a sculptor’s lexicon; rhythm flexes with pressure (turbine‑hum to hush). POV stays tight and confident without head‑hopping; inference reads as inference. Diction risks lushness but the pattern is taught early and remains legible. No dialogue needed; narrative texture carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; few if any scaffolds or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and patterned (spiral/ledger/turbine motifs) rather than mixed noise. Syntax varies and momentum tracks the scene’s intensification, then release. A slight purple edge in places, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis—storm‑arch as ledger, magic slide as stylus, craft as time‑alliance—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction, concept, and non‑mechanical closure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The turns arise from established logic rather than late rule drops. Specifics (whale‑rib slide, “gears of salt and starlight”) resist template echoes.</comment>
