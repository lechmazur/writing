<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maela’s motive (decide if the slide is gift or geas) is concrete and intensifies under storm pressure, culminating in the renunciation of GPS. Interiority is embodied through craft detail and scent, with contradictions (escape vs. arrival; tech vs. intuition) enacted rather than explained. Micro-choices (wedging the slide, carving “with memory,” leaving GPS drowned) reveal values with cost. The only limit is the relative absence of interpersonal pressure, but the single-POV crucible holds.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and sustained: storm → projection → carving → dissolution → navigation choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the slide fuses into the piece and she foregoes GPS, altering future options. Causality is clean; each beat organically triggers the next. The ledger/slide rule set is consistent and pays off on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway and tidal line constrain action and supply resources (projection surface, tidal placement) that shape outcome. The environment charges the final image (two voices: stone and sculpted), meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory specificity is rich and purposeful, filtered through Maela’s craft bias. World rules (arch as ledger) are learned via action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to engage the slide and what map to trust) tightens through the storm’s pressure and the projection’s increasing weight. The decisive act—embedding the slide and carving until it dissolves—forces a trade-off, culminating in the refusal of GPS. Stakes are primarily existential/identity rather than survival, but the cost is legible and reweights options. Escalation tracks with the accumulative lens rather than reversals, and it works.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: debt/rescue as ledger; escape reimagined as arrival; simplicity scaffolding complexity. The final image (two voices; unmarked map across her palms) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The “timewoven alliances” concept recasts history as participatory craft, deepening the piece’s ethical frame. Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with maritime/craft idiom sustains through pressure; POV distance stays stable and character-bound. Rhythm modulates with intensity, and motifs (“turbine-hum,” “ledger,” “spiral”) are patterned without over-explaining. No head-hopping or register drift; elisions are taught and paid off. The diction feels earned by the focalizer’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; minimal scaffold or loops. Figurative texture is lush but coherent and pattern-taught, avoiding mixed metaphors under peak pressure. Syntax varies with good propulsion; key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. Slight risk of saturation in metaphor density prevents a higher mark, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: arch as ledger, slide as stylus, alliances carved from absence, and navigation as ethical listening. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, grounded in craft and weather, not gimmickry. The risk of marrying occult mechanics to material sculpture pays off in the dissolution beat. Freshness persists at line and concept levels.</comment>
