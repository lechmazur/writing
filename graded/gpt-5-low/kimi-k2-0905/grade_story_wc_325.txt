<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to stand by the unremembered—meets a credible inner antagonist in her claustrophobia, which the text embodies through basalt “throat” and brine-thickened air. Micro‑choices (naming Sato, placing her glove over Voss’s) reveal values under pressure. Interiority stays concrete and character‑particular, avoiding label‑speak. Slight safety: aside from fear, flaws and conflicting desires remain narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: gold fleck → narrowing corridor → naming the fused crew → hand over trunk → reverse phase and emergence. Closure lands with cost: restoration achieved, but the obligation to remember reweights the world (“names repeating in her chest”). Orientation is clear from the outset and the causal chain is legible without patches. The only convenience—swift restoration—has groundwork in the gold fleck and Voss’s kept circuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: rusted bulkhead, living basalt, cable vault, and tide all constrain tactics and mood. The gold fleck functions as a micro‑setting/tool shaping movement and the final image. Sensory balance (steel, brine, volcanic glass) tracks stress and deepens immersion. World rules (phase transition via gold) are consistent and learned in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving the unremembered—tightens as the passage narrows and each named technician raises emotional cost. The key deepening is the realization that speaking names changes the state, culminating in the hand‑over‑hand reversal at the trunk. Price is endured (panic vs duty) and then reframed into ongoing responsibility. A touch more jeopardy or failure risk on a beat could heighten pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance as reanimation accrues through particular acts (naming as anchor, regret riding cables) and culminates in a resonant reweighting of “currency and love letters” with the dead. Subtext hums in “crashing hush” and the tide’s held-breath cadence. The near‑thesis line (“to stand by the unremembered is not to anchor them in sorrow…”) edges toward explicitness, slightly softening the afterglow. Overall, insight feels earned by scene pressure and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is assured, with a consistent undersea/electrical lexicon (“phase transition,” “copper veins,” “speed of regret”). Rhythm modulates with pressure, letting short, charged beats carry turns. Dialogue is minimal but precise (Voss’s whisper) and advances stakes. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images are fresh and coherent, sentences carry multiple jobs, and momentum never stalls. Figurative density is high but disciplined within a unified field (cables, brine, phase). No loops or scaffolding; paragraph rhythms breathe with the scene. The final cadence cleanly recharges prior motifs without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A striking synthesis: undersea infrastructure as haunted conduit, gold‑fleck codex as physics key, and remembrance enacted through names as material rescue. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (keeping the circuit open; the gold’s two‑way phase). Risks in voice and concept pay off without gimmickry. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
