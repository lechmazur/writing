<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation and inner stance are clear and particular—tender stewardship born of “mild obsession” becomes a resolved vocation. Interiority is embodied through tactile acts (shadow-ink, freezing the guard) rather than labels. The lack of pronounced internal contradiction keeps it just shy of great; she is certain early and never wavers. Still, the final renunciation—choosing the map over the world—is credible and paid for on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: each “summarized silence” thickens pressure, leading to the fort’s transposition into the booklet and the star’s extinguishing. Closure lands with cost—names carried off, the world flattened, the oracle confined to the paper fort—constituting a Conceptual Repricing with tangible loss. Orientation is clean from the first line, and the pattern is taught early and paid off. The “last star waiting for her signature” is a crisp causal hinge within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: storm, parapet, wet stone, and especially the “ambered hush” actively constrain sound and choice. The flaking gold-leaf booklet functions as micro-setting, ultimately containing the fort and charging the final image. Environmental rules stay consistent and evolve causally (hush, then its lifting). The final paper world is a powerful, setting-driven reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to make a navigable map of the dark) tightens as silences accumulate and the fort shrinks, culminating in the shadow-ink signature that forecloses the old world. Agency is steady and central; the guard beat proves her willingness to protect the fragile process. The price—erasure of names, isolation within the booklet—is unmistakable. Escalation is a controlled intensification consistent with an accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, memory, and the ethics of naming arise from concrete acts (mapping via silence) rather than pronouncements. The “ambered hush” evolves from atmosphere to ethic and finally to a charged cosmology. The ending reweights the whole: darkness becomes navigable community (“peopled with listening”) at a cost. No sermonizing; resonance lingers through images (afterimage on gold leaf) and choices.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with the oracle’s sensibility; syntactic rhythm modulates with pressure. Limited dialogue is purposeful and in-character. Diction remains coherent—elevated but earned by the mythic register. The patterned phrasing (“she summarized silence”) is intentional and supports cadence without obscuring sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is rich yet controlled; images are fresh and precise (“shadow pooled at her feet,” “flag snapped like a bone”). A few dense metaphoric clusters approach purple, but they remain legible and purposeful. Repetition of “ambered hush” works as motif rather than loop. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—mapping by “summarizing silence,” world transposition into a gold-leaf booklet, a star waiting for signature—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without confusion. The piece commits fully to its logic and pays it off with a novel closure image. It reads as a singular vision rather than a template.</comment>
