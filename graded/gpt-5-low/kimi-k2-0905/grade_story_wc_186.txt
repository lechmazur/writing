<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and persistent—rekindle the lamp to prove coincidence has meaning—and it coheres with her retrocognitive curse. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“boots crunching…,” “retro­cognition spill like hot metal”). Change at the end—she “became the new prism”—reads as an earned renunciation with cost. A deeper on‑page contradiction under pressure (hesitation, doubt during the hush) could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: missing shard → retrocog vision of child → desert retrieval under silence → return → assembly → ignition. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she becomes the prism; voices and rose light reprice coincidence). The accumulative lyric pattern holds without orientation debt. Stakes are resolved through her agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is intensely specific and functional: the humming glass pavilion, the brass console, malls overgrown, Joshua tree bones. Environment and objects constrain action (starlight alignment, lighthouse lens) and charge the final image. Sensory variety (sound as structural motif) deepens tone and stakes. The world’s rules feel consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens with the discovery of the missing shard and the desert’s imposed hush. The hush creates a decisive pressure beat that narrows options and marks cost. Escalation is primarily accumulative rather than antagonistic, but the retrieval-and-return cadence is effective. A sharper in‑scene trade‑off or failure before success would further heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—meaning wrested from coincidence, keeping a small light alive—emerges from concrete images (shards, starlight, voices backward) and culminates in a reweighted final image. The echo of saved voices ties personal motive to communal memory. Slight explicitness (“not accidents but refractions of one intention”) edges toward stating the thesis. Nonetheless, resonance lingers without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and character‑filtered, with controlled rhythm and fresh diction. POV distance stays stable and apt; no head‑hopping or unearned certainties. Patterned sound imagery (hum, moan, hush) is taught early and paid off at closure. Compression is confident without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful figurative language. No scaffold loops or template cadences; metaphors align with established motifs of light and sound. A few lush stacks flirt with purple but maintain clarity and propulsion. The final lines land cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The shard of hush, retrocognition as tactile time, and a lighthouse relit for meaning rather than ships feel original and integrated. The quest’s inevitability at closure reframes coincidence with a fresh angle. Risks in lyric world‑building pay off without obscuring sense. The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
