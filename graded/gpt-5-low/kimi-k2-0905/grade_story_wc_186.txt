<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motivation (rekindling to prove coincidence has meaning) and consistent traits (calling retrocognition a curse yet using it) drive choices. Embodied emotion is vivid in tactile encounters (the shard’s warmth, the sudden desert mute). Internal tension exists but stays subtle; a sharper moment of reluctance under pressure could deepen it. Final stance—becoming the “new prism”—reads earned with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: missing shard → retrocognitive vision → desert retrieval → reassembly → ignition. Orientation is crisp early, and the two-shard structure (pavilion/quest/return) lands a decisive on-page change. Cost is legible in the mute desert beat and the child’s death reframed at closure. The drive lens remains causal with lyric accumulation that pays off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and functional: the glass humming pavilion and Polaris alignment constrain tactics and charge the ending image. Environmental details (ruined malls, dunes, dawn humming) are filtered through purpose and pressure. The shard’s silence alters the world physically, not just atmospherically. Vivid without excess sprawl, with objects-as-setting integral to closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightens once the “missing shard” forces a quest and the hush imposes a palpable price. Escalation is primarily endurance and purpose-driven travel, culminating in a precise assembly choice under time/sky pressure. Consequences resonate thematically rather than via a direct adversary, which suits the lens. Slight ease in retrieval keeps it shy of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, coincidence as intention, and light as ethical persistence emerge organically from concrete acts. The ending reweights prior images, but the explicit articulation (“patterns exist, that no fall is final”) edges toward moralizing. Subtext still works through the rose lamp and the chorus of saved voices. Resonance lingers despite the slight overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature sustains across turns, with disciplined imagery and controlled distance. Voice aligns with the character’s mythic, ritualistic frame—no head-hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates effectively from questing cadence to the charged hush of closure. A hair breadth from excess in the final assertions but still cohesive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density and purposeful figurative language; line rhythms propel rather than bog down. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks; varied syntax and strong verbs keep momentum. A few lush images flirt with purple but remain coherent and earned by pattern. The final sentence lands cleanly on image and promise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “shard of hush” and retrocognition refract the lighthouse trope into a fresh, integrated system. Risks (lyric world-building in short form, silence as physical event) pay off and feel inevitable in hindsight. Specific, memorable details (vines over logos, Polaris alignment) distinguish it from genre cousins. Emotional truth meets conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
