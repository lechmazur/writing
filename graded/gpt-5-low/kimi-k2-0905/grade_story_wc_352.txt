<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (decades hunting “forgotten combinations”) and choices under pressure are legible (pressing the symbol; choosing the “third option”). Interiority is specific to her prism‑minded perception with embodied cues (iron‑tasting mist, synaptic blaze). The internal conflict is present but subtle—curiosity/rigor versus the cost of self‑translation—so the tension could sharpen earlier. Still, the final renunciation reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: inversion opens thresholds → doodle reveals lock → palm press releases combinations → self‑translation. Closure lands on the page with cost (she becomes the archive; grotto emptied; symbol inscribed). Orientation is clear by the first paragraph; the hour constraint frames the window even if not actively counted down. The chain is motivated and clean without late rule cheats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The serpentine, misted grotto and inverted gravity are vivid, multi‑sensory, and rule‑consistent; “glass breaking in reverse” and iron‑tasting strands stand out. Environment constrains action (passages exist only upside‑down) and charges the final image (bare shelves, repeating symbol). Details are purpose‑driven, filtered through Ilyra’s archival lens rather than tourist catalog. Strong atmospheric integration with functional stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—consumption vs custodianship vs a third, self‑erasing path—tightens as the doodle becomes a lock and the manuscript’s glow pulls her into the threshold. The decisive act is hers, with a visible price (identity translated). Pressure is primarily internal; the hour clock is present but underused as an active squeeze. Still, escalation reads as a focused deepening consistent with the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory/forgetting, vigilance, and authorship coalesce through recurring images (spirals, violet light, living calculation) rather than moralizing. The final conceptual reweighting—becoming the space between things—recasts prior motifs. A line or two edges toward abstraction, but the resonance is earned from concrete beats. Thematic complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent, lyric third‑person close with a distinctive perceptual signature (“prism‑minded,” “living calculation”). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Elevated language matches the conceit and stays within character plausibility. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with strong images and controlled rhythm; few wasted sentences. Occasional purple weight and repeated phrases (“threshold effects,” “forgotten combinations”) slightly risk redundancy, but do not blur causality. Syntax varies; metaphors largely cohere and support sense. Final cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—archivist as living equation in an inverted‑gravity grotto keyed by a luminous marginalia lock—feels fresh and singular. Risks (dense lyricism, conceptual stakes) heighten rather than obscure meaning, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight. Genre conventions are transformed via specific world‑rules and voice. High originality without gimmickry.</comment>
