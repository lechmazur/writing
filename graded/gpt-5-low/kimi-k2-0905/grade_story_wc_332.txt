<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mireya’s motive is vivid and coherent—retrieve a runaway dream to decode longing and restore erased voices—and her choices (going at dawn, greeting the “open book” sand, painting a corridor, taking the decisive photograph) align under pressure. The trade-off—risking a nameless memory—adds credible cost. Interiority is textured but remains lyric-distant, leaving contradictions (fear vs. compulsion) lightly sketched rather than dramatized in-body. Still, actions reveal values and the final endurance earns its shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: intention → dawn pursuit → painted light → shutter capturing the cipher → palette shatters/colors re-enter → library reconfigured. Closure lands on-page with cost and consequence (palette cracked, image transferred, voices restored). The horizon’s “movable” risk and timed dawn provide persistent constraints that shape tactics. Hybrid lens with causal dominance holds through the ending’s Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago is specific and operative: coral shelves, causeway runes, movable horizon, and the “open book” sand ridge actively shape choices and outcomes. Tools (palette, camera) function as micro-settings that constrain action at the peak. World rules are learned through use, not exposition, and the environment charges the final image (library shelves pulsing with coherent longing). Sensory detail is rich yet integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly set (capture the dream/decipher longing), and pressure tightens toward the sun’s rim and the paper-boat reveal. The decisive snap collapses options and exacts a price, transforming the world. Tension is more luminous than feral, but the cadence shift at the moment of capture provides a meaningful escalation. No coincidences resolve; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of longing, absence, and restoration emerge organically from image and act rather than thesis-speech. The cipher reweights meaning at the end, turning absence into a communal resource without sentimental flattening. A slight neatness in the communal restoration softens ambiguity, but the “luminous absence” persists in the checkoutable paper boat. Resonance lingers beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, distinctive lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature and confident distance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (quicker near the shutter, airier in aftermath) without head-hopping. Purposeful uncertainty is taught and paid off, never confusing what the focalizer can know. Minor risk of lushness is managed by clarity at key beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (world, motive, pressure). Figurative language is abundant but coherent and scene-advancing; no paraphrase loops or scaffolding bloat. A touch of purple risk is offset by clear sequencing and clean syntax at peak turns. Final lines land image-first without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis—shelving silence, painting with light, a cipher of longing decoded via dawn photography—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (mythic logic, accumulative lyricism) heighten stakes and cohere under closure. Recurring objects reconfigure meaning at the end without gimmickry. Emotional truth (longing as communal memory) underpins the spectacle.</comment>
