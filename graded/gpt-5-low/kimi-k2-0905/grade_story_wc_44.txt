<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive—to relearn what was unlearned and retrieve shadows—is clear and drives concrete, escalating choices (keying the automaton, closing loops, surrendering the key to her shadow). The “quietly deliberate” trait manifests in her methodical operations rather than in label-only description. Internal cost is present but understated: trading her wandering silhouette and assuming guardianship reads as an Earned Stasis. A touch more friction or contradictory impulse on the page could deepen her interior struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: discovery of the key → activation of automaton → Möbius dome → encounter with detached shadow → transfer of the key → world-level reattachment of shadows. Orientation and rules are taught by objects and action; the drive lens holds through a decisive change with cost. Closure is on-page and unambiguous, with the price stamped into the final beats (her trade and the sealed loop). No major set-up is left unkept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The observatory’s orrery, dome shutters, and key function as lived tools that constrain tactics and enable the solution; environment is inseparable from action. Specifics (Möbius band of night, moon‑angle rune, mirrored chest) are purposeful and recharged in the ending image. World rules remain consistent (bent spoons, noon shadow logic) and are learned through use. The final balcony view and the guardian automaton charge the last tableau.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one dominant stake (find/restore shadows) and tightens via the reversal of walking the Möbius interior and surrendering the key. Agency drives turns; coincidence does not resolve the conflict. The visible price—her surrendered wandering silhouette and the sealing of the loop—charges the resolution. A slightly sharper beat of risk or prospect of failure could heighten the midpoint stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of absence/return and “sealed awakenings” is earned through concrete actions and reweighted images (shadow as self, love bent by light). The final exchange at the sundial reframes absence as a teachable geometry, not mere loss. The closing aphoristic line (“every shadow is only love bent…”) edges toward explicit moralizing, softening the otherwise impeccable subtext. Even so, resonance lingers through the cost and the charged stillness of the restored noon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person close tracks Lyra’s perceptions with consistent diction and controlled rhythm; brief dialogue is functional and in‑world. The voice modulates under pressure (from cool observation to incantatory cadence) without leakage or head‑hopping. Patterned imagery (spoons, loops, mirrors) is taught and reprises cleanly. Minor flourish risk remains but seldom undermines precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density and vivid imagery propel rather than stall; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional purple‑leaning metaphors (e.g., “stars… smeared into silver spoons”) are coherent within the established lexicon and do not blur action. No scaffold loops or template cadences impede momentum. A touch of pruning could sharpen a few stacked images in the middle third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—spoons bending reality, Möbius night, a rune‑key awakening a shadow—feels singular and inevitable within its logic. Turns grow from earlier particulars and tools rather than late rule changes. Risk‑taking in conceit and image heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. The final charged poise—guardian automaton, sealed loop, and honest noon—lands as fresh and memorable.</comment>
