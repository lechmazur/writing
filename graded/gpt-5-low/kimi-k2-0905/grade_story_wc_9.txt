<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific: a grieving mother seeking the pooled minutes after a stillbirth. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“silver moss,” “tasted of iron and lullabies”) with contradictory impulses—reverence and pain—held together. Her key choices (spreading cards, tracing the name, inviting the night to tea) align with motive and culminate in a credible reconfiguration. Minor sentiment brushes the edges near the end but does not undercut the earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and ritual actions escalate toward a resonant reconfiguration (the crack detaches, strikes her chest, and time rushes back). Orientation is taught early and the pattern pays off in the closure image at 3:42 a.m. Cost is legible on the page—the relinquishing of “the clasp of grief” and the permanent reweighting of her relationship to time and loss. The final act (speaking the name, offering repentance) closes the causal arc with a felt before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: a midnight glade above/within clouds where minutes fall upward constrains tactics and enables the ritual. The saucer, cloud, and moss operate as micro‑settings that guide choice (cards on porcelain river; tracing ink on cloud). Environmental rules are consistent and learned through action (cloud as cathedral, descent once the name is traced). The final image is charged by place: backyard at the exact minute, saucer healed, tea with night.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming and repricing lost time in grief—is announced early and tightens through the card reading and the voices’ timestamps. The reversal arrives when the saucer crack becomes an active force, striking her chest and forcing release; agency is present in her ritual choices. Costs are felt (letting the grief clasp unfasten without erasing love) and the options narrow toward speaking the name. Escalation remains coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of grief, time’s condensation, and maternal love recur via specific objects and rituals, reweighted by the ending. Subtext operates through the tea, tracing, and cloud repentance rather than overt explication. A few lines tilt toward thesis‑statement clarity (“showing every grieving parent how to unfasten grief without forgetting love”), slightly reducing the austerity of the resonance. Overall, the afterimage is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person lens is steady, sensorially rich, and distinct; diction and syntax modulate with pressure without head‑hopping. Patterned elisions (time pooling, cloud-cathedral) are taught and paid off. The voice maintains confidence and plausibility within its mythic register. Minor stylized grammar choices (e.g., “unfasten” for “unfastened”) read intentional but slightly snag the ear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images carry multiple jobs and momentum generally holds. Occasional purple density and a small grammatical jolt (“she knelt, unfasten…”) nick the surface. Repetition (“willingly perplexed”) skirts loopiness but functions as motif. The final third stays clear, with no figurative muddle obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis—cartomancy, cloudbound time, a porcelain crack as river/lightning/memory—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes and cohere under the ritual logic. Turns arise from established motifs rather than late rule changes. The healed saucer/closed eye image and 3:42 reprise are memorable and distinctive.</comment>
