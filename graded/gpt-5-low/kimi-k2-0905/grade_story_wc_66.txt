<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mila’s goal and tactics are crystal clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (rosin ink, antennae, not fleeing) align with a disciplined temperament. Interiority is textured through sensory focus rather than abstract labels. The risk to her is legible but her contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely wavers. The endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis with quiet cost rather than a wrenching trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: nights of preparation lead causally to the solstice broadcast. Closure lands on the page when the inspectors inhale the chord and the city begins to “recall” stories, with conceptual cost to the regime. Orientation is clean by the first lines and the pattern pays off at the ending image. The one‑shot window (solstice, receivers calibrated for silence) tightens options credibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The hall, ember alcove, mist, and the radio’s green dial are tactile and functionally constrain tactics (copper filaments, music stands as antennae, calibration). The rosin dust as medium/tool charges the final image and directly enables the outcome. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a musician’s priorities. The afterglow of the dial reweights setting into a charged micro‑planet.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—smuggling story back under censorship—is evident and deepens through the solstice constraint and the inspectors’ sweep. The decisive intensification is Mila’s transmission, where risk peaks and options narrow. The cost is more conceptual than bodily, but danger and irreversible exposure are present. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without false reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of art as encoded resistance emerges organically from actions (intervals for emotions, rosin ink, dust speaking). The ending offers a resonant answer: stories persist by inhabiting matter and bodies, even enemies’. No sermonizing; the inspectors’ involuntary “paragraphs” in their eyes embodies repricing. Recurring images (mist, embers, dust) gain new charge at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—musical lexicon, tactile craft, green phosphor focus. Quoted pirate lines are spare and subtextual, advancing plot and code. Distance control is steady with purposeful compression across nights. Diction remains coherent to a copyist steeped in music.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; metaphors stay within the music/dust/mist palette. Information density is high with minimal scaffold and no momentum‑killing loops. Rhythm modulates well from quiet preparation to the broadcast swell. A few ornate turns flirt with purple but do not blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Encoding narrative into intervals and teaching dust to speak via rosin pigment is a striking synthesis. The transformation of inspectors through inhaled sound‑fog feels fresh and inevitable from the established rules. Risks in conceit and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final “tiny green planet” reprise is memorable and specific.</comment>
