<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Nara’s motive—to reclaim and redirect “implanted destiny”—is vivid and consistent, with concrete actions under pressure (moss bloom, epigenetic nick). Interiority is specific to her plant-leaning perception, and choices align with her insurgent pragmatism. Internal contradiction is lighter; she is largely unwavering rather than torn. Visible cost is present (risk, physical strain) but not deeply harrowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: kite → coordinates → 52° grotto → embryo alteration → escape. Orientation is crisp from the opening sentence, and the closure lands as a charged poise: she exits with an altered embryo, the council ignorant. The kite’s appearance is a mild coincidence but doesn’t resolve the story; Nara’s agency drives the outcome. Cost is legible though not crushing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is not decorative: the hot springs’ exact temperature, mineral water, and thermophilic moss directly enable the plan. Reconstruction textures (half-framed bathhouses, lanterns) deepen mood and stakes. Environmental specificity constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Nara’s botanic sensibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seize reproductive destiny from the council) is established early and tightens with the guard’s arrival and the time pressure. The soporific bloom and precise incision are decisive moves; a tremor adds pressure. The guard resolution is a touch easy, tempering the felt price of the turn. Still, the narrowing window and embodied strain deliver credible escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: resisting institutional control by evolving tradition through intimate, subversive care. Motifs (heat/water/seed, chlorophyll memory, lantern-lit reconstruction) accrue and reweight meaning in the close. The final “why” risks neatness but resonates as a conceptual repricing of destiny. No sermonizing; resonance arises from action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and POV-consistent, with a distinct vegetal-perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without slipping registers. No head-hopping; elisions are purposeful and legible. Lines like “minerals swirled like galaxies” deliver texture without obscuring causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; sentences do double work. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and purposeful, rarely tipping into purple. Momentum holds in the key beats (guard, incision, tremor) with clear sequencing. Minor lushness slightly softens edge but doesn’t cloud clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, epigenetic subversion in volcanic baths, and a kite as chlorophyll archive. Turns feel earned by established rules and character choice. Risks (lyric science-magic blend) pay off with coherence and freshness. The closing reconfiguration feels both inevitable and surprising.</comment>
