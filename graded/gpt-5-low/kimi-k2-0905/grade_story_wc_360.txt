<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quince’s contradictory impulses—widow’s grief vs. astronomer’s logic—act simultaneously and culminate in a costly, motivated choice. Interiority is specific and embodied through the press, the halo fragment, and the tactile work of setting type. The final renunciation (reversing the press) clearly forecloses his habitual borrowing with a felt price. Minor abstraction at times keeps us a hair removed from bodily stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causality is clean: halo → unintended sentence → personality‑borrowing intensifies → child of light → reversal with rekindled stars and eroded self. Closure lands as a decisive act with conceptual repricing: empathy as subtraction with the cost of losing carried lives. The drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal and holds to the end. Price is on the page: “his own heart blank as unprinted paper.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The press, topaz dome, and cliff‑side workshop are tactile and integral; the tool and sky actively shape options and the final image. World rules are learned through action (halo sinking, reverse printing) without exposition. The environment constrains the act of reversal and charges the last walk down the cliff. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: save/gather the vanishing stars and selves versus keep borrowed lives. Escalation is driven by Quince’s choices (borrowing the astronomer, engaging the halo, reversing the press) and narrows options. The child’s apparition is a strong tightening that forces a trade‑off. Consequences persist in the blankness and vow not to borrow again.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: printing as empathy arithmetic, the halo’s light, and “we are the remainder.” The ending reweights the premise toward release over possession with a resonant image. A single line edges toward aphorism (“that to shine is to be alone together”) but remains earned by the pattern of actions. Subtext hums in the subtraction motif rather than being lectured.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and precise metaphor; focalization remains steady and credible. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and pay off at closure. Brief dialogue is charged and in‑character. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with strong verb choices and clean sequencing; images recur with evolution. A few dense metaphor stacks flirt with purple but don’t blur sense. Rhythm varies, and no paraphrase loops or scaffolding slow momentum. Final images are sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress as soul arithmetic, a halo imprint birthing a child of light, reverse printing to rekindle stars—is striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in conceit and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from the established logic of objects and craft. Emotional truth undergirds the high concept.</comment>
