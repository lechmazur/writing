<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Quince’s motives and contradictions are rich and specific: the widow’s grief and the astronomer’s logic contend inside him and drive his choices. Micro-choices are embodied through tool and body (halo on platen, flywheel turned backward, lungs “full of lucid turbulence”). The final renunciation—printing himself and losing the borrowed souls—is earned and costly. A slight tilt toward abstraction in a few feelings lines keeps it just shy of perfect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/causal hybrid, the sequence tightens cleanly: halo → anomalous sentence → personality swap → child of light → reversal of the press. Closure lands on the page with decisive action and visible cost: stars rekindle as his self is pared to “blank as unprinted paper.” Orientation is clear from the opening and pays off in the restored-sky ending. No soft resets; every beat links forward.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The topaz dome, cliff workshop, and the press are not decorative; they constrain and enable choices, culminating in the backward press as mechanism of sacrifice. Recurring objects (halo fragment, flywheel, broadsheet) charge the final image and carry cost. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through craft and vocation. World rules feel consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—identity and the vanishing stars—clarifies early and escalates through the child’s emergence and the imposed trade-off. The reversal is protagonist-driven and forecloses a path (no more borrowing), with the price legible on the page. Internal and external conflicts braid cleanly without redundancy. The “deliberate ambiguity” pressure deepens rather than diffuses stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through events and objects: empathy as subtraction, not transmission, culminating in release over proof. The final constellation-stitching and the “first edition of a man” reweight prior images without needing an essay. A few aphoristic lines risk over-stating (“the mathematics of emotion ends not in proof but in release”) but remain earned by scene work. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, singular lyric voice with controlled distance; diction suits a craftsman-philosopher under stress. Brief dialogue (“We are the remainder…”) is charged, multivoiced, and plot-active. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and uncertainty is purposeful yet legible. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet clear; images often do double duty (press as heart, stars as borrowed selves). Figurative language remains coherent to the print/astronomy lattice; momentum rarely stalls. Minor aphoristic shine occasionally teeters toward declaration but does not blunt the closure. Syntax varies and carries propulsion into the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of letterpress mechanics, astronomical vanishing, and empathy-as-math feels genuinely new and internally inevitable. The halo fragment’s evolution into a child of light and then constellations is an inspired, earned turn. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The conceptual calculus lands with human cost.</comment>
