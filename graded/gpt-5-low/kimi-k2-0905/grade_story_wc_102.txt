<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation (finding where unused love is stored) drives concrete choices: assembling the camera, inviting the man, initiating the breath ritual, relinquishing the jade. Contradictory impulses (ache vs. offering) surface on the page. The relationship functions as crucible without names, culminating in a costly gift and mutual vulnerability. Minor note: the protagonist’s internal doubt could spike once more under pressure to deepen the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: breath-linked perception leads to projection glow → condensation door → orchard of withheld kindness → return with redistributed stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing (storage as posture) with on-page cost (giving the bead, confronting withheld gifts). Orientation is crisp from the first line, and set-ups (camera, breath, wisteria, tear) pay off. The causal chain is lyrical yet legible at each turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The viaduct, wisteria, river fog, and camera obscura are not decorative; they constrain and enable actions (projection, breath condensation, door weaving from vines). Specific sensory choices (“tasted purple,” “palpable wisteria weight”) track the POV’s priorities and charge the final image. World rules (breath alters perception) stay consistent through setting action. The micro-setting evolves with each beat, culminating in the considerate air and paler dusk rectangle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—alchemizing unused love before it rots the heart—tightens via the arrival of the man and the breath-synchronized ritual, leading to the door and orchard. The visible price is the relinquishing of the tear and the admission of withheld kindnesses. Escalation is accumulative: density and glow increase until the orchard forces a stance. Slightly low external opposition, but internal pressure remains coherent and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from enactment: breath reciprocity as love’s duty; unused love returns as river water to the river. Subtext thrums in images (lantern-flowers, mothing petals around the man’s heart) and a charged object economy (tear, silk). The line “storage is not a place but a posture” risks thesis-stating but is earned by the mechanics and cost just shown. The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinctive lyric third-person close sustains precision and coherence; diction and cadence feel controlled and character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (“address of the love I never gave”). Rhythm modulates with pressure (glow → door → orchard), maintaining legibility. A touch of purple lushness encroaches at times but rarely blurs intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors; images do multiple jobs (sensation, theme, and mechanics). Minor excess in color-synesthesia (“tasted purple”) skirts overwriting but remains coherent within the established lyric register. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; syntax varies and propels. Final images are clear and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura optics married to breath-work revealing an orchard of withheld tenderness via wisteria and condensation. Risk-taking in concept and diction pays off with an inevitable-feeling closure. The object economy (Kwan Yin’s tear) and respiratory mechanics bind metaphor to action. Memorable, specific, and not derivative of familiar templates.</comment>
