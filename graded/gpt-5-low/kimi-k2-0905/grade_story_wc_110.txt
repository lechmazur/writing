<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—to thaw mistrust with transparency—is clear and escalates credibly from staying late to the final renunciation. Her internal contradiction (urge to confront vs. choosing forgiveness) is dramatized at the vent and again at the projector. Emotions are embodied through tactile actions (tracing ink, fitting the lens) rather than labels. Secondary characters apply pressure without stealing focus, and the final choice costs her the satisfactions of accusation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: ticket → booth → eavesdropping → lens → projection → reconfiguration. The closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—she chooses not to expose them publicly and reframes the conflict via a silent film with visible social cost. Orientation is clean early; time/place are legible and consistent. Slight neatness in the overheard reveal reads engineered but doesn’t undercut the earned ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The concert hall and “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” are vivid and functionally integrated, culminating in images thrown onto wet marble. The missing lens as tool-object shapes tactics and charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Sensory integration (dust, wet stone, emergency lights) is purposeful and filtered through Mira’s priorities. The environment’s hush and surfaces modulate tone and meaning rather than being postcard décor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is social trust; pressure tightens when eavesdropping recasts the prank as an attempted absolution, forcing a moral choice. Escalation is quiet but clear: her options narrow from accusation to a costly act of public transparency. The price—relinquishing grievance and foregoing punishment—reads on the page. It’s not high-voltage conflict, yet it coheres under the situational-moral pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of secrecy vs. honesty emerges through objects (ticket, lens) and action (silent film as apology), not lecture. The open-lock doodle reprises and reweights prior images with elegant clarity. One line (“freed by honesty”) edges toward explicitness, but subtext carries the weight in the film and sweeping together. The final image offers a non-literal answer: community restored by shared memory, not confession.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a supple, lyric tilt fits the nocturnal hush. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful, with distinct voices for Rico and Jun and clean subtext. Diction stays within the piece’s established register and modulates well at pressure points. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: precise verbs, layered images that do multiple jobs, and momentum without scaffold. A few flourishes (“listening to snow fall upward,” “unbutton the sky”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and voice-motivated. No loops or cadence templates bog the flow. Syntax varies to match scene energy, especially around the eavesdropping and projection beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blend of workplace mystery, nocturne mood, and communal absolution via silent film feels fresh. The cryptic ticket/lens mechanics yield a non-obvious yet inevitable-feeling turn. While not radical, the piece commits to its quiet risk—a reconciliation without confrontation—and executes with specificity. Emotional truth carries innovation more than concept flash.</comment>
