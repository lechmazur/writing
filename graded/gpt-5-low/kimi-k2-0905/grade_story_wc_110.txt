<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (repair trust, resist accusation) are clear and drive concrete choices under pressure. The overheard plan triggers a credible internal conflict—confrontation versus facilitating collective absolution—and her restraint reads earned. Embodied perception (“soft as wet gravel,” tactile handling of the lens/ticket) grounds emotion. Secondary characters are thin but apply relevant pressure without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: cryptic ticket → search → overheard confession → retrieval of lens → public screening → social thaw. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she withholds exposure, stages an image‑based apology, and limits the story to the walls with visible cost (relinquishing confrontation/punishment). Orientation is strong from the first line; lens holds consistently. The single turn is sufficient and motivated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and objects are vividly selective and functional: the forecourt’s wet marble becomes a screen, and the missing lens constrains action until found. Environmental acoustics (“resonant hush,” ventilation grate) enable the key eavesdropping beat. The rain and crystal architecture tone the final image. World details are integrated through action rather than touristic cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring trust—tightens when she learns the prank’s intent, forcing a choice between exposure and communal absolution. The decision to project the archival reel is a meaningful escalation that reweights options. Costs are primarily internal/societal rather than perilous, but they’re felt and coherently staged. Tension remains steady and concentrates at the projector switch and the silent apology.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, honesty, and communal memory emerge through concrete acts (silent film in lieu of confession) rather than declarations. The open‑lock doodle reweights earlier symbols without moralizing. Ambiguity remains (pranksters’ ethics vs. collective healing), granting the ending a humane complexity. It’s a touch tidy, but subtext carries the apology.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A lyrical, controlled close third maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext and plot turns without exposition (“Her honesty is the key”). Diction modulates with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Occasional elevated phrasing fits the piece’s tonal ambition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with strong verbs and image economy; rhythm varies and propels. Metaphors are largely apt and fresh (“listening to snow fall upward” risks flourish but lands). Minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops. The final image resolves with clean, precise language.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The silent‑film absolution projected onto wet marble is a distinctive, earned turn. The ticket‑doodle mechanic and the “resonant hush” tonal weave feel specific rather than template. The premise (trust restored by image and restraint) reads fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in quiet stakes and lyric texture, and it pays off.</comment>
