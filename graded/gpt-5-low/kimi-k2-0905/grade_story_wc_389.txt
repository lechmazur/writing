<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is specific and consistent—preserving messy human memory against the prophet’s erasures—and her agency (unfolding the array, catching “shadows,” choosing to sing) drives turns. Interiority is vivid and particular, with concrete ties to tools and weather. The recognition that the prophet is also imprisoned complicates her stance credibly. The final renunciation—teaching the light to hold its own shadows—reads earned, though the personal cost is more conceptual than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: motifs and transmissions intensify toward a closure where her song alters the field (followers’ doubts return; the prophet flickers). Orientation is clear early (observatory, exile, storm) and remains stable. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise, with a discernible before/after. The cost is implied more than dramatized, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, storm, brass array, and cobalt glass are not decorative; they constrain action, conduct lightning, and literally capture/charge the final image (“frozen tree of blue-white light”). Sensory detail is focused and POV-shaped, with weather and tools altering options. World rules are consistent and learned via use. The final image’s power is inseparable from these objects and place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (memory vs enforced forgetting) and pressure builds: the prophet’s miracle rewrites books, the electromagnetic “scream” spikes urgency, lightning hits the array, and she chooses to broadcast a counter-frequency. The tightening emerges from her agency rather than coincidence, even if lightning’s timing is mythic. The price is less a loss than a stance, reducing visceral bite. Still, escalation is clear and lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s necessary shadows versus purist light emerges through images and acts, not just assertion; “what’s left when the light forgets to be honest” elegantly reframes the premise. Subtext deepens as the prophet’s private doubt leaks, complicating villainy. A few lines skate near thesis (explicit moral stakes), but the ending’s image-led repricing predominates. The clipped final sentence slightly blurs the afterglow but maintains charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and character-specific, sustaining images with rhythm that swells under pressure. Refrains (“Through fragmented radio frequencies…”) function as taught pattern rather than filler. No head-hopping; distance is steady and apt. Diction stays coherent with the piece’s mythic-tech register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with minimal scaffold; metaphors are coherent to the radio/light/shadow lexicon. Repetitions are purposeful; no significant loop or synonym churn. Rhythm varies well; syntax supports momentum through the storm beats. A few abstract intensifiers appear, but they don’t muddy clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Radio ghosts meeting prophetic authoritarian erasure via a cobalt-glass memory apparatus feels freshly synthesized and inevitable in hindsight. The prophet’s split broadcast (public purity/private doubt) is a sharp, specific turn. Risks in premise and diction pay off without losing clarity. The closure image reweights the whole with memorable ingenuity.</comment>
