<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Calyx’s motive (verify/protect the ridge) is specific and pressures her into a credible, costly choice; the hesitation over sacrificing her teacher’s name puts contradictory impulses on the page. Interiority is embodied through tactile cues (coppery ink, basalt warmth) and not just labels. The renunciation carries forward into action with the children, foreclosing a path of personal continuity. Minor ding: secondary characters don’t actively pressure her beyond ambience, keeping the crucible largely internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: cartographer claim → dream entry → discovery of fissure → seed bargain → sacrifice → instructions → tangible weaving that holds the ridge. Closure lands with on-page cost (lost mentor’s name) and a visible outcome (ridge endures the monsoon). The drive reads Hybrid with causal dominance at the end; the price shapes tactics and the final image. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ridge, orchids, vanilla lattice, and monsoon are sensorial and integrated into action—orchid fibers become the repair method, weather sets the clock, terrain dictates urgency. Details are POV-filtered and purposeful rather than touristic. Environment constrains choices and charges the final image. Vivid without excess sprawl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via the dream’s fissure and the ticking monsoon. The decisive tightening is the seed’s price, narrowing options to a meaningful trade. Resolution stems from her agency and carries an enduring cost. Slight limitation: external opposition is diffuse, but internal vs. situational pressure interweave effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of collective memory sustained by acknowledged uncertainty is organically dramatized through the sacrifice and the instruction to “weave the vacant gap with doubt.” Luminous doubt shifts from danger to binding force, reweighting prior images. Minor deduction for a near-explicit thesis line late (“cultural memory survives not because it is true...”), which flirts with moralizing. The resonance still lingers beyond the stated thought.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature consistent with Calyx’s vocation and state. Rhythm modulates under pressure (thunder, first raindrop) without losing control. Diction stays coherent to the world’s idiom and pattern-taught metaphors pay off. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multi-duty; lines propel rather than pad, and syntax varies to match tempo. Lyricism is rich but mostly disciplined; metaphors are coherent with the world’s logic. A touch of overt theme-stating at the end and consistently jeweled diction keep it just shy of the very top. No notable loops or mechanical artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Reality-checker on a fantasy island, lucid-dust eyes, and a seed that trades memory for fact synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling arc. The dream’s dragon-back geology and the instruction to bind with doubt feel original and thematically integrated. Risks in tone and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final repricing of truth vs. memory is both surprising and earned.</comment>
