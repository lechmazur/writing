<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Calyx’s motivation is clear and compelling, and the internal contradiction (duty to truth vs. loyalty to memory/self) is dramatized in the seed bargain. Her emotions are embodied through sensory specifics (coppery ink, storm-cooled air, or the ridge’s “heartbeat”). The final renunciation (losing the teacher’s name) is a credible, felt cost that forecloses a path. Secondary characters apply light but relevant pressure without muddying her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: investigation → dream entry → discovery of fissure → seed trade → instructions → communal repair → tested by monsoon. Closure lands on-page with cost and effect: the ridge holds and she loses the mentor’s name; both are visible in action and image. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric accumulation supporting, and holds to the end. Orientation is established early; no teleports or rule-breaking fixes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ridge, orchids, vanilla lattice, and monsoon are vivid and purposeful, constraining choices (timing, materials) and supplying resources (orchid fibers). The dream-space is consistently governed by introduced rules and filters through Calyx’s perceptual bias. The environment actively shapes the ending image (braided orchid doubts holding the cliff). Sensory balance and specificity feel integral rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is crisply signaled: the ridge’s integrity vs. erosion by forgetting. Pressure tightens through the thunder clock and discovery of the monochrome fissure, then culminates in the memory-for-fact trade. Agency drives the turn (planting the seed, accepting the loss) and the tactic shift (weaving doubt). Consequences land physically (ridge holds) and personally (erasure of the mentor’s name).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—uncertainty as binding force and the ethics of collective memory—is organically embedded in action and image (silver leaf’s instruction, children chanting questions). The conceptual repricing at the end is strong, but the final sentence edges into explicit thesis (“cultural memory survives not because it is true...”), which slightly blunts resonance. Despite that, the imagery-driven argument mostly avoids sermonizing elsewhere. The cost of knowledge as loss deepens the theme credibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close holds steady; diction and syntax are controlled and modulate with pressure. Patterned elisions and metaphors are taught early and remain legible. No dialogic clutter; the voice carries subtext in images and choices. Distance control is consistent, with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are dense and multi-functional, with minimal scaffolding and good momentum. Metaphoric richness is high but coherent; occasional lushness brushes the edge of excess without obscuring causality. Rhythm varies well and the closure image is crisp. No notable loops or filter-verb stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a “reality checker,” a knowledge fruit that trades memory for fact, and doubt as a structural material for land. The dream-mechanics are specific and consequential rather than ornamental. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes and cohere under pressure. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
