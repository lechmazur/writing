<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Miren’s counter-impulses—caretaker control versus ethical surrender—act in scene and culminate in the costly release of Aster. The removal of ring/braid and burning of the lecture externalize her internal fracture with tactile specificity. Choices align with motive across beats, and the renunciation forecloses her prior “immaculate” handler identity. The cost is felt in the plaque built from tail tips and the refusal of triumph at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: ritual shedding → code-making → release forms a coherent tightening. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she reconfigures her creed and lets Aster go, with on-page price in relinquished status and artifacts. Orientation is clear from the opening sentence and never wavers. The final image (Aster melting into star-dark) reweights the premise with undeniable cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop, stove, cedar, and field under stars are not postcard backdrops; they supply tools and dictate action (burning pages, mounting plaque, outdoor release). Recurring objects (cedar, tail tips) charge the final image and the threshold (plaque over door). Sensory detail is selective and POV-shaped, never museum-like. Environment and micro-objects constrain choices and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (rebuild ethic vs save/control Aster) are signaled early and deepen through the ritual, the honoring of the dead, and the code construction. Escalation is internal but visible, with a clear trade-off: she sacrifices status and certainty to act. External antagonism is minimal, so pressure relies on accumulative rite and grief; it holds but never bites hard. The release is earned and costly without feeling convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (trust, humility, and the price of care) arises from action rather than thesis. The tail-tip compass and plaque convert guilt into practice—concrete repricing, not moralizing. The ending refuses triumphal closure, choosing a living question—a resonant answer embedded in image. Counter-readings (release as risk) are allowed without muddle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled, textured, and precise; diction and syntax modulate with ritual gravity. Elision is purposeful; no head-hopping or stance drift. A few heightened phrases flirt with lyric saturation but remain legible and character-coherent. The perceptual signature (animal tactility, tool attention) is distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: images carry multiple jobs and momentum holds. Figurative language is vivid and largely coherent with the chameleon/cedar/stars palette. Very light purple pressure appears (“shimmering stillness” repeats) but does not obscure sense or closure. Syntax varies and propulsion matches the ritual’s cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ritual of gluing tail tips as a code’s “vertebrae” is startling and specific, transforming grief into praxis. The con’s harm refracted through a handler’s credo feels fresh; the release as charged poise avoids cliché. Choices feel inevitable in hindsight given the setup of pride and patient care. Risks in tone and image pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
