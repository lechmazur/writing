<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motives (duty vs motion) are concrete and embodied in choices: building the raft from bayonet hilts, refusing the council, and unmaking the harpoon. Her interiority is particular and sensory (scrimshaw vibrating against her sternum). The final renunciation carries cost (leaving community and role) and reads earned. Minor note: the council pressure is brief, limiting relationship crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: whale call → raft → council confrontation → departure → harpoon unmaking. Closure lands on the page with cost as she forecloses the rebuild path and transforms the weapon. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph and pattern remains coherent. The “freedom” statement risks over‑explicitness but does not blunt the structural turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: sublittoral fringe with uniforms/urchins, kelp ropes, black sand that “sang,” glass‑leaf orchards. Recurring objects (scrimshaw, harpoon) function as tools shaping choices and charge the final image. Environment provides resources (bayonet hilts, kelp) that alter tactics. World logic (disappearing island obeying the whale) is consistent and dramatized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus communal duty—is signaled early and tightens with the council’s plea and the choice to push off. The culminating act (unmaking the harpoon) deepens conflict into ethos, with a visible price. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent under the chosen lens. Slightly soft external opposition keeps this just below the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Weapon‑to‑kelp transformation and “detachment” reframe freedom as refusing translation of self into others’ demands. Subtext operates through images (scrimshaw warmth, combative tenderness, whale as chorus) rather than lecture. One line states the thesis explicitly, trimming the lingering ambiguity slightly. Resonance remains strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—maritime, tactile, and musical—stays consistent. Rhythm modulates well across beats; patterned diction feels intentional. No head‑hopping or stance drift. A few elevated turns flirt with purple but remain voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; little scaffolding. Figurative language is rich but controlled; recurring lexicon (“combative tenderness,” vibration) coheres. Minimal redundancy; syntax varies to maintain momentum. Density at peaks approaches saturation but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: dock worker/dancer, scrimshaw compass, whale‑called island that appears for the unarmed, and the unmaking of a harpoon into kelp. Risks a bold mythic logic without hedging and follows implications to closure. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight. Memorable images lift it above familiar war‑aftermath tropes.</comment>
