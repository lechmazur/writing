<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—learn why some echo and avoid becoming trapped—drives concrete choices (descending, singing, pressing the shell, finishing the cadence). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, with her gift reading as both edge and burden. The mother cocoon beat forces a charged, value‑revealing decision. A slight neatness in the “lesson learned” coda trims ambiguity but not motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: shell → descent → gallery → mother’s cocoon → finishing cadence, with on‑page closure and cost. The decisive act dissolves the cocoon and reconfigures options (travel vs reverberate). Orientation is swift and stable; the accumulative lyric texture supports, not obscures, causality. The price—letting go of the mother’s echo and foreclosing haunting—lands in the final images.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon, corkscrew cavern, moth‑spun gallery, and starlit nexus are vivid and purposeful, constraining movement and tactics. The shell functions as a micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image. Environmental rules (echoes woven, absorption at the end) remain consistent and operative. The final “open sky” fade is setting‑charged reweighting, not backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoid becoming an unfinished echo) tightens as the canyon questions her and the mother’s voice appears, culminating in the farewell cadence. Escalation is agency‑driven; pressure coheres and deepens rather than multiplies. The cost—completing a goodbye that ends a lingering presence—reads clearly. Quiet but felt; no deus ex elements resolve it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of endings versus reverberations emerges organically through echoes, moths, and the act of finishing. The line “I echoed because I never finished leaving” is diegetic but edges on overt statement; the later “progressive disclosure of goodbye” flirts with a spelled‑out thesis. Still, the final image reweights the premise without sermonizing. Resonance lingers via the portable ending motif (the fused shell).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person close with a consistent perceptual signature (sonic attention, taste of memory). Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without opacity; brief dialogue carries subtext and advances stakes. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled, image‑dense, and efficient; metaphors (moths weaving echoes) are coherent and sustained. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentences carry multiple jobs with forward motion. A few thematic phrases risk didactic echo, but do not stall momentum or muddy closure. Rhythm supports escalation and release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: echo ecology with moth‑looms, a seashell as coordinate and closure key, and “finishing” as ethical technology. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under taught rules. Risks (lyric density, conceptual system) heighten stakes without confusion. The ending’s reconfiguration is fresh and memorable.</comment>
