<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ellery’s motive is clear and particular—coaxing his dead daughter’s laughter back through sound—and his micro‑choices (throttle modulation, kneeling, whispering to the hourglass) embody grief and hope simultaneously. Contradictory impulses (“impossible and familiar”) act in scene, not in summary. The renunciation at the end—accepting absence shaped by echo—feels earned with felt cost. Relationship pressure is present via the wife’s distant chuckle reshaping the household’s emotional state.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Track A single‑scene arc with a clean accumulative/textural drive: experiment → failure → faint return → tentative success → engine death → reconfigured silence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the house “exhales” and the hourglass/cord image reweights the rules of loss with cost. Orientation is clear within the first lines (hourglass, house, Ellery, tunnel), and each beat follows with purposeful therefore/so moves under the lyric lens. The persistent constraint (tunnel acoustics and machine limits) shapes tactics and the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The echo‑chamber tunnel, the blower, and the hourglass are integrated, tactile, and consequential; environment and tool jointly determine what’s possible and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid across sound, touch, and vibration (“concrete ribs,” “glass marble dropped onto tile”). The tunnel’s acoustics pressure choices and create the “true haunting” that survives the engine’s death. The last images (cord against glass; the tunnel as organ pipe) are place‑dependent and indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring laughter—tightens through an accumulative escalation: raw howl, modulation, emergence of giggle, communal ripple, and machine failure forcing acceptance. Agency drives the turns (starting, throttling gentler, killing the throttle, choosing to stop), and the price is the acknowledgment that memory, not resurrection, is the attainable outcome. The engine’s death forecloses a path with cost yet leaves a charged residue in the environment. Tension operates at sentence and story scales without contrived antagonism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: grief becomes tending absence into a shape sound can carry; the piece earns its resonance through image and action (blower‑lullaby, tunnel echo, wife’s chuckle). The explicit thesis line (“tending to the unspoken…”) slightly over‑states meaning near the end, trimming subtlety. Even so, the final images provide a non‑literal answer that lingers without sentimentality. Recurring objects (hourglass/cord) reprice the premise convincingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The close third voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“marble on tile,” “concrete throat,” “organ pipe”). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and the diction stays coherent to Ellery’s sensibility. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the brief quoted whisper lands as earned. The lyric compression teaches its pattern early and pays it off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful images doing multiple jobs, and no significant loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but generally apt and legible; a couple of lush vehicles (“macerated itself”) flirt with purple yet do not blur causality or the closure image. Syntax varies with good propulsion. Final lines are clean and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—conducting a leaf blower in an echo tunnel to coax a dead child’s laughter—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight given Ellery’s history. The tunnel as organ pipe and the hourglass/cord pairing offer fresh, integrated turns rather than ornament. Risk‑taking in tone and method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The reconfiguration from resurrection to “shaping absence” is conceptually and emotionally original.</comment>
