<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corin’s interior conflict (quantifying presence vs. honoring it) is specific and embodied, and Mira applies relational pressure with subtext (“by returning differently”) that catalyzes his decisive act. The gesture of crushing a valuable pocket‑sun reads as a credible renunciation with cost and consequence to his self‑definition. Minor on‑the‑nose lines (“I’ve been selling absence”) slightly flatten complexity but don’t undercut motivation. The friendship‑turned‑intimacy functions as crucible and shifts their dynamic by the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative build lands a clear closure: a conceptual repricing as Corin chooses release over capture, paid for by destroying his product and revaluing his craft. Causality holds: confession → Mira’s counter‑move with the shell → crushing the sun → reweighted meaning. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean within the first lines. Cost is legible on the page and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ember nexus, obsidian arch, and volcanic glass provide tactile, sensorial anchors that filter through Corin’s professional attention. Setting and recurring objects (shell, pocket‑sun) charge the final image—glass sings, shadows ribbon—though the environment mostly amplifies and frames rather than constraining tactics. World rules read consistent and learned through action. Detail economy is strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to hold presence without killing it) tightens from confession to an irreversible choice; the act forecloses his prior commercial path. Emotional and ethical calculus (memory as commodity vs. shared moment) informs the climax. The price is felt but mostly conceptual and relational; external consequences remain gestural. Still, escalation is coherent and earned under an accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of presence vs. preservation emerges organically via actions and images, culminating in a non‑literal answer (share and release instead of trap). The nautilus and pocket‑sun recur with reweighted meaning. A few explicit thesis‑like lines risk overstatement but the closing image resists moralizing. Subtext in Mira’s gesture and their long‑stored secret carries real resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely held to Corin sustains a distinct perceptual signature; diction matches a “scientifically romantic” mind. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with Mira’s “rehearsed casualness” implying latent stakes. Distance control stays stable, and voice modulates toward compression at the climax. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled, with images doing multiple jobs (heat, light, glass, shell). Occasional simile density (“like caramel,” “like luminous veins”) skirts purple but remains coherent and propulsive. No loops or scaffold bloat; sentences advance pressure and image. Final lines are clean, concentrated, and musical without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical pocket‑suns, a nautilus heart, and a conceptual redefinition of presence feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “returning differently” mechanic, and the act of crushing a sun to release context, are memorable turns. Risks in diction and conceit heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template solutions and asserts a singular vision.</comment>
