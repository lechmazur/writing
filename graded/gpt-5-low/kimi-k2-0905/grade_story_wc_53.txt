<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear want (to negotiate with his own ghost) paired with embodied contradiction (age’s decay vs youth’s velocity) drives credible micro-choices: mounting the obsidian mare, clicking the wheel, then breaking it. Emotions are rendered through tactile images (ticket-stub lining, cold through ribs) rather than labels. The relationship dynamic with the seventeen-year-old self carries status tension and sting (“chronological contempt”). Final endurance—stepping on alone—reads as earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held; beats progress from arrival to invocation to rupture (breaking the wheel) to suspended negotiation to re-entry of time. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: acceptance of “shared erosion” and separation from the ghost with the carousel’s clocked restart. Stakes and costs are on the page (sacrificing undeveloped possibilities). Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within the first lines and pays off via the 03:17→03:27 frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, mirrored tiles, and obsidian mare are vivid and specific, with multi-sensory textures (steam, hiss, salt, burnt sugar). Environment constraints shape action: the cloudwater-as-glass becomes the medium for projection/negotiation; the mirrored walkway alters gait; the stationary mare is an anchor. Recurring objects (carousel, wheel, mare) charge the final image. World rules feel consistent through observation rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can the narrator renegotiate self via the ghost) tightens as each click concretizes regret, culminating in the decisive break of the wheel and the joint reading that freezes the lagoon. The cost—dissolving alternate images and parting from the ghost—forecloses a path. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens with a marked cadence shift in the frozen fracture. If anything, the ghost’s counter-pressure could push back one notch harder earlier, but it still holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coherent themes of erosion, memory as abrasive, and the futility/productivity of witnessing accrue through concrete images (sand in the lens, emulsified dreams). The line “regret is just empathy traveling backwards” is a sharp thematic articulation that still feels earned. Slight explicitness in “negotiation is not settlement but shared erosion” trims mystique but clarifies the repricing. The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Singular, controlled lyric voice with precise, inventive diction; cadence modulates effectively at turns (clicks, break, freeze, restart). POV certainty remains character-bound; metaphoric confidence reads as the narrator’s perceptual signature. Dialogue fragments from the ghost carry texture (“chronological contempt”) and subtext. No leakage or head-hopping; pattern-teaching supports the experimental mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs with strong sensory verbs; rhythm breathes around pressure points. Occasional lushness skirts purple but stays coherent and purposeful; metaphors remain consistent to the world’s logic. No evident loops or scaffold; syntax varies, and the final image lands cleanly. Minor risk of figurative saturation in mid-paragraphs is controlled and does not blunt clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a carousel above a dead ocean, a disposable camera wheel as memory-engine, cloudwater glass as negotiation medium. The ghost-as-self encounter avoids cliché through charged specifics and an original moral calculus (shared erosion vs settlement). Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (wheel clicks → break → freeze → restart). Bold risk-taking heightens coherence rather than serving as ornament.</comment>
