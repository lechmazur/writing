<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear motive (settle a debt with the ghost-self) and layered internal conflict (hesitating over 2015) drive concrete trades with visible cost. Interiority is specific and embodied (“silence that rings in broken teeth”). The renunciation and identity inversion at the end are earned by prior choices. Minor note: the “scavenger” label could bear one more embodied decision to stress resolve under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with dominant causal spine: each payment (fragments → 1998 → 2015 → blank) tightens options and leads to the decisive exchange. Closure lands on-page with cost as the blank develops into a mirror and the ghost becomes the narrator, inverting identities. Orientation is taught early and the surreal rules stay consistent. The price is explicit: erased years, ambition loss, and ontological displacement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and charged (kinetic lagoon, compressing clouds, neon horses, moon-camera), and it shapes choices via the tool-like moon wheel and the cloud’s tactile give. Details track action and mood (“funeral march,” “humming like trapped hornets”) without static cataloging. The final image reuses setting to deepen meaning (carousel restarts “with ambition it never earned”). World rules, though surreal, remain coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ownership of self/time—tightens steadily as payments escalate in cost. The crucial reversal is the blank frame bargain requiring the narrator to stay and watch; it leads directly to the identity swap. Each trade forecloses options and leaves scars (camera-shaped) that carry forward. The cost is unmistakable and persists beyond the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of regret, memory-as-currency, and ambition’s erosion arise organically from the trades. Images reweight at the end (blank → mirror; carousel repaired “by ambition it never earned”), offering a resonant, non-literal answer about survival’s costs. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers as the “new-me” departs with the tool. The emotional aftereffect is cold and inevitable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (photographic and mechanical textures) holds under pressure. Dialogue is minimal yet effective and subtextual (“You owe me the rest of the wheel”). Diction and rhythm modulate with intensity without drifting registers. Unreliability is contained within the surreal logic, not a leak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs and maintain propulsion. Figurative language is frequent but pattern-consistent and coherent; no muddle at peak beats. Minimal scaffolding and no loops; syntax varies with momentum. Slight risk of metaphor saturation is managed by clear causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: the moon as a disposable camera wheel, memory-for-time barter, and a kinetic lagoon makes the premise feel singular. The final mirror-swap is both surprising and inevitable given the taught rules. Risks in imagery and structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth grounds the high concept.</comment>
