<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mael’s motivation—to recover erased memories—is concrete and embodied, driving specific micro‑choices (reading grounds, sacrificing the matchbook, stepping into the projection). The interiority is textured through tactile perception rather than labels, and her conflicting impulses (yearning to hold the mother versus the image’s untouchability) play on the page. The earned shift—heavier with recollection, lighter in body—carries cost and forecloses innocence. Slight limitation: external interpersonal pressure is minimal, keeping the crucible primarily internal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held; gravity fluctuations and ritual acts compound until the projection and reconfiguration of memory. Closure lands on the page with cost (matchbook sacrifice, wildflowers consumed, flame feeding on absence) and a reweighted final image (resumed rounds with reclaimed name). Orientation is clear by ~120 words (who/where/when), and causal seams are tight within the lyric mode. The before/after is legible without over‑mechanizing the mystery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harbor, whale, and salt crystal chamber are vividly specific and consistently rule‑bound (brine as hours, gravity’s hiccups), shaping options (weightlessness, upward rain, projection surface). Recurring objects (lantern, wildflowers, matchbook) function as micro‑settings that constrain choices and charge the closing image. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered; environment evolves with events (crystals crack, whale returns to deep). The setting decisively charges the final image and tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: reclaiming a deleted past before it petrifies. Escalation arrives via the gravity surge that both threatens and enables the attempt, forcing trade‑offs (feeding the matchbook, accepting an untouchable reunion). The resolution grows from Mael’s agency and costs her tangible tokens and some absence transference (flame stretching to feed on what’s missing). Conflict remains primarily situational/inner, yet the tightening is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory as mass, grief as altered gravity, and absence as presence accrue through particulars rather than thesis. The realization that deleted memories migrate reweights the world and Mael’s vocation; the final image (lamps as buoys) answers the core question without moralizing. Subtext hums through images (coffee grounds as absences, wildflowers resurrected then spent) and invites reflection beyond plot. Ambiguity feels chosen, not evasive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and steady, with metaphor governing perception in character‑specific ways (pilots’ lore, wharf craft). Rhythm modulates with pressure; syntax remains controlled even in the surge moment. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the diction stays congruent with Mael’s world and work. Elision is purposeful and paid off in the projection sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and economical despite density; images do multiple jobs without padding. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (upward rain of shards; brine as hours) with no muddle at the peak. No loops or scaffold clutter, and sentence variety sustains momentum. The closing cadence crisps motifs without summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wholly fresh synthesis: gravity anomalies as repositories for erased memories, coffee‑ground divination, a salt‑chamber as temporal engine, and a lantern‑lighter’s vocation reframed. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes and cohere at closure. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given seeded rules (fluctuations, objects as mass food). The vision reads singular and confident.</comment>
