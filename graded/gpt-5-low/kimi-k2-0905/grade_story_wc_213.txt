<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motives and contradictions (duty vs. “favor listening over noise”) are clear and embodied through tactile choices with the rope, toggle, and barometer. Her grief for her father grounds specificity without stalling momentum. The unauthorized switch is credibly earned by her curiosity and lineage. Cost is present but quiet: professional risk and a renunciation of protocol rather than melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative pressure (barometer dips, rope’s tug, clock to 04:00) coheres toward the bell substitution and a clean on‑page closure. The final act reconfigures the premise—civic siren replaced by the bell—at real conceptual cost. Causality is tight: anomalies prompt tactic change; the timer fires; bell tolls encode the microclimate. The earned quiet after zero hour reads as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s altitude, cold, and instrumentation constrain choices and give the objects real leverage (rope, bell, parapet, servo, barometer). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true (“warm stones dropped into cold milk,” pine‑tar soap). World rules stay consistent and evolve with events (pressure dips shape tactics). Environment charges the final image and the ongoing practice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is whether to honor protocol or listen differently; escalation arrives via mounting anomalies and the rope’s “tug” demanding the bell. The decisive tightening is her rerouting of the timer and pressing the switch, foreclosing the siren path at zero hour. The price is reputational and ethical more than physical, but it’s legible and tied to her vocation. Tension scales appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—listening over noise, courtesy to the world—emerges organically through images (bell vs. siren, father’s hum vs. silence) and is reweighted at the end. A single explicit thesis line (“never about prediction but about courtesy”) slightly overstates what the images already carry. Subtext otherwise works through restraint and the charged swap of sacred/civic. The ending invites reflection without neat universalizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is controlled, lyrical, and character‑specific, with a steady perceptual signature rooted in technical attentiveness and reverence. Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction remains plausible for her expertise. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. Elision is purposeful and paid off by the bell’s cadence mapping the anomaly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is clean, varied, and efficient; figurative language is fresh and not overstacked. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; information density is high with multiple jobs per line. Images remain coherent and grounded in physics/senses. The final cadence lands without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of climatology, liturgy, and civic warning feels singular, with the bell-as-instrumental sensor a striking turn. Risks (quiet stakes, accumulative structure) heighten coherence rather than blur it. The choice to encode anomaly in peals is both inventive and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is specific and unsentimental.</comment>
