<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s drive for control through science is specific and embodied, and her fear/desire conflict sharpens as the lindens “communicate” and the veins mirror her pulse. Micro‑choices—clipping the leaf, testing in the jar, resisting then surrendering—align with motive and escalate plausibly. The cost of surrender (losing human form) lands as an earned renunciation. Minor hedge: her final conceptual leap (“knowledge wasn’t mastery—it was relationship”) edges toward articulation over dramatization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cause chains are tight: storm → anomalous veins → sample/glass intensification → power loss → physical linking → surrender and transformation, followed by an aftermath shard that consolidates consequences. The lens reads Accumulative with causal steps, culminating in an on‑page Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Cost is legible in the rooting/body change and in the altered nursery. The mosaic coda is clean and deepens the closure rather than resetting it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse, storm, mossy trellis, and sprinkler system are tactile and used—trellis catches her, sprinklers drench her by her own design, and rooting into the floor constrains choice. Weather is not decorative; it animates the linden “language” and sets the clock. Specific occupational details (pH meters, growth charts) filter through her professional bias. The final transformed nursery recharges setting as a charged object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control vs. surrender of self—tightens continuously, with the key turn being her release of control under storm pressure. Physical escalation (veins syncing, pain like roots, rooting into the floor) clarifies price. The resolution is an earned renunciation that forecloses her human path. No antagonist is needed; the situational pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of mastery vs. relationship is woven through recurring images (veins, storm, trellis, controlled systems) and culminates in the reconstructed humanity. Subtext hums via plant “language” and the assistant’s quiet acceptance. A couple lines near the end state the thesis a shade directly, slightly thinning the mystery. Still, the final image reweights knowledge as surrender without neat moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—scientific lexicon braided with vegetal imagery. Rhythm modulates well as pressure mounts, landing strong sensory cadences (“wind through hollow bamboo”). The brief zoom‑out coda retains coherence without head‑hopping. Diction remains consistent with the established stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied cadence; images do double duty (e.g., “brutal honesty of a plant forced to grow around a fence post”). A few near‑purple moments skate close to overrich but don’t blur sense. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing preserve momentum. Final lines land crisply without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Plant–human metamorphosis is familiar, yet the silver‑vein thunder sync, infrastructural complicity (sprinklers), and trellis/architecture hybrid feel fresh. The piece commits to implications—community of plants, charged aftermath—without hedging. Emotional truth around control vs. surrender reads specific to this character and place. Not radical, but confidently singular.</comment>
