<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Posy’s motivation is vivid and consistent, and her choice to open the rusted lid under the child’s request crystallizes her role and risk. Interiority is concrete (“bones humming,” the cat‑brush feeling of redemption) and choices align with her values. Internal tension—faith that the jars can “forgive history” vs. doubt about lacking the great‑grandmother’s song—registers without therapy‑speak. The small relationship beat with the child reframes her solitude into purpose with a credible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: gathering sounds → child’s request → opening the box → speaking jars into it → holographic closure. Closure lands as conceptual repricing: “We are still becoming” reweights the premise, with the cost implied in emptying the jars and surrendering curated memory into a communal device. Causality is clean and object‑driven; no teleporting rules or late cheats. The price is more implied than dramatized, keeping this just shy of the 9+ band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath dunes and the ship’s ribs create a tactile, echo‑rich cathedral that filters attention and shapes tactics (jar‑capturing, projection onto the curved ceiling). The music box functions as micro‑setting/tool charging the final image. Sensory specificity is high across senses (wind as flute, apricot salt). Environment coheres with tone and stakes without bogging momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—becoming a translator—tightens meaningfully when the child’s plea arrives, forcing Posy to risk her curated archive by opening the rusted box. The escalation is protagonist‑driven and culminates in a trade‑off: private custody of memory vs. communal becoming. Pressure deepens more than it reverses, apt for the chosen lens. The cost reads, though it could cut sharper on what is irretrievably lost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: pennies as invitations, jars as ethical memory practice, and a final shift from individual curation to communal chord. Subtextual currents (economy of memory, refugee inheritance, gift vs. sale) layer without sermonizing. The projected line borders on on‑the‑nose but remains earned by the ritualized action. The last image recasts the personal mission as a collective act without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and filtered through Posy’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. Minimal dialogue lands with purpose and subtext. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the lyric compression is taught early and sustained. Cadence modulates toward the ending hum without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet purposeful; images carry multiple jobs (setting, character, theme). Figurative language is varied and legible; no significant scaffold or synonym loops. A few dense metaphors press toward purple, but rhythm and specificity keep momentum. Proofreading and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in jars to feed a bruised music box in a dune‑buried hull is fresh and integrated, not cleverness for its own sake. The penny‑economy inversion and holographic closure feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in premise and diction heighten stakes and coherence. The synthesis is memorable and singular.</comment>
