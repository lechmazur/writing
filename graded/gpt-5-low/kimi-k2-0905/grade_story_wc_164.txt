<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist’s drive (discover why paths disappear before her memory fades) is consistent and embodied through tactile choices—pressing the crater glass, planting seeds, writing and relinquishing. The inner contradiction (laughing and crying; preservation vs. self‑erasure) reads credible. The decisive cost—living without personal memory—is legible and thematically integral. Slight softness: pressure rarely forces a hard trade‑off in-scene beyond the already accepted sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: seeds → glass fragments → personal cost → planting/farewell. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: her sacrifice is reaffirmed by the flood of saved emotions, with dawn and fading memory tightening the frame. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why) and maintained through to the beach exit. Causal seams are smooth for this lyric mode; no late rule changes undermine the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The geode cave, crater glass, phosphorescent seeds, and dawn-dimming light create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Setting constrains options via the ticking dawn and the glass’s affordances; it also charges the final image (cracked glass mist, beach seedlings). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. A strong object‑as‑setting synergy elevates the closing cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes focus on whether her sacrifice yields meaning and whether she can act before memory dissolves. Escalation is a deepening, not a reversal: fragments → personal revelation → planted legacy → affirmed worth. The price is concrete (self‑amnesia) and felt at closure. Slight limitation: opposition is largely internal/time‑bound, keeping tension more contemplative than combative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece resonates on transformation/erosion vs. renewal, with a strong image system (foam, seeds, glass, dawn) carrying subtext. The final emotional cascade answers the central question without needing exposition. However, the explicit sand message (“Every path disappears…”) veers into moralizing and reduces the lingering ambiguity. Despite that, the afterimage remains moving and coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical voice with controlled cadence; diction aligns with the fable‑like, speculative register. Psychic distance is steady, and the few spoken lines are purposeful and subtextually charged. Recurrent terms (“transliterate,” “resonance”) are patterned rather than repetitive clutter. The voice flexes with pressure (dawn approach) without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffolding; images often do double duty. Occasional purple tendencies are kept coherent by consistent metaphor families (foam, crystal, seeds, light). No major loops or cadence templates blunt momentum. Minor abstraction patches exist but do not obscure beats or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—sea‑foam recollectionist, crater glass that transliterates emotion, migratory seeds as carriers of human residue—is fresh and specific. The reweighting (disappearing paths as nutrient transformations) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, allegorical frame) pay off without confusion. The conceptual and emotional axes integrate cleanly at the end.</comment>
