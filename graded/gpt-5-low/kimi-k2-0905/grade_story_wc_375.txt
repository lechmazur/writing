<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied (iron/penny taste, cracked nails), and her contradictory impulses—hiding from the festival yet compelled to complete her mother’s work—operate simultaneously. Motivation escalates credibly from avoidance to collaboration, culminating in giving away blank sheets. The mother–daughter legacy drives micro‑choices at each beat. Slight neatness in the aphoristic line about callings reads close to thesis, but it’s earned by scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → drawing → cave response → lock/laughter → aboveground reprise. Closure lands on the page with cost (she refuses to sell portraits; leaves the lock open) and a resonant reconfiguration of the premise. Objects and environment recur causally without teleportation; setups (4‑7‑9) pay off (9‑7‑4). Orientation is clear early and remains stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cave is sensorially precise and functionally active—she pins the parchment, crystals grow along her lines, the beam ignites a lantern. Setting charges the final image and shapes tactics; it’s not postcard description. Recurring objects (lock, parchment) are integrated spatially and materially. The tonal “auroral” palette is consistent and world‑rooted.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (legacy/creativity vs. memory’s trap) is signaled early and tightens as she chooses to draw despite pain. The decisive act—completing/collaborating on the portrait—triggers the cave and the lock, leading to an earned, cost‑bearing aboveground stance. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and escalating; coincidence (the found canvas) complicates rather than resolves. A faint ease from the magical assist keeps it just shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, inheritance, and reframed vocation emerge through particulars (lock dates, laughter refracted, crystals embodying lines). The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing; her new practice (blank sheets) enacts the answer rather than states it. One explicit thesis‑like line about callings appears but is supported by concrete struggle. The subtle shift from “auroral sorrow” to “auroral becoming” is earned and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical first‑person‑close narration (filter‑light metaphors, mineral lexicon) is consistent and distinctive. Rhythm varies, and elision patterns are taught and paid off; no head‑hopping. The single on‑page spoken line feels character‑true and functional. Diction stays within the established poetic register without jarring shifts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (memory → geology; laughter → lock). Figurative language is lush but coherent within the mineral/light motif; minimal scaffolding or loops. Occasional near‑purple edges are controlled and do not blur action. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum into closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—crystal cave under a carousel, lock releasing laughter, memory accreting into geology—is striking and organic to character and stake. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the seeded dates and objects. The risk of unabashed lyricism pays off with a precise, novel final reconfiguration. Specificity and conceptual integrity push it into a memorable register.</comment>
