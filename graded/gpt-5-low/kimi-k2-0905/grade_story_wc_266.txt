<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivations are clear (restore the crossing, soothe the hound), and Jun’s decisive stamping action aligns with their “gently persistent” trait. Interiority is light; Marta’s wisdom largely manifests as pronouncements rather than tension between impulses. The hound’s arc is sketched but effective; the guides’ internal costs are muted. Still, actions emerge coherently from character and culminate in a credible reconfiguration of the guardian relationship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal line: leash broke → routes tangle → guides seek hound via indirect paths → star stamp rebinds as partnership → routes clarify. Closure lands on the page with the stamping and the hound’s return (a Decisive Change with a resonant reframing). Cost is conceptual more than felt; risk and consequence for the guides are understated. Orientation is solid and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vivid, selective worldbuilding—“veiled ridgeway,” lantern light, mist, star-stamped tools—filters through professional attention. The setting actively shapes movement (indirect routes, impossible cliff) and charges the final image (shoreline vigil restored). Consistent rule set (paths tangle without guardian) learned through action, not expository dumps. Strong atmosphere supports tone and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (unprotected crossing; tangled routes). Escalation is mostly a single deepening (the hound’s howl → confrontation → stamp) with little resistance or trade-off. The final choice is clear and protagonist-driven but pays a light price; tension never tightens to a hard squeeze. Effective but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Coherent theme (courage recognized within; duty chosen vs. imposed) is earned through the stamped partnership and restored order. However, the text overstates its thesis at points (“unused courage wasn’t something to be found but acknowledged”), edging into moralizing. Subtext exists in the partnership reframing and the lullaby tone but could trust image over paraphrase more. Resonance is present but not layered into ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third-person with consistent diction; gentle cadences match the liminal setting. Dialogue is spare and functional, with Marta’s lullaby tone distinct from Jun’s quieter presence. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping artifacts. Rhythmic modulation supports the turn at the cliff and the closing cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is generally clean and evocative; images do multi-task (tickets as permission and constellation). Some phrasing repeats or abstracts (“courage unused simply waits for recognition”), slightly dulling momentum. Syntax varies; no major metaphoric muddles. The final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The ferry guides/guardian hound/star-stamped ticket system feels fresh and internally coherent. The partnership reframing is a graceful twist, albeit gentle rather than startling. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but the synthesis is memorable. Familiar motifs (liminal crossing, courage-within) gain specificity through tools and ritual.</comment>
