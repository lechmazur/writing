<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivations are clear and rooted in duty and care; Jun’s decisive stamping choice and Marta’s calming approach track with their traits. However, interior contradiction is light—there’s little friction or cost within the guides themselves beyond steadiness under strain. The hound’s realization is credible but summarized rather than dramatized from her POV, softening the felt cost. Still, the relationship dynamic (Marta mentoring, Jun acting) creates a modest crucible that earns the closing partnership.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation and drive are strong from the opening: leash breaks → routes tangle → find the hound → rebind by choice. Causal steps escalate cleanly to the stamp that restores the ridgeway, a decisive change on the page. The cost is largely conceptual rather than materially felt, but it coheres with the mythic tone. No evident causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful—lanterns, mist, ridgeway, and the ticket punches integrate with action and closure. The tangled paths and “cliff that shouldn’t exist” constrain choices and justify “indirect routes.” Recurring objects (ticket punch, lanterns, star stamps) charge the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the crossing’s safety) is legible, with one meaningful tightening at the howl and the cliff confrontation. Escalation is gentle but coherent; Jun’s agency at the climax resolves the problem. The price is more thematic than painful, so tension never cuts particularly deep. Still, the progression from disarray to restored order is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of courage as recognition rather than acquisition are clear and recur through images (stars, tickets, leash/choice). Some lines over-articulate the thesis (“unused courage wasn’t something to be found but acknowledged”), tipping toward moralizing. Subtext does appear in the hound’s partnership mark and the guides’ craft, but the ending reiterates rather than reweights. Resonance persists, if somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the mythic register; POV distance remains stable. Dialogue is spare but functional, carrying subtext through tone rather than debate. Rhythm modulates well from hush to the decisive act without head-hopping. A few repeated constructions lean toward incantation but serve the piece’s texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean, with purposeful images doing double duty for setting and theme. Minor redundancies (“vigil in twilight,” “unused courage”) and occasional abstract phrasing soften momentum in places. Figurative language remains coherent; no mixed metaphors or cadence loops that obscure action. Final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The psychopomp premise with a star-stamping ticket punch and a self-choosing guardian hound feels distinctive and internally coherent. The reversal from leash-as-shackle to mark-as-partnership is fresh and satisfying. While the moral is familiar, the specific tools and ritual give it originality. Risks are measured and effective without obscuring clarity.</comment>
