<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Milo’s drive (to capture a color he’s never seen) is embodied in concrete choices—accepting the marble eye, guiding Rosa, smashing the work, finally renouncing painting. Interiority lands viscerally when the eye shows him “the violence of it,” making the change earned. The relationship with Rosa functions as crucible via the barter and the plant‑arrangement dialogue. Minor distance from Milo during a few summarizing passages slightly reduces intensity under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: barter → plant‑conversation → eye‑revelation → collaborative creation → deliberate shattering → spiral garden. Closure is on‑page with cost: Milo returns the eye and “never painted again,” an Earned Stasis/CR that reweights the premise. Setups pay off (reed, marble eye, ash, courtyard arrangements), and causal links are clean. The persistent constraint (colorblindness reframed rather than cured) shapes the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard, kiln, greenhouse, ash, and recurring objects are not decorative; they dictate actions (plant‑arrangement communication, glassblowing, smashing in the yard) and charge the final spiral garden image. The reed and marble eye function as micro‑settings/tools constraining choice. Sensory detail is vivid and POV‑filtered (ultraviolet ash, bruised rainbows). World rules stay consistent and learned through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to see/make beauty—tightens when the eye reveals ugly‑beautiful fracture, forcing a new tactic: collaborate, then destroy to articulate the thesis. The decisive costs (smashing creations; renouncing painting; returning the eye) are earned and escalate meaning. Pressure coheres through the accumulative pattern of barters and replies (plants). Slight softness in explicit external jeopardy is offset by the clear internal price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance is strong through images (reed song, ash rising, spiral of shards) that reframe beauty as brokenness. However, the piece states its thesis multiple times (“we are most alive where we are broken,” “we trade our wounds not to heal them...”), edging into overt moralizing and reducing subtext. The best moments show the theme (smashing the glass) rather than say it. Trimming explicit aphorisms would heighten lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature fits the fable‑like mode; diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional. Subtle shifts toward Rosa’s perspective remain coherent under a stable narrative stance. The voice modulates well at the revelation beat (“each hue screaming…”) without losing clarity. Minor omniscient glosses don’t disrupt focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid, clean images; metaphors are consistent with craft/music/heat. Rhythm varies and propulsion holds through summary spans. A few near‑aphoristic lines verge on purple, but coherence persists and no loops or scaffolding slow momentum. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: phoenix ash, a concertina reed, bartered failures, plant‑arranged dialogue, and a marble eye cohere into a fresh ritual of making and unmaking. Risks (lyric fable mode, smashing the finished art) heighten stakes and pay off cleanly. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the pattern taught early. Specific, memorable details avoid template echoes.</comment>
