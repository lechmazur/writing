<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive and urgency (thirty‑minute window) drive concrete micro‑choices: climbing, etching, accelerating at “fifteen minutes left.” Embodied strain (“lungs tasted iron”) grounds the lyric. The contradiction—artist’s compulsion vs. bodily limits—registers, though deeper ambivalence beyond homesickness is lightly sketched. The renunciation cost lands in the shell’s crumbling and her spent body at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pattern is taught early (mapping memories with the nautilus on the spire) and accrues toward an on‑page closure where the ache dissolves and the horizon imprints her eyelids. The clock structures escalation, and each memory advances the design toward conducting. The final image (shell to sand; horizon folded into a line) completes a resonant reconfiguration with cost (exhaustion, loss of tool). Orientation is clean from the opening; the accumulative lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake are not decorative: they become organ pipe and soundboard, literally generating the symphony. Weather/light at dawn (“sun skimmed its surface”) makes the mirrored horizon functional. Objects and environment constrain tactics (transparent stairs, frost blooming, wind through the spire). The final image is charged by setting mechanics (bubbles thaw into music), satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming homesickness into a conducted symphony before collapse—is clear and tightens via the ticking clock (“fifteen minutes left”) and bodily failure. Escalation flows through movements that deepen pressure rather than adding new conflicts; her agency drives each intensification. Cost is legible: she spends stamina, sacrifices the shell, and accepts an earned stasis. Slight softness in explicit external opposition keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as home, time reversed/etched, unheard symphonies—emerges from particulars (cookies, factory basement, mirrored horizon) and reweights at the end (“you are already home”). Subtext hums in the postal loops of fortunes and the ocean keeping songs the earth refused, without moralizing. The final repricing—the map is the home—answers the opening ache with resonance, not thesis. Ambiguity remains purposeful (the future child inheriting the dawn-song).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice sustains pattern and rhythm without head‑hopping. Diction is consistent with the character’s sensibility; metaphoric fields (music, shells, glass, ice) cohere. Psychic distance modulates with pressure, tightening around the movements and the countdown. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off; no stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; lines often do double duty (image + function). Figurative richness is intense but coherent to the taught motif set; clarity holds in peak beats. Sentence rhythm varies, supporting momentum from ascent to conducting to collapse. A hairline risk of purple is managed by tactile anchors (“iron,” “frost feathers,” “transparent stairs”).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—fortune cookie writer, nautilus as stylus/baton, mirrored horizon as backward score, spire‑organ over a frozen lake—is startling and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric accumulative form, extended metaphor) pay off in coherent mechanics and closure. No reliance on template beats; each fresh turn grows from seeded particulars. The closing child‑shell handoff elegantly extends the world’s logic.</comment>
