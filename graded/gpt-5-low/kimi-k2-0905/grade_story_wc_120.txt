<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and sustained (to conduct the unheard and cure chronological homesickness) and we track embodied cost (iron-taste lungs, buckling knees). Her micro-choices—etching memories as notation, accelerating under the clock—align with that drive. Internal contradiction is present (urgency vs. failing body) though not deeply dramatized as competing impulses beyond tempo. The final renunciation/earnest stasis reads earned as she lets the shell crumble and accepts a new form of “home.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative structure is taught early and holds: memories → etchings → movements → repriced horizon. Closure lands with cost on the page (exhaustion hits; the shell disintegrates) and a resonant reconfiguration (ache dissolves; horizon etched on eyelids). Orientation is clean from line one, and set-ups (mirrored horizon, shell as stylus) pay off. The causal thread is lyric but coherent, with the time constraint shaping tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The spire and frozen lake are not backdrop; they become instrument and soundboard, constraining and enabling choices. Sensory specificity is strong across senses (frost feathers, sub-audible B-flat, ink/yeast/wet cotton). World rules stay consistent within the lyric logic (mirror as backward score). The final image is charged by place: horizon folds to a line on her eyelids, portable “setting” henceforth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compose/home-before-exhaustion) is clear and tightens via the live clock and her deteriorating body. Each memory-etch escalates into movements, narrowing options toward a single conducting attempt. The visible price (spent stamina, crumbled tool) lands. Conflict is mostly internal/poetic, but it coheres and deepens under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thematic spine—memory as map/home, time’s reversals, art retrieving the refused—emerges through actions and recurring objects, not moralizing. “You are already home” arrives as chord, not thesis, and is reweighted by the closing image of the child inheriting music. The mirror motif shifts meaning from reflection to score to inner horizon. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and controlled; the diction’s musicality matches content without drifting registers. POV distance is steady and lyric elisions are pattern-taught. No head-hopping; certainty aligns with what she can perceive. Cadence modulates with pressure (fifteen-minute marker, buckling knees) effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; images do double duty (mirror as horizon/score). Figurative texture is rich but coherent; mixed metaphors are avoided and syntax varies. Momentum rarely stalls despite lyric density. Minor risk of ornamentation is contained by clear causative beats and the ticking clock.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—fortune-cookie poetics, mirrored horizon as backward score, nautilus as stylus/baton—feels singular and inevitable by closure. Risks (lyric logic, musical movements structure) heighten stakes and pay off cleanly. The child-epilogue image reframes legacy without sentimentality. Freshness permeates premise, object-work, and ending.</comment>
