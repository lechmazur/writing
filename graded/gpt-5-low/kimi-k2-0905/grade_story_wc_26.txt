<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is crystal—preserving the unshareable shape of hope—and every micro‑choice escalates it: threading reels, setting the stone between projectors, choosing not to drop it, then internalizing and finally locking it away. Contradictory impulses (preserve vs. release; share vs. protect) act simultaneously in the balcony beat. The daughter‑driven revelation (“not a scholar’s quest but a daughter’s promise”) earns the final renunciation. The cost—becoming the last dusk and locking her shadow away—lands as a credible, paid price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: pattern intensifies from noticing to vault comparison to metamorphosis to charged decision. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid—she sacrifices self-presence to preserve hope—clearly on the page. Orientation is clean early (Mira, balcony, library above clouds) and never slips. The price is legible in the final vault and “becoming the last dusk” image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming library is not postcard décor; orchids exhale dreams that materially alter the scene and charge the choice. The balcony above clouds makes the drop option tangible, and the vault provides the mechanism for the final act. The river stone functions as micro‑setting/tool, constraining tactics and charging the closing image. Sensory selection (orchid perfume, luminous pollen) is purposeful and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping hope unshareable—tightens via the stone’s warming, the footage comparison, and the metamorphosis. The balcony decision is a credible narrowing of options (drop, keep, internalize) with real cost. Pressure deepens rather than flips, fitting the accumulative design. The resolution stems from her agency and forecloses a path (the dream market’s claim on hope).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: noticing endings vs. shareable dreams; hope as shape; stone as repository. The final image reweights the premise—preservation demands personal vanishing—without sermonizing. One or two lines verge on explicit thesis (“She understood the softly deliberate choice…”) but they largely remain earned by scene. The “luminous regret” tone crystallizes the paradox without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Mira keeps distance and diction consistent. The voice’s perceptual signature—attentive to dusk shades, textures of objects—feels character‑specific. Rhythm modulates well at turns (vault, balcony, lock). No head‑hopping; purposeful compression remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is strong, with images doing multiple jobs (orchids both archive and exhale regret). A few moments push toward density saturation, but metaphors stay coherent and support clarity. No scaffolding or synonym loops; propulsion is maintained across beats. Minor purple edges do not blur the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—orchid library above clouds, dream‑market economy, dusk cataloging, a hope‑holding stone—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The “shadow unbound” integration and the final self‑sublimation are fresh, not a template twist. Risks in worldbuilding and lyric register heighten stakes without obscuring sense. The closing reconfiguration is memorable and specific.</comment>
