<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The performer’s motives—cultivating lightness within a punitive hush—are specific and embodied through whittling, logging sounds as “dirge,” and the choice to plant the stripped bouquet. Her moral ambiguity is dramatized (former informer and forger), not merely stated, and it informs her risk-taking under surveillance. The relationship with the ex-officer shifts status on the porch, creating a credible, quiet alliance. Minor limitation: interiority leans lyric-conceptual over visceral at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: narration → crow exchange → wooden feather lodged in turbine → planting → sky’s lone tear → log-line repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: performance suspended, grief given weight, possibility admitted at cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (porch, turbines, mandate aftermath), and the “silence ordinance” constraint persists to the end. Causality is soft-lyric but consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The turbines, porch, and bouquet are integrated as lived pressures: updraft steals shavings, shadows shiver flowers, ordinance polices sound, wind strips petals at climax. The environment concretely constrains tactics (labeling sound as “dirge,” planting where wind can take confetti). Recurring objects charge the final image (wooden feather anchoring stems). World rules feel learned in action without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can intentional attention and craft create permissible lightness within enforced hush—tightens via the crow’s demand, the officer’s entrance, and the public planting gesture. Costs are legible: surveillance risk, sacrifice of bouquet, and a refusal to perform “hopeful noise” overtly (classifying as dirge). Escalation is accumulative, not reversal-driven, but pressure grows to a credible cadence shift. The lone tear provides a charged, not convenient, complicating response rather than resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of grief-as-soil, art-as-defiance, and complicity versus repair arise from concrete acts (whittled feather jamming machinery, planting bare stems). Subtext is carried by image, gesture, and silence; the officer’s scratched badge and “performance suspended” line avoid sermonizing while reweighting the frame. The crow’s line reframes guilt as portable, tying ethics to action. Aphoristic moments (“Grief is soil”) are earned by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice holds throughout, with measured modulation at pressure points. Dialogue feels pointed and subtextual (the officer’s question, the crow’s barter), serving action rather than explaining it. POV remains stable and plausible despite elevated diction, which suits the performer’s ritualized narration. Rhythm and syntax vary to match beats without murk.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, action, and theme—without padding or loops. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (television after sign-off, wooden feather lodged in turbine), avoiding mixed metaphors. Momentum is maintained through purposeful line breaks and escalating images. No noticeable scaffolding, filter stacks, or register drift at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-mandate “remade hush,” bureaucratic sound-logging, a crow bargaining for a carved guilt-splinter, turbines as choreographers—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (speaking crow, aphoristic narration, quasi-allegorical systems) pay off in concrete choices and costs. Key turns arise from established patterns (whittling becomes sabotage and planting ritual). The final repricing (“performance suspended; lightness possible”) is non-obvious and resonant.</comment>
