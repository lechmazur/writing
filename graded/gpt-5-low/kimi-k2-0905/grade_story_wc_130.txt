<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (restore the orchard/approach the master’s absence) drives concrete, inventive choices: aligning the glass eyes, activating the mosaic, climbing, and sealing the astrolabe. Interiority is specific and embodied (“A conjurer does not cry; instead I recited primes…”), revealing tension between discipline and grief. The endurance at the end—accepting ambiguity while restoring motion—carries a felt cost. Slight softness: the ritual unfolds with little resistance, so struggle reads gentle rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: mosaic → astrolabe → projection → seedlings → restoration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: music returns, options reweight, and the protagonist accepts a limit rather than certainty. Causal links are clean within the dream-logic; set-ups (chipped mosaic, dripping stalactite, glass eyes) pay off. The mechanisms succeed on first tries, muting the sense of narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is exquisitely realized and functionally constraining: dripping stalactites, chipped mosaic, fossil trunk, and moonlight all shape tactics. The environment charges the final image as the orchard’s song resumes, reweighting grief into motion. Sensory integration feels character-filtered through mathematical craft. Minor note: the world stays consistently wondrous but largely cooperative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reanimating the orchard as a proxy confrontation with ambiguous loss—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative turns (the click, the sighing shift, the opening stone, the symbol’s pulse). Agency drives each step, and the cost is credible: answers are foregone for restored motion and caretaking. Pressure rises via pattern density rather than overt impediments, which keeps tension quiet. One charged renunciation—sealing the astrolabe—provides the needed narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of ambiguous loss and “solving for motion” emerges organically from action, not sermon. Recurring objects (eyes, mosaic, drip) accrue meaning and culminate in a conceptual repricing: emotion shifts from number to locus, and grief finds a limit rather than a solution. The final optimism is honest, not pat, preserving cost. A single explicit statement (“Emotion is not a number…”) borders on told insight but aligns with the voice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—lyric, mathematically inflected, and consistent in distance—without head-hopping. Rhythm varies with pressure, and diction suits a conjurer who “trades in vanished things.” Elision is purposeful and paid off in concrete turns. No dialogue is needed; the internal cadence carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and economical; images often do double duty (the integral cradling a heart bridges math and feeling). Figurative density is high but coherent, avoiding muddle and loops. Sentence rhythm supports momentum from hush to activation to release. A few ornate phrasings risk purple, yet clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—conjuration through mathematical motifs in a mineral orchard—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Turns grow from seeded particulars, not bolt-on cleverness. Risks in metaphor and worldbuilding pay off at closure without obscuring meaning. Emotional truth grounds the strangeness.</comment>
