<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is precise and embodied—honoring Edda against institutional erasure—and her choices (self‑exile, decoding, confronting Voss, choosing to stay) align. Interiority is vivid via tactile motifs (copper nail, kelp‑stink) and work‑specific habits (singing coded lullabies). The relationship with Voss creates a credible crucible that shifts status on the page. A slight convenience in Voss’s quick alignment trims some friction but doesn’t undercut motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal: decoding → confrontation → joint model overlay → dirigible retrieval → appeal → chosen stasis. Closure lands with cost as she refuses immediate return despite reversal granted, reframing exile. Orientation is clean from the first line; constraints (storms, restricted zone) persist and shape tactics. A small coincidence (wreck proximity) is acknowledged and then solved through agency rather than luck.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The weather station is sensorially alive and constraining—squalls, anemometers, holotable, dirigible, restricted test zone—shaping each choice. Recurring objects (copper nail) and environmental pressures charge the final images (etching coordinates into glass, light refracting maps across rain). World rules are internally consistent and learned through action. The setting’s textures modulate tone and meaning, not just atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring erased bravery—tightens through concrete turns: decoding under storm pressure, challenging Voss, risking a flight in dangerous weather. The price is on‑page (physical risk, social risk, and the chosen cost of remaining in exile conditions). External opposition from the Ministry softens quickly, limiting late‑stage resistance. Still, escalation coheres under the causal lens and culminates in an earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs. institutional denial, legacy, and “reversible exile” are dramatized through specific images and choices, not moralizing. The copper/verdigris motif and weather as archive elegantly reweight meaning at the end. The key question functions as subtext engine rather than thesis statement, returning reframed with communal breadth. The final image (maps refracting across rain) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinctive, lyrical third‑person close maintains consistent distance and diction tuned to a map‑librarian’s sensibility. Sparse dialogue is purposeful and carries subtext (the catalytic question to Voss). Rhythm and syntax vary with pressure; metaphors stay mission‑aligned to weather and metal. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet purposeful, with minimal scaffold and high information yield across images and action. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (semaphore ink, shield‑shaped chart, verdigris thumbprint). Momentum holds through descriptive passages; no notable loops or muddle at peak beats. A few “lyric” intensifiers approach abundance but remain legible and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—map librarian decoding salt‑cipher stanzas at a storm‑bound station under a law of reversible exile—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Objects and weather metaphysics are integrated, not decorative, and the Act’s conceptual turn is fresh. The dirigible recovery and refracted‑light mapping avoid trope traps through specificity. Risk‑taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
