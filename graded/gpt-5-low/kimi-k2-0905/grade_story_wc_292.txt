<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation (to vindicate Edda) is specific, persistent, and drives every choice from self-exile to her final renunciation of immediate return. Interiority is embodied through tactile motifs (the copper nail’s pulse, imprint) rather than labels. The Voss relationship adds a credible crucible and shifts status when her question forces his admission. The refusal to go home after winning is an earned cost that crystallizes her values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: exile → decoding → confrontation → overlay → dirigible search → recovery → appeal → chosen stay. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she can return but elects to remain, reweighting “reversible” with cost. Minor conveniences (Voss’s swift reversal, wreck nine miles away, rapid Ministry response) soften resistance but don’t break causality. The drive lens holds cleanly through the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The weather station and incessant rain are lived-in, tool-rich constraints (holotable, restricted zone, dirigible) that shape tactics and access. Environmental pressure (squalls, wind shear) is integrated with decoding and the search. The copper verdigris palette and atmospheric textures unify tone with place. The final image of etched coordinates on glass refracting across rain is charged by setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (truth vs. erasure) and tighten at the Voss confrontation and dirigible launch. The decisive turn stems from Mara’s question, which converts institutional pressure into alliance and action. Costs are felt more conceptually than viscerally; opposition yields quickly. Still, the renunciation at the end carries a credible price that charges the closing beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motifs (verdigris nail, rain, reversal, mapping) accrue into a coherent meditation on memory, bravery, and institutional erasure. The title idea “reversible exile” is reinterpreted at closure when she declines the granted return. A single line risks on-the-nose statement (“What bravery is so inconvenient...”) but it functions as a catalytic action, not sermon. The final refracted map of overlooked bravery is a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice matches the archivist’s sensibility, with concrete professional noticing (cipher, micro-maps) anchoring flight. POV is stable and distance modulates well through stress, with dialogue used sparingly but effectively as action. Diction is consistent and character-specific; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythmic control supports momentum despite density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (verdigris linking nail, thumbprint, corrosion, and theme). Lyric figuration is rich but mostly disciplined; minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but retain clarity and pressure. The closing image is sharp and unblurred by metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of climatological futurism with archival sleuthing and reversible exile feels fresh. The copper nail as moral and material compass is an elegant, specific throughline. Turns arise from character agency and patterned logic rather than gimmicks. Boldness in concept is matched by coherent follow-through to a charged, non-obvious ending.</comment>
