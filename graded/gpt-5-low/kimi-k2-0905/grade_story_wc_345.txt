<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s altruism, doubt, and tactical tenderness (“she circled the canopy…only when hands below were ready to catch”) create a credible, motivated arc toward release. Interiority is shown through embodied, specific acts (frost‑letters, counterweighting) rather than labels. Kai’s responses deepen the relational crucible without stealing focus. The visible cost—accepting departure once the community can stand—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean accumulative structure across three dawns: messages → mobilization → coordinated harvest → release. Causality holds: dying anti‑grav seeds necessitate harvest; chalk prompts action; bell organizes cadence; success loosens Mara’s tether. Closure lands on‑page with cost as Mara rings farewell and dissolves into the nebula. The epilogue reweights the arc without soft‑resetting stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet’s floating arches, arch winds, ladders, and anti‑grav seeds directly constrain tactics and shape the climax. Recurring objects (bell, chalked sidewalks) function as lived micro‑settings charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (violet on tongues; bronze warmth) without tourist cataloging. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the orchards before the eclipse—tightens through staged mobilization, mistrust → trust, and the dangerous harvest chain. The key deepening is Mara proving reliability through labor and becoming literal counterweight, narrowing options to collective action. The price is legible: risk aloft and Mara’s relinquishment of presence. Tension breathes but continues to rise to the arch‑righting sigh.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Grief transmuted into communal agency (“brambled hope”) accrues through concrete acts; motifs reprice at the end (bell’s tone unbrambled, nebula as communal reservoir). The piece invites reflection on trust and belonging without sermonizing—mostly. The chalked aphorism “Ghost or gardener…” skews didactic, mildly flattening subtext at the brink of closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“a clang like berries caught in wire”) stays controlled and legible. Distance is calibrated, letting communal beats in without head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and patterned diction (“brambled hope”) reads taught and purposeful. Dialogue is minimal but not missed; action carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (tone, world, theme). Figurative language is rich but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors; repetition (bell, frost) is patterned rather than looped. A few intensifiers could be trimmed, but momentum holds to the end. Final cadence is precise and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ghost‑as‑organizer on a sci‑fi orchard with a grief‑slowing nebula and frost‑chalk tactics feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The bell’s “brambled hope” is an original tonal engine, not ornament. Risks in hybrid lyric/plot integration pay off with clarity and resonance. The synthesis of communal SF and elegiac fable reads singular.</comment>
