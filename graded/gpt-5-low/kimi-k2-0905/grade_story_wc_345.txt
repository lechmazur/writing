<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s altruistic drive is clear and consistent, and her tactical shift—from feared spirit to trusted coordinator—tracks through concrete choices (frost-chalk, labor as proof, counterweighting). Interiority is mostly externalized via image and action, but the doubt beat (“why follow a ghost…”) anchors a credible internal pressure. Kai’s role as responsive foil deepens social stakes without stealing focus. The cost—her release after success—feels earned by prior motives.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid causal/accumulative drive holds: the orchards’ failure risk compels the chalk-plan, which compounds into ladders, chains, and Mara’s balancing move. Closure lands decisively with orchards righted and Mara’s tether releasing, carrying emotional cost. Setups (bell, nebula, arches) pay off in the end image. No orientation debt; the pattern is taught early and coheres through to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional: floating arches, anti-grav seeds, and “arch wind” actively constrain tactics (ladders, human chains, counterweight). Recurring objects (watering bell, chalk) charge both action and final image. Sensory detail (violet nebula taste, coffee aroma) supports tone without stalling momentum. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the orchards before the eclipse—drives escalation from messages to coordinated harvest under literal peril (tilting arches). A meaningful tightening arrives with the “together or tilt the sky” directive, forcing communal action. The resolution stems from agency (Mara’s balancing, colony’s chains) with on-page cost (her departure). Tension interweaves internal trust and external logistics cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of communal survival, grief metabolized into labor, and “brambled hope” emerge organically through repeated images and acts. The bell and frost-writing accrue meaning that reweights the ending. Slight deduction for the explicit maxim (“Ghost or gardener, family is the crop we keep replanting”), which edges toward moralizing in a peak position. Nonetheless, the final violet-merging image resonates beyond statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident lyrical third-person maintains stable focalization and a distinctive perceptual signature (“frosted whisper,” “brambled hope”). Rhythm modulates well across planning and action beats, with purposeful diction and image patterns. No head-hopping; elisions are taught and legible. The voice sustains pressure without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful images, and balanced sentence rhythms. A few metaphoric stacks flirt with purple, but coherence holds and no key beat is obscured. Recurrences (bell/bramble) feel pattern-driven rather than redundant. Syntax maintains propulsion through the harvest sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—ghost logistics, chalk-frost messaging, anti-grav orchards, a grief-slowing nebula—feels fresh and necessary, not ornamental. The “counterweight ghost” turn is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. The tonal coinage “brambled hope” is memorable and reconfigured by the final “unbrambled” note. Bold choices heighten stakes without confusing causality.</comment>
