<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to repair generational silence and retool a dangerous language—drives concrete micro‑choices (writing each promise, daring the final phrase). Contradictory impulses (careful vs. reckless) are embodied in her trembling hand and disciplined prep. The cost—her voice subsumed/reconfigured—is felt, not just declared. Slight abstraction in places keeps the inner conflict from absolute peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural pressure builds cleanly through the sequence of promises to the on‑page closure where she completes the symphony. The missing final section as “negative space” is a strong causal reveal that reweights options. Cost is legible: the ink well shatters and her voice transforms, foreclosing the “document only” path. Orientation is clear early and the drive lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is sensorially vivid (fluorescent hum frequency, books as “coffin of sound”) and becomes active at closure as the walls sing. The glass ink well functions as a charged micro‑setting object that constrains and culminates the action. Details are filtered through a linguist’s bias, integrating world rules with event. The dawn exit over glittering shards charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resurrection vs. weaponization of language; moral compass vs. council) is early and coherent. Escalation is the progression through promises, with the third and the “final voice” requirement tightening options decisively. Resolution stems from Elara’s agency with an unmistakable price. The pressure is lyric rather than adversarial but remains taut.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of which silences merit breaking is earned through concrete acts (promises as harmonics; weapon → bridge). Family voices returning reframes language as trust, not power, delivering a resonant non‑literal answer. One line edges toward statement (“not document extinction but resurrection”) but the images do the heavy lift. Subtext hums via the negative space reveal and the cost of becoming the last note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice suits a scholar flirting with dangerous music; diction and rhythm modulate with the crescendo. No head‑hopping or stance drift; focalization remains tight. Elevated register matches character and stakes, avoiding exposition. The prose carries momentum without explanatory crutch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line work is precise, image‑rich, and multi‑tasking; metaphors (“coffin of sound,” “audible light”) are coherent with the premise. Syntax varies with pressure, avoiding loops or scaffold. Information density remains high without muddle, and the final image releases stored charge. No figurative clashes or register jolts in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of linguistics, harmonic resonance, and treaty‑promises as a literal symphony is distinctive and fully pursued. The negative space as final section feels inevitable in hindsight. The glass heirloom’s shattering reimagines “breaking” as release, not ruin. Concept and emotion interlock without safety hedging.</comment>
