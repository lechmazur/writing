<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motivation (to prove sideways time) collides with embodied ambivalence about her prosthetic lungs and identity. Micro‑choices under pressure—engaging the lever, lowering it by degrees, then renouncing further pull—reveal values with cost. The chrysalis/imago recognition integrates with her actions rather than reading as a tidy label. A slight tilt toward abstraction in one or two lines keeps this just shy of transcendent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: lever → projections → moth‑bat interference → realization → renunciatory return to stasis. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost: she foregoes altering the past and accepts the constraint of her mechanical lungs. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no causality breaks. The conceptual reweighting is felt through concrete beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The station, aviary, lever, and nexus are tactile and constrain choice; object‑as‑setting charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (icy warmth, subsonic hum, glassy pinions) and filtered through the mechanic’s priorities. World rules are learned through use (projections, ratios) rather than exposition. Setting directly shapes the turning points and the end’s charged poise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—alter fate vs. accept identity—tightens as the lever’s activation summons interfering songs that reweight options. The moth‑bat ratio and “subdued awakenings” deepen pressure in line with the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her refusal and its consequences for selfhood and future possibilities. Escalation is quiet but decisive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images (chrysalis, lattice of choices, icy warmth) rather than moralizing, culminating in a resonant refusal that redefines “proof.” The sideways‑time doorway vs. equation reframes her quest without evasiveness. Recurrences (nexus pulse, wings at rest) return reweighted at the end. One overt metaphor (“the station was such a chrysalis”) is earned by scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with controlled distance; diction fits a technical yet sensuous mind. Rhythm modulates with pressure (lever activation to quiet poise) without opacity. No head‑hopping, and purposeful elision is taught and paid off. The perceptual signature (mechanically warm, sideways tilt) is memorable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line‑level control is high: imagery serves sense and action, metaphors are coherent and non‑competing, and sentences carry multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; momentum is maintained despite lyric density. The final images crystalize without purple drift. Technical lexicon is precise and character‑bound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a “sky mechanic” with prosthetic lungs interfacing a nexus, moth‑bats singing interference, and sideways time as door not theorem. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring closure. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight from seeded particulars (ratio, hesitation angle, lever degrees). The piece commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>
