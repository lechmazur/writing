<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Caldera’s motives—preserving honest methods and countering denial—drive concrete actions (diving, forging the femur-stylus, publishing a counter-narrative). Her rational rebellion is embodied (sewage micro-doses, refusal of lines) and costs her social standing at the end. Interiority is textured through the cog/sea metaphors rather than label-speak. The final stance (public pronouncement despite recoil) reads as earned endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details layer from sewer to sump to inscription to public speech, culminating in a charged poise/CR ending. Closure lands on-page as she plants the lead sheet and then risks a public stance; the crowd’s recoil makes the cost legible. Set-ups (competing ledgers, street renaming, honest clocks) pay off in her counter-clock act. Orientation is clear from the outset and supports the final reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken city, sewers, strata, and maritime instruments are vividly tactile and filtered through Caldera’s priorities. Environment and tool constrain tactics (tunnel mapping, sump discovery, saline cementing, cog as stylus) and charge the final image. Sensory detail balances smell, touch, and sight without tourist cataloging. World rules stay consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether truth can be inscribed against the city’s denial; it tightens as she discovers the sump and chooses to carve and then speak. The decisive deepening is the burial sump scene where status and story equalize in death, compelling her act. The social price is immediate in the crowd’s recoil, reweighting the stakes from private method to public risk. Escalation is internal-external braid rather than adversarial, but it’s sufficient and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. denial and time as an honest mechanic arise organically from ledgers, cogs, strata, and the city’s nightly repainting. Subtext works through images (sewer filtration as epistemology) and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. The single aphoristic line risks didacticism but feels character-voiced and supported by prior action. The final image reweights prior motifs without flattening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled voice—briny, mechanical, sedimentary—matches Caldera’s mind and state. Distance and diction are stable, with lyric compression that remains legible and purposeful. Minimal dialogue, but her lone line carries subtext and character. No head-hopping or stance drift; rhythm modulates well across pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; sentences propel rather than stall. A few lush metaphors push toward purple but maintain coherence and do not blur action. No scaffold loops or template cadences evident; punctuation and syntax are clean. The final beat is crisp and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—plague-denial city, sewer epistemology, cog-as-counter-clock—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, macabre stylus, conceptual closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Objects and environment are re-purposed in original ways that serve character and theme. The ending’s reconfiguration is non-obvious yet earned.</comment>
