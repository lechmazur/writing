<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (purify the archive) deepens into a credible inner contradiction: purification threatens erasure of self. Embodied pressure appears in tactile details (sweat in the veil, copper‑tasting corridors) and micro‑choices (refusing patterns; choosing exit; later teaching). The shift from solitary purifier to communal rememberer reads earned and costly. Slight distance from other on‑page characters limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: recurring objects and rules (pagoda, veil, algorithms, “avoiding patterns”) build to a conceptual repricing—purify = carry gently. Orientation is clean early; transitions from archive to wasteland to tribe are legible. Closure lands on the page with a charged final image (lanterns, pagoda in bones) and a felt cost. Minor softness in causal tightening (few direct tests resist her) keeps it below 9.2.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archive is vivid and rule‑bearing (defensive algorithms, screaming equations) and it meaningfully shapes tactics (random walking to evade detection). Recurring objects (pagoda, veil) function as micro‑settings and charge the ending. Sensory selection is specific and purposeful across senses. Occasional lyric flourish edges toward overt symbolism but largely serves atmosphere and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purify without losing self) is declared early and tightens as the archive tempts assimilation. A meaningful deepening occurs when purification is redefined and she rejects solitary stewardship, choosing communal burden. The exit mechanic (“walk backward while facing forward”) functions as an earned tactic from the “avoid patterns” rule. External opposition resolves with relative ease, muting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: memory as beautiful contamination rather than cleansing, realized through concrete actions and recurrences. The pagoda and atoms of nostalgia reweight meaning in the close without sermonizing. One line edges toward thesis statement (“to purify wasn’t to erase”) but the surrounding images earn it. Ambiguity persists productively in the notion of shared burden and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent; diction aligns with the world’s metaphoric logic. Distance control holds to a close third with confident compression. Refrains (“by avoiding patterns”) are pattern‑taught and purposeful. Richness flirts with saturation but maintains legibility and cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, original turns; sentence rhythms vary and propel. Some metaphoric stacking (“copper tears,” “screaming equations,” “atoms of nostalgia”) risks purple accumulation but remains coherent. Minimal scaffolding or loops; proofreading is clean. The density slightly blurs force contours at peaks, trimming headroom.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a defensive archive gamed via anti‑pattern walking, a bronze prism pagoda, and “atoms of nostalgia” reimagining memory ethics. The turn to communal curation feels both non‑obvious and inevitable from prior particulars. Risks in form and iconography pay off without obscuring clarity. Not revolutionary, but distinctly rendered and memorable.</comment>
