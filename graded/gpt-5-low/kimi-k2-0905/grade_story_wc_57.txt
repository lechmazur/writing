<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ari’s motive (preserve method to save storm-corn) is clear and embodied in micro-choices—coaxing the rope, warming the knot, cracking the bead under pressure. Her patience reads as a practiced flaw/virtue that slows her when speed would be safer. Relationship pressure with the harbormaster is legible and forces a stance. Slightly limited internal contradiction; she’s mostly resolute rather than torn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: decoding actions, environmental cues, and authority pressure accrete toward a charged planting. Closure lands on the page with cost (sacrificing a bead, legal risk) and a conceptual repricing (heritage as living practice). Because/therefore links are subtle but coherent (harbormaster’s step → chime → final syllable → bead crack → plant → escape). The single-scene architecture is tight and fulfills its own promises.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly tactile and functional: snow, fog, and dock acoustics shape tactics (muffle, conceal, constrain movement). The rope and fulgurite function as micro-setting tools, charging the final image and choice. Maritime specificity feels lived-in, with weather and materials affecting action. Occasional lyric flourish skirts overrichness but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (decoding stanza to plant) and tightens with the harbormaster’s arrival and the brittle fulgurite’s fragility. The key turn (dock groan triggers chime → final syllable) is earned and alters options. The price is present but modest; fog’s convenient cover slightly softens consequence. Still, agency drives the outcome through tactful, risky choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: living knowledge vs. museum heritage is enacted in rope-decoding and the on-dock planting. The final image reframes tradition as practice and growth, not preservation alone. One line explicitly states the thesis (“Heritage is a seed, not a glass case”), but it’s dramatized, not sermonized. Subtext hums in the hush, knots-as-language, and ocean-as-scribe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, maritime-lyric yet controlled, aligned with Ari’s vocation and patience. POV distance is stable; brief dialogue carries status dynamics and subtext cleanly. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from patient decoding to swift escape) without losing clarity. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense and precise; images do multiple jobs (fulgurite as light, time, and code). Syntax varies; momentum holds through descriptive passages. A few metaphoric stacks approach purple but do not blur causality or closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Secret weavers encoded in rope, fulgurite as sky-fire memory, and seed lore fused to lightning feel striking and new. The chime-triggered syllable and planting-on-dock turn are inventive and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric density pay off with coherence. The synthesis feels singular rather than assembled from common tropes.</comment>
