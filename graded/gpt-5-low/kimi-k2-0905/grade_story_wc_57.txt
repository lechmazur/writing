<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ari’s motive—to preserve living knowledge—drives every micro‑choice, from warming the crown‑in‑reverse to cracking the bead despite its archival value. Interiority is filtered through tactile action rather than label‑speak, giving us a credible, embodied practitioner. The harbormaster adds status pressure that she negotiates with patience rather than bravado. A touch more contradictory impulse on the page would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: decoding → intrusion → chime → bead crack → planting → escape → dawn reprise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a seed sprouts through the dock, conceptually reweighting “heritage” with on‑page cost (sacrificing artifact, risk of confiscation). Orientation is clean from the first line. The chime completing the stanza leans slightly convenient but doesn’t undercut causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly integrated: snow, fog, and the golden dock constrain tactics and charge the final image (a green shoot piercing salted wood). The rope/fulgurite functions as micro‑setting and tool, shaping what’s possible. Details stay POV‑filtered through a seed collector’s priorities. Atmosphere deepens pressure rather than pausing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes (recover the storm‑corn method before authorities erase it) are active and tighten with the harbormaster’s approach. Ari’s decisive acts—completing the stanza, cracking the fulgurite bead, planting on the dock—foreclose alternatives and carry risk. The fog clock and brittle glass add constraint. Escalation remains coherent and culminates in an earned, high‑charge image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of living heritage versus curation, language encoded in craft, and ocean as memory emerge through concrete acts and a reweighted final image. The rope‑as‑text motif evolves into action and cost. One explicit line (“Heritage is a seed, not a glass case”) edges toward thesis, but the piece otherwise trusts subtext. The ending invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A supple, lyrical third‑person close sustains a distinct perceptual signature—tactile, patient, sea‑salted. Dialogue is sparse but pointed and reveals status dynamics. Rhythm modulates under pressure without losing clarity. Diction remains consistent with Ari’s world and craft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (fulgurite as time capsule, tool, and symbol). Figurative language is frequent yet controlled, with minimal redundancy and no mixed metaphors muddying key beats. Momentum holds through sentence‑level variety. A couple of lush lines flirt with purple but stay legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—tide‑scribes encrypting agronomy in knots, lightning vitrifying rope into glass that holds a seeded signature—is striking and grounded in action. Turns and payoffs feel inevitable in hindsight once the system is taught. Risk‑taking in conceit and image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
