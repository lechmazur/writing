<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior conflict—skepticism shattered yet yearning for a restored “click of rightness”—is embodied and specific, and her micro‑choices (following the new path, accepting the map, setting the tooth) align with motive under pressure. The horror is morally complex (“the fraud had been tender”), avoiding neat absolution. The final stance (living with bright fractures) carries a felt cost without safety‑hedging. Minor aphoristic moments from the changeling don’t undercut her credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: present‑scene quest → path → sundial → invitation → tooth‑setting → dawn repricing. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she chooses to live by a new rule that accepts fracture, with cost tethered to her frozen‑hour verdict and village implications. Orientation is clear early; causal ellipses feel magical but coherent. The tightening is modest yet purposeful and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden/maze is vivid and integrally functional—hedges open a path, the sundial fixes her prior verdict, and the rewoven labyrinth and pear trees charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (mint, iron, dew) and filtered through Elara’s bone‑setter eye. Environment constrains and enables choices, meeting the high‑band gate. World rules stay consistent within the fable‑lyric register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to metabolize a grave misjudgment—tightens when the path appears and she confronts the changeling’s offer. The decisive gesture (inserting the tooth) forecloses the pursuit of former certainty in favor of a costlier ethic. Stakes are moral and internal rather than perilous, but consequences for identity and communal narrative are legible. A hair more antagonistic resistance might have heightened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness, utility of lies, and strength at the “angle of wounding” emerge through concrete images and charged objects rather than didactic summary. The final constellation/jaw set reweights the premise and offers a non‑literal answer. One line of overt thesis from the changeling (“every mistake is a seed…”) flirts with moralization, but the piece otherwise trusts image and action. Ambiguity remains meaningful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and steady in POV, with controlled shifts in intensity. Diction (“tasting chalk and thunder,” “nostalgic innovation”) reads character‑specific and world‑coherent. Dialogue is sparse, musical, and functions as action/subtext rather than exposition. No head‑hopping or distance leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line craft is supple and economical for its density; metaphors are mostly precise and layered, doing more than one job. Rhythm varies; no scaffold or paraphrase loops; closures are crisp. Lushness skirts purple once or twice but never muddies sense or momentum. Final images are sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Changelings reframed through bone‑setting and constellation cartography feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The sundial vertebra and yew‑log “body” synthesize folklore and moral calculus inventively. Risks in lyric mythmaking pay off without sacrificing clarity. The vision reads singular and confident.</comment>
