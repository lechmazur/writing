<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lin’s motive and temperament are vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices (rolling the clay hive, aligning the glass, then leaving) reveal a values hierarchy with a felt renunciation. Interiority is embodied through tactile noticing and craft logic. However, there’s little active contradiction or visible struggle; her competence rarely meets real resistance. The cost is present (she leaves; the oasis will vanish again) but the path to it is largely unopposed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear and held: thrum → finding the tree via sun patterns → aligning fractured timelines → bees return → covenant and departure. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: “the oasis would vanish again,” and she chooses to leave carrying the lantern’s memory. The world’s rules (kindness as phototropism; lantern glass as time lens) are taught through action and then cashed out. Orientation is clean early, and no causal breaks undercut the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The oasis, hives, apricot tree, and wasteland are sensorially specific and instrumental—setting dictates tactics (locate the tree via soot-scribed sun patterns; place the clay hive; funnel light). The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Environmental logic holds and evolves with each beat (dew, bees, fruit), and the final compass-like tree seals the place-character bond. The tone is inseparable from place, deepening atmosphere without museum-tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and tightens: the thrum intensifies, multiple timelines crowd, and Lin chooses an action (make/offer a hive; align light) that reweights options and yields a price (she leaves what she restored). Stakes are quiet but legible—reviving a place’s capacity for kindness and bearing it forward. The primary limitation is low antagonistic friction; the path rarely narrows except by principle. Still, a meaningful deepening occurs and consequences persist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thematic integration is strong and image-led—kindness as something environments can learn to lean toward; memory as an energy that requires tending. Recurrences (thrum, glass, phototropism, smoke flattening) shift meaning at the end. However, the line “memory travels forward only when carried by kindness” states the thesis too directly, edging into moralizing in the final movement. The resonance remains, but subtlety takes a hit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice filters every detail through a potter’s sensibility and calm attention; rhythm modulates with pressure (thrum intensifies, then softens). POV distance and certainty stay consistent; the visionary moments remain anchored by tactile choices. Diction is precise and character-true, with patterned elision taught and paid off. No head-hopping or dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful; metaphors generally cohere (phototropism, glazing, soot-maps) and carry multiple jobs. A few sentences verge on purple or redundancy, but momentum holds and information density is high. Syntax varies and enjambs with scene needs; the final images are clean. Minor overwriting prevents a higher tier, not clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Beekeeping, pottery, and time-tending synthesize into a fresh mythopoetic logic; “phototropic to kindness” feels newly minted and consequential. The fractured-timeline mechanic shapes tactics, not just theme, and the lantern glass as cracked lens is a memorable innovation. The risk of overt sentiment is mostly avoided by concrete, craft-driven moves. The final covenant with the child elegantly extends the premise without collapsing into trope.</comment>
