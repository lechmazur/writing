<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear and character-particular: restore communal harmony by subtracting her own noise. Interiority is embodied (the rosette drinking lamplight; “frequencies anger forgets”), and her rage is acknowledged then worked through via action. The decisive sacrifice—offering her voice—reads earned by prior steps. Slight softness: the process feels relatively unresisted, with minimal friction beyond the internal, trimming peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: listening → collecting syllables → recognition of missing root → sacrifice → city-wide reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early and the equinox window provides an implicit clock. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she never sings again; the rosette crumbles; her silence re-tunes the city. Cost is on-page and reshapes options post-scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The velvet library is sensorially vivid and functionally constraining (one night access; equinox; the nave’s moonbeam). The mulberry rosette functions as micro-setting/tool and charges the final image (untouched dust circle). Details are POV-filtered (“saffron, iron, and river water”) and evolve with action. Environment meaningfully steers tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlearning hatred via subtractive harmony) tightens at the missing root beat, forcing the costly choice to relinquish her voice. Pressure builds coherently under the accumulative lens; the sacrifice is a clear narrowing of options. The rosette’s dissolution and her permanent silence underline consequence. A slightly greater sense of potential failure might have heightened urgency further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and act: harmony by subtraction; vanishing arts as latent negative space; silence as root tone. The final repricing—quiet becoming the city’s fundamental—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Lines like “vanishing arts do not disappear; they wait inside negative space” feel earned by the scene’s mechanics. Resonance lingers with conceptual and emotional clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“traveled stillness,” “frequencies anger forgets”) holds steady. Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction is precise and character-coherent. No head-hopping or distance slippage; elision is purposeful. The voice sustains both atmosphere and action without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet clean; metaphors are consistent with the acoustic/silence motif and avoid muddle. Sentences do multiple jobs, advancing atmosphere and stakes without redundancy. No scaffold or paraphrase loops; cadence varies with intent. Peak beats stay lucid despite lyric intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a subtractive art of harmony, embodied in a zither rosette, in a velvet library ritual tied to an equinox. The transformation of silence into a social root tone feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity prevents template drift.</comment>
