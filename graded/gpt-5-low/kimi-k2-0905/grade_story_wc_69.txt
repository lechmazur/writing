<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—unlearning hatred by subtracting noise—is clear, character-specific, and enacted through concrete micro-choices (humming, collecting syllables, offering her voice). Her contradictory impulses (rage as a drone vs. disciplined listening) surface on the page and resolve via a credible renunciation. The visible cost—she never sings aloud again—feels earned. Only minor softness: resistance is largely internal and glides smoothly, lowering friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: the ritual actions build density to a reweighted end-state. Closure lands on-page with cost in the dawn beat (rosette crumbling; her permanent silence becoming the city’s root tone). Orientation is secure from the first line, and all set-ups (equinox stay, rosette, “subtracting noise”) pay off. The causal weave is lyric but coherent: each step narrows to the required sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The velvet library is vivid across senses and functions as a pressure-creating container (one visitor, equinox window, moonlight beam). The rosette-as-tool operates as micro-setting, constraining tactics and charging the final image (untouched dust circle). Details (saffron/iron/river water, stained glass) are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment meaningfully shapes choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes consolidate early (“measure silence” to unlearn hatred) and tighten when seventeen syllables lack a root tone, forcing sacrifice. The escalation is a decisive deepening under the chosen lens rather than a reversal; the price is legible and permanent. Internal and external threads cohere (city soundscape shifts because of her renunciation). Quiet pressure, but it unmistakably concentrates toward the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of harmony-through-subtraction, vanishing arts, and the redefinition of “enemy” emerge from action and image, not sermon. The final repricing—silence as root tone—reweights all prior motifs with emotional and social cost. Recurrence (traveled stillness, braided voices, the rosette’s circle) accrues meaning without heavy-handedness. The resonance lingers with credible complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person closely tracks Mara’s perception, with diction and rhythm tuned to the ritual’s mood. No head-hopping; distance control stays steady even as cadence modulates at peak beats. The prose’s certainty matches what she can infer (no retroactive omniscience). Voice is distinctive and integral to meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with layered images doing multiple jobs; syntax varies and momentum holds. Figurative language is rich but coherent and controlled; no mixed metaphors or loops dulling pressure. Line-level choices sharpen the closure image rather than smother it. Proofing and mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central conceit—harmonizing by subtracting noise via a detached rosette—feels strikingly new and organically realized. The equinox-library ritual, “frequencies anger forgets,” and the final dust circle synthesize into a singular vision. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The result is memorable and specific.</comment>
