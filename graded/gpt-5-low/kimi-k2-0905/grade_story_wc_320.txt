<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear motive and professional identity drive concrete choices (unscrewing the hatch, discarding assumptions, feeding the fragment into the circuit). Interiority is specific and embodied (pins mapping constellations across her skin). Internal conflict exists but is gentle—she doubts manuals versus her observation—so pressure on her contradictions is limited. The final renunciation (relinquishing the fragment and a “lifetime of conclusions”) feels earned but not hard-fought.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a conceptual repricing where “silence” revalues from threat to cocoon, with clear on-page cost (sacrificing the star fragment and prior conclusions). Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when). The causal flow from discovery → tuning → revaluation → release reads clean, though escalation is more inevitability than squeeze. The price is felt, if more spiritual than material.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the suspended radio city and perigee create a charged field that frames every action and the final balance. Tools and micro-locales (transmitter room, tuning coil, shattered tubes) are used in the solving. The environment meaningfully charges the ending image (the city poised “between moon-pull and earth-anchor”). Slightly more constraint on options would have pushed this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (tune the hush before it devours transmissions). The meaningful tightening comes through her method (jettisoning assumptions) leading to the reframing turn and the choice to feed the fragment into the system. Resistance is largely conceptual; external antagonism is minimal, so tension is beautiful but mild. The cost lands in renunciation rather than risk under fire.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Silence as seed/cocoon and endings as beginnings develop through concrete images (needle finding the groove; broadcasts blooming). The piece edges toward statement a few times (“every quiet is merely rehearsal”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the final repricing is resonant and earned by scene work rather than sermon. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, sensuous, and tightly bound to this character’s perceptual lexicon (engineering meets lyric cosmology). Rhythm modulates with pressure; image choices cohere to the radio/signal motif. No head-hopping or stance slips. A touch of image density verges on purple in places, but control largely holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with strong propulsion through varied syntax; most sentences do more than one job. A few lines stack figurative language to the edge of saturation, but coherence remains. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Final image is sharp and not dulled by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: “shard of hush,” Hollywood sequin as filament, lunar perigee pressuring a radio city—fresh and coherent. The turn from existential threat to cocoon is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. The only limiter is the gentle pressure curve.</comment>
