<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motive (“find the beginning in every ending”) guides credible micro‑choices under pressure (unscrewing the hatch, discarding assumptions, feeding the fragment). Interiority is embodied through tactile craft details and the “serenely electric” sensations rather than abstract labels. The change is earned: she reframes the shard from threat to cocoon and sacrifices the star fragment. Slight softness: near‑frictionless competence reduces visible struggle in the middle beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → reorientation → decisive tuning culminates in a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page cost (sublimating the gold). Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and causal linkages are coherent (“she set the fragment... the shard slid toward it... she tuned... silence expanded”). Closure is strong and legible in the final image (“needle finding the groove”) reweighting all prior material. Minor limit: danger window is felt but not sharply constricting, tempering the cost signal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower city, gorge, and lunar perigee aren’t postcard—gravity, height, and machinery constrain action and charge the final balance image. Tools (reel‑to‑reel, coils, vacuum tubes) are used in scene, not listed, and their physicality steers tactics. Environmental evolution (“city inhaled,” perigee stretching the gorge) mirrors the internal turn without overt symbolism. Spatial and sensory choreography remain crisp and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (tune the hush before it eats transmissions) and deepens into a reframed objective by mid‑scene. The key tightening is her decision to feed the fragment, trading a talisman for a risky integration that could amplify or resolve the threat. The price is visible and the outcome reconfigures options, though the opposition remains mostly conceptual, limiting felt jeopardy. Tension accrues via density and cadence rather than reversals, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonance blooms from particulars (star fragment, hush, coil), and the cocoon reframing lands as earned insight rather than a grafted thesis. The final image reanswers the opening question about endings with a non‑literal cadence (“needle finding the groove”). Slight thematic overstatement appears in aphoristic lines (“every quiet is merely rehearsal, every finale a hinge”), which edges toward telling. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, confident lyric voice with a precise technical lexicon grounded in POV (catwalk, coils, vacuum tubes) modulates smoothly into visionary cadence. No head‑hopping; distance control stays steady as pressure rises. Patterned diction (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”) is taught early and pays off at closure. A hairline risk of lushness remains, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors that mostly do multiple jobs (“crickets that had learned grammar” captures sound, mood, and world logic). Rhythm varies and sentences propel action and realization without scaffold loops. Some aphoristic lines and stacked figuratives flirt with purple, but they don’t blur causality or the closure image. Copy is clean; mechanics and sequencing are sound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “shard of hush” as active silence, a Hollywood sequin turned filament, and perigee‑strained towers synthesize into a fresh, integrated vision. The tactical turn—tuning silence as cocoon—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric compression and conceptual reframing pay off without obscuring stakes. Minor conventional beats (competent specialist faces anomaly) are transformed by the singular imagery and tool‑based ritual.</comment>
