<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—she seeks “flavors of different silences” to outgrow claustrophobia—and her micro‑choices under pressure (limiting exposure, trading a memory, stepping through the membrane, renouncing the final silence) track cleanly. Embodied interiority is strong via sensory textures (iron‑sweet, lullaby, bolt‑sigh). The renunciation and leaving the doll accrue real cost. A hairline note: the keeper’s trade is swift, but it still reads motivated and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/when/where in the first line), and the accumulative lens holds through closure. The final beat lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she refuses to collect the ultimate silence, releases what she hoarded, and returns altered, with a cost on the page (lost memory, surrendered doll). Causality is coherent and sequential despite the lyric mode. The live hour clock tightens pacing and keeps turns legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The xenial trellis, inverted gravity, and honey‑like hush are sensorially rich and rule‑consistent; setting constrains action (narrow rail, membrane) and charges the ending (doll left between vines). Details are POV‑filtered and purposeful, not touristic. The recurring object (doll) functions as micro‑setting/tool and shapes choices. Atmosphere and world logic integrate without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake—can she expand beyond confinement—drives escalation. Tightenings arrive via methodical tests: controlled advance, sweetened second silence, the memory trade, the membrane, and the climactic refusal. Visible/felt prices (memory for cutting, relinquishing the doll, forfeiting the ultimate silence) sharpen the final choice. Pressure remains coherent to the hour’s end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: naming/collecting quiet versus releasing it; survival tactics versus freedom. The final image reweights the premise—liberation through renunciation rather than accumulation—without moralizing. Subtext in silence flavors, gravity’s reversal, and the chrysalis doll resonates beyond the scene. The cost of keeping the bunker inside her versus breathing widened air is elegantly held.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with a distinctive lyrical lexicon that matches Lira’s sensibility. Rhythmic control and image selection modulate with pressure (from exploratory hush to membrane crossing to release). No head‑hopping; elision is purposeful and legible. Diction stays coherent and character‑plausible within the fabulist frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images do multiple jobs and the syntax breathes with the scene. Lyric density is high but controlled; metaphors cohere (silence as flavor/weight, sky as membrane). Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum holds. A couple of high‑register phrases flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—flavors of silence, an inverted‑gravity hour, a xenial trellis, bottling quiet in a doll—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks pay off through integrated world logic and a non‑obvious resolution (release over capture). Turns are grounded in prior particulars rather than late rule swaps. The final reconfiguration is memorable and thematically fresh.</comment>
