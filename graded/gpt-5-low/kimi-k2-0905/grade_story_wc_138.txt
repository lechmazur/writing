<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vey’s motive—boredom fused to the wound of “goodbye”—is clear and drives every micro‑choice, culminating in the renunciation at the door. Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic (“iron boredom in his blood”), with embodied perception rather than labels. The technician leader is sketched efficiently, applying credible social pressure without stealing focus. Slight coolness at peak moments keeps the emotional contradiction from cresting into the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: storm → fragment compulsion → encounter with mutineers → shards unite → door → Vey’s crossing. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual repricing (choosing “proceed” over memory), and the price is legible. The lens reads Hybrid leaning causal, held consistently. No orientation debt; the single-scene arc stays tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite and solar storm aren’t ornamental; they constrain timing (anchor failure window) and route movement (magnetic fields), charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with sonic motifs (“hush,” “magnetic moans”) tied to pressure. World rules are learned through action, not exposition. The wooden door’s plainness amidst crystal heightens atmosphere and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake tightens once: Vey’s potential exile by mutiny is reconfigured into self‑exile through the door, with cost. The fragment’s compulsion and the storm’s clock apply coherent pressure. Vey’s bargain with the mutineers is a clear narrowing of options driven by agency. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential; one more beat of resistance from the crew could have further sharpened cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around exile, farewell, and reorienting compulsion—space mutiny reframed as temporal and existential departure. Recurring images (“hush,” “goodbye,” magnetic pull) accrue meaning and reprice at the end without moralizing. The final choice answers “What happens after goodbye?” with resonant ambiguity and cost. No sermonizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature; diction suits an immortal’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but loaded, advancing leverage and subtext. Psychic distance modulates effectively under pressure. Minor risk of lushness never breaks POV plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; rhythm breathes with the scene. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and tactically placed; no mixed metaphors dull clarity at the close. No scaffold or paraphrase loops. A few stacked modifiers flirt with purple but do not slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lyric SF of an immortal bargaining with mutineers via a magnetized curse in a storm‑wracked, self‑folding station—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The door’s mundane specificity against cosmic architecture is a strong, non‑obvious choice. Risks in voice and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The amulet’s “direction not death” twist is particularly inventive.</comment>
