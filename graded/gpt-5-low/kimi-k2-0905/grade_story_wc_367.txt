<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lirael’s motives and contradictions are legible: she comes “to steer the night, not to birth a sunrise,” yet chooses to press the wick and laugh again, accepting the geas with visible cost. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile engagement with the wick and lens rather than abstract labels. Micro‑choices (pressing the wick; laughing thrice with escalating consequence) reveal a hierarchy of values. The arc from herald to reader is earned by on‑page action, not declared.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure compounds through patterned acts (laughs, lens, wick) to a clear CR/RR: she relinquishes the lighthouse and role as herald to become a reader sowing prophecies. Orientation is established early (emerald lighthouse; post‑print world) and the pattern is taught and paid off. Cost is explicit (stars erased, wick consumed, lighthouse dissolves) and shapes the ending. No causality breaks; each escalation grows from prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and its lens are not postcard décor; they constrain tactics and enable turns (lens as membrane, sail born from ink, lighthouse as ship). Environmental details evolve with action (starlight through total internal reflection, granite blocks gliding, ocean of post‑newsprint silence). The final image is charged by setting (afterimage in her chest; inland journey as a portable lighthouse). Specificity remains vivid and purposeful across senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to accept the geas and translate shadow into dawn—tightens through each laugh’s price and the wick’s dwindling. Agency drives the major turns: pressing the wick, choosing to laugh again despite erasing stars, steering the structure off its foundation. Costs are felt and accumulate toward the dissolution of the lighthouse and her role. The escalation remains coherent without needing an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images of obsolete print, inverted light/shadow physics, and authorship shifting from paper to sky. The prophetic lines risk aphorism but are integrated as consequences of her laugh rather than authorial intrusion. The final reconfiguration—reader not herald; presses of light on a planetary retina—reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers productively without muddle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with consistent close third access filtered through Lirael’s sensibility. Patterned diction (ink, light, wick, lens) is taught and modulates under pressure without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or register drift; syntax varies to pace escalation. The metaphoric texture feels character‑bound rather than generic purple flourish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet purposeful; images do multiple jobs (e.g., “total internal reflection” as both physics and theme). Overwriting is avoided despite lushness; metaphors cohere to the print/light motif with minimal mixing. Momentum holds with few if any scaffold or paraphrase loops. Minor risk of richness saturation is balanced by clear sequencing and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑print cosmology, lighthouse as ship, black flame printing dawn—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, physics‑as‑myth) heighten the stakes and coherence rather than obscure them. Turns arise from established motifs and choices rather than late rule additions. The conceptual ingenuity serves character and closure, not novelty for its own sake.</comment>
