<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority and a credible drive: she uses craft choices (scalpel, enlarger, fixer) to reclaim censored memory. Contradictory impulses—tenderness toward the censor-lover and ruthless self‑exposure—coexist under pressure. Micro‑choices escalate (sending the plane; speaking the forbidden stanza; writing with fixer). The arc lands as acceptance-through-development rather than erasure, with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative structure is coherent: storm → darkroom ritual → revelation of scars as a map → emissary plane → acceptance. Closure manifests as a resonant reconfiguration where scars become belonging. Slight deduction for the truncated final word, which mars cadence at the landing beat, though prior closure moves have already settled. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean early and consistently carried.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory, darkroom tools, and storm are tactile and purposive; weather actively alters options (rotating dome, lightning imprint/projection, plane’s ignition). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a craft‑aware eye. Environment charges the final image (planetarium of scars/atlas of wounded weather). World rules stay legible within the lyrical register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming and re‑mapping harm—tightens via the printing ritual and storm‑amplified exposure; the timer’s “ding” forecloses erasure as a path. The emissary plane’s sacrifice is a concrete price, and the acceptance (“develop them, not erase them”) narrows options. Escalation aligns with the accumulative lens: density/pressure increase toward a single stance. Cost is emotional and conceptual but felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonance is strong: scars revalued as cartography and belonging; bureaucracy of silence counterpointed by a personal counter‑archive. However, the line “When masks slip we do not become faces, we become weather” states thesis overtly in the final third, slightly flattening subtext. Most meaning otherwise arises from image and action rather than instruction. Aftertaste remains potent despite the small didactic note.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV and craft‑specific lexicon; psychic distance modulation tracks pressure. Patterned diction is taught early and maintained without confusion. No head‑hopping; elisions serve image‑driven escalation. Minor drag from occasional over‑intensified metaphors is contained by clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are lush and largely precise; images do multilayered work (silver halide ghosts/maps of damage). Figurative density occasionally risks purpleing but retains sense. The truncation in the last line is a material artifact touching the landing; cadence takes a hit. Repeated motifs (“vigil in pause,” “rarefied”) stay functional rather than redundant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis of darkroom praxis, astronomy, censorship, and bodily cartography feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The storm as collaborator rather than threat is an inspired turn; the plane to the censor‑lover adds human complication. High‑risk lyricism mostly pays off. Minor deductions for the explicit thesis line and the textual cutoff.</comment>
