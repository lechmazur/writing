<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bellhop’s drive—to gauge the price of safety—anchors every choice, from pressing the bolt into the boy’s palm to his disciplined stillness outside the ward. Interiority is embodied and specific (iron taste, frost on lashes), with credible contradiction: he obeys silence while aching for song. The Earned Stasis at the end (remaining as sentinel) forecloses speech with felt cost. Relationship pressure with the boy and surgeon is clean and alters his stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image tightens toward the charged poise of the final breathing and the “microscopic fracture” in silence. Orientation is clear early; cause-effect is lyric but coherent (carry boy → surgery → charged exchange via bolt). Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—safety recast as a ledger of stolen voices. The persistent constraint (ban on speech) shapes tactics and the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, and the bolt function as lived environment and constraint, not postcard decor. Weather and silence policy narrow options and inflect choices; the bolt charges the last image. Sensory detail is purposeful across senses (metal taste, meltwater constellations, high nerve-whine). The setting’s rules stay consistent and culminate in the reweighted final moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: preserving the fortress vs. the cost in voices. Escalation is a density increase consistent with the lens—boy’s arrival, surgical climax, collective breathing—culminating in acceptance of an ongoing price. Agency expresses as endurance and attention (“remain”), a deliberate renunciation with cost. Slightly static by design, but the tightening is unmistakable at the candlelit closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: safety’s arithmetic and the ethics of enforced silence. Recurring images (bolt, discoloration, lullaby/snow/choir) shift meaning and charge the ending without moralizing. The final repricing—safety as a ledger that buries them—lingers and invites complex counter-readings. Subtext runs in gesture and silence rather than statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A consistent close-third voice with a distinct perceptual signature (iron, song, threaded bolt) sustains lyric intensity without losing control. Diction fits the world’s austerity and ritual; no head-hopping or stance slippage. Rhythm modulates well at pressure points (surgery, breath). Elevated register is voice-motivated and coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is tight, with high information density and purposeful imagery. A few lush turns skate near purple but remain coherent and scene-advancing. Varied syntax and clean sequencing keep momentum through reflection. The opening and final lines frame and recharge motifs without loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The silent-choir bellhop, a “seraphically mundane” bolt, and a cobalt fortress synthesize into a fresh moral calculus. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications rigorously (speech outlawed, surgery under candlelight). The closing reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
