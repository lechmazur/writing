<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—reopening the henge mystery by listening rather than conquering—is clear and deepens into a credible renunciation. Micro‑choices (frame‑matching the films, walking out in rain, stepping into the ring, then waiting without demand) reveal a hierarchy of values. Interiority is embodied and particular (“spirals that drank sound,” “second heartbeat”). The shift to “room for mystery rather than mastery” reads earned with an implied cost of surrendering totalizing control.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: investigation → site entry → charged waiting → map reknits → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands on the page via RR/CR: the henge’s rule clarifies and the map mends, with a felt price in her stance shift. Orientation is clean early and the mosaic with reels is legible; the clipped final dash hints continuity but doesn’t undercut the closure already achieved. Setups (films, tear, axiom) pay off coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: rain‑scoured vault supplies tools and tone; cliff path, mist, and basalt ring constrain perception and behavior. The silence oval and glowing spirals directly shape tactics (waiting, aligning map in the gap). Recurring objects (map, lantern, films) charge the final image. World rules (henge appears when listened to) are learned through action, not told.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to approach the unknown—tightens from analytic scrutiny to an ethical method (witnessing without demand). The key deepening is her decision to wait, which forecloses a conquest path and enables the reknit map. Pressure is quiet but coherent; the cost is conceptual rather than perilous, yet palpable. No luck resolves the problem; her stance does.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of empathetic listening over mastery emerges through particulars (silent reels, sound‑drinking spirals, the chapel‑like hush). The mentor’s axiom echoes but the epiphany is dramatized by the map’s reknitting and her revaluation of practice. The final after‑image (second heartbeat) invites reflection without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively: the henge’s rule resists exploitation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A disciplined, lyrical third‑person stays within Elara’s perceptual bias (cartographic, meteorological, tactile). Rhythm modulates with pressure; syntax compresses in the hush and breathes afterward. No head‑hopping or register drift; imagery is character‑specific. The clipped last line is a stylistic flourish that maintains lens coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is dense yet purposeful; metaphors are coherent and advance action and mood. Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable loops; information density is high. A few lush constructions flirt with purple but retain clarity, even at the peak. The em‑dash ending is controlled rather than an artifact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a map framer using mid‑century reels to triangulate a liminal stone circle that appears only under empathetic attention. The henge as an “oval of silence” and the map physically reknitting are striking and earned. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric closure) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
