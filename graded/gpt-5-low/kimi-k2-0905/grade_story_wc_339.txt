<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “quietly analytic” lens drives concrete actions (measuring decay, formulating a hypothesis, recording a conclusion) and the renunciation with the snow globe, revealing conflict between duty to the lost and the need to release. Embodied choices—unscrewing the globe, swapping contents—externalize her internal stakes. The relationship with Fred (Death) adds pressure through presence and earned restraint rather than directives. Minor hedge: Mara’s climactic insight is highly articulate, skirting over-tidiness but remains character-true.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: details and objects accrue toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. The decisive reconfiguration is clear and costly on the page—she replaces the DC‑3 with her brother’s tags and ascends, reframing the “last transmission” as her own heart’s admission. Setups (journal, measurements, globe) pay off in the ending image and note. Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, why) and the price persists in what she leaves behind.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is tactile and consequential: pressure depth, waterlogged books, and the physicist’s journal shape choices and the meaning of “conservation.” The snow globe as micro‑setting/tool constrains the key act and charges the final image as it orbits the shelves. Details filter through Mara’s professional bias without museum‑tour excess. Environment and object co‑author the closing cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to let go without betrayal—is signaled early and tightens as Mara shifts from cataloguing to enacting release. The key turn is her agency: unscrewing the globe and substituting her brother’s tags, a renunciation with visible cost. Pressure coheres through accumulative density rather than reversals, culminating in the ascent with Fred steadying, not claiming, her. Slight softness: external risk is minimal; the tension remains largely internal but is credibly scaled for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars—water‑breathing books, the physicist’s asymmetric equation, the globe’s reweighting—to argue that grief changes state rather than vanishes. Subtext in Fred’s minimal dialogue and Rumi’s line deepens without sermonizing. The explicit recorder line (“grief obeys conservation laws”) risks thesis‑speak, but it’s earned by the scientific frame and paid for in action. The final image sustains resonance beyond the statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and precise; diction marries scientific and lyrical registers in a consistent perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare, subtextual, and character‑specific (Fred’s “escort” line calibrates his role). Rhythm modulates with pressure, allowing quiet beats to accumulate charge. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid, economical for a lyric mode, and avoids loops; images tend to do double duty (thermodynamics of memory, conservation). Metaphor density is high but coherent and world‑true; no mixed vehicles blunt the closure. Minor risk of over‑articulation in the final thesis line, mitigated by the strong closing image. Syntax varies and propels without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: a sunken library, Earhart’s echo, and a physicist’s journals converge with Death as a patient companion. The snow globe’s transformation is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual science) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular and fully committed to its premise.</comment>
