<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (to preserve a last spark) threads through every beat and culminates in a costly, earned renunciation. Interiority is vivid and embodied (corpse fingerprints of final thought), giving us a distinctive professional psychology. The moment of recognizing the spark as her own lands credibly off prior craft and grief. Slight lack of on-page contradictory impulse under peak pressure keeps it just shy of top-tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: ritual preparation → infusion → aurora dimming → self-recognition → dispersal. Closure is on-page with cost: she surrenders her life to carry 342 sparks, reweighting all prior images. Orientation is established immediately (beautician mortician at the skyborne grotto), and the single-scene structure is cohesive. The cause/effect within the lyric mode remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto, mirror pool, and aurora do more than decorate; they create the threshold where time and sound alter and enable the ritual, and they charge the final image. Recurring objects (ice orchids, pool, chip) are integrated with action. Sensory selection matches her professional eye and the scene’s hush. World rules stay consistent within the mythic register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: preserve a spark before oblivion; pressure coheres as the aurora contracts (tightening) and forces a choice. The reversal (the spark is her own) deepens the conflict and narrows options to sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable on the page via dispersal and the studio’s emptiness. Tension is primarily internal but escalates convincingly under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of beauty as memory’s bulwark and the ferryman across forgetting accrues through particulars (corpse patterns, dragon tear, her craft) and is reweighted when she becomes the “river.” The final image resonates and reframes earlier motifs. One line edges toward on-the-nose articulation (“the only ferryman is the one who becomes the river”), trimming a bit of mystery. Still, the aftereffect is potent and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, unified lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the character’s vocation and the scene’s hush. Psychic distance remains steady; elisions are purposeful and paid off. No dialogue needed; interior cadence carries subtext. Minor flourish-risk never breaks control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with strong image economies; most lines do more than one job. Lush metaphors remain coherent and scene-grounded, avoiding muddle or synonym loops. A few stacked figuratives verge on purple but don’t slow momentum or blur causality. Opening and closing images are crisp and memorable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Beautician mortician,” dragon tear chip, and “patterns in static” synthesize into a fresh, coherent vision that feels inevitable by the end. The ritual-science blend is distinctive, not ornament. The closure turn (self as spark/ferryman) is conceptually bold and well prepared. Risk-taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
