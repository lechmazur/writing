<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elian’s impatience vs. vowed patience is embodied (“a second heart rattling its cage,” kneeling on ice) and drives his micro-choices toward a credible renunciation. His function as a horizon mapper is crisply integrated with motive and action. The final offering of the compass and the cooling of impatience into a “smooth, dark stone” reads as earned change with cost. Slight remove from other humans keeps relational pressure narrow but coherent for this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural build is clean: mapping → detected tremor → nightly shifts → keystone spiral → precisely timed act. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence (signals, bell, blackout, sparks, compass left). Orientation is clear from the outset and the lens holds through a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis ending. No causal teleports; setups pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are tactile and functionally constraining; the ice enables mapping and the final act, the viaduct’s field sets the clock. Tools (compass, slate, graphite) are used with purpose and charge the last image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with environmental rules learned through action. The final image is inseparable from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—timing a quiet uprising—tightens via pattern changes (moon skew, hum deepening, 43-second pulse) culminating in the precise instant of action. Agency is endurance and exact timing; the viable path of “too soon” is foreclosed explicitly. The cost is felt in his restraint and the relinquished compass. Quiet but unmistakable escalation under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of patient revolution emerges organically from practice and image, not moralizing (“silence to speak,” “restrained wildness”). The ending reweights prior motifs (moon paths, field, impatience) into a resonant answer about timing as political force. No sermonizing, just a charged repricing of action and attention. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, assured lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from hum’s pulse to dawn’s release). POV certainty matches what Elian could know; elision serves pattern rather than withholding. No head-hopping or register drift. Phrases feel crafted yet precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; figurative language is vivid and coherent (“dropped mirror,” “coin balanced on a wire”). Rhythm varies, and lines do multiple jobs (world + pressure + theme). A hair’s breadth from purple in places but held in check by function and clarity. The closure beat is crisp, not blurred by metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Horizon mapping via moon-path ricochet and a magnetic viaduct is strikingly original, integrated with political stakes. The spiral/keystone timing and restrained-sparks image feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth—patience as praxis—grounds the novelty.</comment>
