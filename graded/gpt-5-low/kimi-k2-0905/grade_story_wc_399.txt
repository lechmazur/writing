<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation—he must preserve the echo—and tactics flow from temperament (discipline over hunger). Interiority is particular (scar as cost; peripheral awareness as creed), though contradiction is subtle rather than dramatic. Micro-choices—walking the perimeter thrice, refusing direct focus—reveal values under pressure. The earned renunciation at the end (mask back on, role accepted) lands with a quiet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with a clean accumulative drive toward stabilizing the clearing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the echo is anchored; his stance as keeper is recommitted. Causality is lyric but coherent (ritual → manifestation → consecration → stabilization at dawn). The cost is felt rather than explicit, yet legible through the scar-and-mask frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and worked into action: the pavilion’s whispers, sound-catching roof, and kinetic parapet shape tactics and the final image. The parapet’s harmonic actively anchors the clearing, charging the ending when he touches it. Sensory focus is selective and character-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. World rules remain consistent and are learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure mounts via accumulative deepening rather than overt reversals: the walk, the manifestation, the consecration, then dawn’s approach. Stakes stay internal yet coherent—preserve wisdom before it dilutes into noise. The refusal to look directly at the echo functions as a costly constraint that guides action. Some readers may want a sharper external jeopardy, but the internal stakes tighten credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence as teacher, preservation through respectful distance, and the ethics of attention. Recurring images (mask, parapet, whispers) shift meaning at the end to frame duty over revelation. The prophet’s line risks stating theme, but it’s integrated and reweighted by the ritual’s enactment. The ending invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (peripheral awareness governing diction). Rhythm and syntax modulate with the ritual’s cadence without becoming mannered. No head-hopping; stance and register stay consistent. Occasional elevated phrasing remains voice-justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with generally clean, propulsive lines; imagery supports function. Minor repetition (“peripheral awareness,” “kinetic parapet”) skirts lushness without tipping into bloat. Figurative logic holds and the final line is clean and earned. No noticeable scaffold or loops that dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an engineered pavilion, a ritual of oblique attention, and an ethic of preservation over proclamation. The “conjured clearing” device feels specific and consequential, not decorative. The closing reconfiguration is non-obvious yet inevitable given the rules taught. Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
