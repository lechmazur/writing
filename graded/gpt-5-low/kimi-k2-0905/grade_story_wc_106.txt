<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The thief’s curiosity-versus-ethics conflict is concrete and enacted: she hesitates to “cut another fragment” and pivots to a cost-bearing workaround. Interiority is embedded in action (flower code, ring inscription) rather than summary. The hooded woman’s past betrayal choice adds credible moral complexity. The revelation via the ring is tidy but still character-driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: meeting via coded flowers → request to reinterpret → moral hesitation → ring-inscription reveal → merged portrait resolution. Orientation is crisp by the first lines (who/where/when; station, last train, moonlight). Closure lands as a decisive change with cost (she refuses further theft, reweights her practice). The ring reveal leans convenient but remains earned by on-page props.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emerald station, marigolds, and moonlight are vivid and purposeful, not postcard; they fold into action (flower code rendezvous, moonbeams as tool). The coordinates in the ring bind place to choice at the turn. Environmental detail modulates with the scene’s pulse (last train’s sigh, dawn rehearsing). The setting charges the final image rather than merely framing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to thin the world’s fabric for one memory—tightens when payment escalates (starlight jar, ring collateral). The ring inscription reverses knowledge and forces a new tactic (reinterpretation vs. further theft). The cost is legible: she sacrifices a portrait, preserves but dims her jar’s power, and narrows her future mandate. Pressure coheres without reliance on coincidence to resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory, forgiveness, and the ethics of curation emerge through image-charged acts (moonbeams, double exposure, returned ring), not thesis. The final cadence—“Destiny’s door swings both ways” and the petal-code “go home”—reprices prior motifs without sermonizing. The starlight payment complicates blame and mercy. One line (“memory is enough”) edges declarative but is earned by the reweighted images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (tools-as-magic, synesthetic station) is confident and steady. Dialogue is sparse, charged, and subtextual (“Show me,” the un-ashing cigarette). Diction and rhythm intensify at turns without losing clarity (double-exposed reconstitution). No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-information lines carry multiple jobs (world rule, emotion, and plot) with minimal scaffolding. Figurative density is lush but controlled; metaphors cohere to light, film, and botany. Sentence rhythms vary, supporting momentum through the pivot and release. No loops or mixed metaphors dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Portrait theft via moonbeams and coded floristry feels singular and integrated, not quirky garnish. The twist—restoring a previously erased beloved through double exposure—reframes theft as curation with an ethical price. Recurring objects accrue meaning across beats. Risky, imaginative choices cohere under pressure.</comment>
