<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—restore shared balance—drives concrete choices (seven circuits, striking the keystone, sacrificing the fork) and culminates in a costly renunciation of self. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“the hollow inside his chest”), with guilt and patience braided into action. The primary limitation is the near‑saintly calibration; contradictory impulses are present but lightly stressed. Still, the final choice is clearly earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Structure is clean and accumulative: ritual → response → partial rebuild → resistant north ward → personal offering → reconfiguration. The closure lands on‑page with felt cost (he becomes the tenth bell), and the lens (accumulative/textural with causal turns) holds. Orientation is immediate and stable. Setups pay off (archway keystone, footsteps/cobblestones, the fork’s evolving state).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is rich, specific, and operative: cobblestones, archway keystone, and towers are not decor—they’re the instrument and constraint of the healing. The environment directly shapes tactics (heel‑toe circuits, striking the keystone) and charges the final image (Elian suspended in the hush). Sensory detail is purposeful across visual, tactile, and auditory absence. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (revive Viremont) and tighten with the resistant north ward that demands personal cost. The decisive deepening—offering his heartbeat, shattering the fork—earns the resolution without coincidence. Tension is more lyric than adversarial but remains coherent and rising under the chosen lens. The cost reweights the ending image rather than closing with a neat fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of restoration, communal memory, and sacrifice emerge from particulars (footsteps as memory, bellflowers from fork sand) rather than thesis. The final image is a resonant answer: balance requires personal forfeiture and communal readiness (waiting for “the first living foot”). Ambiguity lingers productively about ownership and cost. No moralizing undercuts the effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is singular and controlled—lush yet purposeful—and the POV remains steady. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from hush to the groaning tower to the quiet charged poise at end). No dialogue is needed, and the lyric cadence is taught early and sustained. A few ornate turns flirt with excess but do not blur sense or stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line by line, images carry multiple jobs and propel momentum; repetitions (heel‑toe; hush) are patterned, not looped. Metaphors are inventive and largely coherent to the bell/music domain, with no scaffold or filter‑verb stacks. Density is high but readable; one or two lines edge purple without obscuring action. The final lines land cleanly and recharge earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise and execution feel fresh: Tempris as healing places via cadence, memory as architecture, and becoming the tenth bell. Turns arise from seeded logic (archway keystone, footsteps, the fork’s final transformation). The risk of dense lyricism pays off with clarity and consequence. The piece coheres as a distinctive vision rather than a template.</comment>
