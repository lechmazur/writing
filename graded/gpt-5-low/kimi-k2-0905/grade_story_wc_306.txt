<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s profession, embodied sensitivity, and fatigue are specific and credible; her micro‑choice to refuse anesthetizing their guilt and instead offer a naked choice reads earned. Interiority is tactile (trembling hands, “cloak of doubt”) and not therapy‑speak. The geologist’s reaction is sketched but effective as a crucible for her stance. Slight safety hedge: the team’s collective psychology remains idealized, avoiding a sharper, individuated counterforce on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: wind chime codes, the voiding shard, and dawn cohere toward a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on the page when her offer reframes the project from data to “killing something ancient,” and their certainty is “unhooked,” with the cost of investors, careers, and grief present. Orientation is clear early and the single scene sustains pressure. The shard’s final image as a vessel of grief returns to the sea with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse, wind, chimes, dawn beam, and salt air are not postcard decor; they actively encode doubt, force auditory attention, and charge the ending. The “wind” literalizes and pressures the choice (coat outgrown; loose sail), and the beam reveals “particles of doubt,” a specific reweighting. The hollow mirror functions as tool/micro‑setting, constraining perception through its void. Detail is economical, POV‑filtered, and evolving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical complicity—tightens via the cracked bell’s message and the void‑shard confrontation. Escalation is internal but legible: decoding → witnessing through void → forced choice; the price is to relinquish investor‑facing certainty. A bolder on‑page counterpush from a team member could have sharpened pressure further. Still, the refusal to launder guilt and the team’s unhooked certainty provide a credible narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—welcoming nuance and refusing moral anesthesia—emerges organically from action, with strong subtext in the chimes and shard. The final cadence reweights prior images without didactic wrap‑up, though the last sentence’s “most honest position…” edges toward moralizing. The “coat you’ve outgrown” metaphor is effective and not overexplained. Complexity is preserved: cost is not erased, and grief is retained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric third‑person close sustains Mira’s perceptual signature (auditory bias, tool‑thinking, embodied doubt). Dialogue is minimal but pointed, carrying subtext and action. Distance remains stable and inference matches what Mira can plausibly know. Rhythm modulates well from quiet setup to charged offer without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; images (“reflecting nothing, honestly”) are precise and earned. A high metaphor density skirts purple but remains coherent and scene‑bound; no loops or scaffolding. Syntax varies and paragraph cuts track pressure. Minor intensifier redundancy (“honest wind,” “honestly”) keeps it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Conscience‑for‑hire,” wind‑chime cipher, and a hollow mirror that dissolves reflection are strikingly fresh and integrated. The ethical‑service premise is exploited for story, not ornament, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mode, conceptual device) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
