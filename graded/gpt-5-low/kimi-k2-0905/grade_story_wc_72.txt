<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and particular: a newly conscious statue negotiates duty, complicity, and curiosity with concrete micro-choices (gliding, testing awakenings, pausing at the arch). The moral conflict—preserving “museum of certainties” versus risking exposure—feels earned and charged by the gardener’s braided presence. The admission of the court’s hypocrisy gives the decision cost. Slight remove from embodied stakes (no other on‑page character pushing back) keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning causal/accumulative: awakening → discovery of ampoule → approach to structural weakness → deliberate break with explicit cost. Orientation is immediate and coherent; the keystone method pays off a clear setup. Closure lands on page with a reweighted world—statues awaken, certainty dissolves—and the price is acknowledged (betrayal of former duty, irreversible change). The final charged poise (waiting for divers) crystallizes new stakes without handwaving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater garden is tactile and integral; pressure and possibility flow through cracks, silt, and the arch. The keystone and porous stone aren’t mere décor—they constrain and enable the tactic of releasing memory. Sensory specifics widen beyond the visual (grief of barnacles, metallic tears), filtered through the statue’s telepathy. The setting charges the final image of a living, debating garden.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: risk revelation to transform a static city or preserve comfort. Escalation deepens through the approach to the keystone and the explicit reckoning with the court’s hypocrisy. Agency is decisive in the ampoule’s breaking; the cost is conceptual and social rather than physical but felt. Pressure remains coherent and tight to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nuance versus certainty is dramatized through foxglove’s duality and the porous stone taking memory “like an apology.” Recurring images (poison/remedy, door/breath in “welcome”) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. Subtext runs through contradictions—statues remembering, the city “alive, though it remembers death with fondness.” A single aphoristic line (“Revelation is not a hammer...”) skirts explicitness but is earned by scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The first‑person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled; the perceptual signature (tasting the grief of barnacles) remains consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the keystone beat and softening in the coda. No leakage of knowledge beyond plausible telepathy; stance stays stable. Diction is elevated yet justified by the statue’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is precise and propulsive; images do multiple jobs and rarely pad. Figurative density is high but coherent and motif‑driven (cracks, silt, foxglove), avoiding muddle. No evident loops or scaffold; cadences vary. A few lush runs flirt with purple but remain purposeful and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—telepathic statue, memory ampoule, porous architecture as conduit for nuance—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric diction, concept‑driven closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established premises rather than late rule changes. The final reconfiguration feels singular and memorable.</comment>
