<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular, with a clear contradictory pull between duty to the old court and the urge to “welcome nuance.” The final choice—cracking the ampoule—feels earned by prior perception and cost (admitting complicity, destabilizing certainties). Embodied perception (“marble robes shedding flakes of calcified certainty”) grounds emotion. The arc from warning sentinel to facilitator of ambiguity reads credible and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: awakening → walk through the garden → confrontation at the arch → release. Closure lands on the page with cost via the deliberate cracking and the city’s reconfiguration (statues turning, certainties dissolving). Orientation is clean from the opening; the ampoule’s rules are consistent and pay off. The cost is conceptually legible in the admission of the court’s guilt and the forfeiture of static identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater garden is sensorially rich and functionally constraining: depth, silt, corals, and the keystone arch shape tactics and the final image. The ampoule as object-as-setting charges the ending; mortar turned to sugar is an excellent, specific environmental lever. Details arise through action and POV bias rather than postcard listing. Atmosphere coheres with theme and pressures the choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to unleash the gardener’s memory—tightens well as the narrator moves to the arch and weighs consequences. Escalation is internal but tangible; the decision forecloses the path of static guardianship in favor of vulnerable transformation. The price is felt: complicity confronted, identity altered. One major turn suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of nuance vs certainty emerges organically through foxglove (poison/remedy), structural weakness, and telepathic empathy without sermonizing. “Revelation is not a hammer” reframes action as dialogue, then is dramatized by the gentle cracking and seepage. The final charged poise—waiting under an opened gate—offers a resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity is embraced without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV and plausible knowledge bounds. Rhythm modulates with pressure (measured march to the arch; release into cascading images). Diction choices (“incisively kind,” “calcified certainty”) are cohesive and character-sourced. No head-hopping; purposeful compression remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with fresh imagery and minimal scaffolding. A few stacked metaphors approach saturation, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially across the decision beat. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean. Closing images are sharp and unmuddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Living statue telepathy, foxglove memory, sugar-turned mortar, and an ethics of revelation synthesize into a strikingly fresh frame. Turns feel inevitable from prior seeds rather than gimmicky. The vision commits to its implications and avoids the safety middle. Risk-taking serves meaning and closure, not ornament.</comment>
