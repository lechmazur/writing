<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority and credible contradiction (a rational skeptic undone by a relic) drive concrete choices: pocketing the eye, resisting burial, then planting it. Confession under storm pressure embodies cost without tidy absolution. The sister’s ghost scene sharpens stakes without neat repentance. Minor hedge: a few abstractions (“psychological safety”) skim distance from fully embodied feeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: find relic → involuntary confession → attempted cure via texts → planting → orchard’s transfiguration → chosen stasis. Closure reads as resonant reconfiguration with cost (she forecloses secrecy and chooses the ravine’s confessional ecology). Setups pay off (storms, roots, relic’s radius). The final line fragments mid‑thought, slightly blurring the last cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ravine orchard isn’t decorative; storms, roots, and inverted trees constrain tactics (confessions carry, burial site, storm tempo) and charge the final image (lanterned eyes, lightning as pruner). Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered (truffles, moss, resin, lightning calligraphy). The environment dictates what safety can mean here. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safety versus corrosive truth—is signaled early and deepens under storm pressure. The key tightening is her refusal to cast the eye downriver (foreclosing an easy out) and the risky redefinition of the problem by planting it. Costs are visible: enforced confession, surrendered secrecy, acceptance of a borderland life. The escalation is organic, not plot‑convenient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Truth, secrecy, and communal containment emerge through image and choice (roots drinking confession; eyes as lanterns teaching “fractured grace”). The final reweighting—that safety is ecological, not individual—lands without moralizing. A single explicit term (“psychological safety” as label) slightly flattens subtext. Overall, resonance is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive: tactile, fungal, storm‑threaded, with controlled lyric cadence and clean first‑person distance. Diction mostly stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon; the occasional clinical phrase is a mild register jolt. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (storms vs. quiet foraging). POV remains stable and reliable within its surreal logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, dense without sludge, and images often do double duty. The closing sentence breaks mid‑thought, dulling the final image’s snap. A few abstract nouns (e.g., “psychological safety”) momentarily thin immediacy. Otherwise, syntax varies and momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: empathy virus aftermath, a confessional orchard, and an antique eye reframed as ecological truth‑sieve. Risks pay off via the planting pivot and the lanterned eyes—fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its premise without retreat. Minor diction slips and the clipped last line keep it shy of the very top.</comment>
