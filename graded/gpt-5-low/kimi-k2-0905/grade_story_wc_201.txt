<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (“discover the mathematics of mercy”) and actions align: bracing, counting, tearing off the strap. Interiority is embodied and particular (proprioceptive spikes, “ledger” of sap). The paradox—seeking mercy through pain—creates real tension. A slight abstraction haze keeps a layer of emotional vulnerability shielded.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: equations accrue until the decisive offering of the strap reweights everything. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with cost (surrendering the anchor, accepting approximation). Orientation is clear and consistent, and the final image retrofits earlier beats. The price is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is not decorative; its physics and “communion” constrain tactics and charge the end. The recurring object (pewter strap) and body-as-setting interplay sharpen choices and the closing image. World rules are consistent and learned through sensory action. Tone and atmosphere are cohesive and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake escalates through spikes, equations, and the asymptote choice; the strap-tearing is a meaningful narrowing with felt loss. Internal and environmental pressures interweave, and cadence tightens toward the offering. The conflict remains primarily internal and abstract, slightly softening urgency. Still, the cost and renunciation are unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: mercy as a limit approached, not a gift, earned through embodied struggle. The equations evolve from conceit to moral calculus, culminating in a reweighted final image. Subtext about empire’s ledger adds acid without sermonizing. Insight is earned through particulars, not declared morals.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice with controlled diction and sensory bias (UV, math, proprioception) sustains under pressure. POV distance stays stable; patterned elision is taught and paid off. Rhythm modulates effectively at turns (“I tore the pewter strap free”). Slight saturation risk in imagery, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: high information density, precise verbs, and purposeful figurative work. Repetition patterns (equations, bracing) carry meaning rather than padding. The metaphor frequency is intense and occasionally flirts with purple, but coherence is maintained. No mechanical errors or loops dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis of torture-tech, proprioceptive phenomenology, and mathematical theology feels singular and inevitable at the asymptote ending. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Recurring objects and equations transform motif into structure. The final repricing is fresh and memorable.</comment>
