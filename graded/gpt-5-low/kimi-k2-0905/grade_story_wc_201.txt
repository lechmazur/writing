<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit and embodied: pursuing “the mathematics of mercy” drives concrete micro-choices (bracing, counting, tearing the strap). Interiority is specific and character-particular via synesthetic UV and proprioceptive registers. Contradictory impulses (seek absolution vs. accept enduring pain/asymptote) operate simultaneously. The renunciation/offering of the strap reads earned with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: equations appear as pressure mounts, culminating in the strap offering. Closure lands on-page as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: mercy as limit; forest’s dimming and non-recognition exact a cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear within the first lines and serves the ending image. The persistent constraint (UV penance + strap) shapes tactics and the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is a charged environment that administers “communion in millijoules,” constraining perception and action. The mask strap functions as micro-setting/object, imprinting and then anchoring the final image as offering-detritus. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through altered nerves without tourist cataloging. World rules (UV penance, proprioception) stay consistent and drive beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (earn mercy) is signaled early and tightens through accumulating equations and body-cost. Escalation is a density increase: bracing → equations → knee twist → ribcage brace → tearing the strap, each narrowing options toward an asymptotic acceptance. The price is visible (pain, blood-warm strap removal, acceptance of “approximation”). Resolution arises from protagonist agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Thematic inquiry—mercy as an asymptote and limit—emerges organically from action, images, and math motifs. The final image reweights earlier material (trash as miracle; forgetting as part of the equation). A slight explicitness in “forgiveness might be less a gift than a limit” trims the mystique but remains earned by prior particulars. Subtext about empire’s ledger and rounding error enriches without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled voice fuses math, body-sense, and liturgical diction into a coherent perceptual signature. Psychic distance and tense remain stable; elisions are purposeful and pattern-taught. Rhythm modulates well, with lyric compression under pressure. No head-hopping or register dissonance undermines the effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density lyric prose largely avoids muddle; metaphoric fields (UV, proprioception, math, liturgy) remain consistent. Minimal scaffold or loops; lines do multi-work and propel. A few intensifiers brush purple but do not blur causality or the closure image. Syntax variety and clean mechanics support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of torture-tech, proprioceptive math-mysticism, and penance ecology feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (equation-lyric structure, conceptual closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Recurring objects/images reconfigure meaning at the end with conceptual cost. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through.</comment>
