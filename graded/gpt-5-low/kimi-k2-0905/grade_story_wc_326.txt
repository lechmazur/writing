<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and specific—the ghost’s bodily tick, the clerk’s frozen lashes—and choices (defragmenting, re-entering flesh, returning the “solace”) arise credibly from a need to reframe survival. Contradictory impulses—urgency to beat dawn vs. the pull of “stay, stay, stay”—surface in action. A slight neatness in aphoristic declarations (“failure is a telescope”) trims some complexity. Still, the encounter with the clerk reveals character under pressure with felt stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link cleanly: Wi‑Fi haunting → ink map → embodied return → clerk exchange → charged exit. Orientation is taught early (observatory under snow, misfiled death), and the dawn correction clock gives cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he pays the risk of being corrected by returning to flesh to deliver solace, then refuses daylight. Minor handwave in the ink mechanics, but it’s pattern-taught and coherent to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory, snow, dome, and inkwell are more than backdrop: they constrain timing (storm, radio static, dawn), tools (inkwell, shard), and access (hatch, spiral stairs). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator’s techno-lyric bias. The setting charges the final image (horizon walk; dome glint). A slight postcard shimmer remains, but function and mood align strongly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transpose an error into lived meaning before correction—tightens through the ink-ring decision and embodied return. The visit to the clerk is a meaningful test of purpose, trading safety for witness. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the price is time, exposure, and relinquishing anonymity. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—failure as corridor rather than antithesis—emerges through concrete acts (ink map, ring, clerk exchange) and a reweighted final gait. However, explicit thesis statements (“failure is a telescope…”) edge into moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. The story still earns a resonant repricing of error and miracle, with the shard and heartbeat counts anchoring meaning beyond assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—techno-mystic diction married to tactile cold—and distance is steady. Compression is taught and handled with control; brief dialogue carries subtext and purpose. Rhythm modulates with pressure (crackle to hush) without head-hopping. A few aphoristic lines skate close to register drift, but the persona justifies the loft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences are largely precise, multi-tasking with image and motion; metaphor nets are controlled and specific. Minor purple tendencies are mostly earned by voice. A conspicuous glitch in the last line (“glints like a half”) feels truncated, dulling the final cadence. That line-level artifact in the closing beat reduces polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Digital ghosthood via hospital misfile blended with analog ink-divination in an opal observatory is a striking synthesis. The shard as recurring tool/talisman and the heartbeat-counter as clock feel fresh. Risks—lyric tech-mysticism, procedural ink-magic—cohere to character and stakes. A few stated maxims narrow the afterglow, but the core vision is distinctive.</comment>
