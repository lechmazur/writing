<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—honoring overlooked histories through a fragile memorial—is vivid and consistent, and her actions align tightly with that value. We get embodied emotion (breath tasting of moss, tears after release) and concrete micro-choices (pausing at the butterfly’s interrupted cadence, accelerating the weave). Internal contradiction is limited; she does not face a sharp ethical grind or competing demands beyond letting go. The final renunciation (releasing the wing and memorial) lands as a credible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: ascent → construction → visitation → lift → descent, ending in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on the page with cost (she surrenders the wing/memorial and accepts transience). A small logic slip—“needed [the monarch’s] singular wing” vs. using a moth wing that is then called the butterfly’s “twin”—introduces mild species confusion that slightly nicks causal clarity. Orientation is otherwise crisp from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto above the clouds and “cloud-soil” integrate with action and urgency; transience of roots and dissolution by nightfall constrain time and charge the final lift. Sensory specificity is strong (moss, mineral, lightning-scarred log), with environment shaping tactics (build now before it dissolves; the cathedral literally becomes airborne). The setting’s logic stays consistent and powers the ending image. Lush but purposeful detail maintains momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (make the ephemeral visible before it vanishes) tightens through the butterfly’s arrival and the gathering swarm testing each knot. The escalation is a clear deepening: her work is claimed and lifted, forcing a real surrender. The price is emotional rather than tactical, but it’s legible and earned in the final beats. Minor softness: the conflict never sharpens into a hard dilemma beyond release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of honoring overlooked histories via temporary permanence is woven through recurring objects (wire, wing, cloud-soil) and culminates in a resonant final image. The grandmother’s maxim and the closing reflections edge toward explicitness, slightly reducing subtext. Still, the reweighting—stories gain weight by dissolving rather than being preserved—is conceptually strong and earned by scene. The butterfly’s cadence moving from interrupted to whole neatly enacts the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close holds steady, with a distinct perceptual signature (material detail, ritual cadence). Diction remains coherent and modulates with pressure as the build accelerates, then softens post-release. Dialogue is minimal but functional, and there’s no head-hopping or stance slippage. Slight overornamentation peeks through but doesn’t impede legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm is varied and images are often precise; lines frequently do double duty with atmosphere and action. However, occasional purple density and near-repetition (“transiently rooted,” “blushing stillness”) create mild drag. The species confusion and the truncated final word (“of the bl”) are copy-level blemishes that hurt polish. Despite that, momentum is maintained and the closure image remains clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Original synthesis—wire cathedrals, cloud-soil, a memorial that must dissolve to survive—feels fresh and coherent. The accumulative turn (butterflies forming a living shroud, lifting the structure) is surprising yet inevitable from seeded particulars. Risks in worldbuilding and tone pay off without gimmickry. Minor familiarity in the “ephemeral made visible” trope is outweighed by distinctive execution.</comment>
