<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vela’s motives and contradictions (combativeness turned invitational) are clear and embodied through the arm, card, and footwork; Caelus’s scar and vocoder add credible cost. Their status dynamic shifts on the page from duel to partnership. Emotional specificity comes via tactile choices (tracing shadows, lowering the card), though interiority remains more stylized than deeply felt. Still, the final hand‑clasp reads earned by prior micro‑choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with a coherent accumulative/textural drive builds to a clean closure: he removes the vocoder and they step into the brook together. The sundial’s arc functions as a patterned cadence that pays off at the end. Cost is legible (public vulnerability, surrendering the adversarial stance). Orientation is crisp from the opening line; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered; tool‑and‑place details integrate with action. Environment constrains/charges choices: the sundial’s shadow guides tactics and the brook becomes the charged final image. Sensory texture (gear‑hum, reflections) supports tone without cataloguing. The world’s light steampunk logic stays consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (intellectual/ethical duel with institutional consequences) is signaled early and tightens through syllogism/counter and the coded shadow. A meaningful deepening occurs when Vela reframes the duel as harbor, forcing a price: Caelus’s vocal exposure and mutual renunciation of the duel. Stakes are slightly abstract but made concrete by the scar and public setting. Escalation is agency‑driven, not coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—questions as destinations, listening as motion—emerges through image and action rather than moralizing. Recurring motifs (sundial, card, brook, overture) reweight at the end to answer the opening query non‑literally. Dialogue carries subtext (the harbor invitation) with earned resonance. Complexity remains without false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, lyrical yet controlled, with a stable close third and clean dialogue mechanics. Caelus’s vocoder and Vela’s measured idiom differentiate speakers. Rhythmic modulation tracks pressure, especially at the vocoder removal beat. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, purposeful images that do multiple jobs, and no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is fresh and coherent to the world’s logic; sentences vary rhythmically. The final image efficiently recharges earlier motifs. No artifacts dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of steampunk academia, migratory logic, sundial‑ciphering, and a duel of questions feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual framing) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns grow out of seeded particulars, not late rule changes. The final repricing (duel → harbor) is non‑obvious and satisfying.</comment>
