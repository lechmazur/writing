<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s curiosity and care drive concrete micro-choices (putting on the goggles, aligning pages, choosing descent, trading the thimble) that reveal values under pressure. Her contradictions—drawn to grief’s artifacts yet orienting toward joy—are dramatized rather than stated. The final renunciation (not reporting, adopting the gardener’s role) feels earned and carries cost. A minor softness is the limited on‑page pushback from other characters.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: goggles → cipher → observatory → diary → map → descent → seed planted. Closure lands with a decisive change (she stops ascending socially and commits to rooting below) and tangible costs (forsaking duty, giving up her thimble, choosing a new role). The gust unlocking the diary reads as rule-consistent magic rather than convenience. Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The spire’s cold, brass, and glass, plus the humid hothouse, are tactile and functionally constrain action; the elevator and goggles operate as micro‑settings/tools that shape choices. Sensory specificity (engine‑oil, bergamot, iron) is filtered through Lira’s priorities. The environment charges the final image of “watering the future,” making the setting integral to meaning. No white‑room or postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are personal but coherent: will Lira remain a servant of mourning or become a steward of hidden joy. Escalation deepens via discovery beats and the pivotal decision to descend and plant, with visible forfeitures en route. The tension is more accumulative than adversarial, but agency consistently drives turns. A slightly softer antagonistic force keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image: joy smuggled into sorrow’s fortress, seeds and music reweighted at the end. The “UNFOLD” motif, the apricot tree, and the major chord scene braid subtext without moralizing. The final image reprices the premise—expansion over ascent—creating lingering resonance. No thesis is spoken; insight is earned by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third‑person closely tracks Lira’s perceptions with a distinct sensory lexicon. Rhythm varies to match pressure; imagery patterns are taught early and reprise cleanly. No head‑hopping or register drift, and elision serves momentum. The voice feels singular and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line work is dense yet purposeful, with images doing multiple jobs and minimal scaffolding. Metaphor chains are coherent (elevator heartbeats, diary’s laughing stain to staff) and never muddle causality. A few lush phrasings brush against purple but remain disciplined by action. Syntax and paragraphing maintain propulsion into closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Steampunk‑adjacent elements are transformed by a fresh emotional calculus (joy as contraband in winter). The goggles/diary/light mechanics synthesize into a non‑obvious but inevitable turn. The risk of a quiet, internal climax pays off with a charged final stance. Specific choices (the thimble trade, the tentative major chord) add memorable originality.</comment>
