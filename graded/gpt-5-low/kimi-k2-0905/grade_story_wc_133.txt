<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s drive to “thresh meaning from experience” is clear, embodied by sleeplessness and the compulsion to paint. Her micro‑choices (following rain trails, kneeling at shell spirals, accepting the shard, painting with rainwater) align with motive under pressure. The old woman adds focused relational pressure that redirects Mara from self‑recrimination to purposeful work. The final renaming of insomnia as vigilance reads earned, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern recognition → encounter → charged making → exchange → repriced self. Orientation is immediate (causeway, tide, monastery), and each beat causally seeds the next (brooch warming → spirals → guide/mandate to paint → vial exchange). Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: insomnia reframed and counter‑pointed by the first deep sleep. The cost is felt more as history’s ache and traded memory than as a sharp on‑page sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tidal island, causeway, and rain trails are vivid and functionally constraining (timed crossing, water as medium and guide). The monastery’s drowned/fossil atmosphere and the brooch’s deep time charge the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action (shell spirals, fresco bleed, monks’ tide ledgers). Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and the ending cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but coherent: find meaning worth trading in a world of scarcity. Pressure deepens through discoveries and the old woman’s mandate, culminating in the exchange and the choice to paint feverishly with what the water provides. The tightening is quiet yet real under the accumulative lens; a concrete price beyond the painting itself is light. The final sleep signals resolution earned by stance, not contest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme braids memory, ecology, and art as exchange; images do the work (amber, spirals, drowned frescoes) with strong subtext around what water “remembers.” The ending reweights the premise: vigilance as gift, exchange as meaning rather than goods. A touch of stated thesis (“This is the real exchange”) leans didactic, but the surrounding imagery keeps it from tipping into sermon. Resonance persists via the island existing in “multiple times.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑limited voice is controlled and distinctive, its diction consistent with Mara’s sensibility. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with the old woman’s idiom distinct and subtextual. Rhythm modulates well from austere observation to fevered making. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet mostly carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) without sludge. Figurative work stays coherent (water memory, fossils, spirals) and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor moments verge on purple but don’t stall momentum, and redundancy is minimal. The final image tightens rather than explains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Memory‑for‑supplies exchange, rain‑trail navigation, and the amber’s deep‑time “memory” synthesize into a fresh post‑cataclysm vision. The piece commits to its textural logic without gimmicks, and the turn (insomnia repriced) reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric accumulation, quiet conflict) pay off with clarity. The monastery‑as‑tidal artifact is especially novel.</comment>
