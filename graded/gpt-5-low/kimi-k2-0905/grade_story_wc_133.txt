<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s drive (to “thresh meaning”) is clear and embodied in micro-choices—following rain trails, kneeling at shell spirals, painting with rainwater. The shift from seeing insomnia as a curse to a vigilance-gift reads earned via on-page experience. Relationship pressure with the old woman is gentle but effective as a crucible of recognition and trade. Slightly tidy self-awareness (“another failure…”) trims some ambiguity in her interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: causeway → spirals → exchange → painting → vial → tide return → sleep. Closure lands with a concrete decisive change (sleep) and a reweighted premise (insomnia as gift), with visible cost carried from earlier deprivation. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and set-ups (brooch warmth, market rumor) pay off. Minor convenience in the old woman’s timely appearance keeps it just below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: the tidal causeway, half-drowned monastery, peeling frescoes, and rain trails drive action and choices, including timing with the returning tide. The brooch, shells, and spring water act as micro-settings that charge the final images. World rules (post–water wars) emerge through observation, not dumping. A near-constant visual lushness is balanced by tactile, water-driven constraints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (extracting meaning amid ruin) tightens through the exchange and the demand to “Paint what the water revealed.” The material price is modest (she gives her painting; receives the vial), but the emotional price—enduring insomnia and relinquishing a piece of herself—reads. Escalation is more deepening than narrowing; tension remains soft with no hard pinch beyond time/tide. Clear, if quiet, pressure curve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory-as-currency, ecological guilt, and the ocean’s “memory” accrue through objects and acts, not just assertion. The closure reweights insomnia and the island’s temporal layers, offering a resonant non-literal answer. However, lines like “This is the real exchange” and repeated “thresh meaning” verge on thesis-stating, blunting subtext. Despite that, image-led resonance predominates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent lyrical third close with a perceptual signature anchored in water imagery; dialogue is sparse but purposeful and carries subtext. Diction stays within an artisanal-poetic register appropriate to Mara’s sensibility. Occasional on-the-nose labels nibble at the edge of over-explanation but don’t break distance control. Rhythm varies well between long cadences and clipped realizations.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong—many sentences multitask (world, mood, character) with clean syntax and image precision. Some figurative stacking (“water’s memory,” “thresh meaning,” “haggard awe”) repeats and edges toward purple, but the piece keeps momentum. No material loop/scaffold artifacts or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Final cadence lands cleanly on concrete images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of post-war hydroscape, memory exchange, rain-trail navigation, and a responsive amber brooch feels fresh and unified. The ending’s reconfiguration (insomnia as vigilance) is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off without obscuring clarity. Slight dependence on familiar ruin-poetics keeps it short of exceptional.</comment>
