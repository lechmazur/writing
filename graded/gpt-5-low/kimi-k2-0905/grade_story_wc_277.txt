<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cordelia’s motive (to reweight truth and end the “orbit of regret”) is clear, persistent, and drives concrete choices. Her internal contradiction—heir to lies yet author of correction—plays in the act of inscribing logical negations until the cherished tool breaks. The cost is legible (breaking the rosewood nib; surrendering a self-definition) and alters her stance. Orlan provides light pressure and contrast without stealing agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the projection, inscriptions, and escalating contradictions form a taught pattern culminating in “The story continues.” Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration: the orbit cracks, tactics shift, and papers below change. Cost is on-page at the peak beat (the nib breaks), and the lens holds cleanly. Orientation is early and solid (observatory, journalist call, projector).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory’s devices (slit roof, projector, mirrors) and materials (silver ink) directly enable tactics; Orlan’s mirrors even route sparks into archival change. The rosewood nib functions as a charged micro-setting/tool that constrains and then breaks to unlock closure. Atmosphere (“ink and thunder,” “echoing dome”) is purposeful, not decorative. The final images (funicular, printing house) extend setting into consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: alter the orbit of regret by contesting truth. Escalation tracks via a because/therefore chain within the lyric frame: assumptions → contradictions collide → orbit resists → she sacrifices the nib to force the final line. The price is unmistakable and tied to her identity and method. Resolution arises from her choice, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of truth’s mutability, journalism’s ethics, and regret reframed as a widenable orbit emerge through specific acts (rewriting the sky; reflecting sparks into microfiche). The recurring logic device (“proof by contradiction”) grounds abstraction in concrete struggle. One explicit thematic line (“means sometimes the tool breaks with the falsehood”) flirts with telling but is earned by the break. The ending reweights prior images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice maintains controlled distance and a coherent perceptual signature (“newsprint heiress who smelled of ink and thunder”). Dialogue is spare, tonal, and functional, advancing pressure with subtext. Diction and rhythm modulate at the peak without losing clarity. No head‑hopping; stance is stable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet purposeful; images do double duty (gears as old editors; starlight pooling) without muddle. Recurrent phrases (“solemn/playful”) are patterned rather than looped. Clarity survives the lyric pressure; action order remains clean. A hair’s breadth from overwriting in places, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—astromancy of journalism, logical proof as spellwork, regret formalized as orbital mechanics—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking (metaphor literalized into mechanics) heightens stakes and drives closure. Objects and methods are uniquely tied to character and field. The final repricing (“The story continues.”) avoids cliché and reconfigures the premise.</comment>
