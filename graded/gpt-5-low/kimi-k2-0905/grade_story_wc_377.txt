<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motive—preserving wonder—drives craft‑bound micro‑choices (pin placement, counterweights) to a renunciatory ending (remaining mute, giving the wedge). Interiority is embodied via tactile tuning and “breath‑scriptures,” not labels. Internal contradiction surfaces credibly: heart “cracking open” to speak vs. chosen silence. Slight limitation: relational crucible is minimal until the boy at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design escalates toward the comet’s pass, with clean causal links (calibration → insertion of ice → comet excitation). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ice’s costly diminishment and her wordless bequeathal reweight “wonder” into communal stewardship. Orientation is firm immediately (who/where/when), and the cost is on‑page (“iceberg shrinking,” pockets emptied). The lens holds from craft buildup to charged poise in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bluff, altitude, wind, and night sky actively shape tactics (starlight calibration, cooling bearings, comet angle); the kinetic monument’s tools are lived‑in and precise (pin like a tuning fork’s tongue). Environment charges the ending—“the bluff continued its quiet sentence”—and the micro‑setting (ice, wedges, counterweights) constrains choices. Sensory detail spans touch, sound‑through‑motion, and light, filtered through a tuner’s priorities. World rules are consistent and taught through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping wonder’s color alive—is tightened by the comet’s ticking approach and the irreversible consumption of ancient ice. Agency steers escalation (calibration decisions, endurance of silence, the final gifting), with a felt price paid. Pressure is lyric rather than adversarial but coheres under the accumulative lens. Slight softness in overt external resistance keeps the tension elegant rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Images and actions earn a resonant answer: wonder as frequency enacted through a silent symphony and communal transmission (the wedge to the boy). Subtext thrives in silence-as-resonator and material sacrifice; emotional afterglow is concrete. A few lines verge on thesis (“wonder is not a feeling but a frequency”), trimming subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with controlled rhythm; diction and metaphor fit a craftsperson attuned to oscillation and light. Psychic distance and POV are stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Compression and patterned elision are taught and paid off at closure. Music‑adjacent lexicon remains character‑bound rather than generic purple.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; lines frequently do double duty (world‑rule + theme + action). Figurative language is coherent to the motif (frequency, light, metal) without muddle or strain. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; rhythm modulates with scene tempo. The peak beats maintain clarity even at elevated lyric intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Kinetic monument + comet‑plucked frequencies + ancient ice as a light‑song is an original synthesis, emotionally and conceptually integrated. The bequeathal of a wedge reframes legacy without cliché. Risks in form and diction heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The premise follows its implications to a singular, memorable final image.</comment>
