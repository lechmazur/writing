<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The inspector’s goal and tactics are precise and embodied—timed reagents, tripod, antique camera—revealing a professional, grieving mind. Contradictory impulses (“witnessing as resistance” vs. the urge to shoot now) surface in the wait before the shutter. Small micro-choices under pressure (burying the half-grain, dribbling water, holding breath) layer credibility. The character’s flaw—purposeful curiosity shading into elegiac theft—pays off in the final, costly endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the two‑timer setup, the wind’s arrival, the synchronized opening/closing, and the final crimson flush tighten coherently. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: she captures “the last possible second,” foreclosing further action with felt cost (extinction, contract’s end). The causal chain from reagent to wind to folding reads clean and motivated. The final clipped phrase “no margin” is a hairline stumble but doesn’t break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Moon, Earthrise, terminator wind, feldspar vein, and UV bleaching aren’t ornaments; they constrain timing and shot composition. Tools-as-setting (antique film camera; reagent grains) charge the final image. Sensory specificity is selective and professional—regolith crunch, electrostatic whispers—without catalogue bloat. The environment’s rules remain consistent and shape the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the last bloom before sterilizing dawn—is clear early and tightens through the dual chemical countdowns. The gust and the pink bloom are the meaningful turn that forces commitment; her choice to wait and then shoot is a real trade‑off under time pressure. External extinction stakes interlock with internal hesitation. The cost is legible: she wins the image while losing the living subject forever.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Witnessing versus forgetting develops through concrete particulars (hourglass grain, abandoned Tycho, extinct anemones) rather than lecture. The late reprise (curiosity as mourning; “only color left of them”) reweights earlier images without a pat moral. One explicit thought (“curiosity…another form of mourning”) comes close to telling, but it’s earned and anchored in action. The final image leaves a durable conceptual repricing of time and attention.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A unified, lyrical close third carries a distinct perceptual signature—technical yet elegiac—with steady distance control. Diction and rhythms modulate under pressure (shorter beats at the shutter clicks). No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference stays within what she can know. Minor risk: density of figurative language edges toward purple but remains voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and efficient; images often do double duty (bioluminescence as regret; glass petals as fossils). Rhythm varies with scene needs; scaffolding and loops are minimal. A few lush metaphors stack, and the final clipped phrase (“no margin”) reads slightly artifacted, nicking the finish. Overall propulsion and clarity remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—lunar fieldwork, chemical timers as “time alarms,” antique film as resistance, and anemone extinction—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects reconfigure meaning at the end (hourglass grain, camera, Earthrise). Risks in tone and imagery pay off without obscuring pressure. The piece avoids template beats and offers a memorable, singular vision.</comment>
