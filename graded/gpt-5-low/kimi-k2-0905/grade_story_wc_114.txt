<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied, with the oracle’s contradictory impulses—protection vs. the rising prophetic weight—simultaneously pressuring her choices. Her micro-choices (smudging, stepping into the cold, erasing the illustration, weighing the stone) align with her marginal, probabilistic worldview. Motivation to learn the exact weight is established early and paid off precisely (“4.7 grams”). Slight abstraction around why weight specifically matters is offset by the concrete ledgering of cost and vocation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: instruments repeat “heavier,” the aurora intensifies, the root pierces, and the smudging/expulsion completes a decisive change. Orientation is crisp from the first sentence (who/where/when) and the speculative rule-set is learned through use. Closure lands on-page with cost (expulsion, environment stilled, the bundle buried). No causality breaks; each beat coheres toward the final act.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station and its tools constrain tactics (logbook, barograph, anemometer, rain gauge as burial site), and the cold and aurora shape action and tone. Details are purposeful and POV-filtered (smudged pigment “releasing a ghost,” instruments murmuring names). The setting charges the final image (stone wrapped and placed in rain gauge) and feels irreplaceable to outcome. Sensory texture is rich without disorientation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expel/weigh the truth to protect valley/self—tightens through “heavier” and the root piercing, forcing a sacrificial tactic (erasing the external leaves to surface the internal truth). The cost is legible (physical invasion, sorrow quantified, environmental hush as aftermath). Escalation is protagonist-driven under the accumulative lens, with one decisive intensification at 03:17. No cheap coincidence resolves the conflict; choice does.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: truth as weight, protection as complicit prophecy, and the ethics of forgetting vs. bearing. Recurring images (laurel, instruments, aurora, smudge) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final ledger line (“4.7 grams of sorrow, valley temporarily innocent”) provides a resonant, non-literal answer that charges innocence as cyclical and costly. Ambiguity lingers cleanly: protection is temporary, cost persists.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (probabilistic, marginal seeing) remains stable and apt. Diction, rhythm, and image clusters modulate with pressure (from interior fever-break to auroral peak to hushed denouement). No head-hopping or stance drift; purposeful uncertainty is taught and paid off. The “fault-tolerant” stance informs sentence logic without expository crutch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and rhythmic variety; most sentences carry multiple jobs. A few stacked figuratives risk saturation (e.g., “auroral sorrow,” “breath blooming like shattered glass”), but coherence holds and peak beats remain clear. No scaffolding loops or template cadences; closure image is sharply rendered. Minor purple tint, not momentum-sapping.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original premise and synthesis: an oracle as weather-keeper of probabilistic truth, weighed and evacuated, with instruments as liturgy. The laurel illustration’s evolving function and the rain gauge burial feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and concept pay off with a precise, strange closure. Specificity and conceptual integrity prevent template drift.</comment>
