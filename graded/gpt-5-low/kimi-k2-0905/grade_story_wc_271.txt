<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied, with contradictions—guilt and stubborn hope—played in-scene through micro-choices (pressing the photo to bark vs. letting it go). The somatic markers externalize emotional strategy without feeling schematic. The final covenant reads as an earned renunciation with cost. Minor brush with therapy-speak is grounded by sensory detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: ritual → freeze-as-microscope → tactile consecration → release of the photo → covenant. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, with on-page cost (relinquishing the photograph) and a reconfigured rule-set (living like the trees). Orientation is clear from the outset; stakes cohere and tighten. The lighthouse/arboretum motif persists to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff are not backdrop; wind, resin, railing, waves, and the abandoned lighthouse shape action and options (the wind tearing the photo, resin sealing her face). Sensory economy is sharp across smell, touch, and sound, all filtered through grief-logic. The environment charges the ending image decisively. Spatial continuity is clean.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and deepens: the freeze reframes trauma, the resin act escalates commitment, and the letting-go forecloses a path. Cost is legible (surrendering the talisman; accepting imperfect optimism). Quiet but firm tightening; no spurious antagonism. A single, meaningful cadence shift suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs. optimism arise from concrete acts and recurring objects, culminating in a resonant covenant without didacticism. A couple aphoristic lines (“grief is not a landmine…”, “optimism without memory…”) skate close to on-the-nose but are supported by scene pressure. The final image reweights prior motifs. Ambiguity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with precise diction and rhythmic modulation; metaphors remain coherent to the narrator’s sensorium. POV distance is steady and plausible; no leakage or head-hopping. Patterned elisions (freeze-as-microscope) are taught and paid off. Lines carry felt intention under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphor; cadence varies to match pressure. No paraphrase loops or muddled vehicles; images (“red chrysanthemum,” “tearing paper” wind) are vivid and consistent. Syntax is clean and propulsive with minimal scaffolding. Minor elevated phrasing never clogs the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: somatic botany + post-strike grief ritual in a cliffside arboretum with resin-consecration and lighthouse afterlife. Risks a lyric, reflective mode yet maintains pressure and cost. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Fresh particulars avoid template mourning tropes.</comment>
