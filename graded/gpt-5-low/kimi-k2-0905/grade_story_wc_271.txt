<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied, with contradictory impulses (clinging to the photo vs. releasing it) driving micro‑choices. The “somatic markers” motif risks clinical diction but is grounded in tactile action and cost. The final covenant reads as an earned endurance that forecloses a path (endless memorializing by the photo). Reactions to trees, resin, and scents reveal character under pressure with specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: ritual → freeze as microscope → resin‑transfer → release. Closure lands on the page with cost (letting the photograph go) and an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise vow at the tree. Orientation is clear early (arboretum on a cliff, dusk, survivor), and the ending reconfigures options without contradiction. Constraints (cliff, resin, the arboretum’s endurance) shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The arboretum/cliff environment saturates sensory detail and actively shapes choices (iron railing, roots, resin, wind, black water). Objects-as-setting (resin, photo, lighthouse remains) charge the final image and constrain behavior. Sensory hierarchy reflects the POV’s plant knowledge and grief practices. World rules and spatial choreography remain coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—living with memory without surrendering to it—is tested and tightened by the freeze ritual and the resin act, culminating in releasing the photo. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, consistent with the lens, and the price is unmistakable. The agency is a renunciation with visible loss and a new constraint (image fixed to the tree, photo gone). Tension operates line to line via the wind/sea and the narrator’s somatic tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: optimism with memory, grief as coastline, persistence through living matter. The recurring images (resin, photo, lighthouse/trees) reweight meaning at the end without forced symbolism. Two explicit “I think:” lines edge toward statement, but they’re anchored in scene and do not replace pressure. The final covenant provides a resonant, non‑literal answer that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled first‑person voice with a consistent perceptual signature (botanical lexicon, briny sensory palette). Rhythmic modulation matches pressure; compression in the freeze sequence is legible and purposeful. No head‑hopping or stance drift; certainty aligns with plausible knowledge. High craft without register mismatch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs and sustain momentum; figurative density is purposeful and pattern‑taught (heron/chrysanthemum/gulls) without muddle. No scaffolding loops or filter stacks, and paragraphing breathes with the scene. Diction is precise and character‑bound. Final images land cleanly with no metaphor collision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—botanical grief praxis, resin transfer, and a vow to live like salt‑drinking trees—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Familiar trauma material is transformed through specific, non‑obvious tactics and objects. Risks in lyric compression and imagistic reframing heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The arboretum/lighthouse frame is fresh and fully integrated.</comment>
