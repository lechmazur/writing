<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The guard’s motive—preserve and deliver the children’s “sparks” by ritual duty—is clear and enacted through specific choices (naming, placing the clock, burying it). Interiority is implied via training and embodied acts rather than explicit reflection, which suits the “dreamless” trait but limits layered contradiction. His renunciation of the clock reads as a credible cost. A deeper clash between duty and desire would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual intensifies into a charged act where time splits and the clock is planted, producing a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is taught early (guard, burned forest, frozen clock; glowing dune) and pays off at closure. The price is legible on the page—the guard relinquishes the clock to keep divergent time for children and forest. The ending image reweights all prior beats without explanatory overreach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional: rails as “silver scars,” phosphorescent poppies, and the dune’s glassy sand constrain tactics (placing the clock between box and sand). The strongbox and dune are not postcard backdrops—they supply resources and rules that govern the ritual. The final image is inseparable from place (clock buried at midnight, poppies dimmed, horizon march). Specific sensory choices feel lived-in and consistent with the world’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—carry lullabies/children forward—tightens from naming to wave-function song to the decisive burying of the clock. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve anything. The cost is conceptual and practical (surrender of the clock and acceptance of divergent time). Pressure is coherent, though internal friction remains understated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory versus annihilation, song as transport, and time’s divergence to reconcile grief. Recurring images (clock, names, poppies, “occasionally everywhere”) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end. The final cadence answers the central question without moralizing: what burns never truly sleeps because song alters time. Ambiguity stays purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A controlled, singular lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and syntax suit the “dreamless” professionalism facing the impossible. Rhythm modulates cleanly from ritual calm to charged poise at closure. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; uncertainty feels intentional, not evasive. Names-as-lullaby lines land with musical precision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Highly efficient lines with layered work: images advance story, world rules, and theme simultaneously (e.g., “midnight split into two living seconds”). Figurative language is coherent to the world’s logic; no mixed metaphors or purple sprawl. Momentum never stalls; zero scaffold or synonym loops. Final lines deliver an earned, crystalline image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—freight guard, divergent time via a chess clock, wave‑function lullabies, and phosphorescent ecology—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established pattern (ritual → resonance → renunciation) rather than late rule changes. The piece feels singular and memorable.</comment>
