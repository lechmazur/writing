<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s aims and tactics are clear and embodied—she reads, dances, rolls the dice, surrenders to the vortex, swallows the page. Interiority is specific to her vocation (code as choreography), avoiding generic labels. Contradictory impulses are subtle (risk vs. calm defiance) rather than dramatized in overt conflict, which trims peak intensity. The final choice (carrying the cipher in her body) feels earned and carries legible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pattern and stakes are taught early (spider as clock, dice as compass) and resolve in a charged surfacing that reweights meaning. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with clean causal links at turns (double threes → vortex → archive → ingestion → buoy). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost and an external echo (the child). No orientation debt; the single-scene arc coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The environment meaningfully constrains options: currents, pressure valves, airlocks, silt, and a single dry archive. Tools and objects (dice, buoy, copper plates) are integrated into movement and choice. The world’s rules stay consistent and are learned through action. The final image is charged by setting (moonlit surfacing) and the environment’s release of air.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve and surface the seed) is clear and tightens through the vortex decision and ingestion of the page. Pressure is coherent and grows under the accumulative lens, with the spider-clock paying off at the buoy trigger. Cost is legible (personal risk, consuming the page, destroying the lab’s remaining air). Slight softness: external antagonism is environmental rather than oppositional, keeping escalation intimate rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme arises organically from action and image: vulnerability as hinge, chance vs. judgment, liberation of fear transmuted into strength. Recurrences (dice, dance, web) are reweighted at the end without moralizing. The lullaby-code reaching a child delivers a non-literal answer that resonates beyond plot. A few thesis-like lines are embedded as translation, but they feel earned by the cipher conceit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent with Mara’s perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (quiet thrum to waltzing vortex to surfacing hush) without losing clarity. No head-hopping or stance slips; elision is purposeful. Dialogue is minimal and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with strong verbs and high information density; figurative texture is rich but coherent to the aquatic/dance lexicon. Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum stays taut. A few lush images flirt with purple but remain controlled by pattern and pressure. The final lines are clean and impactful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—dance-encryption, hangman’s dice as compass, spider-timed heist, ingestion of the cipher—feels singular and internally inevitable. Risks in conceit and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns emerge from prior patterning rather than late rule changes. The ending’s echo to the child adds an elegant, fresh reconfiguration.</comment>
