<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desire and cost are embodied and specific: she literally solders hair and offers her stitched self to become the map. The navigator/offering contradiction creates live tension that sharpens at the center spiral. Micro‑choices (unscrewing, spiraling lines, speaking names into the censer foot) reveal values under pressure. If anything, her inner debate remains mostly enacted rather than verbalized, leaving a hairline distance from 9+ complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative lens coheres: midnight calls escalate tasks toward a clear closing act. Closure lands on the page with felt cost as her seams loosen and she becomes the place (RR with DC overtones). Moon‑phase constraints and failed hydraulics persist through the ending image. Every beat causally or pattern‑logically feeds the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The signal station, dish, ruptured hydraulics, and moonlight aren’t décor; they constrain tactics and shape the ritual. The censer foot functions as micro‑setting and tool, charging the center and the final dust‑breath. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, often tactile and olfactory (oil‑stained concrete, cedar/salt). World rules (moon‑phase current) stay consistent and matter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reversing loss—tightens via timed calls, the spiral build, and the realization she must be the offering. Each instruction narrows options, culminating in stepping into the center to “let the spiral close.” The felt price is unmistakable as identity unthreads to achieve the aim. Minor note: no antagonist, but pressure remains coherent and internal/external strands interlock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of grief as navigable terrain emerges through action, not sermon, and the body‑as‑map conceit evolves into a final repricing. Recurrent images (dish, moon, censer foot, spiral) shift meaning at closure. “Reverse migration is not travel but translation” crystallizes subtext earned by preceding beats. The final folklore tag widens resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks one sensibility with a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well across the timed calls; diction is controlled and character‑specific. The brief dialogue (phone) is functional, textured, and advances stakes. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Imagery density is high but disciplined; metaphors align with the established rule‑set (signal, hydraulics, moon, mapping). Sentence rhythms vary and carry momentum; little to no scaffold or paraphrase loops. A couple of lush lines approach purple but remain legible and purposeful. The closure image is crisp, not blurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Signal‑station ritual plus moon‑phase hydraulics and a censer foot that becomes altar/anchor is a fresh synthesis. The midnight call pattern is boldly formal and pays off structurally and thematically. The reversal of dunes and the bodily cartography feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
