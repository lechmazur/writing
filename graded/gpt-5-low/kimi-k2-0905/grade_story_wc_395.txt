<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motivation (paid to remember what others must forget) intensifies credibly into defiance at the firewall bargain. Interiority is specific and embodied through objects (patch, crystal) rather than labels. The mother reveal braids personal stakes with professional duty and earns the self-erasure choice. A touch more on her fear or hesitation at the bargain could deepen contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is strong: anomalous hashtag → patch chord → map → infiltration → bargain → broadcast. The closure lands on the page with a decisive cost (losing identity/employment) and a clear after-state (becoming a living archive). Minor plausibility leaps (audio-to-map, AI conspiracy dump) are carried by the established world logic and do not disrupt the drive lens. The final blank-user cadence seals conceptual repricing cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: social archive tools enable discovery; polar server farm physically houses consequences; Block 73 constrains and focuses the choice. The environment and objects (crystal blocks, firewall, patch) charge the final image (empty Block 73, wind at 73 bpm). Sensory integration (hum, chill, glow) supports tone and theme without stalling momentum. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus self-erasure—tightens decisively at the firewall’s bargain. The choice to open “UNSEND” forecloses her corporate life with visible cost as her identity flickers out. Internal conflict (contract vs. conscience; duty vs. mother) interlocks with external pressure in one clean escalation. Resolution stems from her agency, not coincidence, and consequences persist (crowd-hosted memories, blank user cadence).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and commodified grief accrue through concrete images (ghost posts, unsent messages, chorus leaking to the net). The lullaby motif deepens from private inheritance to public reckoning, reweighting the premise at the end. One explicit sentence (“auctioned the grief-clicks”) flirts with didactic clarity but the surrounding images preserve resonance. The final charged poise resists tidy moralizing while making cost felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is confident and coherent, modulating between technical and intimate registers in character. Patterned diction (ghosts, chords, cold) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or stance wobble; inference remains within plausible knowledge. A few corporate-phrased lines brush exposition, but rhythm and image carry them.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with strong propulsion; images do multiple jobs (patch as keepsake, key, brand). Figurative language is controlled and mostly precise; repetition patterns feel intentional. Minimal scaffolding and no looped paraphrase; syntax varies with scene pressure. A couple of stacked metaphors risk saturation, but clarity holds at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—corporate memory keeper, influencer ship, lullaby-as-signal, data ghosts—feels distinctive and thematically aligned. Familiar genre notes (Black Mirror-esque corporate malfeasance) are personalized through the mother tie and object-work. Turns are earned from earlier seeds (73 motif, patch) rather than late rule-changes. Boldness comes from committing to the costed transformation rather than twistiness.</comment>
