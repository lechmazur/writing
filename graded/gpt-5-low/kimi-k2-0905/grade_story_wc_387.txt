<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and embodied choices; the net‑mender’s humility and boldness cohere into the final risk. Micro‑choices (barefoot steps, continued whisking when the moon dims) show values under pressure. The leap onto the shadow staircase reads as an earned synthesis of tradecraft and belief. Slight idealization flattens contradiction, but motivation remains strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design holds: whistling → moon paths → whisking → shadow path → step. Closure lands on the page with cost as she chooses absence over stone. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and each turn grows from prior images. A minor late typo does not harm causality but prevents higher-band polish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The parapet after rain, mossed blocks, wet flagstones, and harbor reflections are vivid and functional; rain enables the silver thread geometry. Environment constrains action (barefoot for traction; edge decision) and charges the final image. Recurring object-as-setting (whisk) integrates seamlessly. Sensory balance is strong without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on testing and embodying hidden effort, tightened when the moon veils and she persists, then sharpens into stepping off into shadow. The cost is conceptual and physical risk, reweighted by the new rule (absence as support). Escalation arises from her agency rather than coincidence. Pressure is lyrical but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete labor, pattern‑making, and the ethics of maintenance; the closing descent reframes understanding as praxis. Recurring motifs (nets, whisk, moon paths) accrue meaning. A couple lines verge on thesis statement (“understanding comes not from seeing but from doing”), trimming subtlety. Resonance still lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, confident lyric voice with a tactile, craft‑inflected lexicon; focalization is steady and plausible. Rhythm modulates with pressure (cloud crossing, increased tempo toward the step). No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Minor diction flourish never strays beyond established idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density and varied syntax; most images do double duty. Occasional richness skirts purple but stays controlled and concrete. A visible typo/truncation in the final lines (“bl”) is a notable artifact in the last third and dings polish. Otherwise, momentum is clean and unlooped.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis of labor philosophy, lunar geometry, and tool‑ritual; the shadow staircase is a fresh turn that feels earned. Risks in conceit and diction heighten coherence rather than distract. Emotional truth (maintenance as devotion) grounds the strangeness. Small didactic edges and the typo prevent a higher tier.</comment>
