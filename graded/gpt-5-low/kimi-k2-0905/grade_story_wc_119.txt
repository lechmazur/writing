<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chen’s motive—to orchestrate a final message and disappear into a different life—is clear, consistent, and pushed by contradictory impulses (spy vs. “only wind”). His micro‑choices (palming film, planting the fortune, timing steps with the lens) reveal character under pressure. The keeper adds soft relational pressure without hijacking the scene. The renunciation at the end reads earned with a felt cost (identity and ties relinquished).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: repeated “open secret” and light/darkroom mechanics accrue toward the departure. Causality is intact—fortune written, film exposed, cookie planted, skiff untied—and the closure lands on page with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when on a lighthouse night). The final image reconfigures options and meaning without strain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse and sea are not decorative; the Fresnel lens literally enables exposure and rhythms tactics and mood, and the rocky island constrains and charges choices. Environmental pressure shapes his covert method and escape, and the last chord—“hummed… in the key of salt and departure”—is charged by place. Sensory detail is selective and purpose‑driven. Spatial choreography (stairs, rail, skiff) stays clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape/transformation) is signaled early and tightens as the accidentally prophetic fortune reframes risk. The key turn is his renunciation via skiff, with a conceptual and practical price. Escalation is quiet but genuine, deepening through the fortune’s echo (“rock… inside you”). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—open secrets, prophecy becoming true by being carried, light’s confession vs. the sea’s loud secrecy—emerges from particulars, not thesis statements. The final image conceptually reprices the premise (he becomes tuned by the island he leaves). Dialogue carries subtext (keeper: “Ever think the light talks?”). No moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is precise, rhythmic, and consistent; lyric diction is character‑tuned (spycraft + poet’s ear). Dialogue is spare, goal‑bearing, and distinct, with subtext. No POV leakage; focalization remains with Chen’s perceptions and tactics. Patterned elisions (refrains like “open secret”) are taught and pay off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense without muddle; metaphors (darkroom, negatives, lithophone) align to light/film/stone and rarely mix. Minimal scaffold or loops; repetition functions as motif. Syntax and paragraphing manage breath and momentum. A few lush turns push purple’s edge but maintain clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fortune‑cookie writer as covert operative using a lighthouse as camera/darkroom is striking and coherent. The “accidentally prophetic” line as both tactic and fate is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final repricing image feels singular.</comment>
