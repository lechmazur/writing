<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—preserving wonder against the erosion of routine—is concrete and drives every choice, culminating in the costed lie. The involuntary-truth constraint produces credible internal contradiction at the peak. Her micro-choices (recalibrating the turnstile, locking the booth, taking the stairs, pressing palms to copper) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The boy functions as a catalyst without stealing agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: riddle → ascent → second riddle → forced lie → lightning → reanimated hive → toll renunciation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with cost (risking job/identity and opening the gate). Orientation is strong from the first line, and the drive lens holds. Minor reliance on riddle-convenience never breaks logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower, copper cones, ozone, and dead hive are tactile and purpose-driven; blackout constrains stairs and channels tactics through the rods. Environment actively shapes the climax (hands on copper; lightning path to hive). Recurring objects (coins, matchbox) are integrated into setting behavior. Atmosphere (“nectar dusk”) saturates but doesn’t smother clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens from idle booth to forbidden ascent to a lie that violates her defining constraint. The lie is a meaningful, costed act that narrows options and triggers the external cascade. Internal and external pressures interlock cleanly. Stakes remain focused without inflation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved through transgressive honesty (a lie that keeps you honest) emerges organically from constraint and action. Recurring images (nectar dusk, bees, coins) shift meaning at the end. The final offered matchbox extends the ethical paradox into the world. The last clause edges toward explicitness but stays earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close holds steady; diction matches Mara’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and charged with subtext due to the truth-constraint. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially at the summit. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong, with vivid imagery doing multiple jobs; momentum rarely sags. A few lush metaphors approach purple but remain coherent and legible under stress. Varied syntax and clean mechanics keep propulsion. Peak beats stay clear despite density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: lightning-harvest tower, drone-hive failure, truth-curse, and a riddle demanding a lie cohere into a fresh mythic-tech fable. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the constraints. The coin-bee etching and toll renunciation are striking, specific touches. Boldness serves character and closure rather than gimmickry.</comment>
