<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are clear and consistent—skepticism sharpened into inquiry—and her on‑page choices (tracking footprints, sampling, mapping) align with that drive. Interiority is specific (the pendant’s warmth; the “bronze quiet”) and avoids stock feelings. The internal contradiction (skeptic versus longing for a true “home”) is present but mostly implied rather than dramatized under pressure. The closing renunciation (“warn about the price of artificial belonging”) lands, though the felt cost is mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds cleanly from observation to realization: footprints → measurements → conceptual repricing of “home.” Orientation is strong early (who/where/when) and the system of the pilgrimage is legible. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she leaves to fight, with “last free choice” underscoring cost. The cost is more implied than dramatized, but the before/after reweighting is undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sculpture garden, hollow bronze statue, wind‑triggered EM spikes, and “rainwashed tower” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Mara’s scientific attention. Setting details function: wind through the statue affects readings; footprints glow; the pendant warms in response. The micro‑setting (pendant/statue) charges the final image and subtly constrains her inquiry tactics. Rich specificity without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (truth about the visitors’ harvest) are signaled early and deepen through evidence gathering to a reframed threat. Escalation is primarily intellectual and tonal rather than confrontational, but it tightens toward the convergence scene. The visible price is limited to reputational risk and the ominous “last free choice,” leaving consequences largely after the scene. Still, agency drives the turns and the end stance is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Commodification of belonging and the ethics of memory are woven through concrete images (footprints residue, statue, pendant) and culminate in a reweighted definition of “home.” Some thesis lines (“They were collecting… bottling it like perfume”) verge on didactic. The final image resists neat moralizing while retaining urgency. Subtext generally lives in the objects and patterning rather than speech.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Close third with a controlled, lucid lyricism matches the character’s skeptical, analytic mind. Diction (scientific terms, precise observation) remains within her plausible lexicon. The cadence modulates effectively from inquiry to resolve; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Refrains (“bronze quiet”) are purposeful rather than mannered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image‑dense with few redundancies; lines often do double duty (setting and theme). Occasional telling statements slightly flatten momentum but do not obscure causality or the closing image. Figurative language is coherent and textured without purple drift. Information density stays high with minimal scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “collectors of belonging” angle and “chemistry of homecoming” are fresh, with footprints as assay and a pendant as micro‑sensor. The convergence dance/scientific calibration hybrid is a striking image that feels earned. Risks are thematic and conceptual rather than structural, but coherence holds. The premise would be hard to swap without losing its distinct charge.</comment>
