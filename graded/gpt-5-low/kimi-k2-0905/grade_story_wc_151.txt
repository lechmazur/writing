<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority with credible contradiction between the need to be known and the compulsion to hide. Embodied choices—the chalk spiral, pressing the clipboard to her chest—reveal stakes under pressure. The final renunciation (mailing the unsigned letter, keeping the confession) feels earned. A tiny ding for one line of explanatory self‑awareness that edges toward telling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single, coherent scene with a live clock and visible tightening when the drone arrives early. The causal chain holds: deadline pressure forces a decisive selection between two letters. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with felt cost (remaining unread, erasing the chalk map). Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The golden arcade, glass roof, postal slot, and drone are vivid and purposive; they constrain choices and charge the final image. Recurring objects (clipboard, chalk) are integrated into action, not postcard detail. World rules (obsolete surface mail, drones) remain consistent and learned through scene. Atmosphere deepens theme without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truthful self vs protective anonymity—is signaled early and tightens credibly with the drone’s early arrival. The external clock and internal conflict interweave, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses a path. Visible prices: she keeps the confession, mails anonymity, erases codes that might reveal her center. Tension escalates at sentence and beat levels without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Identity, authorship, and the ethics of concealment emerge through objects and acts (mailing, chalk, barcodes vs daisies) rather than thesis. The final choice reweights “meaning in the margins” via action. One sentence (“she understood that meaning lived…”) edges toward a stated theme, slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature—futuristic nostalgia filtered through her sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Lyric compression is purposeful and legible. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with strong verbs and multi‑tasking images. A few metaphors lean lush (“honeyed beams,” “tiny planet orbiting her hesitation”), but coherence holds and cadence varies. Minimal redundancy; motifs reprise rather than loop. Proofing and syntax are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of obsolete surface mail with drones, a “pseudonym creator,” and chalk codes feels fresh and specific. The choice at the end is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth anchors the novelty.</comment>
