<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arlo’s motives (guarding defiant thought) are clear and enacted through concrete, risky micro-choices (palming the seed, twisting a tendril, using the ventilation). His contradictions—nerves vs. charm, compliance language vs. subversive action—surface in embodied beats. The Voss interaction reveals status and subtext without flattening either character. Cost is present but mostly conceptual, not deeply personal on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: plant seed → club signals → Voss intrusion → pollen distraction → warp-enabled slip → charged final image. Orientation is strong from line one, and the drive lens reads Hybrid with causal pressure leading to a conceptual reweighting at the end. Closure lands via Charged Poise/CR as “Resist” blooms and the citywide plan is set. The on-page cost is lighter than the threat implies, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse isn’t postcard décor; bees, glass, ventilation, and soil dictate tactics and outcome. World rules are learned through use (vegetal code, warp comma) and stay consistent. The recurring object (seed) and environment charge the final image (firefly-readable “Resist”). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered without tourist listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (planting glyphs under surveillance) is signaled early and tightened by Voss’s arrival and the imminent satellite pass. Arlo’s agency drives the turn (activating ventilation, slipping via warp residue), and the plan narrows options toward dawn. The felt price is mostly risk and one seed spent; a sharper on-page loss would heighten escalation. Still, stakes remain coherent and growing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of surveillance-economy, language as living resistance, and taxing imagination emerge through action and imagery, not sermonizing. The “refund of dreams” and “comma rewriting reality” reweight earlier motifs at the end. Subtext thrives in Voss’s “candidly cryptic” exchange and the unparseable plant-speech. A few clever lines flirt with on-the-nose, but the piece resists moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled voice—lively, sly, and sensorially precise—matches Arlo’s persona and the world’s rules. Dialogue carries subtext and pressure, especially with Voss. Rhythm modulates cleanly under stress without head-hopping or register drift. The playful lexicon (“Form 1099-IDEA”) enhances character and setting rather than explaining them.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with fresh metaphors that mostly land; lines do multiple jobs. No scaffold loops or template cadence, and syntax varies to maintain propulsion. A touch of figurative lushness risks purple in places but rarely obscures action. Mechanics and sequencing are clean through the climax and final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Taxable thoughts + plant-linguistics + municipal grid warping is a striking synthesis. Turns and tactics grow from these specifics (ventilation pollen as speech, warp comma), not from generic genre moves. The final image feels inevitable and reconfiguring. Boldness reads organic, not gimmicked.</comment>
