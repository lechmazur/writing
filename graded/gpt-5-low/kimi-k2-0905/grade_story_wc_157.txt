<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arlo’s motive—guarding defiant thought—drives specific, risky choices (planting the seed under surveillance, invoking the passphrase, exploiting the ventilation). Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (“tasting nectar and nerves”) with competent but not invulnerable swagger. The Voss exchange clarifies status and pressure. Limited contradiction inside Arlo (mostly fear vs. resolve) keeps the arc persuasive but not deeply torn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: seed placement → coded confirmations → Voss intrusion + satellite clock → pollen distraction → warp‑assisted slip. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: by sunrise the planted word “Resist” reweights the world’s tax logic with social cost and personal risk. Persistent constraints (surveillance, taxable thoughts, ticking satellite pass) shape tactics. The on‑page cost is more conceptual than bodily, but legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse isn’t decorative; its ventilation system becomes the critical tool and its living inventory encodes dialogue. Drones, glass shimmer, and insect behavior filter through Arlo’s trained attention, guiding choices. Object‑as‑setting (gourd seed) charges the final image. World rules (taxed thoughts, vegetal language) stay consistent and discoverable through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—plant the glyphs before surveillance captures them—is clear and tightens with Voss’s arrival and the imminent satellite pass. Arlo’s agency drives the turn via passphrase and pollen gambit; the warp residue escape is a paid‑for option, not luck. Costs are present (risk, used seed, time compression), though not devastating. Tension runs sentence‑to‑sentence without soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of state capture of imagination and counter‑speech through living language arise from concrete acts (planting a glyph as resistance). Subtext in coded botany, tax forms (1099‑IDEA), and bees carrying “subversive pollen” builds resonance without sermonizing. The final image reprices the premise—language as flora, freedom as horticulture. One phrase (“untaxed thought unfurl”) edges toward explicitness but remains image‑led.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, witty third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature and stays within Arlo’s plausibility. Dialogue is sparse but pointed; Voss’s lines carry subtext and threat while advancing pressure. Diction and rhythm flex with intensity, and patterned elisions (codes in plants) are taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet purposeful; images often do double duty (orchid bees as “tax auditors” both worldbuild and theme). Metaphor frequency is high but coherent to the tax/resistance motif, avoiding muddle. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum is strong. A couple of stacked similes flirt with purple but don’t blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—taxable thoughts, living language glyphs, horticultural subversion—feels fresh and specific. Turns grow from prior particulars rather than late rule‑drops, and risk‑taking (vegetal code as dialogue) heightens stakes without confusion. Final reconfiguration (“Resist” in firefly cursive) reads inevitable in hindsight. It stands apart from template dystopia through tactile, clever tactics.</comment>
