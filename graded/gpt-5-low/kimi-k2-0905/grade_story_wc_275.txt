<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, character-specific motivation (weaving violent legacy into a peace-garden) with embodied perception and micro-choices (lifting the canvas, sheathing, planting). The pacifist/violent inheritance tension is vivid but largely uncontested on the page, keeping the cost subtle. Interiority is textured (engraved quiet as pressure), though the emotional path is a touch pre-decided. The final acceptance reads earned, if gently so.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images accrue toward the planting and the root-pulse. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when, cause of loss). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost—braiding violence into peace—enacted by planting at the airbag’s fall site. Because/therefore threads are soft but coherent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective setting (cracked glass dome, desert roses, obsidian spire) filtered through Mira’s horticultural priorities. The environment and recurring objects charge the final image (spot of impact; canvas-patterned stems). Weather/light (“tranquil blaze”) modulate tone and meaning without postcard excess. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: transform ruin into continuity. Pressure deepens via night-long labor and the decision to bind the violent artifact into the living graft, culminating in planting and listening for roots. Escalation is more textural than oppositional; consequences are conceptual rather than biting. The cost is felt but understated, keeping tension moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, transformation, and reconciliation arise from particulars (blood-brightened blooms, canvas weave in stems) rather than thesis. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the root-pulse and site-specific planting. Occasional explicitness (“creating living memorials”) nudges toward statement but does not undercut the earned resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature (horticultural lexicon, sensory bias). Rhythm and diction are controlled, with modulations at sunset/night/dawn that track emotion. No head-hopping or stance slippage; the voice sustains image pressure without over-explaining. Line-level confidence shows across beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images do more than one job. Lush metaphors are mostly coherent and grounded in the world’s textures. A few phrases recur (“inculcating plants with values”) and flirt with abstraction, but momentum holds. Final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—inculcating plants with values via grafting woven with a bounty-hunter relic—feels fresh and integral. The “engraved quiet” and “tranquil blaze” lexicon lends distinctiveness without gimmickry. Risks are aesthetic and thematic rather than structural, but they heighten cohesion. The piece commits to its premise with specific, memorable choices.</comment>
