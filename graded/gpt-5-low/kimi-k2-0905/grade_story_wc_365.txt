<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority and specific micro-choices (kneeling, swallowing the cube, vowing to chart consequences) reveal a singular psyche under pressure. Motivation coheres—she maps absence to weigh withheld truth—and contradicts itself when her own complicity surfaces, sharpening the final renunciation. Emotional texture is concrete (tastes, pulses, balance shifts) rather than labeled. Minor softness: the guilt acceptance is swift, more processed than struggled with on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: shard → loom → locker → note/cube → repriced mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—her complicity and a redirected life’s work—on the page. The shard/tool functions as a persistent constraint shaping tactics and exit image. Slight convenience in the note/cube mechanism, but it fuels, rather than replaces, the earned turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bay’s tactile ruin (cracked deck, ribs, zero‑g, skylight) guides choices and constrains movement; the shard as micro‑setting charges orientation and the ending. Sensory detail is curated through the map maker’s professional bias, balancing smell, touch, and sound. World rules feel consistent and are learned via action, not exposition. The final image is decisively charged by place and object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering and weighing withheld truth—tightens through the loom traversal and the zero‑g discovery to the complicity reveal. Agency drives escalations (stepping into strands, prying the locker, ingesting the cube, choosing a new mapping ethic). The cost is conceptual and moral rather than physical, but it’s legible and charges the resolution. A more acute on‑page setback or trade‑off would push higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth as mass and the ethics of cartography emerges through images and actions rather than lecture; the note risks aphorism but is embedded as artifact and reweighted by the ending vow. Recurring motifs (shard’s song, redirection, loom) evolve in meaning and culminate coherently. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection on complicity and weaponized knowledge. No false equivalence dilutes the stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric POV with a consistent perceptual signature—sensorially biased, mechanically attuned—sustains control under pressure. Diction and rhythm modulate with intensity (from dust and rust to charged stillness in vacuum) without head‑hopping. Taught patterns (“cyclically spontaneous,” loom, redirection) are purposeful and paid off. No register drift or explanatory crutches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; lines multitask (world, psyche, tension). Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“loom” of bays, “copper wire of her veins”), rarely purple. Minimal repetition feels motif‑driven rather than looped. A trace of aphoristic shine in the note is the only slight excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—sensory cartography as ethical inquiry, a humming shard as loom key, grief digested as data—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual SF) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established motifs and character choice rather than late rule changes. The final reconfiguration is both conceptually bold and emotionally grounded.</comment>
