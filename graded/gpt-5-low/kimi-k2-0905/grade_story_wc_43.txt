<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to deliver a “flawless goodbye”—is clear and consistently embodied through tactile, sensory choices under pressure. Her “decisively kind” stance directs concrete actions (placing the shard, modulating the music, guiding the daughter). Interiority is specific (vinyl scent as hope), though her inner conflict is subdued—competence outweighs contradiction. Still, the final redefinition of “reunify” registers as earned growth with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece deepens via sensory braiding (sound → scent) toward on‑page closure. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “reunify does not mean repair,” crystallized by rejoining the vinyl halves, with death and continued carrying as cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the two‑shard skybridge coda coheres. Setups (song title, shard) pay off precisely at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific—the cloud‑level ward, glass floor, humming skybridge—and integrates with mood and action. Environmental details are filtered through Mara’s sensory priorities, and the skybridge midpoint charges the final image. While the setting mostly shapes tone rather than constraining choices, the object‑as‑setting (vinyl) and space frame the closure. The sensory palette is balanced beyond the visual (smell, sound, touch).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: shepherding an intentional goodbye. Pressure tightens when Mara shifts from hymning the mundane to hymning the “scent of hope,” narrowing tactics as Calderon approaches stillness. The price lands on the page (death; Mara’s acceptance of carrying both halves forward). Resolution flows from Mara’s choices rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of parting, ritual care, and the difference between reunion and repair arise organically from images and acts, not sermonizing. The recurring vinyl motif evolves meaningfully, culminating in a nuanced answer to the central question of how to say goodbye. Subtext in dialogue (“Goodbyes aren’t endings”) avoids platitude by being enacted. The final image reweights prior details with lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Dialogue is spare but character‑specific and subtextual, advancing stakes. No head‑hopping or stance drift; sensory focus remains anchored in Mara’s gaze. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and dense without collapsing into muddle; images like “silence to grow teeth” and “label centered over his heart” are sharp. Figurative load is high but purposeful and consistent with the voice, maintaining clarity through the peak beats. No loops or scaffolding clutter; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few lush turns flirt with purple but do not blur causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: hospice music therapy rendered through “hymning the mundane,” a vinyl shard as ritual tool, and “the scent of hope” as tactic. The reunify vs. repair insight feels inevitable in hindsight and genuinely reorients the premise. Risks in lyric texture and surreal setting pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece resists template beats, achieving memorable specificity.</comment>
