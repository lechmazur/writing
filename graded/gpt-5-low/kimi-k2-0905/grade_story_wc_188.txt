<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Luma’s motive and values are crystalline and drive each micro-choice (the trade with Jax, the lullaby dust, the wager with the governor). Interiority is conveyed through tactile ritual (chanting, handling shards) rather than exposition. Minor limitation: little contradictory impulse or visible fear under pressure; she remains serenely competent, which flattens complexity slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: trade → fuse → wager → ignition → sky’s release, with clean setup/payoff on the mosaic and the governor’s ban. Closure lands on-page as a decisive change with an explicit risk (surrender craft if it fails). A touch of convenience in the lullaby-dust beat, but it fits the established magic and doesn’t undermine the throughline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and active—the blooming fortress, spiral stair, sentry choke point, and battlement ritualize escalation and shape tactics. Recurring objects (hourglass, rag knot, rocket) charge the final image. The environment constrains action without stalling momentum; only hairline excess of lushness keeps it from higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen the sky vs enforced despair) is clear from the outset and tightens credibly at the governor’s ultimatum. The pledge to surrender if she fails creates a real price and focuses the climax. Conflict integrates internal stance with external action, though Luma’s near-invulnerability slightly softens felt danger.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hope versus control is embodied through concrete acts; “Remember” evolves from secret to skywriting heart. Thematic turn lands in image (floating sand, green laughter flame) rather than moral. One line edges toward thesis-stating (“seriousness without playfulness calcified”), but the piece largely trusts subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and cadence stay coherent under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and status-charged. The voice sustains patterning (chant, hissing flame, corked sky) without confusing focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet controlled; images align (corked sky, glass heart, orbiting sand) and carry multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or syntactic monotony; momentum stays taut across ornate sentences. Occasional high-density metaphor clusters flirt with excess but remain legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of pyrotechnic craft with a metaphysical blockade feels fresh; the mosaic note’s transmutation into a skywide “Remember” is inventive and earned. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without gimmickry. A couple beats echo familiar fable structures, but the particulars feel singular.</comment>
