<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias is distinct—kindly, methodical, tactile—and his motive to make the voices heard culminates in a credible renunciation of invisibility. Interiority is concrete (mapping joists, tracing oxide like dried blood) without therapy-speak. The relationship with the girl is delicately staged and reconfigures his stance. Internal conflict is subtle rather than overt, so the price of visibility is felt but not sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: fragments accrue into a charged reveal where the girl says “I see you,” a clean on‑page RR. Orientation is crisp early (library, outage, crawlspace), and the pattern is taught and paid off. The cost is emotional rather than logistical, but it lands in the final beat with a before/after. No extraneous detours or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library and crawlspace are tactile and constraining—pipe chases, floorboard gaps, candlelight—shaping what Elias can do and how. Sensory specificity across sound, touch, and smell sustains tone without touristic cataloging. The environment charges the final image (her palm to the boards, voices rising). Consistency of world rules and tools reads effortless.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on audibility and visibility under a ticking outage; pressure coheres as he moves from secret caching to deliberate revelation. The meaningful tightening is the candle/girl discovery leading to the push of the final fragment. Cost is mostly identity exposure rather than a hard trade‑off, keeping tension quiet. Still, the escalation cadence is clear and purposeful under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of stories as survival/lanterns emerges through action and the recurrent fragments, culminating in communal voice. The taped line “Stories are lanterns” toes the edge of explicitness but is diegetically justified and earned by prior particulars. Subtext operates in gestures (her hand on the boards) and the charged hush. Resonance lingers without collapsing into a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s perception; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. No head‑hopping; the girl’s presence is rendered through his vantage and sound. Repetition patterns (sapphire hush, pipe chases) feel taught, not mechanical. The prose trusts image and action over explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, varied rhythm, and images that work on multiple levels without muddle. Figurative language is selective and apt (“oxide surface flaking like dried blood,” “moth wings”). Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum carries through the accumulative beats. No artifacting at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crawlspace archivist conjuring a chorus from tape fragments during a blackout feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The ferromagnetic detail and pipe‑chase mechanics ground the lyric premise. The final reweighting—visibility as shared voice—transforms a trope into something particular. Bold without gimmickry, though the conflict remains intentionally gentle.</comment>
