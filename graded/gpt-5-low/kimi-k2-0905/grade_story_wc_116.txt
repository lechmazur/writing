<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear motive and interiority: the oath to “witness change without judgment” binds every choice. Contradiction is alive—she seeks coherence in the river’s silence while edging toward surrender to forgetting. Micro-choices (activating the swan, choosing to write, then leaving) reveal a hierarchy of values. Emotional embodiment is specific (e.g., “ledger heavy,” “silence stitched her frayed thoughts”), though the arc stays contemplative rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: river → library → river, with the swan and silence as causal links. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: acceptance that forgetting may be mercy and a future decision to remain stone-bound when the swan dissolves. Cost is conceptual but legible (the loss of vocation/self when the map dies). The final sentence fragment mars cadence but does not erase the closure achieved a line earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is lavish, precise, and functional: the obsidian refuge restores her, the catacomb library multiplies marginalia and rearranges itself, and the swan-as-tool navigates space. The river’s “regenerative silence” constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail is integrated and POV-filtered (ink like sap, glowworm lantern). Minor risk of ornament density keeps this just shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on identity and duty versus the pull of erasure; escalation is a deepening rather than reversal. The tremor and the library’s living marginalia intensify texture, not direct opposition. The meaningful tightening is the recognition that the swan’s decay will foreclose her role. Pressure is coherent but remains mostly internal and lyrical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of witness, memory, and mercy cohere through recurring images (swan, silence, ink, sand). The final repricing—loosening grip as mercy, not decay—reweights the whole. Occasional direct restatement of the oath flirts with over-explicitness, but subtext largely carries the load. The last charged image of becoming “another stone” resonates cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single, assured close-third voice with distinctive diction and rhythm. Lexicon and imagery feel of a piece with the world’s logic; psychic distance remains steady. Musical sentences modulate without head-hopping. Slight purple edges are controlled and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density and strong imagery; most metaphors cohere. Some lines cluster figurative layers that risk saturation. A visible copy error (final sentence fragment) breaks the closing cadence. Overall momentum holds, but tightening a few lush passages would sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: obsidian refuge with regenerative silence, an origami swan keyed by a river’s name, and a library that breeds marginalia. The map-wear cost and future-earned stasis feel non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are purposeful and coherent. Minor conventional lyric tropes appear but are transformed by specificity.</comment>
