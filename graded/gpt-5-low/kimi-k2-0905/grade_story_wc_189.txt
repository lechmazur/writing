<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motives are clean and character-specific: she flees to the grotto to seek a sideways answer to reconciliation, and her micro-choices (shifting the lantern, setting/offering the cicada) reveal her value hierarchy. Interiority is embodied through observation, not labels, and the daughter’s hesitant arrival adds real relational pressure. The change—mutual re-entry into dialogue—feels earned with visible cost (vulnerability, time). Minor softness: conflict remains gentle; sharper internal contradiction could push higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the pattern of noticing → invitation → offering → acceptance culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (chronicler, grotto, tide) and the closure lands on-page with cost (charged sharing of the cicada, dawn’s threshold). The “memory-forward” foresight elegantly seals the cadence without mechanical wrap-up. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto and tidal pool are exquisitely specific and filter through the chronicler’s professional attention; sensory detail (phosphorescent limestone, brittle star, salt grit) is purposeful. Environment constrains tactics—silence, watching, patience—and charges the final image (tide reclaiming the basin, footprints erased yet stone changed). The jade cicada functions as a micro-setting object that evolves state (cool to warm). Balance across senses is strong without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciliation) is signaled early and tightens via the daughter’s arrival, the silent co-watching, and the offering of the cicada. The meaningful turn is the daughter accepting the object and the mother’s low-voiced metaphor, which narrows options from avoidance to tentative engagement. Cost is legible: risk of exposure, relinquishing argument posture, and time spent in endurance. Pressure is subtle but consistent with the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of transition, patience, and time’s texture emerge organically through concrete motifs (tide pool as held ocean, cicada’s delayed song, erasing footprints). Subtext is strong in shared observation and silence. However, two explicit thesis-like lines (“Listen to the pool…”; “every pause is a cocoon”) tip toward didactic, slightly reducing the earned resonance. The ending still reweights the premise through image, but restraint there would lift it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with precise diction and a stable close-third focalization; perceptual signature is unmistakable. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual; the daughter’s half-sob laugh reads true. Rhythm modulates well from hush to charged poise at dawn. Minor risk of over-articulation in a couple thematic sentences keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: images do multiple jobs, syntax varies, and momentum never stalls. Figurative density is high but coherent to the sea/time/cicada lattice; no mixed metaphors or template cadences. Minimal redundancy; key echoes (erasure, layering) are purposeful. A touch of overt thematizing trims the top edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “tidal-pool chronicler” frame with a jade cicada as grief/time conduit feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The tangential observational method as conflict tactic is an elegant, original choice. The final reconfiguration—charged by environment and object—avoids cliché reconciliation beats. Bold restraint and image-led logic heighten stakes without gimmickry.</comment>
