<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Asha’s contradictory impulses—former universalist vs. the hard mercy of forgetting—are dramatized through tactile, specific choices (forty-nine tesserae; releasing named memories). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, anchored in the embodied act of rebuilding a mosaic. The renunciation (taking the stone, leaving) forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor telling creeps in but is grounded by action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: present labor interleaves with charged recollection, culminating in a CR/RR where “map of forgetting” reweights the premise. Orientation is clear early (plaza, minaret, shattered sky), and the closing legend beat lands cost without soft resets. The forty‑nine‑day motif and dawn timing provide subtle structural tightening. No causality breaks; the closure moment is on the page and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The environment and objects (minaret base, tesserae, cracked stepping stone) shape tactics and charge the ending—she literally reads history by touch and lets the chipped pattern guide the new map. Starlight and the “shattered sky” permeate mood and method. The stepping stone removal recharges the locus of setting at closure. Sensory and occupational specificity feel lived‑in, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around choosing what to forget and what that costs; the tightening comes as she assigns each tessera to a released memory and then removes herself and the stone. Stakes are moral and personal rather than adversarial, but they escalate via the dawn deadline and the exacting numerology. The price—identity shift, leaving the city, ceding judgment—reads clearly. Quiet but decisive deepening suits the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme integrates through action and image—knowledge as burden/blessing; mercy in forgetting—culminating in the multi‑valent final figure (book/child/flame/seed). However, the line “the greatest mercy lay not in what we chose to remember, but in what we allowed ourselves—and others—to forget” states the thesis outright, softening subtext. The CR still resonates. Ambiguity is meaningful without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature—tactile attention, moral calculus, and measured cadence. Rhythm modulates from methodical gathering to dawn revelation cleanly. No head‑hopping or register drift. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry density and propulsion; images often do double duty (astronomical charts as wayfinding and erasure). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; minimal scaffold or loops. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in late moral lines trims the peak band but does not dull closure. Syntax and paragraphing vary to support breath and pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Map of forgetting” rendered via mosaic praxis, the Iron Cradle persona, and the retooled constellation all feel singular. The retrocognition premise is harnessed to humane stakes rather than spectacle. The ending’s social ripple (communal tesserae constellation) extends novelty into consequence. Risk‑taking in concept and image heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
