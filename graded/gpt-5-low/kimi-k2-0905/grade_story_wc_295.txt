<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—she must witness and translate before the star dims—and her realization that she is “the chronicled” reframes her healing power with personal cost. Interiority is concrete through object work (petal‑syllables, telescope, vellum) and the boy’s late naming marks a relational turn. The main softness: conflict resolves with minimal resistance; her gift faces grief but little pushback or error. Still, the renunciation of solitary bearing (shared burden) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: star‑timed witnessing → doorway vision → healing act → vow and shared burden. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: temple’s credo, the healed instrument, the handoff of the telegram, and the star’s wink, with cost (temple crumbles; she carries the echo). Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and set‑ups pay off. Slight smoothness in obstacles keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory, refractor, and star mechanics are tactile and integrated; the temple/desert overlays evolve with action and choice. Object‑as‑setting (telegram, refractor) constrains moves and charges the final image. Sensory economy favors purposeful detail; world rules (variable star cadence) are consistent through use. Not quite 9+ only because constraint is gentle rather than forceful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres under the chosen lens: the predicted fade creates a ticking window; her speaking of syllables and tool‑healing escalate meaning. The decisive deepening is the inscription’s reconfiguration into a credo that alters her stance and bond with the boy. Stakes remain mostly internal/spiritual, with limited friction or foreclosed options on the page. Nonetheless, the trade—solitary bearing of grief for shared stewardship—carries felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Resonance is strong—“shared burdens → shared light” reframes grief into communal cartography—and images echo with integrity (pollen‑ink, star Morse, midnight solace). However, thematic lines are occasionally stated outright (“Witness, speak, heal…”) edging toward didactic. The story largely earns its insights through specific acts and objects, and the final star wink reweights the whole. A touch more subtext over statement would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature runs throughout; diction and rhythm are controlled and apt to the chronicler. A brief “we” collective moment reads intentional and thematically aligned rather than leakage. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—the boy’s first human name carries subtext and turns the relationship. Voice remains consistent under pressure without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; verbs and nouns generally carry weight. Some lines press toward purple or thematic declaration, but clarity and momentum survive. No material loops or metaphor muddle at the peak; sentence rhythms vary effectively. Minor overwriting in the final exhortation prevents a higher tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis—daylily telegrams as healing script, variable stars as Morse doors, a boy fluent in constellations—feels singular and coherent. Turns arise from established rules, not late conveniences, and the star‑observatory toolwork grounds the wonder. Emotional truth (burden‑sharing) is specific rather than generic. Slight familiarity in the explicit moral keeps it below the rarest band.</comment>
