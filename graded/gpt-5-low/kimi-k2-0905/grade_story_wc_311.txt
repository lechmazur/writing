<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority—he seeks to “name the nameless fear” and discovers complicity. Contradictory impulses surface: duty-bound taker of endings versus shame and a need for atonement. Micro-choices (tracing the atlas, shattering cylinders, folding scraps) reveal values under pressure. The final acceptance of a costed identity shift reads earned rather than declared.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image-triggered turn (“pinhole” → starlight → star-sentences → question) tightens toward the conceptual repricing. Closure lands with cost: he learns the dead’s sacrifices sustained him and acts to release their voices, losing relics and the old frame. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the ending’s Charged Poise/CR is on the page. No causality breaks; each beat coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, wax cylinders, and atlas are tactile, specific, and used as tools that shape options. Setting actively charges the turns (roof splitting into copper, starlight machinery, atlas transforming to boat/ledger/paper souls). Sensory range is rich without cataloging; details evolve with action. The final image is inseparable from place and objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and escalates: from seeking a name to confronting the accusation that he is fed by sacrifice. The pivotal tightening is the written question “What was sacrificed for you?” followed by the copper mirror’s accusing brother. Agency drives resolution (shattering the cylinders; releasing and naming the voices), with a felt price and reweighted options. Pressure stays coherent and deepens rather than resetting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (“echo of sacrifice,” naming as moral accounting) emerges through event and image, not sermon. Recurring motifs—monsters as sacrifices crystallized, star-sentences, ledger—shift meaning at the end to forgiveness through recognition. The final pulse-in-the-chest reweights the reaper’s existence without tidy absolution. Ambiguity is meaningful, not murky.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lyric third tight to the reaper’s perception with consistent, confident distance. Diction and rhythm modulate under strain (jaw clicking, wordlessness) and avoid meta-explanation. The pattern of image-led turns is taught and paid off cleanly. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density lines mostly carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme) without sludge. Figurative language is bold yet coherent to the established logic (light, copper, ink, frost). Minimal redundancy; momentum sustains through varied syntax. A few lush stretches flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Reaper mythos reimagined via observatory mechanics, star-sentences, and ledgered sacrifice feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks—lyric accumulative structure, object-transformations—heighten meaning rather than distract. Turns grow from seeded images; nothing reads like stock template. Emotional truth matches the conceptual invention.</comment>
