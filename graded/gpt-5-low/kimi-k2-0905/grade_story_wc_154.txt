<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied—cordite on the tongue, “unknot by naming” as credo under pressure. The child’s plea and tap on the coral apply live relational pressure that forces confession and the choice to stay. Contradictory impulses (morphine-softened perception vs. urgent decoding) coexist credibly. The earned renunciation—sharing the birthday, altering the discharge—lands with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding the cast deepens stakes from date to village to coral-spiral, culminating in a reweighted final image. Orientation is established early (field hospital atrium, twilight, anesthetic) and serves the closure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the discharge line and star reprice guilt into sediment with cost (endurance, confession). The persistent constraint—the smudging ink and approaching dark—shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atrium’s mist and glass roof tangibly influence action (drips diluting ink; a soft clock on “before the dark eats the words”). Object-as-setting (brain coral) is integrated and charges the final image when aligned with the cast spiral. Sensory detail is selective and POV-biased, using sound (“soft clicks”) and touch (plaster ridges) to advance the scene. The environment frames the ending (droplets echoing footsteps), not mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the imperative to decode before loss; the page-by-page reveals escalate emotional cost. The boy’s line “stay” tests commitment and forecloses departure, paying a price in endurance and confession. Stakes remain intimate but consequential, integrating internal guilt with the external smearing clock. The resolution arises from agency—naming, staying, and inscribing the third line.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of translation, culpability, and communal memory arise through particulars (reef/spiral/fish) rather than lecture. The closing reprices trauma—from shrapnel to sediment—without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer: meaning is remade through shared naming. Subtext operates via image alignment (coral on cast) and the discharge note’s metaphor. A single explanatory sentence (“not inventory but confession”) skirts explicitness but is earned by the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled cadence; elevated diction fits a traumatized translator’s sensibility. Sparse dialogue carries subtext and action (“Unknot them…”; “stay”). Psychic distance modulates cleanly under stress without head-hopping. Metaphor and rhythm flex with pressure, never breaking plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut and multi-tasking; images do double duty (droplets as syllables and as a clock). Figurative density is high but coherent to the motif set; no muddled vehicles or loops. Minor risk of saturation is offset by purposeful reprises (shrapnel→sediment; blood→dew). Syntax and paragraphing vary to pace the decoding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The translator-in-a-field-hospital frame gains freshness through the reef/coral lexicon and ledger-on-cast device. The coral–cast alignment is an inventive, inevitable-feeling turn that reweights meaning. Risks in lyric intensity and metaphor stacking pay off with clarity and emotional precision. The piece commits fully to its premise without safety hedging.</comment>
