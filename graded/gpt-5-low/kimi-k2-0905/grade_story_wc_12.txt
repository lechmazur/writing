<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motives (“plumb the congregation’s unspoken fears”) drive concrete micro‑choices and escalate to the self‑risking swallow of doubt. The priest’s internal contradiction—performing faith while weaponizing doubt—registers viscerally. His dynamic with the painter adds pressure and a counter‑lens without head‑hopping. The cost (blood, relinquishing the loop’s armor) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (layered loops) and held through the reversal (infinite reverse) to on‑page closure: the possession passes because questions are resolved. Because/therefore linkages are elegant and legible (layers → hum of assumption → possession advances → reverse collapses the texture). The cost is present in the body and in forfeiting the built sound‑rope. Slight ding for the truncated final sentence, though closure already landed one beat earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nave, pedal, and “dimensional anchor” are not backdrop; they constrain tactics (looping, overdub, reverse) and charge the final image when the anchor is released. Specifics like ultramarine, cracked fresco, and the narthex/holy water sequence evolve with pressure. Sensory detail is balanced (sound foremost, light/color second). The object‑as‑setting (pedal) and sacred space cohere plausibly within the story’s rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (prevent possession) concentrate through one meaningful tightening: adding the congregation’s assumption as a hum that strengthens the threat. The “one loop left” beat compresses time and narrows options; choosing to record and then reverse his own doubt is a credible, costly tactic. The resolution flows from his agency and the woman’s counterstroke, not coincidence. Price and narrowing are clear without overcomplication.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—faith as door vs. wall, doubt as method and color—emerges from actions (negative space cross, hum of assumption) rather than exposition. The woman’s line risks being thesis‑like but is earned by the preceding images and recasts the blue motif. The final repricing (answers deprive possession) resonates beyond the scene without moralizing. Recurrences (heartbeat, silence, ultramarine) shift meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature threads sound‑engineering with liturgical cadence. Psychic distance remains steady, with dialogue sparse and subtext‑rich. Diction is controlled and voice‑specific, matching pressure. Minor cadence blemish in the final truncated line affects craft more than POV control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and efficient, with figurative language tethered to action (looping, negative space, hum). Rhythm varies well, and sentences do multiple jobs without scaffolding. However, the closing sentence is truncated (“walls settling into a”), marring cadence at the finish and undercutting polish. Otherwise, purple excess is avoided and clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—liturgical soundcraft, loop pedal as dimensional anchor, visual art as negative space exorcism—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking serves stakes rather than ornament. The reversal via “infinite reverse” is conceptually neat and grounded in earlier mechanics. Minor dock for the marred final line preventing a fully seamless finish.</comment>
