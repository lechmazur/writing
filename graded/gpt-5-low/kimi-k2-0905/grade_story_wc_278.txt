<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation rooted in guilt propels concrete choices (RESTORE, then RELEASE INSECT). Interiority is embodied through object interactions (amber, stylus, letters) rather than labels. A credible internal tension appears at the final menu (BECOME LULLABY vs RELEASE), with a felt renunciation. Cost is present but a shade soft because she avoids the starkest sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Patterned causal chain (tether → projection → menu → letters bind → second menu → release) reads coherent under a hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is strong from the first line and holds. Closure lands via a decisive choice (RELEASE) that reconfigures the premise with a legible emotional price. The cost could be sharpened, but the before/after is clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The laboratory, console, and antique-letter apparatus are vivid, specific, and integrated into action; tools and micro-setting elements constrain choices (menus, tethering, binding letters). Recurring objects (amber, stylus) charge the final image. Sensory detail tracks urgency without bloating. World rules are consistently learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quelling guilt) is signaled early and tightens with the lab’s predatory revelation and the binding letters. The second menu crystallizes a true trade-off; slicing the paper chain and releasing the insect is an active, earned resolution. The price is primarily internal—she foregoes “BECOME LULLABY”—which reads but could be made more viscerally unavoidable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motifs (amber insect, meteor hush, haunted firmware) evolve into a resonant answer about releasing rather than embodying guilt. The lab’s conceptual turn (it cultivates, not archives) reframes prior images without moralizing. The final emptiness of the amber reweights the whole in a concrete, emotionally credible way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric third-person close with controlled cadence; diction and imagery are purposeful and coherent. The voice modulates under pressure without losing clarity. No head-hopping or stance slips; patterned elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs; metaphoric texture is rich yet legible with minimal clutter. A few stacked images approach lushness but do not occlude causality or the closure image. Rhythm varies and supports momentum; proofreading is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis—constellation tattoos as firmware nodes, a lab of lost sounds, menus offering existential trades—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is coherent and not gimmicky. The conceptual turn integrates with character, not just premise.</comment>
