<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (to map his own interior), embodied through unique sensory habits and the ring’s burden. Contradictory impulses—fear of touching his own map vs compulsion to find the stillpoint—surface credibly. Micro-choices (following the spiral, kneeling, releasing the ring’s hoard, refusing to print) reveal values with felt cost. The only limit is the relative smoothness of his progress, with little active resistance beyond atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds as pressure tightens from hush-listening to spiral center. Closure lands on the page: the ring discharges language into soil; he becomes the map—an earned reconfiguration with cost. Anchors are clear early, and a single, coherent scene delivers the decisive cadence shift. The paused constellations returning provide a clean before/after marker.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vivid and functionally constraining (sound as terrain; hush as gateway). The ring, cane, and sonic ecology act as micro-setting tools shaping tactics and the final image. Sensory detail is fresh (tasting frequencies, Braille of sound) and POV-filtered. World rules stay consistent and charge the ending’s “inner weather.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but clear: confront and map his own unmapped feelings or remain blank. Escalation is a density increase (spiral tightening, ring’s growing weight) culminating in the costly release. Agency drives the turn (he kneels, touches ground, lets the ring exhale; later chooses not to print). Pressure is gentle rather than oppositional, slightly limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—the limits of cartography and the necessity of becoming one’s own map—emerges through concrete acts rather than statements. Recurring images (hush, spiral, ring, constellations, “quiet blaze”) shift meaning at closure. The insight avoids platitude by tying to a specific price (carrying the lines under skin, abandoning print). The final “private meridian zero” elegantly reweights the whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a singular perceptual signature (synesthetic, tactile hearing) persists without leakage. The diction remains plausibly tethered to the character’s sensoria and craft. Rhythmic modulations match pressure, culminating in a poised, resonant ending. No head-hopping; elision patterns are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: images do multiple jobs, and syntax varies with momentum. Figurative density is high but coherent, with recurring vehicles (sound-as-Braille, hush, blaze) rather than scattershot. Minimal redundancy; a few lush phrases flirt with purple without obscuring sense. The closure image is crisp and unsmudged by metaphor overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Conceptual synthesis feels singular: ultrasonic forest, frequency-tasting, a compass ring that drinks alphabets, and emotional cartography. The stillpoint’s mechanics and the ring’s purge are non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric mode pay off with clarity and consequence. Emotional truth grounds the novelty.</comment>
