<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marek’s motive—atonement for the duke’s daughter—drives every choice, from decoding the tapestry to righting the king. Interiority is precise and embodied (“knuckles blanched,” “predatory clarity”) and contradictions (prideful tutor vs. penitent exile) stay active in-scene. The change is earned and costs him a relinquishment of self-punishment without absolution. Relationship pressure is offstage, but its weight is credibly borne.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: observation of the frozen village → decoding → maze-walk → righting the king → time resumes. Closure lands on the page with cost and consequence (“Time snapped forward… thunder finally rolled”), a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear from the outset and the motif chain is kept. No teleports or unkept setups; causality is figuratively but consistently handled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and determinative: the time-frozen village constrains action, the fountain-maze focuses tactics, and the tapestry functions as a decipherable map. Weather and the “woven hush” texture pressure and then break at the turn. Recurring objects (labyrinth, king) charge the final image and constrain choice. World rules (pause/perturb/resume) remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens via a single deepening: the suicidal king line reframes his guilt, pushing him to walk and then complete the maze. The decisive act (righting the king) brings external consequence and forecloses the loop of self-castigation. The pressure is internal but escalates coherently; the price is ongoing ambiguity about the daughter plus the courage to re-enter life. Stakes remain intimate, not grandiose, but are felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Chess/labyrinth/weaving motifs accrue into a clear meditation on acceptance over erasure. Subtext is largely image-driven, with a strong reprise at the king’s righting; however, the closing aphorism (“The board is wider than the mistake”) edges toward didactic clarity. The insight is earned by lived particulars, so the moralizing is softened but present. Resonance lingers through reweighted images rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Marek’s mind—precise chess diction fused with sensuous observation. Psychic distance holds, with measured compression at peaks (“fierce repose,” “predatory clarity”). Rhythm modulates well, especially through the turn and release when time resumes. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffolding, and metaphors stay coherent within the chess/weave/labyrinth field. A few rich images sit close together, but they serve propulsion rather than blur it. Syntax varies effectively; closures land cleanly in image and action. No loops or clarity-muddling figurative tangles in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess pedagogy, a frozen village, and a tactile decoding of frayed threads feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The king-righting as a ritual that releases time is elegant and character-specific. Risk-taking in structure and diction heightens coherence without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template redemption arcs by grounding the turn in precise, idiosyncratic mechanics.</comment>
