<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority and embodied guilt drive concrete micro‑choices (decoding, walking the maze, righting the king). Contradictory impulses—predatory clarity vs. shame—coexist on the page. The change (from punitive self‑exile to reframed acceptance) is earned by prior beats. Slight neatness to the self‑forgiveness arc keeps it just shy of the absolute top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: fountain → tapestry → internal chess diagram → physical maze → righted king → resumed time. Closure lands on the page with cost through a decisive act that reconfigures meaning and consequence. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and setups pay off cleanly. The causal throughline is quiet but consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The time‑frozen village, fountain labyrinth, and weaver’s tapestry are vivid, specific, and POV‑filtered. Environment constrains and then charges the final image (paused world resumes only after the king is set upright). Details evolve with action rather than decorating it. Weather and objects meaningfully shape choice and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self‑forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens through decoding to embodied trial in the maze. Escalation is internal but legible, culminating in a decisive gesture with conceptual cost. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without relying on coincidence. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, trimming peak intensity slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motifs (labyrinth, king, thunder, tapestry) braid into a resonant argument about reframing loss. Subtext largely arises from image and action rather than explanation. The final aphorism (“The board is wider than the mistake”) edges toward stated moral, slightly thinning the earned resonance. Still, the reweighted images carry genuine aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with diction and rhythm calibrated to Marek’s mind: strategic, exact, tautly lyrical. Compressions and elisions are taught and legible; no head‑hopping. Voice sustains pressure without register drift. A hair of lushness under peak beats prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are musical, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences carry more than one job and propel momentum. Metaphor chains (weave/maze/chess) are coherent and controlled; no significant loops or scaffolding. Minor purple edging in a few phrases is contained and does not blur sense. The closing cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess pedagogy, frozen time, and textile code feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric accumulation, symbolic object economy) heighten stakes and cohere at closure. The maze‑as‑mirror turn and the king’s righting as temporal trigger are memorable and specific. Emotional truth undergirds the conceptual elegance.</comment>
