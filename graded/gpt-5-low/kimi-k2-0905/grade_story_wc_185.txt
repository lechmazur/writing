<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, urgent motivation (“find the quiet in the storm”) drives concrete choices at each beat. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft (ice augury, breath control) rather than abstract labels. The relationship with Jalen adds pressure and stakes without stealing focus, though her inner contradiction is muted—she reads as highly competent with little visible doubt. The cost at the end (cracking the stone, risking memory loss) feels earned by prior choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with crisp causal linkages: augury → timing the hush → Warden test → dome fracture completion. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: the circle closes, beings fold inward, and the stone releases silent meaning. Cost is legible in the cracked relic and the relinquishing of stored voices. Orientation is clean from the start; no teleports or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and their acoustical constraints shape every tactic (breath, gait, tools) and culminate in a setting-locked solution (sound-severing fissures). Recurring objects (stone, ice, bridge of petrified song) aren’t postcards; they pressure choice. Sensory detail is specific and purposeful across senses, not merely visual. World rules are learned through action, consistent, and charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive and carry the last map through a timed hush) is clear early and tightens at the Warden and the Great Resonance Dome. The final escalation is protagonist-driven: completing the circle and severing sound pathways with visible risk. Prices are present (time window, risk of attracting beings, cracking the stone), though a sharper on‑page internal trade‑off would have pushed tension even higher. No coincidences resolve the core problem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as agency, preservation, and resistance accrues through concrete acts rather than thesis. The last whisper—“We were here”—reprices the whole piece without moralizing, translating sound into meaning. Subtext in the Warden and refugee fish deepens the stakes of memory and erasure. Complexity lingers: victory is charged by loss (expended voices, a relic breaking).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature holds steady; diction and rhythm align with a practiced keeper of quiet. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and subtextual (words literally swallowed), fitting the world’s rules. Psychic distance is controlled; no head‑hopping or register drift. The voice compresses under pressure without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and clean propulsion; images often do double duty. The lyricism is lush yet generally coherent; metaphors track to the world’s sonic logic. Minor slips—one visible typo (“sprinkbling”) and occasional stacked modifiers—slightly nick the polish but do not blur causality or the closure image. Rhythm varies and supports momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Conceptual synthesis feels singular: silence as craft and weapon, sound-eaters thwarted by mute geometry. Recurring motifs (ice cracks, ripple maps, fossil chords) reconfigure at the end with inevitability. Risks in diction and worldbuilding pay off and shape tactics, not just atmosphere. The final reweighting (sound as meaning without sound) is fresh and memorable.</comment>
