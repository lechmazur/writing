<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (preserve maps/memory via silence) drives concrete choices under pressure. Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and ritual competence rather than labels. Relationship dynamics with Jalen are efficient and functional, adding stakes in the Warden pass and the circle completion. A deeper on-page contradiction within the keeper (fear vs. compulsion) is implied more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal throughline is tight: augury → timed transit → Warden → Dome ritual → hush bloom and exit. Closure lands on-page with cost (the stone cracks, beings fold, they depart under an earned hush). Orientation is immediate and stable; the pattern taught early (silence as survival) pays off at the climax. The live clock (third resonance) cleanly narrows options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated and constrains action at every turn (chiming stalactites, absorptive relic, Abyssal frequency, Mirror Pool augury). The environment supplies tools and limits (powdered silence, mineral lace, runes flicker) that shape tactics. The final image is directly charged by place-rules (Dome’s skin cracks to sever sound paths). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carry the last map out alive by creating a hush window) is signaled early and tightened by the march into the beings’ chord. The meaningful turn is the circle completion that severs sound pathways, forcing a trade-off measured in risk and the relic’s fracture. Agency is front-and-center; coincidence does not resolve anything. Prices and constraints (timing, sound sensitivity) are legible and shape tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silence as resistance/preservation accrues through recurring objects and acts, culminating in “We were here” as meaning without sound. Thematically, memory vs. consumption is dramatized rather than stated, with the cracked stone releasing stories as conceptual repricing. The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity remains productive (victory is temporary, cost permanent).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains pressure without losing clarity; diction coheres with the world’s logic. Sparse dialogue carries subtext and action (word-drinking stone; Warden’s nod). Psychic distance and tense remain stable. Modulation tightens at the Dome without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density lines largely pull double duty (world-rule + action), with varied syntax and strong verb choices. Metaphor net is cohesive (sound/silence/stone) and rarely overreaches. Minor copy slip (“sprinkbling”) and a few lush clusters slightly thicken the flow at peak, but do not obscure causality. Final cadence is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: silence as engineered topology, energy beings who eat sound, augury via ice fractures, and “powdered silence” are memorable and organic. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight and grow from established rules. Bold, specific risks heighten stakes without gimmickry. The piece reads as a singular vision rather than a template.</comment>
