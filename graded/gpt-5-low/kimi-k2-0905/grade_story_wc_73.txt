<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and consistent—an ex‑mathematician trying to model and then feel the “texture” of regret. Contradictory impulses (panic when motion falters vs. the lure of a possible exit) collide in scene at the ripple. Micro‑choices reveal values: bleeding a sigma to restart motion, refusing to step through, sacrificing the perfect die. The cost is legible and earned by prior traits and tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of climb → dice → mathematical interventions → ripple → renunciation → forgetting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she chooses not to step through; the world begins to forget her). Orientation is clear from the outset and the rules evolve consistently (perpetual motion, then its falter on recognition). The set‑ups (dice, proof, sigma) all pay off causally within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is both stage and constraint, directly impacting options (no end, motion’s hum, the stakes when it slows). Environmental shifts (slowing, convulsing, folding) charge the final image and force choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (stone coolness, echoing clatter, velvet‑heavy air). The recurring objects (dice, blood on steps) function as micro‑setting that constrains and marks space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—continuity of self via motion vs. confronting the missed door—is signaled early and tightened when the stairs slow at her realization. She actively raises costs (blood, sigma) and finally chooses to refuse the door and feed the dice into the ripple, foreclosing a path. The chipped die as “key” creates a decisive narrowing of options. The price (self’s erasure into forgetting) is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Regret as recursion and “texture” coheres with the math/dice/stair motifs, culminating in a non‑literal answer: she reweights opportunity by marking and renouncing. Subtext operates through objects and pattern breaks rather than thesis statements, with only minor moments of explicitness (“probability was a liar”). The door‑never‑seen reframes the quest without moralizing. The final forgetting image lingers as a complex, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third‑person closely held to Elara’s mathematical sensibility yields a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and metaphor stay consistent with her background (primes, sigma, recursive regret) without register drift. Psychic distance tightens at peaks (“heart ticking like a gear with a missing tooth”). No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid, rhythmic, and mostly free of loops; images do double duty (dice as sound, chance, and agency). Occasional heightened phrasing skirts density but remains coherent and purposeful. Key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. Final lines are clean and concentrated without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—math as ritual in a surreal, perpetual staircase; a chipped die becoming a key; blood‑sigma to restart entropy—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric abstraction, conceptual closure) heighten stakes and cohere. The “door never seen” reframes missed opportunity memorably. The ending’s forgetting move resists template comforts.</comment>
