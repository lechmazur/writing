<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locksmith’s motive—freeing a fragile idea from fear—is clear and consistent, and his tactic shifts (silence-song, tracing stitches, backward stepping) reveal a calm, unshowy boldness under pressure. Interiority is conveyed through image rather than thought, which suits the mode but limits contradiction on the page. The micro‑turn when the mouth won’t open tests resolve credibly. Cost is largely conceptual (carrying secrets as music), not sharply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure is coherent under an accumulative/causal hybrid: star’s hint → bruise/lock → song → unraveling → disorientation → release. Closure lands with a decisive change (the idea freed) and a resonant coda (his own silver curl), though the cost remains soft. Pattern is taught early (star/nexus rules) and held through the end. The final fragment (“And though the”) slightly mars cadence but not the closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nexus under starlight is vividly particular and functional: it exists only under “silver,” the star provides a locating and tactical hint, and the alleys/doorways/river transform in the idea’s wake. Setting details are integrated with action (moths, breathing doorways, negative‑space map). World rules feel consistent and purposeful. The final images are charged by place without feeling postcard‑ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure tightens when stitches turn to moths yet the mouth won’t open—necessitating the disorientation tactic. Stakes remain singular and legible: liberate the first thought of peace, with dread as mechanism. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (star’s hint) complicates but does not resolve. The price is more symbolic than visceral, tempering intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of fear’s self‑sealing vault, earned courage, and the transmissibility of hope accrue through motifs (ribbon/hair, first star, negative‑space map) and reweight at the end. The deer of light and glowing hoofprints avoid didacticism while offering a non‑literal answer to “What if?”. Occasional explicit phrasing (“mind’s first thought of peace”) edges toward abstraction but is offset by concrete images. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; cadence modulates to support turns (silence as song; backward stepping). Diction is consistent and voice‑true to the mythic register. Minimal dialogue is purposeful; the single spoken line lands as action. No head‑hopping or distance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but coherent and image‑driven; most lines do multiple jobs without padding. Occasional purple lean is restrained by clarity of action. Mechanics are clean overall; the dangling final fragment is a copy error that nicks the closing cadence. Rhythm and sentence variety sustain momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—an idea‑locksmith working with starlight, ribbons of hair, and negative‑space maps—feels singular and fully committed. The disorientation tactic is a fresh turn that grows from established logic. Recurrences (first star, ribbon) reappear with transformed charge. Risks in mythic diction pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
