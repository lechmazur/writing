<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (find the “frequency of belonging” tied to her missing parents) is clear and her choices—approaching, engaging, pulling the lever—align. Interiority is particular (recognizing her grandmother’s charts; bodily response to the frequencies). However, internal contradiction is mild; she meets little resistance and the pilgrim applies minimal pressure. The final renunciation (leaving old uncertainty) lands but at a relatively low cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single‑scene causal spine is clean: arrival → invitation → lever pull → printed star‑map → reconfiguration. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the stars “sing her name,” narrowing options toward the choice to follow. Cost is implied (foreclosing the searcher identity for the path found), but it’s gentle. Lens holds as accumulative with a causal apex at the press.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ancient observatory at dusk, the hand press, and the chip are vivid and usefully integrated: dying light makes the etched constellations flare, the press is tactile constraint, the broken dome frames the final star image. Details are selective and filtered through a pilot’s eye (drone, columns, astrolabe), anchoring tone. The environment charges the ending image even if it doesn’t hard‑block alternatives.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and coherent: belonging via the chip/pilgrim. Pressure tightens at the lever pull, transforming abstract hope into an on‑page test. External opposition is near‑absent and the price is mostly conceptual, which lowers felt jeopardy despite a strong central turn. Still, the deepening from object to lived frequency is effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motifs (frequencies, stars, printing) braid into a theme of calling and homecoming, with the final image reweighting prior mentions of the grandmother and parents. The line “It prints belonging” leans overt, but the lever action and sonic revelation earn the realization. The piece invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third‑person limited on Mara is steady; diction and rhythm suit the lyric‑speculative mode. Dialogue is minimal but targeted, with the pilgrim’s invitation functioning as action. No head‑hopping; focal distance modulates gently at the climax. A few recurring tags (“perpetually surprised eyes”) verge on echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs and propel momentum into the lever beat. Minor repetition (“perpetually surprised”) and occasional lushness flirt with purple but don’t blur sense. The final cadence is clean and charged. No notable scaffold or template rhythms.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—type‑foundry chip, a hand press that “prints belonging,” a drone pilot, and a pilgrim—feels fresh and internally coherent. The key turn (printing as a frequency map) is non‑obvious yet earned. The risk is stylistic rather than structural, but it pays off. Slightly safer conflict design keeps it below the highest band.</comment>
