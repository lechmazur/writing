<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and particular—she answers a spectral summons to “retrace” communal sorrow—and her choices (mapping with ribbon, refusing to carve a name, tying the dyed ribbon for the monarchs) align with a coherent value system. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft instincts rather than abstract labels. Internal contradiction is modest (competence outweighs struggle), but the late image of her own name in forget‑me‑nots adds a quiet, personal cost. The character reads distinct and consistent across the accumulative turns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers ritual acts toward a reweighted spiral/mentorship premise culminating in the gravestone and seedlings. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—collective grief gains an embodied pattern given away to the living. However, the final sentence truncates mid‑cadence (“into”), slightly blurring the landing even though an earlier closure beat (families weeping at the spiral) already works. Causality within the lyric frame remains coherent with clean because/therefore linkages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and functional: glass condensation takes dye, the avocado tree yields sap, and roots crack a burial cist, letting the environment materially shape tactics and images. Sensory detail is integrated and purposeful across smell, touch, and sound (“glass panes rattling like loosened teeth”). The setting’s rules stay consistent and charge the final images (seedlings through tile seams, the ribbon-flag). Scale and specificity feel proportionate to the scene’s stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (“before the last butterflies leave”) and intensify as Elara reverses paths and externalizes grief’s shape. Escalation is a density/deepening rather than reversal, consistent with the chosen lens, and the cost is conceptual (abandoning a name for a communal spiral, accepting her own mortality). The avocado‑sap choice and timed tying of the ribbon are credible tightening moments. Pressure is steady rather than acute, but it coheres to the ending image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—collective grief acquiring a transmissible shape—emerges organically from craft actions, mentorship terms, and the spiral’s social afterlife. Recurring motifs (poems, butterflies, spiral) reweight meaning without sermonizing; “What flies away returns as sky” resonates as earned wisdom. The piece avoids platitudes by binding insight to specific acts and costs. Minor risk of over-explicit aphorism is mitigated by strong image‑driven closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s perceptual bias as a carver; diction and rhythm remain controlled under pressure. The ghost’s “thundering calm” contrasts effectively with her fierce meditativeness, and the narrative stance doesn’t overreach knowledge. Purposeful compression reads taught; dialogue is minimal yet charged. The mid‑sentence final cutoff dents cadence but not overall control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is largely strong—images carry weight and sentences do multiple jobs—but the density of figurative language occasionally crowds the breath. Crucially, the final sentence truncates mid-phrase, an artifact in the closing third that dulls the landing. Otherwise, momentum and clarity hold with minimal scaffolding or loops. Syntax varies and avoids mechanical cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost mentorship fused with funerary craft and migration ecology feels freshly synthesized; the spiral-as-collective-grief is a non‑obvious, persuasive turn. The avocado‑sap dye and condensation transfer are inventive tactical beats rather than mere ornament. Risk-taking is high but legible under the accumulative lens. The truncated ending prevents a higher score despite the originality’s coherence.</comment>
