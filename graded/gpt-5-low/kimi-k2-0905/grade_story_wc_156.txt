<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Liora’s need for control versus the nickel’s lure of curiosity is dramatized through tactile choices (spoon, coin, inverted note). Her “methodically playful” trait is enacted, not labeled, and the moment she declares “I will never be certain…” is earned by prior beats. Cost registers as a foregone finished restoration and identity shift. Minor note: interior contradiction could show one more stumble before the final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: failed method → coin bargain → nested awakenings → final charged poise/CR. Closure lands with a conceptual price: she renounces completion as the definition of restoration. The garden/echo mechanics stay consistent and culminate in the last image. Orientation is clear from the opening and supports the ending without explanatory backfill.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sound wave garden constrains action (tuned basalt, B-flat ribbon) and charges the final image (fresh grass recording her question). Details are selective, sensory, and tool-driven (silver spoon, tesserae, obsidian gong), all filtered through Liora’s craft. World rules are learned by action, not dump. The setting’s logic nests with the theme to shape choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens when her method fails and the coin demands a trade; the nested city revelations deepen stakes. The decisive turn is Liora’s acceptance of uncertainty, foreclosing the comfort of completion. The cost is conceptual but legible on the page. A small additional external consequence could have further sharpened the knife.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of curiosity over certainty emerges through actions and objects (coin as “city’s coinage of attention,” inverted waves draining into possibility). The ending reweights prior images without heavy explanation. Slight ding for the overt thesis line in dialogue, though it’s contextually earned. Subtext in the guide’s reply and lullaby of “verbs without endings” lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close tracks Liora’s perceptions with consistent diction and rhythm. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off (echo ribbons, folding garden). Dialogue is minimal yet charged and subtextual. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates cleanly at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied syntax and concrete imagery; metaphors cohere to sound/coin/city logics. No scaffolding or synonym loops, and momentum never stalls. Lushness stays purposeful in peak beats. A few lines flirt with aphorism, but they are anchored by scene action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: restoration via acoustics, a hobo nickel as minted attention, and nested awakenings that refold city and restorer. Risks (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heighten meaning without obfuscation. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established tools and rules. The vision reads singular and fully committed.</comment>
