<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (reestablish the archive, decipher “physics of transition”) are clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices—mapping the arbor’s clicks, planting the seed, humming the lullaby. Her kindly, methodical temperament constrains tactics rather than serving as a label. The grief thread (mother’s disappearance) complicates her task and culminates in accepting a pattern over a body. The cost is largely emotional, not decisional, but it reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative design tightens cleanly: arbor signals → seed activation → mirrored sky symmetry → mother’s waveform → archive restored → new plank. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing (“haunted ambitions” reframed as love learning new shape) and a concrete world change (bridge extends). Orientation is crisp from the first sentences; no causality breaks. Cost is legible as relinquishment of a literal return in favor of a pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is vivid, rule‑consistent, and instrumental: iron leaves “speak,” iron filings enable planting, the arbor resonates, and the new plank appears. Details are POV‑filtered through a translator’s mind (cuneiform, signs, equations) and the hourglass sky reframes the physics of the scene. Environment constrains and enables action, then charges the final image. Sensory specificity avoids generic spectacle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (restore meaning/archive; reconcile absence) are signaled early and deepen through the arbor’s sentence, the seed’s responses, and the symmetry reveal. The protagonist’s agency drives each intensification (translation choices, lullaby, etching the equation). The price is mostly internal; no hard trade‑off narrows options beyond acceptance. Still, pressure coheres and grows under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of translation, grief’s grammar, and transition accrue through images rather than lecture; the cuneiform sentence and “equation equal love divided by time” reweight meaning. “The departed become the grammar of the living” risks statement, but it’s diegetic and earned by prior action. The final line elegantly reinterprets “haunted ambitions” without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a translator’s perceptual signature sustains throughout; diction and imagery are consistent with Mira’s mind. Psychic distance modulates well under pressure, and moments of spoken text feel organic. Compression and patterned imagery are taught early and pay off at closure. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is tight and propulsive despite density; images do double duty (world rule + emotion). Figurative language is frequent but coherent; no mixed metaphors muddy key beats. Minimal scaffolding or loops; rhythm varies with scene needs. Slight risk of purple edging is managed by consistent logic and payoff.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—cuneiform semiotics, magnetic arbor ecology, knowledge seed, hourglass sky symmetry—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric‑conceptual integration heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Turns emerge from character‑specific tactics rather than late rule dumps. The vision reads authentically its own.</comment>
