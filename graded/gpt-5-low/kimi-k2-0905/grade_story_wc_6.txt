<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—transforming inherited harm—drives every micro-choice, with embodied contradictions (anger vs. compassion) showing in tactile acts (grafting sand, tying the coin, logging coordinates). The firefighter/arsonist-daughter tension is specific and coherent. The earned stasis at the end forecloses vengeance in favor of watchful care with felt cost. Minor explicit statements (“trying to prove that scars can sing…”) slightly reduce subtlety.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: each ritual step deepens pressure toward a charged poise ending. Closure lands on-page in her promise/salute and the coin-glint image, with emotional cost carried forward. Orientation is clean from the first sentence. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, dunes, salt-tolerant pines, and volcanic sand are vividly filtered through a firefighter’s eye and used functionally (water poured, pines as recipients). Environment and objects charge the final image and shape tactics. Sensory choices stay purposeful and tonally unified. Strong specificity without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciliation with the father’s fire—tightens via the grafting ritual, the drachma tying, and the vow to bring saplings. Pressure coheres as internal endurance with a clear price (carrying shame, refusing retaliation). Escalation is quiet but decisive under the accumulative lens. Slightly soft mid-scene turn keeps it shy of peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motifs (black sand, coin/red thread, lagoon’s peace) evolve into a resonant answer: harm can be re-tuned rather than erased. Subtext lives in image (the coin as listening heart; red thread as reconciliation flare). A couple of on-the-nose lines brush close to stating thesis, but overall the piece earns its insight through particulars. The final promise reweights the premise without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, steady lyric voice with a firefighter’s perceptual bias; rhythms modulate gracefully across pressure points. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled. Diction is precise and consistent with the character’s sensibility. Minimal explicit dialogue is purposeful and charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with rich but coherent figurative texture (“clouds that drifted like kelp,” “guilty fingerprints”). Information density is high with little scaffold. A mild tendency toward thematic restatement and lushness keeps it just short of the very top. Syntax and cadence vary to support momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—firefighter/arsonist’s daughter performing a ritual graft with volcanic sand and a coin on red thread beside an obsidian lagoon—is striking and memorable. Risks in lyric compression and symbolic apparatus pay off in coherent closure. Emotional truth feels specific rather than templated. The reconfiguration at the end reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
