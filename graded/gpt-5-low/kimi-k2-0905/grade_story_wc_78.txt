<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prophet’s motive and modus operandi are clear and consistent, and his choices drive every turn. Interiority is mostly inferred through sensory focus and craft rather than explicit conflicting impulses, so cost reads conceptual more than emotional. His competence under pressure is compelling but nearly frictionless. The strongest beat for character revelation is when he strikes absence and recruits the crew—leadership over comfort.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sound-making escalates from solitary study to communal dubbing to engineered spiral, culminating in movement across the Doldrum Wall. Orientation is clean from the outset, and each tactic logically arises from prior signals (cloud lyre → nautilus spiral → rotating crown). Closure lands on the page with a felt before/after: stillness to motion, silence to groove. The persistent constraint (dead calm) shapes all tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The raft-orchard and sea-atmosphere are tactile, sonically biased, and constantly shape options (no wind forces acoustic propulsion; trees and bamboo provide instruments). Details are purposeful and filtered through the prophet’s ear—glass buoys, drumfish skin, cambium-conducted F sharp. The environment constrains choice and charges the last image as the orchard becomes an orchestra that literally moves the world. No static postcard description; world rules stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—crossing the Doldrum Wall—tightens credibly: forecasted calm, arrival of stillness, then engineered sonic oar-strokes. Escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent under the accumulative lens, with the key turn being the shift from striking objects to striking absence and enlisting communal pulse. Cost is mostly exertional and conceptual rather than sacrificial, but the narrowing of options reads. The final spiral rig is an earned deepening, not a deus ex device.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece articulates a rich theme—art as instrument, community rhythm transforming obstacle—through concrete acts rather than thesis. Recurring images (lyre → nautilus; petals as notation) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer: silence can be converted into motion when reframed as groove. Ambiguity remains purposeful, with no tidy platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyrical voice with a sonic lexicon stays stable and apt to the focalizer’s perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates with pressure—from luxuriant description to kinetic, sentence-level propulsion at the climax—without losing clarity. No head-hopping or register drift; metaphors remain in a coherent sound/marine field. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; nearly every line advances image, world, or pressure. Figurative language is lush but controlled, avoiding muddle and mixed vehicles. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; punctuation and syntax vary to match scene needs. The final sentence crystallizes prior motifs with clean, vivid force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Conceptual synthesis—sound engineering, tidal prophecy, and an orchard-raft—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric accumulation, musical physics) pay off through tight integration with tactic and closure. Turns grow from established patterns rather than late rule changes. The piece avoids safe median choices and commits to an unusual, coherent vision.</comment>
