<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prophet’s motive—“turn obstacles into instruments”—is clear and consistently enacted, with concrete micro-choices (listening, scoring, striking absence, rigging tubes). Interiority is mostly externalized through craft rather than thought, but it still reads particular and embodied. Contradictory impulses are minimal; stoic focus limits emotional complexity. Nonetheless, action aligns with motive and produces an earned endurance-style change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clean: layered sounds → Doldrum Wall pressure → tactic shift (striking absence, communal dub) → spiral imitation → crown that moves the raft. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (the raft edges forward, a breeze enters), and the lens holds. Cost is more conceptual/communal than visceral, but the constraint and solution are present and paid off. Orientation is crisp from the opening and supports the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral—the drifting orchard, Doldrum Wall, blue hour, tools—each constrains or enables choice. Environmental pressure (still air) forces the sonic tactic; objects (mallet, tubes, copper cone) are used functionally. Sensory texture across sound, sight, and touch is selective and purposeful. The final image is charged by place: mirror-still sea becoming a speaker/orchestra.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crossing dead calm) is signaled early and tightened by the Doldrum Wall, pushing the prophet to renounce conventional action in favor of sound. Escalation is agency-driven (striking absence, mobilizing heartbeats, engineering the crown), with one strong turn (imitate the nautilus spiral). The cost reads as disciplined labor and risk under constraint, though it isn’t deeply punitive. The resolution stems from his choices rather than luck, even as the breeze arrives as consequence of the established pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme—obstacle-as-instrument, silence-as-groove—emerges organically from concrete acts and images rather than moralizing. The petals/notation and cloud-lyre-to-nautilus reprise reweight the premise at the end. Communal rhythm reframes agency without sentimentality. The final listening stance functions as a resonant answer to the story’s question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (music/meteorology fused) remains stable and apt. Diction is controlled and image-forward without straying into authorial gloss or head-hopping. Psychic distance holds under pressure, modulating rhythm at turns. Minor flourish density does not impede clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, musical phrasing; repetition (“fractal generating”) reads pattern-taught rather than looped. Metaphor chains stay coherent to the sonic/maritime lexicon and propel momentum. A touch lush, but sentence variety and clarity keep the line clean through the climax. No scaffold or synonym churn materially dulls the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating orchard, sonic meteorology, dub-as-propulsion, fractal mechanics—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring legibility. Turns grow from established logic (cloud-reading → spiral engineering). The final reconfiguration has authentic ingenuity.</comment>
