<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Luma’s desire to “find a color misplaced between childhood and the first funeral” is specific and drives coherent choices: pocketing the fragment, invoking the Lattice, and paying sorrow to project the film. Embodied emotion (the fragment warming her ribs; “each brushstroke cost her a sigh”) keeps her interior lived. The renunciation—letting the fragment dissolve—lands as a felt price. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized in a head-to-head impulse clash.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: fragment discovery → Lattice consultation → living wall requirement → costly display → integration/dawn. Closure is on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: joy isn’t recovered but developed through risk; the fragment’s dissolution marks cost. Orientation is crisp from line one (who/where/when) and the lens holds to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard fog, cider house, and “living wall” are sensorially vivid and functionally constraining: only that wall can develop the film, and the fog shapes the Lantern Lattice’s mechanics. Environmental specificity (“plaster still smelled of fermented stars”) charges the ending with the vermilion cheek lingering in mist. The setting is inseparable from both tactic and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming joy—tightens when the Lattice requires a living wall and each brushstroke extracts present sorrow, narrowing options. The decisive act (displaying/painting with light) exacts a visible price and forces the surrender of the fragment. Pressure escalates cleanly without needing external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through material particulars: film, fresco, and living memory reframe joy as something developed rather than found. The closing moral line (“joy had never been lost…”) veers toward overt statement, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the final image of the laughing child in perpetual projection carries earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is singular, confident, and textured, with consistent diction and image logic around fog/light/film. Psychic distance remains stable; lyric elision is taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register slips; rhythmic control supports the unfolding pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and purposeful metaphor; images often do double-duty (craft and world). Occasional lushness brushes purple but remains coherent within the motif set; no paraphrase loops or muddle at the peak. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the climactic painting sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Painting with light, a ghostly pigment network, and a living wall that develops a memory-film cohere into a fresh, memorable synthesis. The fragment-as-film-stock turn feels inevitable in hindsight and not gimmicky. The risks heighten resonance without harming clarity.</comment>
