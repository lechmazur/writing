<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Luma’s motive—recovering a lost joy/color—drives concrete micro‑choices: pocketing the shard, invoking the Lattice, accepting the “living wall” constraint, and spending sorrow to paint. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“palette in hand,” “colors arrived first, then motion”). The cost is visible (her sighs, the fragment dissolving, “heart over‑exposed”). No relationship crucible, but the internal contradiction (yearning vs. pain of exposure) stays live and earns the final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each move densifies pressure (failed sunbeams → fragment → Lattice → living wall → costly painting). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the mural’s private dawn reframes “lost” into “developed,” with on‑page price. Orientation is clean from the first line; set‑ups (fog, fresco, Lattice, living wall) all pay off. The shard’s dissolution provides a clear before/after hinge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fogged orchard, cider house, and “living wall” are not ornament; they constrain tactics (she must find a wall that “remembers” and work within fog’s light scarcity). Specifics like “apple press,” “fermented stars,” and the dome of faces from fog are POV‑filtered and purposeful. Environment charges the final image (a private dawn within ruin). World rules (Lantern Lattice in fog, pigment ghosts) remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover/“develop” joy) is signaled early and tightened when the Lattice demands a living wall, forcing a concrete, risky action. The painting sequence exacts a cost (“each brushstroke cost her a sigh”) and forecloses retreat by binding the fragment permanently to the wall. Escalation is protagonist‑driven throughout; no coincidences resolve the core problem. Quiet but unmistakable deepening culminates in the shard’s sacrifice and her over‑exposure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motifs (film/exposure/light vs. shadow) evolve into earned insight, and the final image reweights prior material without needing explication. However, the line “She realized joy had never been lost; it had merely waited to be developed” states the thesis a touch directly, softening subtext’s charge. Still, the mural’s ongoing projection and travelers’ rumor create lingering, multi‑valent resonance. Emotional honesty avoids false neatness; the cost of carrying light remains.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (“paints with light,” “fermented stars”) sustains through pressure. Psychic distance stays stable; elisions are taught and paid off (the Lattice, the film strip logic). Diction is cohesive and character‑bound; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates effectively from searching to charged poise at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; most lines do multiple jobs (world‑building, action, theme). A few lush metaphors verge on purple (“fermented stars,” “pensive mirth”) but the pattern is taught and stays legible. No loops or scaffold; sequencing and syntax remain clear. Final third maintains clarity while sustaining lyric intensity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis—light as paint, fog as knowledge lattice, fresco as film—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual magic system) heighten stakes and cohere at the ending. Turns grow from established rules rather than late conveniences. The closing traveler rumor extends the premise with fresh texture rather than cliché.</comment>
