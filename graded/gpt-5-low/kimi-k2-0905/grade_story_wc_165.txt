<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cass’s motive and method are crisp and embodied; her analytical bent guides concrete micro-choices (tide charts, prime-number strobes) and a principled refusal of credit. The inner contradiction—control versus surrender—is dramatized by the public orchestration and the private donation of the second bishop. Emotional textures are conveyed through attention and tactic rather than label-speak. The cost is quiet but legible: she relinquishes authorship to preserve wonder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: meticulously seeded cues converge on the boy’s “lucky” win, then reprice meaning with the second bishop. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR—design and chance are reweighted, with Cass choosing anonymity and relinquishment. The because/therefore chain is intact even while lyrical. The truncated final line slightly blurs cadence at the end, nicking the otherwise clean landing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tidal arcade is vivid and functional: salt film “adhesive,” tide timing, bulb half-lives, and crowd vectors all shape choices. Sensory specificity is rich across modalities (sound as 5/4 waves, sparks as constellation). Recurring objects (bishop, raven) are inseparable from place logic. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image of the bishop and the tide.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are modest but coherent: can Cass fracture monotony through engineered chance without being seen. Pressure deepens via synchronized performers and the live clock of tide and “between acts.” The boy’s win provides the turn; Cass’s renunciation is the price that tightens the thematic stake. Low overt opposition keeps the ceiling below the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—control versus wildness, authorship versus wonder—emerges through particulars, not pronouncements. “Orchestrated serendipity” is tested and then revalued by the final surrender to the tide. The quiet aftereffect (private encore) resists tidy moralizing. A hair more friction or consequence would deepen the resonance further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third-person close carries a distinct, precise perceptual signature—mathematical lexicon meets seaside grit—without slipping distance. Rhythm modulates well between plan and event; no head-hopping. Diction is character-true and confident. Minor end truncation interrupts the final cadence but not overall control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are largely taut, multi-function, and musical; images like “prime-number intervals” and “5/4 time” feel earned and clarifying. Overwrought patches are rare and mostly support tone. The cut-off final sentence is a notable craft blemish at the end. Otherwise, syntax variety and propulsion are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a magician of attention engineering “luck” with tide charts and primes, turning a midway into a covert instrument. The raven, bishop, and timed performers cohere without gimmickry. The final donation of a duplicate bishop is an elegant, non-obvious reweighting. High originality tempered only by the small execution slip at the end.</comment>
