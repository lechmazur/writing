<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (to hush the prophecy), and his micro‑choices under pressure—unfolding the wing, mapping silence, speaking the “period,” and swallowing the sphere—align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and embodied (“cold gripping his ankles like forgotten manacles”). Internal contradiction is present but subtle: he’s repelled by the code yet accepts hosting its counterweight at personal cost. A slightly greater torque between fear and duty in the climax could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens logically: offering the wing → murmuration → anti‑sound → counter‑word → ingestion with cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) and the lens holds. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he internalizes a burden that continues to “murmur against the bone,” reconfiguring options with felt cost. No unkept setups; the river and origami logic pay off causally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The brook isn’t postcard décor; it accepts the offering, generates reflective replicas, carries unpronounced syllables, and frames the dawn chorus—directly shaping tactics and the ending image. Sensory specificity (moonlight glazing ripples, cricket‑code) is POV‑filtered and purposeful. The environment’s rules stay consistent and charge the final stance. Strong micro‑setting integration elevates atmosphere to function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through a clean cadence: gathering hush → prophecy’s counterbeat → the inverse word → ingestion. The pressure point (prophecy fighting back) forces a narrowing to a risky tactic with a visible, lasting price. Stakes are both intimate and communal (his body vs. the village’s dreams) and the resolution is earned. A hair more friction prior to the “period” utterance could heighten the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silence as mastery (not absence) is enacted through concrete acts and the closing cost image lingers. Recurring motifs (crane, brook, code vs. hush) accrue subtext without over‑explanation. One explicit thematic sentence (“tranquility is not the absence of fire but the mastery of its blaze”) risks mild moralizing in the final third, slightly flattening the resonance. Even so, the piece invites reflection and resists tidy binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains throughout; diction and imagery are consistent with the POV’s mythic register. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from lush observation to clipped decisive utterance). No head‑hopping or stance slips, and purposeful elision is taught and paid off. The “period” uttered as word is a voice‑level risk that lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images often do double duty. Lush metaphoric fabric occasionally skirts saturation but maintains coherence and momentum. Syntax varies and the closure image is sharp and un-muddled. Trimming a handful of stacked metaphors could further sharpen peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mapping silence, an uttered “period” as counter‑spell, origami cranes replicating from reflections, babies crying in binary. The premise fully commits and follows implications into a costed ending. Risks (conceptual magic system via negative sound) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The result feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
