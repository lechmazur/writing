<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lark’s contradictory impulses (shedding the “cynical, drunken” skin yet fearing thinness of the new one) drive credible choices, culminating in a steadier, risk‑taking bluff before Rourke. Marin is distinctly sketched—competent authority tempered by quiet rebellion—and her choices pressure and redirect Lark. Embodied emotion (heat, ash, trembling skin) keeps motivations concrete. The only softness: Rourke’s quick capitulation trims the felt cost on their character changes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal with textural accrual): the patrol’s approach → Rourke’s entry → their bluff forms a clean tightening, while motifs (tin, skins, spiral) accumulate toward a reconfigured end. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lark names a new identity and they secure a plausible institutional shield for the library. The brief foretold future (“No bulldozer will arrive…”) slightly reduces on‑page price, but does not break closure. Orientation is clear from the first lines and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted, star‑rinsed library is tactile and instrumental: roof holes admit moonlight and flashlights, the potbellied stove enables the ritual burn, warped shelves become a defensive spiral. Objects act as setting (coffee tin, stove, cranes) and charge the final image. Environmental detail remains POV‑filtered and evolves with action. The place constrains tactics and reweights meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the library/avoid punishment while forging beauty—tightens when footsteps and flashlights force a public stance. Their decision to present “order” as cover is a credible reversal that narrows options and risks personal cost. Internal stakes (identity molt) interlock with external pressure. The ease of Rourke’s withdrawal trims the afterburn of consequence, keeping this short of top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through deed: composting old selves, rebuilding shelves into a spiral, seeding dictionaries with cranes—beauty from anarchy enacted, not preached. Subtext in status inversions (CO aiding an inmate; order used to shelter rebellion) complicates the moral calculus. A few explicit lines (“Beauty from anarchy”) flirt with on‑the‑nose but are earned by the concrete ritual. The final identity inscription reframes earlier images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (iron dust, green flames, “luminous fracture”) and clean focalization through Lark with brief, motivated omniscient glide. Dialogue is purposeful and differentiated—Marin’s pragmatic subversion contrasts with Lark’s metaphor‑leaning improvisation. Rhythm modulates under pressure without losing clarity. Minor predictive statements don’t disrupt the stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with vivid yet disciplined imagery; most sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purposeful, rarely slipping into purple. Momentum holds through the patrol beat to the bluff and settles into a charged poise. Slight exposition of future outcomes softens the line‑level sting at the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The persona‑molt ritual inside a prison library, the coffee‑tin reliquary, and paper‑wing insurgency synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame. The rebuild-as-cover twist is elegant and character‑driven. Risks (lyric density; institutional bluff) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels both inevitable and surprising in hindsight.</comment>
