<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (protecting vulnerable voices) is vivid and consistent, and her micro-choices under pressure (dialing in, breaking in, photographing, lying to Hask, triggering the alarm) reveal character. Status dynamics with Hask are clear and shift in the confrontation. The internal tug between risk and duty reads, though her victory comes a shade smoothly. Still, the final renunciation (letting the hearing aid die) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain from pulse-detection to archive breach to confrontation to public exposure; the lens holds. Closure lands on-page with cost: Hask collapses under the weight of truth, the alarm brings consequences, and the uploaded proof forecloses denial. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. Minor convenience in the ease of the upload doesn’t undercut the decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The atrium’s mist, rust, lamp, koi pond, and deactivated scanner all shape tactics and pressure. The hearing aid functions as a charged micro-setting and anchors the final image when its battery dies. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. The environment evolves with events (mist ribbons, muffled sirens) and constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through a meaningful tightening: break-in risk → confrontation at the pond’s edge → alarm and public consequence. Agency drives each turn; the koi pond beat presents a tangible brink. The cost is real though the antagonist yields quickly. The final renunciation consolidates the price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of institutional erasure vs. listening as heroism emerges organically from concrete acts. Recurring images (pulses, ledgers, photographs, mist) reweight meaning at the end. The line “heroism is rarely chosen; it is overheard…” edges into overt thesis in the final paragraph, softening subtext. Nonetheless, the closing images carry resonance without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and precise diction; POV remains stable and confident. Dialogue is minimal but effective and subtextual (“That photograph belongs to the Ministry”; “I found nothing but fungus.”). Psychic distance tightens under pressure without head-hopping. Elevated language matches the piece’s texture and stays character-coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; syntactic variety supports momentum. Figurative language is lush but coherent and purposeful; no mixed-metaphor confusions at peak beats. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops. A few ornate lines flirt with purple but don’t impede clarity or propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “heart-trace” hearing aid as a medium for the dead in a decaying conservatory is fresh and integrated. The ledger/erasure angle and the moral calculus (risking job and safety to restore credit) feel specific and non-obvious. Turns arise from established tools and motives, not late rule changes. The final reconfiguration (retiring the aid) is both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
