<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motives and methods are clear and particular, with embodied perception (“air tasted of iron and lilies”) anchoring her interiority. Her micro‑choices—following the pulse, aligning the photo, handing it over—track with her calling. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a visible interpersonal price. Still, the vocation’s cost surfaces at the end (the aid falls silent), earning a modest but real change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative drive is clean: photo → atrium → pulse → name → encounter → synchronized release. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration (Eleanor’s heart at rest; Mira’s aid silent) with a felt cost. The coincidence of the niece arriving at the same time is acceptable under the chosen lens given the taught “call” logic. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and objects are vivid and purposeful: mist, condensation, memorial wall, and the carousel architecture all thread action and final image. The hearing aid as tool/micro‑setting constrains tactics and charges closure. Sensory selection is precise and POV‑filtered; no tourist cataloging. The carousel reveal reweights earlier images without heavy‑handed symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the duty to deliver assurance, tightening when the pulse grows urgent and the woman appears. The key turn is Mira choosing to bridge the living with the dead by surrendering the photograph. The price is quiet but legible—relinquishing her ongoing “call” (aid goes silent). There’s little resistance or reversal beyond urgency; the piece earns its quiet register.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of listening, promise, and the ethics of attention accrue through particulars (Geiger‑like pulses, memorial names, “closing parentheses”). A single line leans close to thesis (“incidental heroism...”), but the carousel and synchronized aids carry the resonance without moralizing. The ending offers a non‑literal answer: presence can repair what grand gestures could not. Ambiguity remains humane rather than muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with clean distances and no head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure; dialogue is spare and natural, hinting subtext. Metaphoric texture feels owned by the POV rather than authorial gloss. The closing cadence fits the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, varied sentence rhythms, and images that carry multiple jobs. Figurative language is rich yet coherent (velvet swallowing light; Geiger counter pulses; closing parentheses). No scaffold loops or template cadences; momentum never stalls. A few stacked metaphors flirt with lushness but don’t blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise—“contact tracer for hearts” via a retro hearing aid tuned to the dead—is fresh and integrated. The carousel/memorial atrium is an inventive setting that reframes closure. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the story’s logic of pulses and promises. The work takes tasteful risks in concept and tone without obscuring clarity.</comment>
