<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mireya’s motives and contradictions are vivid: duty to the Echo versus the town’s safety culminates in the “third path” choice. Interiority is embodied through sound-as-thinking and the “logically emotional calculus.” Micro‑choices (tempo shifts, bowing changes, driving the key into the pier) reveal values under pressure. The cost registers in the worn key and her tears, an earned endurance rather than neat triumph.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain is clear: artifact cracking → shadows manifest → sonic attempt → moral trade‑off → inventive reconfiguration that lands on the page. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (key abraded, emotional toll, implied future duty). Orientation is clean from the first line, and the lens holds through to the final spiral image. No unearned turns or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina and the toolscape (key, baleen, ear‑bone) constrain tactics and drive choices; calving ice actively pressures the peak beat. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mireya’s sonic expertise. World rules are learned via action (frequency as agency) and stay consistent. The final image recharges place through stars echoing the bone’s spiral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect Echo vs. save town) is signaled early and tightens at the calving moment. The reversal—inviting shadows to listen—arises from agency and prior setup (vibrational matching), not coincidence. The price is legible if quiet (tool degradation, ongoing duty), and tension runs at sentence and beat levels. Slight neatness in restoring order keeps it just shy of the topmost band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of mercy through attention and engineered empathy is earned by acts, not told. The story reframes power as resonance and consent (“teaching darkness to listen”), avoiding moralizing. Recurring images (spiral, key, ice/whale memory) deepen meaning and shift at the end to a map of absolution. Ambiguity lingers productively in the cost of stewardship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third‑person close with a distinct sonic-perceptual signature remains stable and controlled. Diction is lush yet purposeful, modulating with pressure. No dialogue; the internal cadence still advances action and subtext. Voice never overreaches the established register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is musical and information‑dense with minimal scaffolding; images often do double duty. A few high‑saturation metaphors risk purple but stay coherent and legible under stress. Rhythm varies well, and the closure line lands cleanly without figurative muddle. Proofing and syntax are tight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis of lighthouse engineering, cetacean acoustics, and ritual absolution feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The “frequency/memory” mechanics are fresh and embedded in character and setting. The third-path solution via communal listening subverts familiar confrontation arcs. Bold yet coherent, with no gimmickry.</comment>
