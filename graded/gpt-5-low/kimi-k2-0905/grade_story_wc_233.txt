<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear motive (erasure vs. memory) and a credible, costly choice anchor the arc; interiority is vivid and embodied (“air thinned into lace… each breath a stitch”). The contradiction—self-preservation vs. sacrifice—surfaces at the dais and resolves through Earned Stasis. Minor hedge: emotional conflict feels largely foregone once the shard reveals her future voice, slightly reducing on‑page struggle. Still, agency at the coronation/erasure moment reads earned and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: climb → recognition of starlight as memory → shard’s reveal → decisive acceptance of the crown, with cost. Closure lands on the page with felt price (erasure traded for the kingdom’s remembrance and cosmic repair). The firefly clock and “final warning” create a persistent constraint sharpening the end. No causality breaks; set‑ups (astronomer, dream-map, crown) pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is not decorative; the ridge, ember grotto, and bleeding starlight constrain options and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful across senses (coppery air, frost on eyelashes, molten silver hiss). World rules are learned by interaction, not exposition, and the environment directly defines the price. The cobalt grotto above clouds frames both opening and closure with coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erase self to mend sky/restore name) is signaled early and tightens as memory literally drains away. The shard’s revelation meaningfully deepens the conflict and narrows options to a binary: descend and doom, or accept erasure. The final act is unambiguously a paid price. Slight softness: resistance at the peak is brief, making the final trade feel a touch inevitable rather than hard-fought.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory, identity, and self-authored fate emerges through image and action, not sermonizing. The loop reframes prophecy as memory, reweighting prior material with a resonant moral cost. The last image (a hidden crown burning above clouds) sustains ambiguity without confusion. One small neatness: the universal restoration of her name borders on tidy but remains earned by the cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyric texture; diction and cadence fit the queen’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well from ascent to coronation. No POV leakage or head‑hopping. Occasional density flirts with overwriting, but clarity holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with mostly clean, controlled figurative language (“memory escaping the world”). A few stacked metaphors and repeated constructions (“lacy menace,” multiple glass/bleed images) approach purple but don’t blur sense. No scaffolding loops or cadence templates slow momentum. Final paragraph lands with crisp, charged imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The self‑looped prophecy as memory and the bleeding‑starlight-as-erasure feel fresh and particular. The grotto/crown mechanism and the firefly clock synthesize mythic and intimate scales. While queen/prophecy tropes are familiar, execution personalizes them with distinctive sensory logic. Risk‑taking in image system pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
