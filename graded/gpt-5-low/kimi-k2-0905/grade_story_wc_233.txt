<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interior motive and cost are clear and layered: she wants to stop erasure and “unravel the mystery,” yet must choose erasure to save the sky. The embodied pressure (dew, thin air, fever-warm starlight) grounds her psychology. The core conflict—climb down to seal doom vs. stay to burn memory—feels earned. Slightly abstract diction at moments distances us from sharper micro-contradictions, but the climactic choice lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean hybrid drive: accumulative lyric pressure with causal pivots—warning → climb → realization starlight = memory → crown choice. Closure is on-page with cost (she accepts coronation/erasure), and consequences ripple (mirrors crack, name returns). Orientation is established early and held. No teleports or unkept setups; the time-loop reveal binds prior beats coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and constraining: cobalt grotto, basalt steps, ember stones, and bleeding starlight physically and metaphysically shape options. The grotto and crown directly determine the price and mechanism of saving the sky. Sensory texture spans sight, touch, temperature, and sound (fireflies as aural clock). World rules are absorbed through action without expository dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory and cosmic integrity) is signaled early and tightens toward a concrete trade-off. The mid-beat realization that starlight is escaping memory escalates cost and urgency, culminating in a decisive renunciation. Fireflies provide a ticking clock that converges with the “shared exhale” at the dais. The price—self-erasure to preserve the world—is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory, sacrifice, and acceptance-over-answers develop through recurring images (starlight/memory, mirrors, crown). The loop reweights the premise so the queen becomes the voice that once commanded her. One line edges toward explicit theme (“mystery unraveled not by answers...”), slightly blunt amid otherwise resonant imagery. Overall, the final image emotionally reprices the world with lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyric register that modulates appropriately under pressure. Diction and syntax feel controlled, with patterning that the piece teaches early. No head-hopping or stance wobble; elision supports revelation (future-voice twist). A hair shy of 9+ due to occasional ornate phrasing that risks distance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are lush yet mostly efficient; images often do dual work (world + theme). Minor purple flare and repetition (“lacy menace,” reiterated “ember grotto on the ridge”) introduce density beyond necessity. Rhythm remains varied and readable, with clear beat-to-beat propulsion. No figurative muddle at the climax; closure image is crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bleeding-starlight-as-memory and self-sent prophetic loop feel fresh and integrated; the crown as sacrificial engine is striking. Risks in imagery and cosmology cohere and elevate stakes. While time-loop sacrifice isn’t new, the specific synthesis (mirrors, fireflies, grotto physics) reads singular. The inevitability of her choice in hindsight underscores ingenuity.</comment>
