<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Calen’s hunger “to capture the shape of possibility” is enacted through concrete micro‑choices—kneeling, pressing the program to soil, accepting the seed. Contradictory impulses (oathbound withdrawal versus yearning for possibility) coexist and resolve into a credible reconfiguration. The cost surfaces viscerally when frost spells the names he deserted and through the binding allegiance. Slight distance from secondary relationships keeps the crucible primarily inward, but it works for this frame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: recurring “Reality shifted” marks escalations toward a clear CR/RR closure (“the greenhouse was not a place but a question”). Causal beats link cleanly (program → soil → mercury roots → living script → seed), with cost legible in the reckoning of deserters’ names. The final move to plant is nearly complete but marred by an incomplete last sentence, softening the cadence. Still, the before/after is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse is exquisitely specific and functional: spiral paths appear, soil breathes, temperature drops, and mercury roots literally rewrite options. Environment constrains and enables choices (the program must meet soil; the path ushers him; the door materializes), and charges the final image of planting. Sensory selection is vivid without museum‑tour listing; world rules feel consistent inside the fable logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconfiguring failure into possibility—tightens with each deepening (allegiance, script of unlived choices, fusion with puppet). The names‑as‑constellations beat makes the price palpable before acceptance of the seed, and agency drives turns. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses his prior withdrawal. Only the truncated last line slightly blunts peak tension’s release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of failure as compost and possibility as cultivated, not seized, emerge through particular images (mercury roots, greenhouse as question, seed covenant) rather than abstract moralizing. The final realization reweights prior motifs without neat platitude, and the EXIT fireflies for “the lost” provide a resonant counter‑reading. One explicit thematic articulation (“what would you harvest if failure were merely compost?”) edges toward declaration but remains earned by scene pressure. The incomplete last sentence nicks the afterglow a hair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (copper and starlight on the tongue, bells of silver leaves) sustains pressure and wonder. Voice modulation tracks escalation without head‑hopping; elision patterns (“Reality shifted”) are taught and paid off. Diction remains coherent to the fable‑knight register. A clipped final sentence interrupts rhythm at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is dense yet purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, emotion, and turn), and rhythm varies. Imagery stacks are mostly coherent within the alchemical logic, avoiding figurative muddle even at peak beats. Minor purple pressure is offset by clarity, but the truncated last line and occasional intensifier clusters shave momentum. Proofreading otherwise reads clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Knight + alchemical greenhouse + living playbill + puppet double synthesizes into a fresh, memorable mythic‑lyric. Key turns feel inevitable in hindsight (program to soil to roots to seed) and risk‑taking heightens stakes without confusion. The “failure as compost” reframing lands as concept and felt cost. Small cadence blemish at the end doesn’t touch the ingenuity of the design.</comment>
