<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (repair vs. release) are clear and consistent, and her choices under pressure—using the clock hand as film, timing by the leaf-sound, leaving—reveal a credible renunciation with cost. Interiority is particular and embodied (“luminous ache,” tactile tools, the Hasselblad with lunar dust). The mantra-like line “to harness the ephemeral…” edges toward stated theme but reads as her credo rather than authorial intrusion. The final choice forecloses her life at the observatory with a felt price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: tremors → clock hand in camera → shutter-click → collapse into the photograph → departure. Closure lands on the page with cost: the observatory is gone, fixed in the single frame, and Mira leaves. Setups (observatory-as-camera, spinning hand, leaf-sound) pay off causally and conceptually. Orientation is clear from the outset and serves the closure image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar observatory and its instruments are specific and tactically relevant: the station-as-camera reframes the stakes and dictates the method of capture. Tools (1956 Hasselblad, silver halide, airlock, shuttle) constrain choices and charge the ending image of the observatory folding into a photograph. World rules stay internally consistent within a poetically altered physics. The environment decisively charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clinging to repair vs. restructuring self—tightens as tremors escalate and the spinning hand erodes certainty. The decisive act (loading the clock hand, timing by the leaf-sound, choosing to leave) narrows options with a visible cost: losing the observatory. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly. The cost carries into the final flight and static needle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of impermanence, capture vs. release, and time as aperture emerge through concrete images that shift meaning at the end (leaf-sound, observatory-as-camera, the photograph containing lost futures). The aphoristic refrain risks overtness but is earned by the tactile particulars and the mentor’s earlier warning. The final repricing—she was the subject being developed—lingers without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is strong and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical single-POV voice with a distinct perceptual signature (optical/mechanical metaphors, precise nouns) sustains pressure. Rhythm modulates well at peak beats (the shutter-click, the fold into the photograph). No head-hopping or stance drift. Slight recurrence of signature phrases is motif rather than tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and clear sequencing through a lyric mode. Repetition (“luminous ache,” “changelessly constant”) is controlled and functional. No coherence breaks or paraphrase loops; cadence supports escalation. Minor lushness never muddies the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a lunar observatory as a literal camera, a spinning clock hand as film, and a leaf-sound as temporal metronome culminating in the station collapsing into a photograph. Risks in concept and diction pay off with coherent stakes and a clean closure. The turn feels inevitable in hindsight from seeded motifs. The vision reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
