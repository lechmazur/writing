<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—“to harness the ephemeral”—is clear and enacted through specific choices (loading the spinning hand into the Hasselblad, timing by the leaf’s sound, choosing to leave). Interiority is textured and embodied (“luminous ache,” boots thrumming), though contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized as a live tug-of-war. The mentor’s recalled warning grounds her final renunciation. The cost of leaving her 30-year post is felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: shaking → leaf-sound timer → shutter click → station collapses into the photograph → departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing (observatory as darkroom; the world collapses into the frame) with tangible cost. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/what’s tremoring) within the surreal logic. Setups (spinning hand, leaf-sound) pay off precisely at the hinge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, tools, and recurring objects are specific and pressure choices (Hasselblad as mechanism, station-as-camera, shuttle patched with mirrors). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through profession. World rules stay consistent within the lyric-surreal premise. The final image is charged by setting: the observatory folds into a single frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture versus release) tightens as tremors escalate to the shutter act and departure. Agency drives the turns: choosing the method (leaf-sound), enacting the exposure, and leaving rather than “repairing.” The cost to identity and home is legible, and the station’s collapse forecloses return. Stakes remain intimate but consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of letting go, capture, and self-restructuring arise organically through image systems (camera, shutter, leaf-sound, escape velocity) and reweight at the end. The mentor’s line risks directness but earns its place by reframing the climax. The final shift from escape velocity to “drag of memory” gives a resonant, non-literal answer. No sermonizing intrudes on scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with consistent single-POV distance and controlled cadence. Recurring diction patterns (“luminous ache”) feel motif-driven rather than mechanical. Compression under pressure is legible and purposeful. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with evocative, mostly disciplined figurative language; images do multiple jobs (camera/observatory/darkroom). A few repeated phrases verge on incantatory but do not stall momentum. Syntax varies with scene needs; closure image is crisp. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding artifacts blunt the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—lunar observatory as camera/darkroom, a spinning clock hand as film, timing by the sound of an impossible leaf—feels striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in surreal physics serve character and theme rather than gimmick. Turns are grounded in earlier particulars. The final conceptual flip is fresh and memorable.</comment>
