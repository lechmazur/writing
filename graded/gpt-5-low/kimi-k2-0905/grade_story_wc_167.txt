<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—paying “debts of beauty” before sunrise—is clear and particular, and her craft anchors her interiority. Embodied perception (salt wind, kelp, the harmonica’s ghost note) reveals character without labels. The renunciation of the prism is a credible cost consistent with her values. A true internal contradiction under pressure is minimal; serenity slightly softens the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual deepens from waiting to reading rings to the sacrificial throw. Orientation is crisp by the first sentences (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost: she gives up the prism, which dissolves to heal the town’s windows, completing the “ledger.” The because/therefore chain is lyric but legible, though not overtly causal in a traditional plot sense.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn isn’t mere backdrop; tide, auroral residue, and the town’s windows actively shape options and the final image. The bay’s rings are the mechanism of reading, and sunrise is a live constraint. Tool and place fuse (prism + bay + dawn) to produce the healing act. Sensory specificity is high and POV-filtered, never touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the reckonings before sunrise—tightens via the prism’s flare and the imminent “audit” of daylight. The final choice (hurling the prism, accepting its loss) reads as earned escalation under the accumulative lens. Pressure is quiet rather than adversarial; the lack of significant resistance slightly lowers intensity. Still, the cadence shift to action at the end delivers a meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of valuing the mundane and reparation accrue through specific relics (teacup, harmonica, scar) and reweight at the end when ordinary windows are redeemed. Subtext works through ritualized speech and image rather than thesis. “She understood the assignment” edges toward meta-plainness but is buffered by scene pressure. The last image’s code of rings sustains resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently focalized through Mara’s perceptual biases (glass, light, craft). Rhythm varies well; diction (“storms slid off them like apologies,” “audit the world”) is elevated yet apt. No head-hopping or stance slippage. A few ornate turns flirt with purple but maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut and image-dense with minimal scaffolding or loops; sentences often do double duty. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and task-linked. Micro-repetition (“prism atrium in mist”) feels patterned rather than redundant. No mechanical slips; momentum breathes with intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Harbor glazier + prism + ring-reading ritual yields a fresh synthesis; the sacrificial dispersion of the prism into town windows is an elegant, non-obvious payoff. Risks in lyric accumulation and quasi-mystical mechanics pay off clearly. Emotional truth—repairing overlooked value—feels earned, not decorative. The piece avoids template beats while staying legible.</comment>
