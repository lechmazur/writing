<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motives and professional/inner craft are clear and particular; her ritualized choices (naming the objects, hurling the prism) align with her worldview. The interiority is concrete (reading ripples as ledger) but offers little contradictory impulse or real struggle. The final sacrifice of the prism registers as cost but not against a live internal opposition. Strong specificity, modest tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: dawn’s approaching “audit” frames the window, the ripple-reading deepens, and the prism throw reconfigures the world. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost—the prism dissolves into the town’s windows. Orientation is crisp from the opening line and the pattern taught early pays off at the end. The causal weave is lyrical but coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is sensorially rich and functionally constraining: tide, wind, and sunrise pressure the ritual’s timing. The prism, water, and town windows function as micro-settings that charge the final image and tactically shape action. Specifics like “atrial glass of the abandoned lighthouse” and the ferry’s humming harmonica deepen place logic. Environment meaningfully inflects choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the before-sunrise ledger and the decision to name and then relinquish the prism. The key tightening is the prism’s flare and the “assignment” to speak value, culminating in the irreversible throw. Stakes are conceptual but legible; the price is the loss of the talisman in exchange for distributed, invisible repair. Escalation is quiet yet real under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—revaluing the mundane—emerges through enacted images (cracked teacup, dented harmonica, scar) that are repriced without overt moralizing. The ending’s dispersed light sealing hairline cracks offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext in “storms slid off them like apologies” and “brutal clarity” complicates sentiment with cost. Resonance lingers without closing ambiguity too neatly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with a glazier’s perceptual bias toward light and fracture. Diction and rhythm modulate purposefully from hush to harmonic to the blades of color. POV distance remains steady; the few spoken lines function as incantatory action, not explanation. No leakage or register drift undermines the lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is polished: high information density, varied syntax, and purposeful metaphors that hold their logic (ledgers, audits, prisms). A few elevated phrases risk purple (“noctilucent reckonings,” “auroral residue”) but remain coherent and voice-justified. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates drag momentum. The final sentence lands cleanly with image-driven propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor glazier premise and ripple-led valuation ritual feel fresh and integrated. The prism’s dispersal into town windows reframes “repair” with a deft, original mechanic. Risks in concept and diction heighten coherence rather than distract. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight and distinct in the field.</comment>
