<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (map echoes) deepens credibly into lineage and guilt; her micro‑choices—lifting the negative, following the sigh, descending the hatch—reveal value hierarchy under pressure. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“legacy’s burden” shifting from cadence to cost). A slight drift toward fated surrender at the climax trims agency, but the choice to go down is still hers. The endurance/absorption ending carries visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (diaries → negative → hatch → tunnel) tighten toward a charged transformation. Closure lands on‑page with cost—Mira becomes the echo/corridor, reconfiguring premise and options. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when after climate shifts) and the camera‑building logic is paid off. The coda with the rescue team cleanly seals the loop without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is inseparable from action: the ivy‑veiled passage as shutter, storms as flash powder, corridors as developing trays. Environmental detail is selective, multisensory, and pressure‑bearing (hatch, ladder, humming wires). The recurring negatives and breathing room charge the final image. World rules stay consistent and learned through discovery, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confronting/decoding the building’s memory—intensifies as the lineage tie raises the price. The tunnel sequence is a decisive deepening that narrows options, culminating in transformation. Cost is unmistakable (self erased into architecture). Slight inevitability at the pull softens, but does not erase, earned escalation via her choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Legacy’s burden” evolves from motif to operative law, reweighted by the camera‑building reveal and the final absorption. The piece resists moralizing, letting images (reversed laughter, child‑frame scream) carry meaning. The ending provides a resonant, non‑literal answer: to learn what walls dream, one risks becoming their negative space. Thematic coherence is tight and lingers beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric third‑person close with architectural‑acoustic lexicon fits the premise and stays consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure; patterned elision is taught and legible. No head‑hopping or stance drift; certainty matches what Mira can infer or sense. The voice’s precision heightens closure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line craft is dense yet purposeful; images do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Figurative chains (lungs/arteries, camera/developer) cohere rather than clash. A hairline risk of saturation in a few lines, but clarity and propulsion hold through the climax. Opening and final lines are charged, efficient pivots.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Building‑as‑camera with climate storms as flash powder is a striking, integrated conceit. The negative‑space inheritance and self‑becoming‑corridor turn feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks are bold and not gimmicky, with strong conceptual integrity. The synthesis of acoustics, architecture, and legacy reads singular.</comment>
