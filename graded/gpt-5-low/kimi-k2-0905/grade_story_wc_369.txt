<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—relieving “quantified sorrow” and learning what trees witness—is clear and consistently expressed through tactile choices (chalk grid, catching mercury dreams, dismantling the sextant). Interiority arrives via perception-action rather than abstract labels, and her compassion reads in how she speaks to dreams and the instrument. The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses or visible inner friction; she moves with assured competence. The renunciation of measurement at the end feels earned but low-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: mapping dreams, the pin’s timing, moonlight’s rules, and the sextant’s burden converge into a cedar transformation. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—rejecting measurement for witness—with on-page cost (sacrificing the instrument) and a reweighted rule-set (“quantify nothing”). Orientation is clean from line one; causal threads are consistent within the fable’s logic. The cost is more conceptual than painful, slightly limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tower-parapet, storm, and moonlight actively constrain tactics: moonlight heals, stormlight times the pin, chalk on slick stone captures mercury dreams. The sextant, grid, and parapet integrate as micro-settings that shape each move, and the final image (cedar rooted to parapet stone) is charged by that environment. Sensory detail is vivid, purposeful, and filtered through Mara’s craft-mind. World rules (moonlight healing, dream-mercury) are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure accrues via pattern: catching dreams reduces sorrow, the pin marks the timing, aligning the broken sextant to the moon refracts grief into trees, culminating in the deconstruction that forecloses measurement. Stakes remain intimate but coherent: transform a grief-burdened tool and reframe human calculation against trees. Escalation is a deepening rather than a clash; cost is the loss/rebirth of the sextant. The gentle cadence limits visceral tension but suits the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—measurement vs witness, repair vs extraction—emerges organically through actions and recurring objects, with a resonant final reconfiguration. The cedar and “quantify nothing” notebook entry articulate a non-literal answer that reweights prior images. The explicit phrasing “quantify nothing” edges toward moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the piece maintains emotional honesty and avoids sermonizing elsewhere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close voice persists with controlled cadence and precise metaphor, modulating with pressure (from storm-lit intensity to dawn hush). POV certainty remains within what Mara could infer; no leakage or head-hopping. Diction feels character-filtered through her craft and attention to tools. The lyric density stays legible without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is tight: images carry multiple jobs (world rule, theme, action), and rhythm varies to propel or ease. Figurative language is rich but coherent; few, if any, muddled metaphors or loops. Minor lushness risks purple, but the prose mostly earns its density by advancing process and pressure. Final lines land cleanly with precise images and no scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow embodied in a broken sextant that becomes a cedar under moonlight is strikingly original and internally coherent. The “pin moment,” mercury-dream mapping, and stormlit inversion feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The risks (lyric fable, process-magic) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final conceptual pivot is both surprising and earned.</comment>
