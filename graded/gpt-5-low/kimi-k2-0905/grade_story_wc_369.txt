<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and method are clear and character‑specific; her competence and gentleness guide concrete micro‑choices (chalk grid, alignment, unscrewing limbs). Internal contradiction is mild—she apologizes to the astronomer yet sacrifices his tool—so pressure on her values is felt but not wrenching. The cost registers as relinquishing the instrument to become a cedar, though she bears little personal risk. Interiority remains embodied through tactile action rather than labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mapping dreams → pin’s chime → moon‑refracted trees → deconstruction → cedar. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: sorrow is transmuted and the tool redefined; the “Instructions” line locks the before/after. Orientation is clean from the opening; the pin beat cleanly tightens cadence. Cost is legible in the loss of the sextant and the acceptance of a non‑quantified future.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: storm, tower, parapet, and moonlight actively shape tactics (chalk grid’s slickness, refracting through cracks, moon‑healing). The environment constrains and enables choices and charges the final image (a cedar rooted in parapet stones). World rules (moonlight heals) are taught in action and stay consistent. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—reduce quantified sorrow and learn what trees witness—and tighten with the pin’s chime and the spectral tree realization. Escalation is mostly deepening rather than conflictual; the primary price is the sextant’s sacrifice and Mara’s renunciation of measurement. No antagonist, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens. The cadence shift at deconstruction provides the needed turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of witnessing vs. quantifying, ecological grief, and repair arise organically through events and images (numbered leaves; sorrow measured in “rings”). The final reweighting—“quantify nothing”—is potent, though the phrasing flirts with explicit thesis. Subtext hums in the pin as a “bookmark” and in the cedar’s future cones as second chances. Emotional aftereffect is earned without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyrical texture; diction and rhythm feel confident and character‑bound. Patterned elision (dreams as beads, sorrow as index) is taught and controlled. No dialogue needed; voice carries action and subtext cleanly. Modulations under pressure (pin beat, lightning inversion) are deft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet purposeful; images often do double duty (cracked mirrors → constellations/sorrow; moon through fractures → spectral trees). Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies and momentum holds. A high figuration density skirts purple but remains coherent and legible. The final line recharges motifs without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: quantified sorrow, dream‑mapping, a broken sextant transmuted into a cedar under moonlight, and the pin as temporal lodestone. The premise’s implications are followed through to a surprising yet inevitable closure image. Risks in tone and world rules pay off without muddling clarity. Specificity and imaginative leaps feel singular and memorable.</comment>
