<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Vale’s motive (find the wraith/mentor, manage bitterness) is clear and her micro‑choices—taking the phone, accepting the mentor’s reframe, stepping into the garden’s center—credibly lead to metamorphosis. Interiority is vivid and embodied (arrowhead warmth, buoyant sorrow), though the internal contradiction (hunt vs. surrender) resolves a touch smoothly. The herbalist applies light but relevant pressure without stealing focus. The cost—abandoning her old life—reads on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: environment and motif density build to a resonant reconfiguration as Vale becomes the “harmony untamed.” Causality is legible (phone → realization → arrowhead resonance → ascension) with on‑page cost. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, aim) and the ending’s charged image lands. Minor late flourish beyond closure is fine, though a clipped fragment slightly mars the final third’s smoothness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underground garden is sensorially specific and functional: frost, floating herbs, and the glass ceiling shape options and charge the final image she literally drifts through. Objects-as-setting (arrowhead, phone) integrate seamlessly into space and action. Consistent world rules (gravity play) unfold through observation, not exposition. Strong POV filtering keeps detail purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting grief/bitterness) is signaled early and tightens when mentor reframes the quarry and the arrowhead activates. The escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, but it narrows options: hunt versus become. The choice to surrender and ascend is protagonist‑driven with a clear price. Pressure remains coherent without relying on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres—grief reweighted into levity, self as the sought cryptid—delivered through images (static, frost, buoyant sorrow) that reprice prior beats. However, the explicit line “The wraith was never separate from you…” over‑articulates the thesis near the end, dulling subtext. The final images still resonate, but moralizing trims the afterglow. The piece otherwise avoids sentimentality and earns its insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is confident, with a distinct perceptual signature (scientist’s tactility meeting mythic register). Diction, cadence, and sensory choices modulate with pressure and stay coherent. Dialogue is brief but purposeful. Minor risk of lushness encroaching on clarity is mostly contained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is often luminous and efficient, with images doing multiple jobs. Still, there’s occasional purple stacking and one truncated fragment (“hearing in its crack”) in the final third, which is a copy error that dents momentum and polish. A few near‑synonym reiterations could be trimmed. Rhythm otherwise propels to a strong close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—cryptid investigation recast as internal harmony that plays with gravity—is fresh and felt; phone-as-seance and frostbitten levity are memorable. Risks (mythic lyricism, concept-as-creature) pay off without obscuring closure. The arrowhead’s cultural echo and environmental physics are integrated rather than gimmicky. Slight overstatement keeps it just shy of the rare air.</comment>
