<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol’s motive—once a debunker now compelled to exhume truth—drives every beat and sharpens at the diamond’s playback. Contradictory impulses are on the page (“almost dropped it, yearning for amnesia” vs. choosing to hang it). Micro‑choices—gloves, pattern‑reading, humming the sign‑off—reveal a precise hierarchy of values under pressure. The closing endurance carries felt cost without moral safety nets.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: letters → stillpoint → resonance → diamond → playback → decision to broadcast. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she sacrifices comfort for a truth that accelerates decay. Orientation is immediate (Geiger, “Paradise” gate), and the rule‑set (resonance access, playback at 3:03) stays consistent. The final image reweights the world’s logic without resorting to coincidence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard and stillpoint actively constrain and enable choices (calm pocket, hex‑scar cues, Geiger modulation). Objects and environment charge the ending—the hung diamond as a bell in radioactive wind, apples browning as consequence. Sensory detail is specific and purpose‑driven (chrome slag letters, glassy roots, copper taste). World rules unfold via action rather than exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens from search to discovery to the punishing playback, forcing a costly stance. The decisive act—suspending the diamond to broadcast to the soil—forecloses personal amnesia and triggers visible consequence (rot). Stakes remain coherent: truth versus preservation under radiation. Escalation is clean though largely internal, yet the physical world mirrors the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of institutional deceit, memory as curse, and truth’s corrosive necessity surface through concrete action, not thesis. The orchard’s false vitality vs. accelerated rot crystallizes the moral calculus without sermonizing. The “conscience flaw” reinterprets the diamond and Marisol’s past role, yielding a conceptual repricing. The final seeds/rot image invites reflection beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled close third with a distinct perceptual signature—technical yet sensory (“angry cicada,” “milk‑white with a black spear”). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure; revelations arrive through tactile choices rather than helper‑narration. No POV leakage; certainty matches what Marisol can infer. Lyric compression is taught early and remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet precise; images carry multiple jobs (hex scars as world‑rule and cipher). Figurative language is vivid but coherent; no mixed metaphors or looped scaffolding. Momentum persists through varied sentence rhythm and purposeful paragraphing. Minor richness skirts purple but stays disciplined under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: a cursed diamond as conscience playback, a stillpoint accessed by broadcast tone, truth broadcast to soil. Risks—lyric science‑myth, archival confetti as map—land cleanly and heighten stakes. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (sign‑off tone as key; orchard tessellation echoing shredded letters). The final image is memorable and specific.</comment>
