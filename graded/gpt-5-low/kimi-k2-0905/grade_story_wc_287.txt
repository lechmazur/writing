<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are precise and embodied—illegal gardening, theft re-framed as “translation,” and a promise to the boy anchor her choices. The pragmatic/ wistful contradiction drives action (stealing the tooth to keep a vow) and reveals a lived moral calculus. Her vulnerability stays active under pressure (moving by “moon-glow,” emptying the can) rather than declared. The relationship with the boy is economical but potent, altering her tactics and culminating in a credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: theft → lock → descent → contact → ascent → rooftop revelation → renunciatory drop. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tool’s fall and re-clicked lock, the lavender passed on, and the boy carrying “a small reflected moon” reconfigure options with felt cost. The persistent constraint (bolted door; risk of fines) shapes tactics throughout. The on-page price is clear in the relinquished tool and the acceptance of ongoing risk rather than a solved corridor.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor/moon/stairwell ecology constrains movement, sight, and strategy (working by moonlight, “cupping” light, bolted iron). Tools and micro-settings—fire escape, lock, garden—are tactile and consequential. Sensory details are selective and bias-driven (diesel and starfish, mildew and coats) without tourist cataloging. The final image is charged by setting logic: moonlight as resource, rooftop as illicit sanctuary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get the boy to sky/light—tightens through the bolted door, the dark descent, and the timed ascent. Escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent under a hybrid accumulative/causal lens. The lock opens a touch easily, and external resistance is soft, slightly trimming peak pressure. Still, the renunciation of the tool and the garden’s precariousness register as real costs at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Light, translation, and cultivation as modes of resistance cohere without sermonizing; motifs (petal, oars, leaf/lavender) evolve into a non-literal answer about sustaining courage. The “reflect light into dark corners” principle is dramatized, not lectured, and reweighted by the final handoff. The piece resists neat moralizing, embracing illegality as ethical action. Any tenderness is earned by concrete acts rather than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and precise recurring lexicon (oars, light, metal, plantwork) holds steady. Psychic distance is stable; inference is signaled as inference. Dialogue is sparse but charged, carrying subtext and function. Patterned elision (refrains of rhythm and light) is taught early and pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do double work (image + action or theme). Figurative texture is lush yet coherent within water/light/garden fields, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minor risk of saturation in a few sentences, but cadence varies and propulsion holds. No visible scaffolding or loops; the final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fire-escape gardening as clandestine mutual aid, the bitting gauge as “translation,” and moonlight as a tangible tool feel fresh and particular. The rower/oar rhythm patterning choices and breath is inventive without gimmickry. The renunciatory drop of the tool into nasturtium potential is a sharp, surprising, inevitable turn. Emotional specificity replaces template uplift.</comment>
