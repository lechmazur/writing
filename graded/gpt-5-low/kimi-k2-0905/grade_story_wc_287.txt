<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are clear and textured: a fines-savvy, rule-bending caretaker who steals a tool to keep a promise. Her contradictory impulses—risk-averse pragmatism vs. transgressive compassion—operate simultaneously and drive action. Embodied choices (kneeling with the petal; guiding the boy; surrendering the tool) reveal hierarchy of values with cost. The boy’s presence tightens her stance without head‑hopping or sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: theft → lock → descent → boy → ascent → garden → relinquishment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the boy leaves with lavender and “a small reflected moon,” while Mara pays with risk and the lost tool. The lock’s click and the tooth’s fall provide on‑page cost and a before/after hinge. Orientation is anchored early; the lens holds through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Harbor, moonlight, and rooftop garden are vivid and filtered through Mara’s sensibility; details are tactile (tarpaulin wings, rusted railing). The iron door and the gauge tooth function as micro‑setting constraints that shape tactics and the ending image. Sensory balance is strong; the environment mirrors and pressures the action without feeling touristic. Minor flourish risk, but specificity remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—getting the boy to sky/light—tightens credibly at the locked door and in the dark stairwell. Escalation comes from Mara’s agency (using the tooth, managing silence, guiding ascent), with a felt price at the end (tool lost, ongoing risk). The conflict remains intimate yet charged, avoiding soft resets. The quiet stakes read viscerally without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Light versus confinement, translation versus theft, and care as subversion emerge organically from action and recurring images (petal, oars, moon, lavender). “Every oar is a promise” flirts with aphorism yet is earned by the story’s pattern. The final image reweights prior motifs into a durable answer about sustaining courage. Sentiment is held in check by concrete, specific acts.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanics and moonwater metaphors) that maintains distance discipline. Compression and patterned diction are taught early and carried through peak beats without confusion. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual, serving action. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High-density figurative texture mostly clarifies rather than cloys; rhythms vary and propulsion holds. A few images push toward excess (“cupped the moonlight in her palms”) but remain coherent within the taught lyric. No significant loops or scaffolding; syntax is clean. Minor saturation prevents the absolute top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—illegal rooftop horticulture, locksmith lore, harbor cadence, and a child’s initiation via a petal—is fresh and specific. Recurrences (oars, petals, light) feel inevitable in hindsight rather than engineered. The lock tool’s fate reframes themes with grace. Risk-taking in tone and image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
