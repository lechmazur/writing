<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s drive is precise and sustained, with embodied interiority (“calm outside, quake within”) that avoids therapy-speak. Her micro-choices—boarding, decoding logs, asking Riga to beach, salvaging—align tightly with motive. Contradiction (daughter of a “hero” seeking to dismantle his myth) gives her arc moral texture. Riga’s presence adds clean status pressure without crowding the lens.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: sundial/gnomon dent → log discrepancies → scratched coordinate → beached barge → recovered journals → decisive mission shift. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis hybrid: she relinquishes the sundial and redirects her life’s vector with visible cost (loss of father-myth). Orientation is strong from the opening image; the drive lens holds. The final mission toward statues extends consequence rather than soft-resolving it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canal’s fog, iron walls, and swinging lanterns are vivid and integrated into action, not postcard detail. The barge and reedy cut constrain tactics, while the sundial-as-tool functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather and water affect choices (nosing into a hidden cut, salvaging a crate). Specificity feels lived-in and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth versus inherited myth—is signaled early and tightens through log-reading to the bunker reveal. A meaningful deepening occurs with the coordinate and the on-page recovery of journals, culminating in a renunciation that carries cost. Pressure is mostly internal but coheres and grows under the causal lens. Agency drives each turn; coincidence never resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of institutional forgetting, inherited scaffolds of lies, and public monuments accrue through concrete acts (decoding, salvage, renunciation) rather than sermonizing. “Serene upheaval” shifts from internal sensation to environmental image to civic project, reweighting prior beats. One line edges toward explicit thesis, but resonance remains earned. The final mission reframes truth as ongoing work with social cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person stays tightly bound to Mara’s perceptions; rhythm modulates with pressure. Diction is precise and character-coherent; no head-hopping. Sparse dialogue fits Riga’s defined voice. Patterned elisions (morning radio, serene upheaval) are taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is supple and efficient; images do double duty without sludge. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and purpose-driven (“wake spreading like a sentence spoken at last”). Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing maintain momentum. A few elevated turns flirt with purple but never blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a pocket sundial as map and moral fulcrum, morning-radio silence as civic liturgy, and a rusted barge as witness to suppressed history. The bunker-crate-journal reveal feels inevitable in hindsight given prior cues. The ending’s public-facing mission risks sentimentality but stays specific, avoiding generic closure. Overall, the piece commits to its vision with confidence and precision.</comment>
