<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear and felt, and her interiority is textured (“calm outside, quake within”). Contradictory impulses surface credibly—devotion to her father versus the drive to dismantle his myth—though the conflict remains largely internal and poised rather than messy. Micro-choices (reading smudges, asking Riga to beach, relinquishing the sundial) align with motive. Riga applies subtle relational pressure without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: logs → weight discrepancy → coordinate on sundial → beached barge → bunker → journals → mission shift. Orientation is grounded early (canal, freighter, Captain Riga), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (the father’s de-heroization and new public mission). The morning-radio timing recurs and pays off. No unkept setups or convenience solves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canal, fog, and rusted freighter are tactile and operative—setting shapes access (beaching, reedy cut) and charges images (lantern ellipses, scar-like canal). The pocket sundial functions as a tool-object that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory economy is strong and POV-filtered; world rules stay stable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the start and tightens through the concrete discovery path, culminating in a choice with cost. The escalation is primarily knowledge-deepening rather than danger, but it narrows options meaningfully (accept truth, act publicly). The emotional price is clear and fuels the forward mission. No gratuitous reversals; the turn at the bunker feels earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of myth-making, institutional erasure, and the ethics of remembrance emerge through image and action rather than sermon. The “architecture of lies” motif evolves into dismantling scaffolds, culminating in a charged public-facing mission. A few near-thesis lines (“not an ending; it was scaffolding…”) flirt with explicitness but remain earned by particulars. The final image reweights prior material without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical close third sustains a distinct perceptual signature; metaphors are character-specific and consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure—quiet, tensile lines at discoveries; expansive cadence at closure. Dialogue is minimal but apt and in-character (Riga’s taciturn presence). No POV leakage or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images often do double duty (lantern ellipses as “serene upheaval made visible”). Figurative language is vivid yet controlled; no mixed metaphors or purple drift. No scaffold loops or template cadences; the final lines land crisply and re-energize earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—an errant legend-seeker using a sundial and erased logbooks on a canal barge to exhume a personal-political lie—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The coordinate scratched into the sundial is an elegant, specific twist that avoids gimmickry. The quiet crusade that follows sidesteps familiar revenge arcs. Risk-taking in tone and structure heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
