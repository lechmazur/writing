<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and evolving: a debt to the dead pulls a man who prefers predictability into risk. Interiority is embodied (salt on lips; “books breathing underwater”), and contradictory impulses (stubborn refusal vs. compulsion to descend) coexist credibly. His final acceptance of tenure at cost to his old life reads earned, sealed by seeing his own name in “Perpetual Repose.” Minor hedge: “inadvertently stubborn” is told, though mostly dramatized through choice and endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: package → descent → discovery → repair attempt → insufficiency → memory-fire amplification → keeper acceptance. Closure lands with cost (he stays as lighthouse keeper; the inland parlor is abandoned). The lens holds as Hybrid with causal dominance at the end; no orientation debt. Magical beats stay consistent with the story’s established logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater city library is specific, tactile, and functional (octopus catalog, swollen volumes, coral desk) and it constrains choices and enables tactics (paper boats, bezel for the shard). Recurring objects (lens, books) charge the final image and shape action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, not a museum tour. The environment directly governs the climactic act and the earned stillness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive the distress signal/relieve accumulated dead) is signaled early and tightens when the re-set lens proves insufficient and demands sacrifice. The key reversal is the lens “demanding a keeper,” forcing a trade-off with visible cost. Agency drives turns: he chooses to burn memory, then to accept tenure. Pressure remains coherent and escalates to a resonant, costly stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of custodianship, memorial labor, and the “address of rest” emerge from image and action rather than argument. The lens/librarians motif reframes death work as curation with social cost and responsibility. A faint whiff of thesis appears in the sentence “to remind the living that rest has a permanent address,” but the preceding beats have earned it. The final image reweights earlier material with lingering ambiguity and tenderness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close remains stable with a lyrical yet controlled cadence suited to a ritualized descent. Diction is distinctive (e.g., “column of chased stillness”) and consistent with the undertaker’s sensibility. Psychic distance modulates cleanly at pressure points. No dialogue, but narrative texture carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and purposeful figurative language that mostly clarifies rather than clutters. A few lush clusters nudge toward purple, but rhythm and specificity keep momentum. No significant loops or scaffolding; metaphors align with the established sea/library palette. Mechanics are clean and the final cadence lands.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—undertaker as lighthouse-keeper of a drowned library, memory-fire, brass octopus catalog—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight given the shard and vocation. Risks in worldbuilding and tone pay off without obscuring clarity. The turns grow from the premise rather than gimmickry. The final reconfiguration transforms familiar deathwork into an original custodial myth.</comment>
