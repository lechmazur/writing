<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular (debt to the dead, refusal turned acceptance), and micro-choices under pressure—repairing the lens, sacrificing memory-pages, accepting tenure—align with his profession and flaw. Interiority is embodied through tactile images (salt on lips, pocket lighter, paper boats). The contradictory impulse (inadvertent stubbornness vs. compulsion to answer) is present and resolved with felt cost. A touch more on-the-spot hesitation at the tether would elevate complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid causal/accumulative structure holds: package → descent → discovery → failed partial fix → memory-fire amplification → tenure acceptance. Closure lands on-page with cost: he becomes the lighthouse keeper, abandoning his inland life (Earned Stasis/Decisive Change). No orientation debt; the rules are taught through action and paid off. Stakes tighten cleanly at the shard’s insufficiency and the octopus’s tethered offer.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The underwater city library is vivid, sensorial, and purposeful; the octopus catalog and coral desk are not ornaments but tools that shape choices. Environmental constraints (depth, current, cracked dome, bezel) directly determine tactics and the final tether. Recurring objects (lens, catalog) charge the last image. World rules feel consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the signal vs. surrendering his life ashore) escalates via a meaningful turn: the shard alone fails, forcing a sacrificial tactic. The paper-boat conflagration transforms grief into fuel, narrowing options. The final acceptance of tenure forecloses a path with a visible price. Minor note: a brief beat of genuine risk or near-failure in the burning sequence could intensify pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of custodianship, debt, and the architecture of rest arise organically from particulars (cataloging souls, overdue fines, RETURNED stamps). The final image reweights the premise: signals remind the living that rest has an address. One line edges toward overt thesis-stating, but the imagery largely carries the resonance. Subtext of self-burial and vocation-as-calling lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistent, textured third-person close tracks the undertaker’s sensibility; diction is cohesive and modulates with pressure. Lyric compression is taught early and remains legible. No head-hopping, no register drift. The voice’s imagistic confidence supports the mythic frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density imagery is largely precise and doing multiple jobs; rhythm varies well, and sentences carry momentum. Recurrent phrases (“occupying impossible spaces”) feel motif-driven rather than looped. Minimal excess; clarity holds in peak beats (the burn, the tether, the acceptance). A hair from purple in a few stacked metaphors, but control is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Concepts like a brass-octopus catalog, memory-fed underwater fire, and a lighthouse lens for the dead feel singular and inevitable in hindsight. The turn from undertaker to keeper is fresh yet grounded in established logic. Risk-taking enhances coherence and closure without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads as an authentic vision rather than a collage of tropes.</comment>
