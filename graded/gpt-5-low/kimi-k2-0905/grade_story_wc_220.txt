<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scraps’ motive—retired from death‑finding yet compelled to collapse distance—drives concrete choices (nudging the leaf, leading the trek, digging). The contradiction between renunciation and compulsion is embodied and paid through effort and risk, if softly. Kite’s desire is clear and active without flattening Scraps’ agency. Emotional texture is vivid though the path remains relatively unopposed, muting deeper strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: relics → riddle → decoded coordinates → trek → rescue. The phonograph/leaf mechanism is seeded early and pays off without feeling like a late rule change. Closure lands decisively with a reunion image that reconfigures the premise (distance taught to kneel). The cost is more lyrical than punishing, but it’s present (time, labor, Scraps’ limp, the leaf’s softening).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The scrapyard/wasteland is not backdrop; it supplies the phonograph, shapes the trek, and locates the brother in a buried subway car. Sensory specificity (scent‑syntax, metal, ozone, orchard smoke) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. Recurring objects (leaf, cylinder) function as micro‑settings that constrain action. The final environmental shift (wind smelling of orchard smoke) charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and sustained: find the brother/collapse distance. Escalation is steady—decoding to pursuit to excavation—though resistance is light and solutions tend to work on first try. Agency drives turns (using the leaf to alter the cylinder, choosing to set out at dawn). The visible prices are modest, keeping tension strong but not harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: distance vs. closeness, translation across senses, relics reanimating the living. The leaf’s “tinted revelations” evolve from memory to mechanism to communal repricing (the wind’s new scent). Subtext operates through image rather than statement; the brother’s final line elegantly closes the thematic loop. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person with a distinct olfactory signature is maintained without head‑hopping. Dialogue is spare yet loaded, advancing stakes and subtext. Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate with pressure. The voice balances mythic register and tactile grit convincingly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush and mostly precise; images do multiple jobs and momentum holds. A few metaphors skirt purple (“spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise”) but remain legible and voice‑true. No notable loops or scaffolding; syntax varies with scene needs. Minor excess prevents a higher band but does not cloud closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis is striking: a scent‑reading bloodhound decoding phonograph grooves with a waxed leaf in a post‑war scrapyard. Risks in image‑logic and cross‑sensory translation pay off and feel inevitable by the end. Turns arise from established motifs rather than late gimmicks. The vision reads singular and fully committed.</comment>
