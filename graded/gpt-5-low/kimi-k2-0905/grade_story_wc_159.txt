<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—preserving names—drives concrete, escalating choices, culminating in the renunciation of self. Interiority is embodied and specific (foxglove heart; glass-orchid petals), with genuine contradiction: love and regret alongside methodical duty. The final sacrifice is earned by prior micro-choices (memory-by-memory payments). No safety hedging; the cost is visible and irreversible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: guttering bulbs → extract lullaby → amplify → chandelier demands payments → total self-forfeit. Closure lands decisively on the page; the price is explicit and shapes tactics throughout. The drive lens reads Hybrid with a causal dominant at the end, held consistently. The falling tube/child coda reweights the premise without undercutting the paid cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opal library, chandelier, drawers, and museum are not postcard décor; they constrain and enable options and charge the ending image. Recurring objects (bamboo tube, glass-orchid petals, bulbs) function as micro-settings that shape choices. Sensory detail is purposeful, with atmosphere yoked to action (twilight urgency, audible light). World rules stay internally consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and tightens: save names or lose the marvels; each saved name costs a memory, culminating in self-erasure. Lira’s agency drives each turn (tooling the tube, paying memories, accepting final demand). The visible prices after each beat alter tactics and narrow options to a stark trade-off at the end. Tension scales coherently under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme arises through particulars: preservation’s cruelty, memory as currency, the ethics of caretaking. The foxglove regret and revenant-choir images reconfigure the premise at the end without didacticism. Ambiguity remains meaningful (legacy via the child’s note vs. Lira’s extinction). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: remembrance requires sacrifice, yet leaks back into the living.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature and controlled cadence; diction is consistent and character-bound. Patterned imagery is taught early and sustained without head-hopping or stance wobble. Modulation under pressure is deft, with rhythm tightening at payments and opening at the coda. A hairline risk of lushness remains but does not impede clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Figurative richness is heavy but coherent and varied, avoiding muddle or loops; syntax and paragraphing create a clean visual rhythm. A few metaphors cluster near peak beats, flirting with excess but not blurring causality. Opening and final lines are both charged and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a metaphysical archive where names-as-vibration are preserved by sacrificing memory, with fresh objects and mechanics. Turns feel inevitable from prior specifics (the chandelier’s tariff), and the coda avoids cliché by repurposing the cracked tube. Bold, coherent risk-taking heightens stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth undergirds the novelty.</comment>
