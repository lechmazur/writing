<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s desire to preserve names and her willingness to pay with memories culminate in an earned, costly self-erasure. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“heart, shaped like a foxglove”), with a credible tension between gentle procedure and aching regret. The Por memory grounds the sacrifice in personal specificity rather than abstraction. Minor limitation: interior contradiction is elegant but not deeply contested on the page before the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the guttering bulbs create a live clock, each payment escalates, and the chandelier’s rule cleanly governs tactics and cost. Closure lands on‑page with undeniable price when Lira sacrifices her self‑memory. Setups (tube, chandelier, museum) pay off causally without late rule changes. Orientation is immediate and sustained despite lyricism.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The opal library, chandelier, drawers, and museum are not postcard décor; they constrain choices (payment rule, object resources) and charge the final image. Recurring objects (bamboo tube, glass‑orchid petals) function as micro‑settings that mediate action. World rules are learned in motion and stay consistent. Texture is lush yet purposeful, matched to Lira’s vocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the names before total dark—tightens through the chandelier’s demand and the dwindling bulbs. Each surrendered memory is a clear price that narrows Lira’s options to the final irreversible trade. The cracked tube’s partial success and the chandelier’s escalating hunger create a clean deepening. Resolution is decisively driven by Lira’s agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The story interrogates preservation’s cruelty: saving communal memory by consuming the caretaker’s self, culminating in a resonant repricing when her name becomes music for the living. Motifs (names, bulbs, foxglove, tube) accrue meaning and reweight at the end without moralizing. The museum’s “deserted marvels” reflect the cost/benefit tension with credible ambiguity. The after‑image (child and note) extends theme without explanatory gloss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single, stable lyric POV with a confident, coherent idiom; diction and imagery reflect Lira’s sensibility and role. Rhythm modulates with pressure (ritual calm to sacrificial intensity) and maintains legibility. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext through image and action. Purposeful compression reads intentional, not evasive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are dense and multi‑function, with strong verbs and precise images; momentum rarely stalls. A few metaphoric stacks verge on purple, but the pattern is taught early and remains coherent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sequencing is clear. Slight lushness in the final third trims headroom but doesn’t blur closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: glass‑orchid caretaker, chandelier of names, memory‑for‑name exchange, and the cracked tube’s afterlife cohere into an original myth. Turns and objects are prefigured and transformed rather than introduced as ornaments. Bold risks in imagery and premise heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration (Lira as the last extinct feeling and a carried song) is fresh and inevitable.</comment>
