<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation and worldview are precise and embodied; her tactile reading of light and trauma-informed approach feel particular and earned. Micro-choices under time pressure (switching from patching to retraining the feedback loop) reveal values. Internal contradiction is subtle—calm under urgency—rather than overt, which slightly limits depth. Col applies light, relevant pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal throughline is clean: diagnosis → deeper damage → partial fix → new problem (feedback panic) → inventive retraining → launch. Orientation is immediate, and the live clock tightens the sequence. Closure lands on-page with the drone’s decisive launch; cost surfaces via time risk and the constraint of blindness shaping tactics. No contrivances or resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: drippers, boiler, kiln, and rain barrel all constrain or enable actions. The environment is used as instrument (boiler as metronome; water refraction as sensor) and charges the ending image. Specificity is disciplined and filtered through Lira’s sensory schema. World rules hold consistently.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (catch the Aurora) is clear from early and escalates with the discovery of battery swelling and the failed test pulse. The reversal from mechanical fix to psychological reconditioning is strong and agency-driven. The price is primarily time and risk rather than a deeper sacrifice, keeping the cost slightly soft. Tension operates across beats without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: translating fear into usable signal; feedback into direction. The rain-barrel retraining fuses trauma memory with practice, offering a resonant, non-didactic answer. Recurring images (spectra, magnetic calm) reweight at the close without moralizing. Subtext of care-as-craft under communal stakes lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet task-focused, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in touch and sound. Dialogue is minimal but functional and character-distinct. Distance and diction remain consistent under pressure. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is controlled and economical; metaphors cluster around light, magnetism, and water with coherence. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences carry multiple jobs without sludge. No scaffolding loops or strained figuratives; the final image is crisp. Technical terms are integrated and believable within the world.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—a blind artisan reading light through water to retrain a drone’s “fear”—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Occupational detail and thematic frame mesh without gimmickry. The rain-barrel method as emotional and technical bridge is ingenious. Risks in conceit and diction pay off cleanly.</comment>
