<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motive and skillset are distinct and embodied, with tactile methods and credible micro‑choices under pressure. The infirmary memory reframes the “jitter” as trauma translation, deepening her interiority. Internal contradiction is light—she stays remarkably composed—so the arc reads more as mastery than struggle. The apprentice dynamic adds texture but exerts minimal pressure on her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: damaged wing → deeper vein/battery issue → patch → feedback terror → retraining via water → launch. Orientation is precise from the first lines, and the internal logic of the repair world holds. Closure lands decisively with the drone’s reconfigured behavior and departure under the live clock. The on‑page cost is primarily time/risk rather than a sacrificed option, but it’s felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: drippers, boiler hush, mist, and the rain barrel all constrain tactics and enable the fix. The depot’s soundscape becomes a metronome, tying environment to action. The harbor clock and breeze charge the final image. World rules feel consistent and learnable through use rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (seeds to the village; ship’s imminent departure) and escalate when the “fixed” drone jitters, forcing a new tactic. The retraining sequence converts theme into action under the deadline. Cost is chiefly temporal and cognitive, not a foreclosed path, but pressure tightens credibly. Resolution is earned by her adaptive choice, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of translating fear into function and “decoding feedback into direction” are dramatized, not stated. Lira’s blindness and recovery mirror the drone’s relearning, giving the final arc a resonant repricing of terror as torque. Recurring images (light, spectra, water) evolve meaningfully. No moralizing undercuts the effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, tactile, and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in non‑visual cues. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, cleanly differentiating Lira’s calm command and Col’s uncertainty. Elevated diction fits the artisan’s mind and never breaks POV modesty. A few lush metaphors press the edge but remain coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, pressure, and character—and momentum rarely stalls. Figurative texture is rich yet controlled; no looped paraphrase or scaffolding intrudes. Occasional density (“magnetic calm,” “iron filings”) is earned by motif and does not blur causality. Mechanics and syntax remain clean with purposeful rhythm shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The refractive repairs and water‑taught retraining for a drone are genuinely fresh. The synthesis of tactile method, acoustic pacing, and trauma translation feels inevitable in hindsight. Stakes (medical seeds, maiden voyage clock) avoid trope bloat and stay intimate yet urgent. Risk‑taking is formal and thematic without obscuring clarity.</comment>
