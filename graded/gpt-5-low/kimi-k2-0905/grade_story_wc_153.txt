<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied: pockets of unsent letters, a guilt that “taught me cruelty could feel like freedom,” and the compulsion to speak in the “seam.” Contradictory impulses (flight vs. return) are dramatized, not labeled. The medium applies live pressure without stealing agency. The apology choice forecloses the path of silence with cost felt in the moths/letters release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual steps (shard → mirror → water corridor) causally open the seam. Closure lands on-page: “I’m sorry” seeds through time, with the cost marked by the healed cut and emptied pockets. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/drive). The final image reconfigures options without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and spirits are tactically and thematically active, not decorative; the environment hushes at the seam and the water closes “like skin” behind steps. The shard functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image (reinstalled rainspout). Sensory detail across salt, moonlight, condensation, and sound supports pressure. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is announced and tightens: finding and speaking within the “space before deciding.” The corridor opening is a clear deepening that narrows options to a single charged act. Cost is legible (emptying letters, a wound that needed healing, relinquishing the long-held silence). A small lack of on-page resistance keeps it just shy of maximal tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of apology, decision, and return surface through objects and actions rather than abstractions. Recurring images (shard, condensation, moonlight) reprice meaning at the end without moralizing. The “come back whole” motif bridges past/future via subtext. The ending lantern of “salt and song” offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice maintains controlled distance and rhythmic modulation. Diction is character-coherent, with tactile specificity and purposeful compression. Dialogue is minimal but charged (“Hold it toward the moon”), functioning as action. No head-hopping or stance leakage; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density imagery largely remains coherent and purposeful; lines often do two jobs. A few lush stretches risk purple but do not blur causality. Cadence varies with scene needs, and there’s no paraphrase loop or scaffold clutter. The final cadence is sharp and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—mangrove spirits, a gargoyle shard as conduit, condensation messages, and time’s “seam”—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and tone heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The reinstallation of the shard as a universal house rainspout is an inspired closure turn. Emotional truth grounds the conceit.</comment>
