<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marisol’s motives are clear and embodied—steal, plant, prune, and accept risk to alter collective memory. Sensory interiority is distinct (tasting glass, blood-fed sprout), though internal contradiction is light; she rarely doubts or wavers. Micro‑choices (timed planting, blood offering, pruning lullabies) reveal values without therapy‑speak. The cost is present but mostly conceptual; she evades direct confrontation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal spine under an accumulative/lyric mode: theft → timed planting → pruning aromas altering the city → transformative dawn → Ministry’s muted arrival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the greenhouse and the city’s palate are reweighted; officers leave with seeds. The ticking clock and environmental filter (“loudspeakers” softened by chlorophyll) anchor time and place. Cost is legible via risk, blood, and the decision to vanish rather than claim victory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly sensory and functionally constraining (cracked panes, rust flakes, lunar light lattice), shaping both tactics and the final image. Environmental details evolve with events (rust to copper bones; glass to leaves) and filter antagonistic pressure. Specifics are POV‑true for a chef (taste, scent, ash/dust mix). The setting charges the ending with earned transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seed the city with unauthorized memory—tightens through the live clock and the encroaching Ministry. Escalation is agency‑driven (planting to pruning to harvesting to distribution) with concrete prices (theft, blood, exposure). External opposition remains largely atmospheric until the end, slightly softening felt jeopardy. Still, the cadence shift at dawn and the Ministry’s arrival seal the pressure arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory as commons, beauty as an offshoot of decay, and cuisine as political instrument emerge through concrete acts (ash of cookbooks, “synaptic plasticity” aromas). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: officers depart altered, pockets seeded. Recurring images (rust, pruning, fruit) accrue meaning and pivot at closure. Ambiguity lingers productively around ethics and contagion of nostalgia.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third‑person closely held to Marisol’s sensorium; diction is culinary‑astral without drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure (clock breaths to dawn hush), and imagery remains coherent. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; the pattern is taught early and sustained. Compression avoids exposition while keeping legibility high.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors that do more than one job; lines propel rather than decorate. Occasional lushness flirts with excess but stays legible and voice‑true. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter, clean syntax, and precise verbs. Final images are sharp and unmuddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: culinary rebellion via neuro‑aroma in a corroded greenhouse under celestial timing feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Object ecology (seed/knife/ash) integrates with world logic and stakes. Risks in concept and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. The transformation beat (officers leaving with seeds) is a memorable, earned turn.</comment>
