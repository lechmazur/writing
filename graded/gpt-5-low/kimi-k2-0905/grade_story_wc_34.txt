<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive—articulating unspoken needs before thunder—drives clear micro-choices (kneeling to paint, resisting the echo, then releasing the petals). The echo externalizes her contradiction (preserve vs. release) and pressures a genuine shift. Embodied detail (metal taste, trembling hand) grounds emotion. Slightly told motivations (“Lyra’s motivation was simple”) keep this just shy of top-tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: painting → echo’s intervention → moths awaken → release of petals → communal broadcast. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she abandons preservation for communal signal, with the cost visible in the emptied plate and dissolved echo. Orientation is clean from the outset (courtyard above clouds; lightning/thunder clock). The causal linkage is lyrical but legible at each intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the courtyard’s balustrades become canvas/harpstrings; mist births the echo; the above-cloud altitude and ozone charge tactics and tone. Weather and space constrain the timing and the method, charging the final image of broadcast to the city and the child’s wall. Details are POV-filtered and sensorially rich without museum-touring. Superb specificity supports action rather than stalls it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (speak needs before thunder erases them) tightens under a real clock. The echo’s accusation deepens pressure and forces the turning choice to release the preserved petals—foreclosing her prior strategy. Thunder’s arrival reweights the graffiti into anthem, making the price and pay-off legible. Stakes are emotional and communal rather than mortal, but they escalate convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of converting loneliness into communal signal emerges through concrete actions (graffiti encoding, moths, broadcast) rather than sermon. The final image (child reading “I am lonely too”) reweights the premise with quiet social cost and hope. A couple of explanatory lines (“Lyra understood then…”) skim the edge of over-clarity. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical third-person close sustains a controlled, storm-charged diction and rhythm; brief dialogue is apt and subtextual. Perceptual signature (“between lightning and thunder,” “driftingly alert”) stays coherent under pressure. No head-hopping; the echo reads as a pressured facet rather than POV drift. Voice modulation at the climax supports the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid but controlled imagery; metaphors cohere to electricity, code, and flora. Minor purple edges appear but do not blur cause/effect, and there’s little to no scaffold or looped phrasing. Rhythm varies well; sentences push momentum toward closure. Final cadences land cleanly without syntactic clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive fusion of storm-physics, graffiti code, and emotional broadcast feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The moths ticking binary lullabies and the copper bolt plate as palette/shield are fresh and purposeful. Risks in lyric texture heighten stakes rather than distract. The conceptual turn (from preservation to release) is non-obvious and grounded in prior specifics.</comment>
