<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, felt motivation (“to understand the shape of home”) meets credible fear; the choice to let the feather write on her own body is an earned, high‑cost act. Interiority is specific (copper air, mirrored palms, humming stone) rather than label‑speak. The cracked mercury glass externalizes contradiction—self‑protection versus belonging. Minor: the old man applies little pressure beyond naming the want.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: each step (stone hum → descent → feather writing → cracking) tightens toward a ritual culmination with on‑page cost. Closure largely lands (mercury shell breaking, stone crumbling), but the final sentence is truncated (“unfurl like”), blurring cadence at the moment of release. Orientation is clean and maintained; cause/therefore links are solid. The price of shedding the shell is legible but the incomplete last beat undercuts impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore is vivid and functional: geography funnels her to the chamber; storm‑charged air and hidden thunder shape tone and stakes. Recurring objects (feather, stone) operate as micro‑settings constraining action. Spatial logic stays coherent while the store later reconfigures to mirror her history, charging the final movement. A 9‑band gate is missed only because the truncation dulls the closing image’s full charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to restore dangerous belonging—tightens into the decision to inscribe truth on her own skin. The cost is explicit: protective mercury cracks; substitutes shatter; the stone is spent. Escalation is protagonist‑driven and coherent under the accumulative lens. The external antagonist is minimal, but internal pressure suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of home as necessary rather than safe emerges through image (homes seeded, mountain‑as‑home for stories) and action (self‑inscription). However, the explicit line “Home is not where you are safe—it is where you are necessary” functions as a thesis in the finale, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the costed renunciation of the shell gives the insight weight. Ambiguity remains around future harms, which is effective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled POV with a distinct perceptual signature (mirrored touch, after‑images) and consistent distance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure as thunder grows and the ritual intensifies. Limited dialogue is purposeful and subtextual. Minor purple edges stay within voice logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong—dense, purposeful images that carry multiple jobs—and momentum is mostly smooth. Some phrases verge on ornamental, but clarity holds. The truncated final sentence is a material artifact that blunts the closure’s cadence. Otherwise, syntax and variation are well managed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Familiar mythic components (phoenix feather, labyrinthine library) are recombined with specificity (mercury‑glass skin, seeding places with belonging) to feel fresh. The “home as necessity” reframing is resonant. World logic aligns with character need rather than serving as a mere backdrop. Not wholly unprecedented, but executed with conviction.</comment>
