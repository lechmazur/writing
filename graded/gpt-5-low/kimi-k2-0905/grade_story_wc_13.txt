<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s goal is clear and felt, and her micro‑choices (cadence breaths, choosing the left spiral, surrendering future minutes) reveal priorities under pressure. The grief motive is embodied via concrete sensory afterimages rather than labels. The final renunciation is earned and costly. Occupation (natural history illustrator) colors perception but is less integral to her tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain under an accumulative/textural lens: cadence → reversed water → canal fork → aviary → payment → doorway → recovered syllable → restored timeline. Closure lands on the page with cost (future minutes surrendered) and reconfigures her options. Orientation is crisp from the first line, and the pattern of rules is taught and kept. No teleports or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop canals, giant’s nap, and iron aviary are vivid and integrally used; environment and recurring object (pendant) constrain and enable choices. Spatial choreography remains clear through bridges, forks, and the canal edge doorway. World rules (time pressure, breath cadences) are learned through action, not exposition. The final image is charged by setting returning to gravity‑obedient normal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve the place/echo to complete her mother’s last word) tightens into a concrete trade: uncage echoes by paying future time. The aviary scene forces a non‑reversible choice with an explicit price, escalating from exploration to sacrifice. The nap’s countdown adds external pressure culminating in the giant’s exhale. Resolution grows directly from her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Memory, debt, and the ethics of release are dramatized rather than stated, with the pendant’s shift (∞ → Möbius → sealed loop) reweighting meaning. The recovered syllable completes an interrupted cadence, linking form and theme without moralizing. The ending’s “debts are paid by choosing which memories to set free” resonates as earned insight. Ambiguity lingers around what future she forfeited, enriching the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—precision of breath counts, ledger metaphors, and time‑logic—without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure; sentences lengthen for hush and tighten at turns. Diction is consistent with the world’s register and Mira’s sensibility. Purposeful elision (how the cadence works) is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images multitask (steam as notation, wisteria as clock). The prose leans lush but remains legible at peak beats; metaphoric logic holds. No looped scaffolding or filter‑verb stacks; momentum is sustained. A hair of purple flourish risk, but it doesn’t blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: rooftop canals, a sleeping giant compressing time, and breath‑cadence timecraft tied to grief. The aviary of echoes and digit‑boats of melted numerals feel singular and necessary rather than ornamental. The final reconfiguration is both conceptual and emotional, inevitable in hindsight. Bold but controlled risk elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>
