<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, rooted motivation (keeping the orchard alive, answering the breach) drives concrete choices: opening the forbidden pouch, grafting with the gear, barring the elders, lifting the child to the graft. Interiority is vivid and specific (“deciduous vows,” “endearingly feisty” curses) with tactile objects revealing value hierarchy. Contradictory impulses (anger at the council vs. humility/apology owed to the orchard) coexist credibly. Stakes are mostly ethical and communal rather than perilous, keeping tension on a quiet register.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal strands; the ritual acts compound to a resonant repricing at the end. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the sequence from breach → ritual → public pressure → generational handoff cohere. Closure lands on-page via a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: refusal of contracts with visible cost and the ribbon’s absorption reweighting the covenant. Montage spans (week/years) are legible and feed the end image rather than reset stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is singular, tactile, and constraining: rafters, scaffolds, and the absent rose window shape action and risk. Tools and objects are integrated (copper gear, ampoule, ribbon) and charge the final image. Sensory range is rich (sap hiss, coconut-and-copper fragrance) without tourist catalog drift. World rules are learned through use and remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the orchard (and covenant) will be healed on terms of apology—tightens with the elders’ attempted re-entry and her refusal. The meaningful turn is the ritual commitment culminating in barring the doors; the price is social/economic and the endurance to sleep under the graft. Escalation stays coherent under the accumulative lens rather than dramatic reversal. If anything, danger remains moral/communal rather than visceral, keeping intensity gentler.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: fruit feeds on apology; vows as deciduous matter composting into roots. Recurring images (ribbon, figs/scrolls, copper gear) shift meaning toward generational covenant and earned persistence. The final repricing (fragrance drifting citywide) answers the central question without sermonizing, despite one near-maxim line earlier. Ambiguity remains humane (forgiveness on the orchard’s timeline, not the elders’).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and sensorially precise; metaphors feel native to the character’s lexicon. Distance remains steady and modulates cleanly at pressure points (ritual, refusal, handoff). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (“Promises are leaves...”). No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (fig/scrolls as history and instruction). Figurative language is lush but controlled; no mixed metaphors or template cadences dulling momentum. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; syntax varies to match beat intensity. A few aphoristic lines flirt with abstraction but are paid off by image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orchard-in-rafters, quartz-eyed mending, deciduous vows embodied as fig-scrolls—this synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in worldbuilding and ritual logic heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. The generational transfer and reweighted covenant resist tidy moral. Specific tactile choices (coconut oil scent, copper gear graft) anchor originality in lived detail.</comment>
