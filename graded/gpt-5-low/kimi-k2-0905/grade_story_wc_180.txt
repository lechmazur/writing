<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is crisp: heal the orchard after the council’s breach, guided by maternal teaching and love for her daughter. Interiority is embodied through tools and acts (gear as graft, ribbon as pendulum) rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (feisty defiance vs. tender caretaking) coexist credibly, culminating in barring the elders at a cost. Minor limitation: conflict is largely internal/ritual rather than sharply contested on page until the door-barring beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning accumulative: present-tense ritual beats accrue into a resonant reconfiguration where apology becomes sustenance, and the orchard heals at tangible cost. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/CR: she refuses amended contracts, binds wound with ribbon, and the final fragrance reweights the social covenant. Orientation is clean from the first line; cause-effect across items (gear, pollen, ribbon) is coherent. The “years later” epilogue enhances rather than disperses the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard is vivid and functional: rafters, rose window light, roots around corbels, scaffold height—all constrain tactics and imagery. Tools and micro‑setting charge choices (climbing, grafting at lightning scar, barring doors) and the final image (coconut-and-copper fragrance) is inseparable from place. Sensory balance is strong beyond visual (sap hiss, bees, fragrance). No postcard bloat; details are filtered by the mender’s craft and vows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive orchard/withhold forgiveness) is signaled early and tightens through discoveries (fig-scroll vows) and ritual risk. The key turn is an active refusal—barring elders despite amended contracts—showing cost and stance crystallization. Pressure is more devotional than combative, but escalation reads as deepening under the accumulative lens. A slightly sharper external push would heighten stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme integrates through action: apology as nourishment, vows as deciduous, generational repair through humble objects. Symbols earn their weight (ribbon → comet lash → rot → fragrance) without sermonizing; the line “Promises are leaves…” is character-grounded and recontextualizes the premise. The final repricing (broken contracts photosynthesize into hope) lingers with cost and possibility. Complexity remains, as forgiveness is deferred to the orchard rather than decreed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent lyric voice with tactile craft lexicon; third‑person close never leaks. Rhythm modulates well between lush description and precise action (“I persist, you persist”). Sparse dialogue is natural and subtextual, especially with the daughter’s question. No unmotivated register shifts or head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors; lines often do double duty (world and theme). Lushness approaches purple but stays coherent and scene-advancing; little to no scaffold or synonym churn. Syntax varies, and paragraphing supports momentum. Minor risk: stacked imagery could overwhelm in lesser hands, but here it remains legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Cathedral orchard + deciduous vows + tool‑rituals is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The fig-scrolls of vows and apology-as-fertilizer are strikingly original and thematically integrated. Risk-taking in tone and structure pays off with clear closure and emotional truth. Specificity (coconut oil, copper gear, quartz monocle) keeps the lyricism grounded.</comment>
