<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Myrrh’s ambition, craft‑specific perception, and familial custom yield concrete, character‑particular choices (testing the seed, timing the graft, figure‑eight stitching). The internal turn—ambition loosening into gratitude—reads earned by on‑page sensory pressure. Embodied detail (“breathing through her mouth,” “seed sighs”) grounds emotion without labels. The mother’s silent pass adds relational depth without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density and ritual actions build toward a quiet but clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with a tangible price—she relinquishes the urge to astonish and offers the journal to the “wind‑spirits.” Orientation is swift and firm (who/where/when clear), and set‑ups pay off (custom, seed, tide, indigo paper). Stakes are modest but coherent and resolved on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treetop village’s swaying bridges, haunted boughs, and tidal sap directly constrain tactics and charge the final image. Olfactory atmosphere is purposeful and POV‑shaped, not a tourist catalog. Tools and micro‑setting (spider‑silk, cambium, indigo paper) are used to act, not decorate. The environment’s “breathing” cadence informs timing and the earned stillness at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure mounts through timing and precision (waiting for the seed’s “breath,” knot choice, avoiding pollinators) and culminates in an internal trade‑off. The tightening is gentle but clear: execute the graft without disturbing tide or spirits versus performative ambition. The visible cost is renunciation rather than risk of failure; nonetheless, the escalation reads coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: “What is hidden feeds what is revealed,” the family custom, and “serenity within motion” reconfigure by the end as she chooses companionate stillness over display. Recurring images (indigo paper, birds, breath, tide) shift meaning at closure without moralizing. The offering of the journal enacts the theme instead of stating it. Ambiguity (spirits vs. sensitivities) enriches without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, sensuous voice with controlled lyricism; diction matches a meticulous herbalist’s sensorium. Psychic distance is steady, with purposeful modulations at key beats. No head‑hopping; elisions are taught and paid off. Rhythm supports pressure without drift into opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is lush but coherent and disciplined to action (“figure‑eight knot” marries image and function). Cadence varies; sentences propel rather than stall. Minor risk of purple is managed by precise verbs and tactile tasks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis—olfactory craft, wind‑spirit etiquette as scent, and a familial wrapping custom—feels singular and necessary. The tide‑as‑thought conceit and corpse flower praxis sharpen both world and arc. The final reweighting (ambition to offered hush) is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is measured and integrated, not gimmicky.</comment>
