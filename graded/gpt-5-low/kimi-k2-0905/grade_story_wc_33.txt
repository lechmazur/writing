<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (redressing broken promises) drives precise, risky choices, and “respectfully rebellious” is enacted rather than labeled. Interiority is concrete and object‑filtered (heron, storm bottle), though internal contradiction is more implied than dramatized. The endurance stance at the end (“emptiness itself can be a message”) reads as earned stasis. Minor ding: we don’t see a sharp on‑page emotional cost paid beyond risk and resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid but leaning accumulative/causal: the plan (data‑dot + storm decoy) tightens pressure into the drone sweep and escape, landing in a charged poise. Closure is present (message planted, diversion sprung, stance set), but the final incomplete sentence blurs the cadence and dampens cost. Orientation is crisp early; set‑ups (Sky Empress, neon EM) pay off. Cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping it below elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The arcade is tactically integral: neon “saints” mask signatures, the Sky Empress hides the storm, glass roof stages the rain’s strike. Sensory specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered; details evolve with events. The environment charges the ending image set (lights dying in solidarity), amplifying theme. Small restraint: world rules for drones/weather are suggestive, not granular, but fully serviceable at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (get the memory virus into the system under drone scrutiny) is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation reads via the uncorking, sensor pivot, Sal’s timing, and the first raindrop—a meaningful tightening. The price is risk and exposure rather than a concrete loss; the win comes too cleanly to crest higher. Still, agency drives every turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of institutional absence and enforced memory develops through concrete emblems (heron feather, blank ledgers, empty cart). The “linking absences” method elegantly marries form and meaning; the cabinets’ self‑extinguishing avoids sermonizing. The truncated last line undercuts the final resonant chord, though the prior image sequence still lands. Complexity holds without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled first‑person with tactile metaphors and clean focalization; diction fits the world and stance. Rhythm modulates well at pressure points (the uncorking beat and drone pivot). The final clipped sentence breaks the cadence and slightly jars the otherwise assured control. No head‑hopping or register drift beyond that glitch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is often electric: efficient images that carry plot and theme simultaneously (“ozone…sounded like someone saying ‘run’”). Minimal scaffolding; high information density. However, the final line truncation is a significant artifact touching closure, dulling the culminating image and momentum. Without that, this would sit in a high band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a mail drop heist powered by a “memory virus” of absences, neon saints as EM cover, Sky Empress as cache—imaginative and purposeful. Risks in image systems pay off in multiple beats. The execution feels singular rather than templated. Slight ceiling from the soft cost and the end glitch.</comment>
