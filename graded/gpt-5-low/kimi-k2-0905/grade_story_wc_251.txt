<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and method are clear and embodied, and her agency drives the night’s transformation. Interiority is specific (hearing the pieces’ unspoken wishes), though she faces little inner contradiction or visible cost. Ellis adds pressure symbolically rather than adversarially. The ending shows a credible endurance/renunciation of fixed play, but the emotional price is soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images (grotto, sapling, windows) build toward a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands on-page when she fuses the real sapling with the diorama—after which the town subtly reconfigures. Orientation is clean from the opening. Cost is conceptual/social more than dramatized resistance, keeping this just below exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the cobalt library breathes, shelves shift, and the misted town and curfew shape tactics and secrecy. The magnetic grotto acts as micro-setting and tool guiding choices and charging the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. Minor deduction only because environmental constraint is suggestive rather than hard-pressuring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes (liberating play from fixed rules) are legible and escalate through Mara’s organizing, the gathering, and the ritual insertion of the sapling. The tightening is a cadence shift rather than a hard trade-off; pressure coheres but meets little resistance. Agency is strong at the peak, and the reconfiguration is earned. The cost remains mostly conceptual, not biting on-page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: rebellion as rewilding of rules, “losing” teaching the game, and objects shifting meaning. Subtext lives in small confessions (cashier, janitor) that align with the central question without sermonizing. The final image reweights everything toward living systems over fixed systems. A single thesis-tinged line (“what if losing…”) is overt but supported by action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person with controlled distance; diction and rhythm are consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is sparse and natural, carrying subtext (“I knew you’d hear it”). Voice modulates with pressure, especially around the ritual. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet clear, with high information density and purposeful metaphor (“reference cards stirred like roosting birds”). Varied syntax and clean sequencing keep momentum. A few dense figurative clusters flirt with saturation but remain coherent. Final lines land crisply without scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—chess pedagogy, a magnetic diorama, civic window choreography, and communal “amplified quiet”—feels genuinely fresh. Risks serve the core emotional logic and closure. Turns arise from established motifs, not late rule changes. Slight holdback from 9+ due to soft on-page cost.</comment>
