<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation and worldview are precise and consistent, filtered through tactile choices (sampling, labeling, resisting naming the caterpillar). Interiority is embodied and profession-specific, avoiding stock emotion. The only limit is the modest on-page internal contradiction; the key renunciation (no anthropomorphism, no villains) is subtle rather than pressured by a sharp cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene, clean orientation, and an accumulative drive that lands in a conceptual repricing: decay as twin timelines, “No villains, only vectors.” Closure feels earned through repeated micro-choices and the spectrometer result; the cost is quiet (refusal of drama, acceptance of limits). Slight softness of overt cost keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid and lived-in; tools and weather integrate with action (dust film, creaking beam, silted window). Environmental specifics charge the final image (dust spiraling) and plausibly constrain action (laser alignment through smeared glass). Detail remains purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates via findings (redshifted peaks), the live caterpillar, and the neutron-sample decay’s counterpoint, tightening the stance rather than driving a crisis. The meaningful turn is thematic—embracing non-dramatic causality—more than tactical; cost is a principled renunciation. Clear, coherent stakes, if gently scaled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of gradual change and anti-melodrama emerges through particulars (diffraction scales, maintenance lapse, adaptive thickening) and culminates in the “two containers of decay.” A couple of thesis-forward lines (“No villains, only vectors”) risk mild didacticism, but the closing image reweights without tidy moralizing. Resonance lingers as conceptual, not sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident close third with a distinct scientific lexicon and precise metaphors; rhythm varies and remains controlled. Diction matches the POV’s expertise, and the voice modulates from clinical to humbled without leakage. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lucid and efficient despite rich imagery; sentences often carry dual loads (world + theme). Figurative language is fresh and internally coherent (scales as diffraction gratings; dust as spectral memory). Minimal redundancy; no artifact loops or cadence ruts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The neutron-star matter paralleled with butterfly dust is an inspired, non-obvious fusion; the premise feels singular and necessary. Risks are taken in a quiet, accumulative form that pays off with a charged poise ending. The ingenuity is conceptual rather than plot-twist driven, and it lands.</comment>
