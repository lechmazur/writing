<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority and motive (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) drive concrete choices: to play, to translate wind, to crush the flake, to take his hand. Contradictory impulses—fear from her father’s fall vs. reaching toward the hitchhiker—are dramatized at the climax. The emotional texture feels embodied via tool use (bow, violin, glass), not diagnostic labels. Minor limitation: lyricism sometimes buffers raw struggle, softening friction in mid‑beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: music→echo→doorway shadow→pixel reassembly→bridging. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she crushes the flake and steps onto the unfinished bridge; at dawn only the violin remains. Orientation is clean early (single POV at a mountain pullout at dusk), and the magical logic is taught and honored. The causal chain within the poetic rules reads coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pullout, wind, guardrail, gorge acoustics, and scaffold wrap language shape options and final imagery. Environment and objects (violin, flake) constrain tactics and literally open the doorway. The setting’s rules are learned through action (wind as code), not exposition. Final image (violin left at the pullout, guardrail doorway) is charged by place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (refusing “never”) and tightens as the performance alters the world. The peak choice—risking loss by crushing the flake and taking the rasterized hand—forecloses safety and the path of refusal. Father‑fall memory deepens pressure, intertwining internal and external stakes. Escalation is clear and protagonist‑driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of amnesty, possibility, grief, and craft-as-translation accrue through specific motifs (collodion pixels, tarp Morse, bridge‑song). The ending reweights prior images without moralizing: “never is just another pixel waiting to be moved.” Subtext around inheritance and risk persists in the father’s fall vs. new bridge. Resonance lingers with conceptual repricing rather than tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (listening to wind like a score) is sustained. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and focalization stays clean. No dialogue needed; the prose performs action. Slight risk of uniform elevation, but control mostly holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful images; lines often do multiple jobs. A few moments edge toward metaphor saturation, but coherence and momentum remain intact. Syntax varies and closures are clean; minimal scaffolding or loops. Final beats are crisp and un-muddled despite lyric compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: collodion “pixels,” tarp‑language, and bridge‑song cohere into a fresh magic system serving character and theme. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (music→doorway→conducted pixels→bridge rendered in silver halide). Risk‑taking elevates without obscuring clarity. The final repricing of “never” is both original and earned.</comment>
