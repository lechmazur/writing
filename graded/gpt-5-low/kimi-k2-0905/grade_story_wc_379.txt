<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and intensify: a curator who listens, tempted by investigation, ultimately choosing renunciation. Micro-choices (tea to convene witnesses, borescope attempt, staying overnight, refusing to open) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion and POV texture keep her particular (“dust between her ribs,” blanket in desert cold). The only slight softness is a touch of aphoristic closure that risks neatness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumor → heartbeat → vigil → communal listening → quiet absorption. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses opening the box, pays the conceptual cost of unanswered mystery, and reconfigures the courtyard via the offering cushion. Orientation is clean from the first sentence, and the mailbox constraint persists. The price—relinquishing answers for witness—lands on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vivid and particular, filtered through Mira’s curator sensibility. Environment and objects (iron gate, fountain, rusted mailbox, borescope) shape tactics and charge the final image. Sensory balance (soundscape especially) deepens atmosphere without postcard excess. While constraint is subtle, the fixed, public setting enables the communal resolution and her refusal to pry.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: solve vs. listen; the tightening is the heartbeat discovery leading to a refusal to open. Pressure coheres by cadence and density, culminating in the communal silent vigil that narrows options to witnessing. The cost is conceptual—abandoning solution for presence—and it’s legible. External antagonism is minimal, but under the chosen lens, escalation reads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: objects “return to stories,” listening as treatment, community as ear. Subtext operates via hush, heartbeat, and offerings—no didactic summary. The final image conceptually reprices knowledge vs. witness without sermonizing, though the closing aphorism brushes the edge. Resonance lingers beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyrical cadence matched to Mira’s sensibility. Diction is controlled and desert-inflected; no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythmic modulation at peak beats (“lub-dub…”; the courtyard hush) is deft and legible. Purposeful elision serves mystery without withholding known facts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; syntax varies and momentum carries. Figurative language is coherent and motif-bound (sand, wind, listening), avoiding mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffolding; line-level clarity never wavers, including at closure. Final lines re-energize motifs with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: a heartbeat mailbox, a listening doctor’s absence, and a curator who heals through witness. The quiet refusal to “solve” reads as bold and thematically integrated. Specificity (borescope, sesame bread, oud, velvet cushion) roots the lyricism. Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens rather than obscures clarity.</comment>
