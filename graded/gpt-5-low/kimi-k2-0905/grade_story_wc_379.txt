<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—curating the discarded and proving listening heals—is clear and embodied in concrete choices (tea, borescope, then renunciation). The dusk borescope probe versus dawn refusal captures a lived contradiction. Interiority is shown through tactile attention and restraint rather than labels. Cost is quiet but legible in the chosen endurance and public stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clean: rumors → investigation → vigil → communal listening → reweighted ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when she refuses to open the box and installs the empty cushion. Orientation is swift and stable; no causality breaks. The cost—forsaking solutionism for witness—appears on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard, fountain, dawn light, mint tea, and iron mailbox are vivid and purpose-driven. The mailbox constrains action (no key, “does not want to be opened”) and charges the final image. Sensory layering (lub-dub, sprinklers, sparrows) ties environment to resolution. Details are filtered through Mira’s curatorial gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to force a solution or surrender to listening. Escalation is a steady tightening: rumor density → pulse discovery → night vigil → communal silence, culminating in her renunciation. Stakes remain intimate but consequential, with a visible foreclosing of a path. No false antagonism or luck-driven resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: listening as healing, objects returning to stories, community as instrument. Recurring images (locket, heartbeat, sandstorm) reweight meaning at the end. The final aphoristic line risks neatness but feels earned by the scene’s specificity. Subtext operates through silence and offerings rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close with curatorial perceptual bias; diction and rhythm stay controlled. No head-hopping; distance modulates with pressure (vigil tightens, dawn breathes). Patterned elision (rumor accumulation) is taught and paid off. The occasional aphorism stays within the voice’s ambit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and efficient; images do double duty (heartbeat as locket, dust as rumor). Minimal scaffold or loops; rhythm varies well. A few lush metaphors flirt with purple but remain coherent and scene-true. Final cadence lands cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a heartbeat mailbox, a listening doctor’s absence, and a curator who leads by witness feels fresh. The community’s silent crescent and the empty-velvet-cushion gesture are memorable, non-obvious moves. Risks (quiet, renunciatory ending) heighten coherence rather than blur it. The premise would not read the same in another place or voice.</comment>
