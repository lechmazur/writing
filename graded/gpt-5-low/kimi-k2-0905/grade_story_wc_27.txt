<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation (“discover meaning… keep the sky open”) drives concrete micro‑choices: climb the crane, duet with the stones, ignite the pad, broadcast instead of escape. Interiority feels specific (hum in arches/sternum) with a credible contradiction (“awkwardly confident”). The final renunciation of simple escape for a riskier, communal act reads earned. Slight lack of on‑page fear or hesitation undercuts felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive coheres: lullaby → stone hum → resonant duet → consoles wake → ignition via opera glasses → launch/broadcast. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the closure is an on‑page decisive change. World rules are learned through action; the causal chain holds within the piece’s magical‑tech logic. The off‑stage antagonist pressure lowers immediate consequence, softening cost at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The repair bay’s ferrocrete, gantries, crane, roof hatch, ignition sigil, and swallows are vivid and tactically used; the opera glasses function as a tool shaped by light at twilight. Setting actively constrains choices (climb the crane, focus the suns) and charges the closing image (shuttle rising from a dead bay). Environmental logic stays consistent while deepening tone. Details remain POV‑filtered, never touristy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reignite sky/resistance—tightens through a single, meaningful deepening as song becomes instrument, then ignition and broadcast. Agency drives turns and the refusal to flee is clear. The price is implied (risking militia attention, forgoing private escape) but not sharply dramatized. Lack of a counter‑force in scene keeps escalation from peaking higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation through beauty and resonance emerges organically from acts (song, stones, swallows, consoles waking). The “lull as breath” reframes rebellion with a resonant conceptual turn. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“her motivation sharpened…”) but the final image earns the insight. Subtext of inheritance (mother’s lullaby) and stewardship threads cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, confident voice with a consistent perceptual signature (“cathedral of thunderous serenity,” “peppercorns flung into blue soup”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; syntax expands at the crescendo without losing clarity. Diction fits the character’s mythic‑tech sensibility. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; minimal scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is abundant but largely coherent and purposeful; the few extravagant metaphors still track. Momentum rises cleanly into the ignition/launch without sludge. Copy and mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: an ancient henge under a spaceport, opera glasses as ignition lens, lullaby as unjammable broadcast. The reweighting of a “lull” into a gathered breath is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in blending mythic ritual with SF tech pay off without gimmickry. Emotional truth supports the novelty.</comment>
