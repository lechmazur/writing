<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—“to cultivate foresight in action”—is crisp and governs her choices from data-gathering to the backward-writing pivot. Interiority is embodied through ritualistic observation (“The numbers felt like prayer”) and tactile engagement with wind and glass. The piece leans competence-forward, with limited contradictory impulse beyond reverent rigor versus grief, which slightly flattens tension. The cost registers in her renunciation/sacrifice of the patch and the burden of carrying the forecast.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive coheres: wind-signature mapping compresses toward the fused-glass locus, then the predictive-echo rule flips tactics (writing backward) to land closure. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing with on-page cost (surrendered patch, reversed gait, public posting that forecloses secrecy). Orientation is clean early; pattern is taught and paid off without causality cheats. The plaza’s reconfiguration and her exit path are earned by prior vectoring.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The port’s container labyrinth is vivid, tactile, and operative—wind corridors, leaning stacks, and the humming glass constrain movement and dictate method. Sensory range is broad (metallic creaks, sodium light, electric tang) and filtered through a professional’s noticing. World rules (stored/released sound) are learned via action, not dump. The setting directly charges the final image (spiral corridors, glowing fractures guiding future responders).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the event to prevent further harm—tightens from measurement to revelation to tactical reversal. The key escalation is Mara’s agency pivot: feeding intentions backward to let the wind “correct” her—trading conventional control for predictive listening. Cost is legible: she gives up the patch and commits to walking backward/marking paths, bearing responsibility for others’ safety. Stakes stay coherent; one deepening turn suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of memory, echo, and ethical foresight arise from particulars (wind signatures, the plaza hum, the glass palimpsest) rather than thesis. The final cadence reweights prior images: a city must “hear itself before it screamed,” aligning method and meaning. The bulletin-board line edges toward aphorism but is integrated as operational guidance rather than sermon. Ambiguity lingers productively around the port’s agency and the price of listening to the future.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice achieves “hazy precision” with consistent, character-shaped diction; syntax tightens at pressure points without losing clarity. POV boundaries hold; the recorder’s predictive echo is dramatized rather than explained. Rhythm and imagery feel controlled and specific to Mara’s perceptual signature. No head-hopping or register leaks undermine the stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is compressed and purposeful; figurative language is apt and coherent (“fossilized lung,” “a sub-audible note that vibrated in her teeth”). Little to no scaffold or synonym loops; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, pressure). Variations in sentence length modulate momentum effectively. The prose keeps clarity even at peak lyric moments (the plaza, the reversal).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—investigative method as wind-instrument listening, stored sound as predictive echo, writing backward to court the future’s correction—is striking and organic. The flight patch’s transformation and the glass palimpsest feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking serves stakes rather than gimmickry. The piece’s conceptual integrity holds without resorting to template twists.</comment>
