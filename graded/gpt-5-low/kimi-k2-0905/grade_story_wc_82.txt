<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and embodied through craft; the maker’s profession and habits ground grief into tactile choices (stealing a leaf, choosing the southern stair, spending the moonstone). Contradictory impulses—hoarding the daughter’s last dream vs transforming and releasing it—act on the page. The final renunciation (lighting with her last spark) feels earned and costly. Minor note: interior complexity could sharpen once more at the peak fold.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; the ritual builds to a visible cost as the moonstone is consumed and engines go dark. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she trades the stored dream for cranes and a final letting-smoke-go image; before/after is legible (“hands smelled only of tea”). Orientation is clear by the opening moves. Causal links within the lyric logic consistently pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, rule-consistent, and instrumentally used: levitating stones and the paradox stair constrain travel and time; tea leaves fuel and the garden receives the cranes; the basilica’s engines and moonstone state changes matter. Sensory detail is purposeful across senses (iron, bergamot, bandages), and the final image is charged by environment. World rules are learned in action, not dumped. Spatial choreography remains clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes sharpen as the ritual proceeds: each fold spends irrecoverable material (the daughter’s dream) and narrows options; the engines’ “quota of sorrow” underscores cost. The key tightening is the decision to turn all content into cranes and then burn her own last spark. Internal and external pressures braid without needing an antagonist. A small on-page hitch in explicit jeopardy is offset by the clear price paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief through craft integrates with every object and action; subtext emerges via work, trade, and renunciation rather than statement. Recurring images (lanterns, ribs/galaxy, cranes, smoke) reweight at the end into a non-literal answer: goodbye as portable light and release. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality; the cost is felt. Ambiguity remains purposeful (what is kept after letting go).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in a lantern-maker’s sensibility; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. No head-hopping; stance remains stable; purposeful elision is taught and paid off. Syntax varies with momentum, and images align to the POV’s lexicon. Confidence without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet precise; metaphors cohere to light, glass, breath, and tea with minimal drift. Information density is high and propulsive; very little scaffold or synonym looping. A hair from purple in a few lines, but clarity and cadence control prevent muddle. The final sentence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: tea garden of sleep, oneiric engines, lantern craft, and origami cranes interlock with character and stakes. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight; no gimmickry. Bold commitment to an accumulative ritual structure heightens meaning and pays off with a singular image. Emotional specificity keeps the strangeness human.</comment>
