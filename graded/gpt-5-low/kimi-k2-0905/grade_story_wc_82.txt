<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Her motive—to transmute her daughter’s last dream into cranes—drives every choice, with concrete micro-actions (choosing the southern stair, pocketing a leaf, breathing in the dream) revealing craft and grief in tension. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft details and sensory memory rather than labels. The Earned Stasis at the end (smoke leaving; hands smelling only of tea) reads as a costly renunciation, not a neat cure. Slightly limited contradiction on the page, but the push-pull between holding and letting go is present in the ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterned progression from approach → descent/ascension → ritual → release → return. Closure lands cleanly with cost: the moonstone crumbles, engines darken, her last spark is spent, and the cranes become lanterns for others; this reconfigures options in a felt way. Orientation is clear early, and the basilica/tea garden rules are consistent. The final image serves a Resonant Reconfiguration with a tangible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, specific, and tool-like: levitating stones, paradox stairs, chime-leaves, and oneiric engines constrain travel and tactics (stealing a leaf for fuel, the paradoxical stair shaping her route and cost). Sensory detail spans smell, taste, sound, and touch, filtered through a lantern maker’s priorities. The environment charges the final image (cranes glowing in tea bushes; smoke that “simply leaves”). World rules feel internally consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform grief—tightens through the ritual, with a meaningful price (moonstone destroyed, dream used up, her last spark spent). Pressure escalates texturally via density of imagery and the flock’s multiplication, culminating in release and loss. No antagonist, but internal/external pressures interweave well. The paradox stair adds a secondary cost that deepens rather than distracts.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-craft and luminous burden transmuted into communal light emerges organically from particulars. Motifs (lamps, chimneys, leaves, cranes) reweight at the end without moralizing, offering a charged refusal rather than cure. The final act—smoke that neither ascends nor descends—answers the central question with quiet, earned ambiguity. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through material, practiced actions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and intimately filtered through a maker’s lexicon; diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional. The voice sustains lyric density without losing clarity or over-explaining. Patterned elision is taught and paid off, with no head-hopping. Cadence modulates effectively at ritual and release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet disciplined; images do double work (tea leaves as dream-fuel; cranes as lamps). Minimal scaffolding, strong verbs, and varied sentence rhythm maintain momentum. A high density of figurative language skirts purple but stays coherent and purposeful. No loops or metaphor muddle impact closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: dream-recording basilica, paradox stairs, and lantern craft fuse into a singular ritual logic anchored in human grief. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight—each world choice supports the transformation and release. Risky, lyrical world-building heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The crane-lanterns as communal goodbye is memorably non-obvious.</comment>
