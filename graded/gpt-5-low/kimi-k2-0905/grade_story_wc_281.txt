<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation (restore privacy for the pill-affected) is clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with the geode feels character-specific. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from skepticism to hope without a real on-page struggle or trade-off. Most turns are competence-forward rather than pressure-driven, limiting emotional texture. The neighbor scene hints at stakes but doesn’t force a difficult choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Drive lens reads primarily causal: shock → activation → experimentation → breakthrough → application to community → charged final image. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the ending provides a resonant reconfiguration (belief + sanctuary) even if the price is largely off-page. The montage compression between discovery and mass impact reduces felt cost. Still, the closure is legible and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The light painting studio and muscovite sliver are vividly rendered and function as tools that shape choices (mirrors, projectors, frequencies). The environment plausibly enables the discovery and later becomes a sanctuary, charging the final image. Sensory detail tilts visual but is purposeful (refracting projections, vibrating mica). A more tactile constraint or hazard would push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (mental privacy in a chaotic world), but escalation is smooth and largely unopposed. The meaningful tightening arrives at dawn with the resonance discovery, yet few options close and almost no setbacks or trade-offs appear. The Mrs. Chen test provides a small proof rather than a pressure spike. Resolution leans on summary of success rather than an earned, risky crossing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Privacy versus connection, science braided with intuition, and communal healing emerge naturally from the images. Some lines tip into telling (“Her motivation crystallized,” “a belief that even technological disasters could be healed”), slightly flattening subtext. The geode as map/key is a strong thematic vehicle that reweights the final moment. The piece resists a tidy moral but remains concept-forward more than character-contested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and diction consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“fractally precise,” “willowglass hope”) that suits the concept. Occasional abstraction edges toward purple but remains legible and character-filtered. Dialogue is minimal yet functional; narration carries the weight effectively. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lines are generally clear with efficient progression; technical terms are controlled and vivid when used. Repetitions (“fractally precise,” explanatory scaffolds like “Her motivation crystallized”) add mild redundancy and telliness. Figurative language is coherent, not overmixed, though density occasionally blunts urgency. No mechanical errors, and the final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—muscovite geode as telepathic lens, light painting as thought-mapping, post-recall privacy tech—is fresh and memorable. The step from art studio to sanctuary feels organic to this premise. Risk lies in the science-mysticism blend, which the piece commits to without hedging. A harder on-page price or reversal would elevate ingenuity into the top band.</comment>
