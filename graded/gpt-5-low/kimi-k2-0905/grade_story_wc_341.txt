<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—preserving memory and proving her mother right—drives concrete choices (threading the filament, releasing kites, etching the lens, finally stepping out). Interiority is specific and embodied (“tastes like burnt coffee and airport goodbyes”). Contradiction is credible: she fears forgetting more than falling, which sharpens the final renunciation. Minor note: internal conflict could tighten once more at the brink to heighten cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: cable fraying and successive recordings escalate toward a Charged Poise ending. Closure lands with cost on the page as she memorializes, then steps into open space while the telescope becomes the “falling star.” Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when established by the gondola and lineage). Setups (spool, theory, kites) pay off without strain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sky gondola, cable, and telescope are tactile, specific, and constrain tactics (zero-g dust, floor panel, fraying wire). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through vocation and grief. The environment charges the final image (untethered cradle; telescope falling). World rules feel consistent within the lyrical frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory vs forgetting) is clear and tightens as the cable unspools and the readings accelerate. The reversal (final wire pops) forces a priced act: she releases the archive and chooses to step out. Agency drives resolution; coincidence (wire snaps) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Stakes are intimate yet scaled by the sky-wide premise, with no soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory as weather and grief as data emerges through action, not lecture, culminating in a conceptual repricing where “empty spaces remember” feels earned. The “Tell them…” litany functions as subtextual prayer and archival act, not moral. Lineage (grandmother, mother, Mara) concretizes legacy and cost. The last image reweights prior motifs without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Singular, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature shaped by meteorological and aviation lexicon. POV remains steady and intimate; quoted lines to the telescope are in-scene and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with pressure (cable pops, lurch, final flare). Diction stays coherent to the piece’s aesthetic without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do more than one job. Metaphor load is rich but largely coherent (“dusty starlight” recurs and pays off). Minimal redundancy; momentum doesn’t stall despite lyricism. A few stacked figuratives flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—meteorology of emotion, archival filament, memory kites in a failing sky gondola—is fresh and integrated. Risks (lyric science, invented device/ontology) heighten stakes and land cleanly at closure. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (lineage → proof → release → step). The final reweighting (telescope as falling star) is striking and memorable.</comment>
