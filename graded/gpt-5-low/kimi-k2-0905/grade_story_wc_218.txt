<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mateo’s motive (six months to live → finish a multispecies “remodel”) is clear and embodied through meticulous actions and diary entries. His gently systematic nature constrains choices (mapping circuits, replacing insulation, adding alternate paths). The final act—closing the circuit through his own body—reads as a credible, values‑driven cost. Slight limitation: interior contradiction is muted; serenity dominates over felt ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught and held: copper network expands, animals join, and the on‑page closure is the bodily circuit that lights the temple. Causality is clean within the magical‑real rules set by the grown architecture. Cost is legible in the self‑soldering act and the horizon “dissolving.” Orientation is established early and never slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard of living stone pillars is vivid, tactile, and rule‑bound (strangler figs reshaping basalt). Setting constrains tactics (wires along branches/pillars; animals complete circuits) and charges the final image (lantern visible to ships). Sensory detail is specific and filtered through Mateo’s botanical eye without tourist listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete the bridge before death) tightens via expanding circuitry and the animals’ participatory risks (rat chews insulation; cat interrupts a node). The decisive deepening is Mateo integrating himself into the system, paying a plausible price. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial but remains coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of de‑centering the human architect and fostering interspecies parliament accrue through concrete events. The diary line “Architecture is only complete when it forgets the architect” risks over‑explicitness but is voiced in character and earned by the action. The handoff to the new caretaker reweights legacy and collaboration without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to Mateo sustains a distinct perceptual signature (botanical lexicon, patient cadence). Rhythm modulates with pressure toward the luminous finale without head‑hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with the established voice and world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, image‑rich, and purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs (world rule, action, theme). No paraphrase loops or muddled metaphors; cadence varies to propel accumulation. The closure image is crisp and earned, free of scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Grown architecture + bioelectric orchestration via copper is a fresh synthesis executed with integrity. The animal‑played instrument conceit feels inevitable in hindsight and culminates in a bold, luminous act. Risk‑taking enhances stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
