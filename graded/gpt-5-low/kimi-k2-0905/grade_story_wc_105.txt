<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear and particular—imprint the sound of trust breaking—and her choices (feeding the forge, pressing her ear to iron, pocketing the shard) align under mounting pressure. Her interiority is embodied and character‑specific (“a gap she had preserved by collecting absences”), and the keeper adds direct pressure. The revelation of her complicity provides credible contradiction and a felt cost. Minor note: the turn is insight‑led rather than contested by a live external counterforce.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clean anchors and a coherent accumulative/causal lens that tightens through the forge sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she sacrifices the preserved absence and redefines her work’s aim; the cost is on the page. Setups (device, absences, aurora/forge) pay off without stray threads. The final image reweights the premise while honoring prior constraints.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ring, and forge are vivid, sensorial, and integrated into action; details filter through Mara’s auditory‑synesthetic priorities. Environment constrains and charges choices (she must use the forge; trees feed on memory and react to her wound), and the device functions as a micro‑setting tool. World rules are consistent and learned through interaction. The final image is charged by place (aurora fading, buds releasing “forgiveness”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and escalates as she moves from hunting a sound to sacrificing her talisman and confronting complicity. The keeper’s demand forces a trade‑off; the forge encounter deepens pressure and knowledge. Agency drives the result and forecloses a prior path (hoarding absences). Stakes remain intimate but viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of absence, betrayal, memory, and the ethics of listening emerge from particulars (absences as dew, roots feeding on stories) and culminate in a non‑literal answer: tune devices to reveal the hush where trust trembles. Subtext hums through image (trees tasting wounds, petals chiming) and resists platitude. One sentence edges toward didactic (“collecting absences had never been about fixing the past”), slightly on‑the‑nose but still earned by scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical, synesthetic third‑person close holds steady; diction and rhythm suit Mara’s sensorium. Brief dialogue is purposeful and subtextual. Distance control is tight with purposeful modulation at peaks (“sound like glass cracking under weight of snow”). No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent figurative language; most lines do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; rhythm varies with pressure. A few stacked metaphors approach lushness but remain legible and purposeful. The closure beat is crisp and unsmudged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis—synesthetic acoustics, a forge that burns absences, trees drinking memory—feels inevitable in hindsight under the hearing‑aid premise. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established logic and personal choice. Memorable images and a singular artistic stance lift it into publish‑now territory.</comment>
