<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is precise and embodied—find and capture the sound of trust breaking—and her choices (feeding the forge, pressing her ear to iron) align under mounting pressure. The keeper applies situational pressure without stealing agency. The complicity reveal supplies genuine inner contradiction and cost, though simultaneous push–pull earlier is subtle rather than foregrounded. The final renunciation/reorientation of her craft reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory translation tightens toward the forge-etch climax. Closure lands on-page via a resonant reconfiguration: she sacrifices the preserved absence, confronts complicity, and reframes her invention’s aim with cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why) and no causality gaps appear. The obsidian imprint and plan to retune the aid give a tangible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The environment is vividly specific and functional: shipwreck ring, lifeboat-rooted trees, and the aurora-forge constrain tactics and enable the ritual. Setting logic (orchard drinking memory) escalates and charges the climax and final image. Micro-setting objects—the aid, forge, obsidian—operate as tools that contour choice. The last sensory “forgiveness” note is inseparable from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates through decisive acts: entering, offering the costly absence, enduring the cello/heat to capture the waveform. The price is concrete (relinquishing the preserved gap) and internal (own complicity). Tension deepens rather than reverses, fitting the lens. Resolution is driven by her agency and forecloses a prior path (salvific fixation on the past) in favor of a riskier future stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: absence as shaped silence, memory as nutrient and wound, forgiveness as a new frequency. Subtext is mostly image-driven (trees drinking stories, tongs of quiet), and the closing reframing of purpose resonates. A couple of sentences verge on overt thesis (“collecting absences had never been about fixing the past”), slightly reducing mystery. Still, the final cadence reweights prior images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with consistent sensory translation defines the POV. Diction fits a designer attuned to sound/color without register drift; the lone line of dialogue is lean and pressurizing. Psychic distance is stable, and rhythm modulates at peak beats. Minor explicitness in thematic lines doesn’t destabilize the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence music is strong with high information density; images generally cohere and propel. Figurative texture is rich but largely controlled, with minimal redundancy or scaffold. A few lines tip toward explanatory abstraction, but not enough to stall momentum or blur the closure image. Mechanics are clean and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hearing colors, collecting absences, an orchard rooted in lifeboats, and a forge that sings—these synthesize into a singular logic rather than a collage of quirks. The imprinting onto obsidian and the reoriented invention feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and metaphor heighten stakes and meaning without confusion. The vision feels authentically its own.</comment>
