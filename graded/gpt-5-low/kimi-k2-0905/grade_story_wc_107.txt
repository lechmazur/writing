<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid: fleeing storms yet courting heat, craving safety yet leaving the sanctuary behind. Embodied interiority (the funeral she never attended; the tactile work of checking for “bloodless edges”) grounds her arc. Micro‑choices (repurposing tape, burning the chair, using the bookmark as spine) reveal values under pressure. Slightly low external friction keeps the crucible mostly internal, but it remains credible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative design coheres cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration: she decides to leave the dome, reweighting her flight into stewardship. Orientation is immediate and steady; each step (fuel → fire → construction → placement) links causally. Cost is legible on the page: abandoning her plan and accepting the risk of leaving her work behind. The lens holds through to the closing image with a felt before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The weather station’s thaw actively shapes tactics (scavenged chair, tape, fallen cornice) and inflects choice. Sensory detail is precise and filtered through craft and grief (metallic melt, cardamom ghost). The setting charges the final image of the dome on the console, redefined space now keeping vigil. World rules are consistent, and environment constrains and enables action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure builds via accumulative intensification: securing fuel, guarding against cuts, the building’s shudder, and finally deciding to leave the creation. Stakes are focused on whether she can construct a “safe zone” and at what personal cost. The decisive turn—abandoning possession—narrows options and carries an emotional price. Lack of an external antagonist keeps the curve quieter, but tension remains coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: repurposing as redemption, inquiry needing protection, thaw as grief’s recalibration. Recurring images (bookmark, tape, melt, narration) accrue meaning and reweight at the end. The line “safe zones belong wherever they are needed” risks slight directness but is earned by the scene’s particulars. The final invitation (“Enter, wonder, argue, forgive”) resonates without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular, consistent lyrical voice with a distinctive habit of dramatizing mundane acts; the quoted self‑narration feels character‑true and functional. Rhythm modulates with pressure, from playful grandiosity to softer candor. POV distance remains stable and plausible, with no head‑hopping or register drift. Compression supports momentum without obscuring sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images are fresh, syntax varied, and sentences carry multiple jobs. Figurative density is high but coherent to the glassblower’s sensibility; minimal redundancy and no loop scaffolding. A few phrases brush lyric excess, yet clarity and propulsion hold, including at closure. The final lines land cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Glassblowing as grief‑engineering within a thawing weather station feels singular and memorable. The bookmark as spine and magnetic tape as tensile memory are inventive and charged. The risk of a quiet, internal climax pays off through concrete craft actions tied to a conceptual repricing. Fresh synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
