<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (fleeing grief, building “safe zones for inquiry”) are concrete and consistently drive micro-choices (harvesting materials, inspecting edges, repurposing tape). Interiority is embodied and particular—the playful self-narration both steadies and reveals her. The final renunciation (leaving the dome) is earned by the accumulative thaw and her values; the felt cost is giving away the first sanctuary. Slightly limited contradiction under pressure; the struggle is mostly internal but credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build from search and set-up to craft and renunciation lands cleanly in a Charged Poise/RR closure. Orientation is immediate (abandoned weather station, spring thaw) and causally coherent: resource gathering → making → deciding to leave it. The price—relinquishing the artifact and the fleeing stance—appears on the page. The drive lens holds; no stray threads undercut the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The weather station is tactile and instrumental: chair for fuel, thermometer for imagery and salvage, reels for reinforcement, the console as plinth. Thaw and environmental instability (cornice crash) shape tempo and confidence, not just mood. The bookmark-as-object and the dome-as-tool charge the final tableau. Sensory balance (metal, steam, cardamom) feels lived and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure accrues texturally: need for fuel, safety checks, outside shudder, and the act of crafting funnel toward the decision to leave the dome behind. The dominant stake (can she establish a truly safe inquiry space without fleeing?) tightens as making forces a choice of where it belongs. The cost is legible though quiet; escalation is internal rather than confrontational but still narrows options. One strong cadence shift—the softened narration before the final move—marks the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Repurposing and thaw resonate through concrete acts (burning forecasts, tape as tensile memory, bookmark as spine) and culminate in a reweighted premise: safe zones belong where needed. Thematic afterglow lingers without moralizing; her narrated lines operate as character-driven subtext. The closing image reinterprets earlier motifs (map, dome, lighthouse) with emotional consequence. A single assertive line (“proving knowledge is never useless”) is voice-true and doesn’t tip into sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The close third carries a distinct perceptual signature—lilted, tactile, with playful declaratives that belong to Mara. Rhythm modulates from incantatory play to softened intimacy at the end. No head-hopping or stance drift; diction aligns with her craft and temperament. The self-narration device is integrated and precise rather than gimmicky.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush but controlled; images are coherent and multi-tasking (mercury dreams, cardamom steam) with minimal redundancy. Sentence rhythm varies and momentum doesn’t stall. A few high-lyric phrases flirt with purple but remain legible and purposeful. The final line is crisp and earned without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Glassblowing in a thawing weather station, using magnetic tape and a found bookmark to build a sanctuary, is fresh and integrated. The playful self-narration as emotional tool feels original and necessary. The reconfiguration—leaving the dome as a “lighthouse” for future wanderers—lands as a non-obvious yet inevitable choice. Risks in tone and method heighten coherence rather than distract.</comment>
