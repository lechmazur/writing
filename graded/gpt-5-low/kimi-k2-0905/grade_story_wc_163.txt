<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (scientific mapping) and evolves credibly into ritual partnership and renunciation (“knowing data would desecrate the moment”). Micro-choices under pressure—pocketing the feather, striking the match, exhaling into the moon-pipe, tearing out the atlas page—reveal values shifting from measurement to belonging. The conflict between protocol (ascent clock, data) and ceremony lands with felt cost. Interiority is embodied and specific without diagnostic labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image-driven action tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page via earned stasis/CR: she sacrifices data and the atlas page, internalizes the city’s rhythm, inherits plumage, and surfaces with a vow. The time constraint and auto-ascent provide persistent pressure; cost is legible in the final acts. Orientation is clean from the outset; no causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The facility’s concrete features (moon-pipes, thermocline-powered projectors, flooded corridors) constrain choices and power the ritual. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, with specific mechanisms shaping action (copepods, silver bubbles, salt-eaten catwalk). The setting charges the final image (ascent, paper bird/feather offering) and coheres with the protagonist’s occupational gaze. World rules are consistent and learned through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes—complete the rite before the sub surfaces or be left to the drowned city—are clear and tighten through ritual steps. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she engages the hologram, ignites the feather, opens the valve, exhale catalyzes a city-wide illumination, then chooses renunciation. The price (lost data, relinquished atlas page, risk of being left) is felt. While the conflict is quiet, the cadence shift at dawn provides a decisive intensification.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of belonging vs measurement emerges organically from particulars (telemetry repurposed as ceremony; “To captivate the sky, first captivate the ground…”). The final images reweight prior material without moralizing, offering a nuanced answer: belonging as reciprocal recognition across depth. The burning feathers/copepods/atlas page form a coherent symbolic system with emotional charge. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice filters the world through a professional, wonder-leaning gaze. Distance control is steady; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (ritual beats tighten, ascent breathes). Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying thematic subtext. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and high-density without losing clarity; images do double duty for mood and causality. Figurative language is controlled and consistent with the world’s logic (thermocline power, inverted rainfall, copepod fireflies). Minor lushness could be trimmed, but momentum holds and the closure image is sharp. No loops or scaffold artifacts evident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—landscape astrology, drowned research ritual, thermocline ghosts, moon-pipes, copepod constellations—is striking and cohesive. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight due to seeded objects and rules (feather, valve, atlas). Risks in premise and diction heighten meaning rather than distract. The final repricing (telemetry → ceremony) reads both fresh and earned.</comment>
