<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (scientific mapping) and deepens into ritual/reciprocity, with embodied choices: she withholds data, risks time, and performs the rite. Contradictory impulses (record vs. revere; leave vs. stay) are dramatized, not told. The final renunciations (not recording; tearing out the atlas page) feel earned by preceding beats. Minor note: her fear of missing the sub could press her more directly in one line for added bite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discoveries accrete (feather → echo → chalk constellations → exhale ritual) to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Cost is on the page via renunciation (no data, atlas page torn) under a live time constraint; the final promise reweights the premise. Orientation is clean from the start, and set‑ups (moon‑pipes, thermocline power, feather) pay off. The closure image (paper bird igniting as last burnt feather) lands with conceptual price and earned cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The facility’s specifics (unflooded corridor, thermocline‑fed holograms, moon‑pipes) constrain tactics and supply ritual mechanics. Sensory detail is selective yet lush (cedar/ozone, green emergency light), filtered through her profession. Environment charges the ending (autosurface clock; paper bird extinguished into the city’s care). World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the rite before sunrise/auto‑ascent—tightens once and guides choices (climb, exhale, forgo data, board just in time). Escalation is protagonist‑driven through ritual acts that deepen meaning rather than reversals. The visible price is conceptual (renunciation, inheritance) more than peril, but it’s legible and charged. A single sharper pinch from the ticking clock could heighten tension further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of belonging as reciprocal recognition emerges through concrete rites, not assertion. Recurring images (feathers, breath, constellations, bubbles) shift meaning at the end, revaluing science as ceremony. The final promise reframes “captivate” ethically without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively (what the city wants; the cost of remembering vs. recording).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with stable close third; diction fits the character’s perceptual bias (astral, tidal metaphors anchored in lab realities). Brief dialogue is textured (“spoke in pulses”), serving subtext and plot. Rhythm modulates with pressure, maintaining clarity. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (moon‑pipes as world mechanic and thematic conduit). Figurative language is rich but coherent; no muddled metaphors or loops. Syntax varies for propulsion and breath; no scaffold clutter. The closing sentence reprises and recharges motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Underwater orrery‑city + thermocline‑fed ghost + avian ceremony is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable by the end. Risks (ritualized science; feather ignition rites; copepod fireflies) heighten stakes without gimmickry. Turns are grounded in earlier particulars, not late rule changes. Emotional truth (renunciation vs. recording) anchors the novelty.</comment>
