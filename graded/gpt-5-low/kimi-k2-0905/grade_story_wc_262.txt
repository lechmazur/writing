<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear and consistently pursued, and her agency drives the key turns (choosing psychometry; scratching lyrics onto the film). Interiority is vivid and embodied through cinema‑specific perception. The change—moving from seeking to releasing—is credible and earned. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is muted; the path feels relatively smooth emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene causal chain is clean: psychometry → vision → projector animates → Mara inscribes release → retrieval and reading of the letter → transformation. Closure lands on the page with cost (burned envelope, relinquishment) and an RR/CR final image. Orientation is firm by the first paragraph and the accumulative pattern is taught and held. No major causality gaps or teleports.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Orion Palace and its booth are tactile and determinative: the projector, film canister, velvet, and storm all constrain and enable choices. Recurring objects (film strip, crystal sphere, cigarette case) charge the final image. Sensory specificity is high without feeling like a museum tour. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (recovering the lost lyrics/locating stored love) are signaled early and deepen as the film activates and Mara must add her own words. The key tightening is her decision to scratch new lyrics—an action that forecloses passive longing. Cost is primarily emotional but legible on the page. Pressure could be sharpened with one concrete risk or resistance beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of stored/unused love, projection, and release cohere and culminate in the film‑to‑body threading image. Subtext largely works through images and actions (looping film, balcony, hushed thunder → rain). The line “Love is never unused...” edges into explicit thesis; it fits diegetically but slightly blunts the lingering ambiguity. Overall resonance is strong despite that near‑moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in cinema textures. Distance stays stable; the diction modulates well at turns (the projector’s cough; the rain’s applause). No head‑hopping, and elisions are purposeful. Rhythm supports the accumulative build without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet functional; images often do double duty (storm as applause; pigeons as sprocket holes). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern‑consistent. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum holds through to the final image. A few metaphors flirt with lushness, but clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal gazing + psychometric cinema as a vessel for “unused love” feels freshly synthesized. The projector self‑threading and the inscription on the final frame are memorable turns that read inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and image pay off without obscuring clarity. Minor familiarity in the “found letter completes the song” beat is outweighed by execution.</comment>
