<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—proving objects absorb emotion while grieving his sister—is concrete and drives micro‑choices (the lies, the prism’s placement). Contradictory impulses are dramatized, not told (“I have let you go” versus “I need you still”). Embodied perception (frost, hush, temperature) keeps emotion lived rather than labeled. Slight elevated remove in places is the only distance from a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure deepens through the “shifted hush,” the lies, and the prism’s flare. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration—he repositions grief, leaves the prism, and walks out under a reweighted rule set. Cost is legible on the page (fractured prism, acceptance without consolation). Orientation is clean from line one; no causality gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and prism integrate as environment/tools that constrain options and charge the final image. Weather and mineral acoustics affect action (hush freezes dew; arbor sings; mist becomes mirrors). Object‑as‑setting culminates with the prism left to refract dawns, recharging place and meaning. Specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (release vs retention of grief) tightens through the ritualized “truthful lies” and the deepening hush. The pivotal renunciation—admitting “I need you still” and leaving the cracked prism—forecloses a path with cost. Escalation is a decisive intensification rather than multiple turns, apt for the lyric lens. Stakes remain coherent and felt at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image—objects as reliquaries, grief refracted into spectrum, “truthful lies” as ritual currency. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing (“Keep the colors; I’ll keep the hush”). Subtext around proof vs pilgrimage and reliquary vs prison is earned by particulars. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is controlled and distinctive, with a tactile, mystical lexicon consistent to character. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to chime) and stays legible. No head‑hopping or stance slips; elisions are taught and paid off. Elevated diction serves the mind of an “attentive mystic,” not generic lyricism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet purposeful; images do double duty (frost as braille and memory map). Minimal redundancy; syntax varies; momentum holds. A high density of figurative language skirts purple but remains coherent and grounded in physical logic. Final images are clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Quartz arbor, “shifted hush,” and truthful lies as currency synthesize into a fresh grieving ritual with internal logic. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (reliquary reframing; prism fracture mirroring him). Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece reads as a singular vision rather than template.</comment>
