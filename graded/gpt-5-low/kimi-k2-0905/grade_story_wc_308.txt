<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained: find and fuse with the “wandering pulse” by learning to “navigate without moving.” Interiority is textured and embodied (teeth ache, arrowhead warms), but internal contradiction is mild; he moves steadily toward surrender rather than wrestling with competing impulses. Micro‑choices—listening, singing in harmonics, pressing the arrowhead to his chest—track with his goal. The change lands, though the felt cost of renunciation is more implied than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: motifs (pulse, birds, bone towers) densify to a closure where he “becomes the echo.” Closure occurs on the page via the arrowhead merging and the canyon singing back; the conceptual cost is the surrender of movement/individual separateness, which reads as an Earned Stasis/CR. Orientation is firm from the outset (who/where/what he seeks). The tightening is singular but meaningful and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon of bone and its acoustics aren’t decoration; they function as resonant instruments that shape tactics (harmonic singing rather than walking). Sensory specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered (dust that “whispered,” towers as tuning forks). The environment constrains choice and charges the final image as the towers “sing back.” World rules (resonance, echoes) are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and consistent; escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than external conflict. The pressure tightens when birds form the living arrow backward and he chooses stillness, foreclosing the path of motion. Cost is subtle but legible in the surrender to the canyon’s rhythm. No antagonist, but internal and environmental forces interweave effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory, home, and stillness accrue organically from particulars (stone, wind, birds, dust) and reprised at closure with reweighted meaning. The final image answers the central question non‑literally: home is achieved by becoming the echo, not moving toward it. No sermonizing; resonance is earned through image systems and recurrence. The grandmother’s bequest ties lineage to identity in a way that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with stable close third POV; diction and rhythm align with the mythic register. Patterned elisions are taught early and paid off in the harmonic closure. Minor repetition (“weathered resolve of his weathered face”) nicks the surface but doesn’t break control. The voice modulates appropriately as pressure crests.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and clean syntax that carries momentum. Occasional redundancy and a few purple-leaning lines slightly over-saturate the texture, but not enough to obscure sense or closure. Parallel image systems are coherent (echoes, ripples, harmonics). The final cadence lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Bone towers as resonant instruments, a “harmonic stone skimmer,” and navigation by stillness via bird patterns feel fresh and integrated. Risks in concept and diction pay off with coherent world logic. The turn—becoming the echo—reads inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis transcends template mythic quest beats.</comment>
