<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cael’s goal (to locate the wandering pulse and “navigate without moving”) is clear and consistent, and his lineage-based reverence informs his choices. Interiority is textured and embodied through sensory attention to bone, wind, and vibration. However, internal contradiction and active struggle are muted; he encounters little resistance beyond the lyric task. The final renunciation—becoming the echo—reads earned but low-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece builds from sensing the pulse to harmonizing with the towers to the arrowhead’s merger. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he becomes the echo/compass—with conceptual cost (self-dissolution into place). Orientation is clear early (who/where/what he seeks), and motifs pay off cleanly (birds, arrowhead, dust). The causal thread is soft but coherent within the lyric design.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon of bone and endless echoes is vivid and functionally integral; the environment literally vibrates, shaping Cael’s method and final state. The arrowhead-as-tool and the towers as tuning forks constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory specificity (“teeth ache,” layered dust) is purposeful and filtered through Cael’s expertise. The setting is not postcard; it drives outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding and anchoring the wandering pulse—tightens when the birds form an arrow and the song makes the towers answer. Escalation reads as density/deepening rather than reversal; the felt price is identity-blurring and a fixed stance. Still, the pressure remains largely internal and assured, with little jeopardy or competing cost on the page. The cadence shift at merger provides the key narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of home-as-stillness, ancestral memory in stone/wind, and echo-as-self are organically enacted, not lectured. Returning images (birds’ spiral, layered dust, pulse) reweight meaning at the end. The final image resists a tidy moral while offering a resonant answer. Occasional near-ornamental phrasing skirts sentimentality but doesn’t overwhelm.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, patient, and sensorially tuned to vibration and pattern; it remains stable and apt for the mythic mode. Diction and rhythm modulate toward the close without drift or leakage. No dialogue, but focalization stays tight to Cael’s perceptual signature. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with strong image economy and purposeful repetitions (dust, hum, echo). A few metaphors verge on lushness, but coherence is maintained and redundancy is limited. Rhythm varies and propulsion suits a lyric accumulative beat. No scaffold loops or mechanical cadence mar the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “harmonic stone skimmer” in a canyon of bone offers a fresh synthesis; birds as navigational grammar is inventive. The merge of arrowhead and sternum is a striking, specific turn that feels inevitable. Risks in lyric density pay off without obscuring clarity. Minor reliance on familiar “home was always here” sentiment slightly tempers novelty.</comment>
