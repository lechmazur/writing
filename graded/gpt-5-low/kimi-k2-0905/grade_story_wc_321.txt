<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Arden’s motivations and contradictions are vivid and consistent: denial reframed as “slipping sideways,” optimism under pressure, and longing for a dock that remembers him. His micro-choices (radio numbers, flipping the hourglass twice, steering to the heartbeats) reveal a hierarchy of values. The decision to accept “permanent transient” reads as earned stasis with a felt cost. Slightly limited complexity beyond the central opposition keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Coherent causal chain: barnacle-coordinates → radio echo warning → “half here” condition → heartbeats steering → grotto closing → hourglass cost → merge. Closure is on-page with a decisive reconfiguration and a tangible sacrifice (the hourglass destroyed, path foreclosed). The earlier setup pays off (half-here test, patterns as navigation). A minor softening of the “choose one timeline” price is offset by the hourglass’s loss and Arden’s chosen liminality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and phosphorescent barnacles are specific, sensorial, and pressure-bearing; the environment gives coordinates and imposes a closing window. Tools/objects (hourglass, radio) are integrated with setting and charge the final image. World rules are learned through action without exposition. The setting shapes tactics, not just mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and escalates: ferry flickers, commuters gutter, warning from past self, then the closing grotto and burning hourglass force a narrowing of options. Arden’s agency drives all major turns; the heartbeats steering is a strong tightening beat. Cost is legible though slightly softened by the “both timelines” merge. Tension operates sentence-to-scene with no offstage solves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resonant themes of home, choice under liminality, and reframing surrender are embedded in action and image (sideways clocks, auroral stitches, brass caps pocketed). The ending reweights prior motifs without stating a moral. Optimism resists sentimentality by being paid for with a real loss and acceptance of a liminal life. The subtext is coherent and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinctive, lyrical yet controlled close-POV voice with consistent idiom and image systems. Compression is purposeful; brief dialogue via radio advances plot and subtext. Rhythm modulates well under pressure, avoiding expository tell-backs. A few lush metaphors skirt the edge but remain coherent to the diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; most lines do multiple jobs (world, pressure, character). Figurative language is vivid but disciplined and motif-coherent (sideways, stitching, salt/metal). Syntax varies to maintain propulsion; the closure image is sharp. Minor purple glints never obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—a vanishing commuter ferry navigated by barnacle coordinates and an empty hourglass that merges timelines—feels fresh and organically realized. Turns and images emerge from the established logic, not late rule drops. The final reconfiguration (auroral stitch, hourglass dust) is surprising yet inevitable. It takes a bold, specific risk without gimmick.</comment>
