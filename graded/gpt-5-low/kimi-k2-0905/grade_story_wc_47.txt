<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motives—reclaiming agency and transforming harm—are clear and embodied; her contradictory impulses (viral exposure vs. private seeding) play out credibly. Micro-choices (recording, then burying rather than posting; leaving without names) reveal a hierarchy of values with cost. Elias’s gentle pressure and proffer catalyze her decision without stealing agency. No therapy-speak shortcuts; the interiority stays concrete and character-particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush, drip cadence, and garden pattern build to a Charged Poise closure. The decisive act—recording then interring the file—reconfigures options with cost (forgoing virality for protected growth). Orientation is clean from the outset; setup beats (viral confession, refuge) pay off at the ending mound and ant’s shadow. The final blink/sleep image seals a before/after without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mossed data center is tactile, specific, and evolves with action (lichened circuits, thaw-drip cadence, skylight). The environment shapes tactics: sanctuary from sirens, a burial site under an upright blade, and a physical pattern pressed into soil. Recurring objects (pendant, USB, server) charge the last image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Mira’s bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: who owns her voice after virality. Pressure tightens when Elias arrives with her confession loop and then offers a live recording—forcing a choice that narrows options. The price is legible: choosing privacy and latency over immediate amplification. The cadence shift from scream to seed functions as a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: healing as cultivation, the internet’s appetite vs. dignified curation, endurance as growth. Images (ant, drip pattern, moss garden) accrue meaning and reweight at the end without moralizing. “Labels are frost” and the burial act offer a resonant non-literal answer to the central question. The piece invites reflection beyond the incident’s report.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature and steady psychic distance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and the one spoken line feels earned. No head-hopping; Elias’s presence is handled through Mira’s lens. The patterned elision is taught and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density prose largely sustains clarity; metaphors cohere (seed, hush, circuits/lichen) and serve action. Minimal redundancy; the repeated “pattern left by drip” functions as motif rather than loop. A few lush lines flirt with excess but momentum holds, especially at the ending image. Syntax varies and carries propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of moss-garden server farm, virality vs. secrecy, and planting a USB as seed feels original and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet plot, lyric density) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Fresh particulars (ant in amber casting a shadow) anchor universals. The final blink reimagines tech as dormancy/germination with conceptual bite.</comment>
