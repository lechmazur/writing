<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ember’s motive—rescuing a promise and reconciling her arson with preservation—is clear and consistent. Interiority is sensory and character-specific (lavender and sulfur; heat-warm threads), though the piece occasionally tells her realizations rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses. The identity turn (arson as revelation) feels earned by the tapestry’s reweaving. Costs are more conceptual than visceral, but the final renunciation of “false repositories” reads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: the descent → discovery → deciphering → reweaving → collapse → emergence progression coheres. Orientation is firm early (who/where/goal) and the closure lands on-page with cost (archive collapses; identity and mission redefined). Causality is light but intact, with the art-cipher trail motivating each step. A bit of explanatory summation near the end trims potential sharpness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archive is vivid and functional: soot walls, false wall niche, perfume cue, warmth of the fragment, culminating in a collapsing environment that pressures exit. Details are filtered through Ember’s tactile, heat-centric attention, reinforcing tone. World rules (art as cipher, heat-revealed compounds) are consistent within the piece’s logic. The setting charges the final image of emergence with the fragment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve truth/promise—tightens as the tapestry reweaves and the archive begins to fail. The collapse adds external pressure, but resistance is otherwise low, with no significant obstacle beyond deciphering. The internal conflict (destruction vs. preservation) resolves more by revelation than by contested choice. Cost is present but gentle, keeping escalation solid but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme is coherent—fire as revelation and the necessity of burning to preserve truth—and images recur meaningfully (eyes, heat, tapestry, ashes). However, the story states its thesis explicitly in lines like “Her arson had never been about destruction” and “sometimes we must destroy to truly save,” blunting subtext. The final image reweights prior material effectively despite the didactic edges. Ambiguity around moral cost is touched, not deeply interrogated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Ember’s sensibility; “volcanic tenderness” forms a recognizable signature. Distance is stable and the single spoken line lands as an incantation rather than exposition. Some diction repeats and leans purple in places, but rhythm and stance are steady. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is sensuous and largely clean, with strong nouns and tactile verbs; key sentences carry multiple jobs. Repetition of motif phrases and occasional summary-like moralizing introduce mild redundancy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; a few lines edge into over-explanation. Momentum generally holds across paragraphs and the final cadence delivers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—an arsonist whose art is a cipher to a truth-bearing archive, with a tapestry self-portrait that reweaves into the grandmother—is fresh and specific. The “burn to reveal” conceit is not wholly new, but the handling feels individually voiced. The closing reconfiguration (keeper instead of destroyer) is earned. Risk is moderate, with originality arising more from texture than structural daring.</comment>
