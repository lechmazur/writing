<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are lucid and embodied—she comes to “unbind” the bowl and reimagine a family tradition, acting through tactile, specific choices (planting the scorched seed, engineering a resonator). The internal contradiction (legacy of bonfire/crowd vs. solitude/unfinishedness) is credible and drives action. Emotional texture is shown through sensory perception rather than labels. The cost—refusing resolution, leaving the bowl, accepting solitude—lands without overstatement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each move—seed in bowl, unresolved notes, wire-bridge resonator—intensifies the premise and narrows options toward the charged dawn image. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with a felt price. Setups (shipwrecks, bell shard, bowl) pay off causally. The final leaf and humming bowl reweight all prior beats with cost and promise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse and ring of shipwrecks are vividly sensory and tactically consequential (acoustics teaching her to “let go,” rigging wire for the bridge, bell answering). Environment constrains and enables choices and charges the final image. Details track physically and evolve with action (droplets, ash, copper light). The bowl functions as micro‑setting at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—redefining legacy through unfinished music—and tightens via a purposeful deepening rather than reversal. The decision to craft the resonator and sustain unresolved playing through the night demonstrates cost and commitment. Stakes remain intimate but consequential and are paid on the page. Slight softness in overt external jeopardy keeps it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of unfinishedness as invitation, inheritance vs. reinvention, and survival transformed into generativity emerge through image and action, not sermon. The line “beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation” edges toward explicitness but is grounded by surrounding scene work. The final image reweights prior motifs (bowl, bell, ash, dawn) with lingering resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful and rich rather than murky.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, disciplined lyric voice with a precise acoustic lexicon; perception is character‑specific and consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to shiver to dawn) without drift or head‑hopping. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and momentum. Elisions are purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet controlled; metaphors cohere to the acoustic/ash/shipwreck palette and do more than one job. Information density is high with minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies to propel. One explicit thematic sentence slightly blunts mystery but does not stall momentum. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a post‑burn rainforest greenhouse, shipwreck ring, and an alms bowl repurposed as an instrument/resonator for unfinished music. Turns arise from the premise’s logic, not gimmickry, and the closure feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric density) heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. The vision reads singular and memorable.</comment>
