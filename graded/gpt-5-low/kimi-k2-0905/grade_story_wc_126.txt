<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to unbind the bowl and reclaim beauty in the unfinished—is concrete and drives each micro-choice (planting the seed, refusing resolution, wiring a resonator). The grandmother tradition provides a credible internal counterpressure without stalling action. Emotional textures are embodied (sound as tactile, the soil’s tremor) rather than labeled. The final renunciation (leaving phrases unresolved, leaving the bowl behind) feels earned with a subtle, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: sound motifs layer toward a Charged Poise/RR closure where the hush lifts and the seed unfurls. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by line two), and beats link via clear, motivated actions. The closure’s cost—embracing incompletion and leaving the vessel humming—lands on the page. Persistent constraints (the hush, ash-soaked setting, family legacy) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse and shipwreck ring are not backdrop; they shape acoustics, supply the rigging wire, and frame the “listening” world. Details are selective and POV-filtered (drips as intervals, bell shard answering), charging the final image. The bowl as micro-setting evolves into a resonator, constraining choice. Environmental logic remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via accumulative intensification: planting the seed, withholding resolution, the ship-bell’s reply, constructing the resonator, and playing through the night. Stakes are personal and aesthetic rather than perilous, but the refusal to resolve forecloses a path and reconfigures meaning. The hush’s partial lifting and daybreak leaf provide a tangible turn. Slight softness remains in overt price paid beyond renunciation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: unfinishedness as invitation, art as seed for survival, tradition reimagined without spectacle. Recurring objects (bowl, bell, wire) accrue meaning and reweight at the end. One explicit line (“beauty in the unfinished is not abandonment but invitation”) edges toward telling, modestly reducing ambiguity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct perceptual signature—the ear-led noticing—guides diction and rhythm. Lyric compression remains legible, with controlled cadence shifts at intensifications. POV distance is steady and confident, with no head-hopping or register slips. The prose breathes with the scene’s acoustics, modulating gracefully under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: images carry multiple jobs, and syntax varies for propulsion. Figurative language is rich but disciplined and coherent to the acoustic motif. No paraphrase loops or scaffold drag; transitions are frictionless. A hair from maximality due to density bordering on luxuriant in places, though clarity never falters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—an echo-harbor violinist turning a mendicant bowl into a resonator in a shipwreck-ringed, burned rainforest greenhouse—is striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction pay off, reconfiguring familiar “art after ruin” tropes into something singular. Turns arise from on-page logic rather than late rule changes. The closure image feels fresh and earned.</comment>
