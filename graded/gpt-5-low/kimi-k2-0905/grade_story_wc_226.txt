<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motives (to refract and redistribute blame) are clear, character-specific, and tested under time pressure. Contradictory impulses—defiance vs. guilt—operate simultaneously and culminate in the earned shift from speaking to listening. The acceptance of cost and plan to paint with her own blood foreclose a path credibly. Embodied emotion and micro-choices (climb, angle mirror, stop reciting, whisper acceptance) reveal her values under strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure tightens coherently: light→echoes→images→listening→crack→feather→departure. The closure lands on the page with cost (Earned Stasis/CR): she accepts the price, rejects the priests’ ritual, and redefines the truth’s ownership. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the one-hour clock plus approaching bells maintain temporal pressure. The lens holds cleanly to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and spire are not mere backdrop; they shape tactics (echo multiplication, tactile climbing, vibration response) and charge the final image (split spire humming, feather). The mirror shard and spire function as object-as-setting constraints with evolving meaning. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through Lira’s priorities. World rules (echoes, refracted syllables) are learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (making the spire sing before the ritual to reweight blame) are clear and escalate via density and pattern break when she stops speaking to listen. The decisive tightening is her acceptance of cost, which redirects her path away from the priests and toward a blood-painted reckoning. The cost is felt, though its most concrete payment is deferred to the implied painting. Internal and external pressures interweave without coincidence resolving them.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness is dramatized rather than moralized; her “coin” line is recontextualized by the later realization that the price is listening. The fracture of the spire and the feather literalize refracted/sharable truth, transforming blame into a communal resonance. The final note—“a story learning to breathe”—offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical close third sustains a consistent perceptual signature with precise syntactic control. The voice modulates under pressure (from playful theft-tone to sober listening) without breaking stance. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and subtextual. No head-hopping or register slips undermine credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density lyricism is largely clean, with vivid, specific metaphors that cohere with the world’s rules (echoes, bone, light). Rhythm varies well; lines often do multiple jobs without scaffold. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple, but they remain controlled and purposeful. The final image lands with clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Echo-canyon bone towers, refracted syllables painting “ghost sentences,” and a spire that sings/cleaves deliver striking, integrated novelty. The turn from performative confession to costly listening feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The mirror, feather, and ritual clock synthesize world, character, and theme without gimmickry. Risk-taking in imagery and mechanism heightens stakes while staying legible.</comment>
