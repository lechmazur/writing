<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, idiosyncratic interiority—her prosopagnosia shapes how she notices shoulders, hands, negative space—and her micro-choices under pressure (coin-to-wall transfers, pigment calculations) feel earned. The contradiction between monastic precision and the demolition clock registers credibly. Her final renunciation—leaving the work to survive without her—lands as an earned stance. A touch of thesis‑speak (“limitation is not failure but filter”) trims some mystery.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure is clean: coin code → method → siren countdown → explosion → charged exit. Closure arrives as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines “portrait” via absence and preserves memory with visible cost as the building falls. Orientation is anchored early and never wobbles. The coin mechanics and demolition clock motivate each intensification.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library, coin, candle, vibrations, and pigments are vivid and functional; environment and object constrain tactics and charge the last image. The live space (curved wood, knothole light, root systems) shapes what and how she paints. The final glow inside the trunk materially reweights the place. Detail is selective and POV-specific, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve what matters before demolition—tightens with the siren and root‑borne vibrations. Her tactic shift (faces → sky/negative space via the coin’s notches) is a meaningful deepening driven by agency. Cost is legible: she abandons the sanctuary to rubble and accepts that her portrait will be unreadable to her. No antagonist needed; pressure coheres and climbs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of limitation as lens emerges organically through craft choices and the negative-space revelation. Recurring images (coin notches, sky, shelves holding breath) are reweighted at the end. A few overt formulations (“the guild’s greatest knowledge…”) flirt with moralizing, slightly reducing subtext. Still, the last absence-as-anchor point resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person closely held with a distinct perceptual signature; diction suits an abstracting, tactile artist. Rhythm modulates with pressure—calculated strokes to urgent acceleration at the siren. No POV slippage or head-hopping. Elevated register stays consistent with character and circumstance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is rich and propulsive, with multi-tasking sentences advancing image and action. A few stacked modifiers and near-reprises (“holds their breath”; “fractal”) approach density saturation but do not blur sense. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean. The closing image is crisp, not muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—face-blind portraitist preserving sky-as-portrait via a coded coin inside a living library under demolition—feels genuinely fresh and inevitable by the end. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The method (indentations translated to measures) grounds novelty in action. The final absence point reframes identity memorably.</comment>
