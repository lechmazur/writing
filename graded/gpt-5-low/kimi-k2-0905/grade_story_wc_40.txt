<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s restraint, cataloger’s mindset, and shift from control to witnessing are clear and consistent. Her micro-choices—listening, testifying, placing the crystal, leaving without looking back—reveal values under pressure. Internal contradiction (fact‑bound certainty vs. openness to the library’s living memory) is credible but softly contested. The cost is quiet—renunciation of mastery rather than a dramatic sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: hush → sequences → testimony → book/flower → “zygote.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she chooses witnessing over definition with a felt conceptual cost. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words; the crystal and dictionary motifs pay off on the page. The only limit is the low-friction path—escalation is elegant but gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The library at dawn is tactile and POV-filtered; dust, slant light, and brittle spines shape attention and tone. The crystal functions as a charged micro‑setting tool that conditions perception and the final image. Environmental actions (book fall, pressed snowdrop) integrate world rules without exposition. Description is purposeful, never postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth in a world beyond definition) is clear and deepens through the sequences and the library’s reply. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara testifies and the library answers, reweighting her goal into witnessing. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral; opposition is minimal, so pressure never truly pinches. The cadence shift suffices for this mode but stops short of acute risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: endings as beginnings, language’s death opening a chorus of memory, growth as inward spiral. Recurring images (crystal, hush, snowdrop, last dictionary/“zygote”) evolve in meaning and culminate without moralizing. The final smile reads as earned repricing rather than tidy moral. Subtext breathes in implication and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is assured, lyrical, and steady in close third; perception is bias-marked by a scholar’s attention. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the brief quoted testimony feels organic. No head‑hopping or stance slippage, and diction stays aligned to character. The lyric register remains legible under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and multi‑tasking, with minimal scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (“spiral of human moments,” “heart beating in glass”) without purple excess. Syntax variety supports momentum and breath. The final image resolves with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a post‑lexicon world where a crystal records a library’s sonic memory; closure reframes apocalypse as genesis. Familiar motifs (library, pressed flower) are renewed through specific use and consequence. Risk is quiet but confident, avoiding gimmickry. The piece feels singular rather than template-driven.</comment>
