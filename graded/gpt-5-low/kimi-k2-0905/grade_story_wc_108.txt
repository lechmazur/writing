<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo’s motives and contradictions (phobia-ridden yet professionally leaping) are vivid and consistent, and his micro‑choices under pressure (kneeling to read the cast, choosing to project the raw footage) reveal a clear values hierarchy. Fear and competence coexist on the page without tidy cure, and the shell’s advice catalyzes an earned shift rather than a sudden epiphany. The child’s brief scene functions as crucible without derailing his arc. The final stance—keep the trembling take—forecloses a safer path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: clue on the cast leads to the shell, the shell reframes tactics, guards arrive, projection outmaneuvers them, and the plan to leak lands as closure. The lens reads Causal to Charged Poise; the decisive internal commitment changes options with on‑page risk. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/why), and the projector/stars payoff is prepped by environment. Cost is legible in the public self‑exposure and immediate danger.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library, iron stacks, film cans, skylight “clogged with constellations,” and projector aren’t just decor—they constrain and enable the final tactic. Sensory details are selective and POV‑true to a stunt worker steeped in sets and rigs. The environment directly charges the closing image (stars through perforations as screen). World rules remain consistent and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claiming a new identity via vulnerable truth—is signaled early and tightened by the heirs’ impending announcement and the arrival of guards. The key deepening is the shell’s instruction that reweights fear into tactic; escalation culminates in the risky projection choice. Visible price: exposure of raw fear and potential capture; he chooses endurance over flight. A slight remove remains because the leak occurs tomorrow, not on‑page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of “betraying the frame” and vulnerability as power emerge through concrete acts (keeping the trembling take, projecting rehearsal footage), not just assertion. However, the final sentence edges into overt thesis language (“Vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source”), dulling subtext. The shell as motif elegantly reframes voice and inheritance. The piece still invites reflection on authorship and exploitation without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>First‑person voice is distinctive—industry idiom, stunt logic (“counting heartbeats like stunt beats”), and image choices cohere to character. Dialogue is sparse but crisp and subtextual (the girl’s “listen scared”). Distance control is steady under stress; no head‑hopping. Rhythmic modulation suits pressure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical; images often do double duty (“dawn bruised the horizon” is familiar but effective in context). A few high‑color metaphors stack, yet clarity and propulsion hold and there’s no scaffold or synonym churn. Syntax varies and momentum never stalls. No line‑level artifacts obscure causality or the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive blend of film‑set grit, inheritance twist, and a magical realist shell that gives tactical advice; the “betray the frame” turn feels fresh and inevitable. Risks (lyric density, meta‑cinematic conceit) heighten stakes and cohere in the ending image. Specifics (Formica table, bomber jacket, projector to stars) keep it grounded. The synthesis reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
