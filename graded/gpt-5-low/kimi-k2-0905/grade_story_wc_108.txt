<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Leo’s fear and compulsion are concrete, embodied (knees knocking, trembling hand), and directly motivate each choice. The contradiction—phobia-ridden yet stunt-skilled—acts in scene, not as label. His final stance (keep the trembling take; leak the raw reel) is earned by the shell’s instruction and his prior methods. Slight near-moralizing at the end trims perfection but does not undercut character truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: DNA revelation → search for shell → child’s cast clue → retrieval → security arrival → projection gambit → escape and plan to leak. Orientation is immediate and stable; the library and film gear facilitate the decisive turn. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost: he refuses to hide fear and risks brand exile. The drive lens holds cleanly through to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rusted library, iron stacks, film cans, and skylight stars aren’t decorative—they supply the projector and screen that enable the outwitting. Sensory specificity is filtered through a stuntworker’s eye (“frame,” “reel,” “gels”). The environment constrains and charges the final image (stars as light source; ceiling as screen). Scale and texture feel purposeful and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (identity, obsolescence) and tighten when security arrives; the choice to project raw fear forecloses the safer path of flight. Internal and external pressures braid effectively. The visible price is social/professional risk and deliberate exposure of weakness, which reweights options. A minor softness: the guards’ hesitation is convenient, but the tactic grows from character and setting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: “betray the frame” becomes the literal tactic and the conceptual answer. The seashell’s instruction reframes fear as connective power; the final image revalues what counts as heroism. The line “Vulnerability isn’t armor; it’s the power source” edges toward stated thesis, but it’s earned by the scene. Subtext operates through objects and industry idiom rather than lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct first-person voice with film/stunt lexicon and rhythmic control; diction modulates under pressure without breaking POV plausibility. Dialogue is spare and charged (“Only to people who listen scared”), carrying subtext and function. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or stance slips. Lyric touches serve character rather than ornamental flourish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multi-tasking density with strong verbs and vivid images; momentum rarely stalls. Metaphors are apt to the world (“prop ship,” “color-grade into heroism”), with minimal clutter. A few aphoristic turns late slightly polish the thesis, but clarity and propulsion hold. No loops or scaffold artifacts dampen the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—phobic stunt double, tyrant-director paternity, a whispering seashell, a star-punctured library used as projector—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. “Betray the frame” retools a familiar vulnerability theme into a concrete tactic. The risk taken with tone and objects lands without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration reads bold and memorable.</comment>
