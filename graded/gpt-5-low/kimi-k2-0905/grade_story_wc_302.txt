<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and motive (“to document the library of unspoken words”) drive concrete choices: unsaying her first lie, offering the lullaby, seizing the syllable. Contradictory impulses (“cautious exuberance”) are embodied and pressured by the watch’s rules. The costed trade (mother’s lullaby) reveals values under stress. Slight distance from deeper personal history limits the emotional bleed-through at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rules accrete (backward watch, echo‑grammar, mirrored debts) and culminate in a conceptual repricing with cost. The closure lands on-page: trade made, collapse triggered, reset at riverbank with altered terms (lost lullaby, missing second letter). Setups pay off (cipher’s reversal, watch’s stutter as warning). Minor ambiguity in mechanics never harms the closing beat’s coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally constraining: algae chandeliers, vowel/consonant floor, echo‑enforced grammar all shape movement and options. The watch and library architecture charge the final image and govern tactics. World rules are learned through use, not exposition. Specificity stays POV‑filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gain/document the unspoken) tightens as time-language debts mount: watch stutters, algae dim, library begins to collapse. Turns are protagonist-driven (unsay lie; pay memory; seize key), and each carries a visible price. Pressure coheres under the stated rules; coincidence does not resolve. The reset carries consequence rather than a soft erase.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language as time-debt and silence as creation emerges through concrete acts (unsaid lie, traded lullaby) rather than statement. Recurring objects reweight meaning at the end, repricing omission: “The library survives in what you choose not to—”. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion. No moralizing; resonance is earned by image and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature; diction matches the surreal, rule‑bound world. Elision patterns are taught early and paid off cleanly at closure. Brief dialogue carries subtext and pressure without breaking POV. Slight lushness at peaks is managed by rhythm and image specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (setting, rule, emotion). Rhythm varies; lines propel rather than pad; minimal scaffold. Figurative texture is heavy but pattern‑taught, with few mixed metaphors and sustained clarity under stress. A minor risk of purple excess is contained and does not blur causality or the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: echo‑latency as grammar, cyclically reversed cipher, blood‑letters drying into Braille, and a mercury mirror that takes memories. Turns feel inevitable under the rules and the risk profile is high without gimmickry. The object‑centric closure recharges the premise elegantly. Emotional specificity (the lullaby) grounds the conceit.</comment>
