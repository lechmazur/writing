<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to catch the goddess’s echo) is clear and sustained, and her cool-headedness is consistently dramatized through choices (refusing to “cry,” deploying silence, using the spike). The internal friction—poise versus the star’s demand to expose vulnerability—registers but remains understated. Her actions align with her ethos and culminate in an earned repricing rather than a tidy conversion. A touch more embodied hesitation or cost would deepen the felt conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative/causal hybrid: the garden and star descend, the threat is issued, and the spike decision channels vibrations toward a focal point, leading to “Stay” and repricing. Orientation is clean and the closure lands on-page with consequence; the rail spike functions as a persistent constraint. The cost is conceptual (trading silence as a voiced offering) rather than overtly painful, but it’s legible at the end. Linkages hold without stray coincidences or unkept set-ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid, rule-driven, and directly shapes tactics (vibration channeling, sonic vines, threat to “burn the garden silent”). The rail spike as tool charges the final image and constrains choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is integrated and purposeful, with world rules learned through action. Tone and environment mesh to create pressure and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens when the goddess threatens annihilation unless Mara “cries.” Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency (spike into loam; voiced silence) and results in a narrowing of options for both parties. The price is subtle, but the reversal (echo transformed to “Stay”) reweights the conflict and forecloses one path (proving herself via noise). A slightly sharper on-page sacrifice would intensify the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme—divinity as conversation, not capture—emerges from particulars (echo, silence, spike, garden) and culminates in a non-literal but clear reweighting. The line “divinity is not a catch but a conversation” risks overtness, yet it’s earned by the preceding action. Subtext hums in the interchange between silence and sound, predator and listener. The final images reverberate without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with controlled diction and consistent focalization; the goddess’s single line of dialogue carries threat and subtext. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and imagery remains coherent. No head-hopping or stance slippage, and the elision is pattern-taught. Minor cap due to global gate (Q2 < 9.0).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density prose with fresh metaphors that largely avoid muddle; images (rail spike as “tongue,” lullabies stitched) do multiple jobs. Momentum holds; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. A few stacked intensities approach purple but remain legible and purposeful. Syntax and paragraphing support propulsion and cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concepts like “voicing silence,” sleepwalking constellations, and a sound wave garden feel singular and integrated with stakes. The spike’s industrial tang against the cosmic is a fresh synthesis. Turns arise from established rules rather than late contrivance. Strong originality with disciplined follow-through; capped by global gate.</comment>
