<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and method are clear and character‑particular (cool‑headed hunter who “voices silence”), and her decisive act with the spike aligns with her temperament. The demand to “show me your cry” sets a credible internal pressure point, but the contradictory impulses (cry vs. silence) stay mostly implicit. Interiority is distilled more into image than felt, embodied struggle, so the cost reads as conceptual rather than viscerally lived. Still, her micro‑choices under pressure reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative design coheres: constellations descend, threat issued, spike driven, echo reframed into “Stay,” and a resonant reconfiguration lands. Because/therefore links hold even in the lyric register (silence method → garden behavior → spike as channel → reweighted insight). The cost is subtle but legible—the trade of pursued capture for conversational reciprocity and the foreclosed path of “the first cry.” Orientation is clean from the outset; closure lands with on‑page images and consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and rail spike operate as environment and tool that constrain tactics (splitting the “sound bed,” pulling all vibrations to a point). Sensory specificity is vivid and integrated (lavender reeds, indigo longing, sonic vines), and world rules remain consistent through action. The setting charges the final image (garden exhaling, lullabies stitched) and is inseparable from the resolution. Economy and POV bias feel intentional and lived‑in for this surreal frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (catch the echo) and tightens when the star‑goddess threatens to “burn the garden silent.” Escalation is protagonist‑driven: the spike redeploys the garden’s physics, forcing a narrowing of options. The price paid is primarily conceptual (renouncing the demanded “cry” to assert silence as agency and accepting conversation over capture). A slightly more embodied cost would push this higher, but tension scales well for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo/listener reciprocity and divinity‑as‑conversation emerge organically from repeated particulars (silence as net, the spike as conduit, “Stay”). The final reweighting answers the initial question without moralizing, and images reprise with altered meaning (feral lullaby turns gentle; spike as “tongue” learning language). Ambiguity is purposeful yet coherent, sustaining reflection beyond the scene. No thematic overstatement undercuts subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature, steady distance, and controlled rhythm. Elevated diction feels motivated by the world’s physics and Mara’s chosen attention; brief cosmic personifications remain legible. The single line of dialogue is textured and pressurizing. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with largely clean, purposeful figurative work (“rail spike… a marriage of force and stillness”; “pocketed it like a tongue”). The metaphoric load is heavy but coherent, avoiding muddle and redundancy; sentence rhythm varies and propels. Minor risk of saturation in stacked images, but momentum and clarity hold through the climax and final image. No evident loops or scaffold dulling the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations, a silence‑net, and the rail spike as acoustic fulcrum synthesize into a fresh, inevitable turn. The piece commits to its surreal logic and follows implications through tactics and closure. Risk‑taking in premise and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The reconfiguration (“not a catch but a conversation”) feels both surprising and earned.</comment>
