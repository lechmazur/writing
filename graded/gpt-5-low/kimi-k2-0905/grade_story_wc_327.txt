<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-POV desire is precise and embodied: she fears the curse but fears silence more, and her micro‑choices escalate from listening to speaking to swallowing the diamond. Interiority is conveyed through tactile lexicon (texture→sound) rather than label‑speak. Contradictory impulses (self‑preservation vs. cultural preservation) operate simultaneously. Slight lyric distance keeps some psychological nuance abstract, but the sacrifice lands credibly with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: river‑tongue’s last breath → descent into the echo tunnel → syllable amplification → self‑sacrifice. Closure is on‑page and costly: calcification and death reconfigure the world so the language persists. Causality is clean (diamond whispers → translation attempt → curse seeps → swallow → towers speak). Orientation is clear and functional within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and echo‑tunnel are sensorially precise and shape tactics (wind‑played flutes, echo multiplication) and the climax image. The environment constrains and enables: she uses acoustics as a tool, and the final lexicon lives in the walls. Recurring objects (diamond, feathers, skull dome) are integrated, not ornamental. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving a dying language—tightens through a visible tradeoff: each slowed heartbeat yields clearer phonemes at the cost of life. Agency drives escalation: she initiates the rite, speaks the first word, accepts the seep, and swallows the stone. The final state forecloses her survival while securing communal continuance. Tension rises at sentence and beat scales without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: translating touch into sound, body into archive, and sacrifice into communal voice. The heron/starlings grammar reprise reweights the opening, arguing for living language as migratory and embodied rather than inked. No sermonizing; the last lines deliver a resonant conceptual answer through image and consequence. Ambiguity remains purposeful (curse as price vs. covenant).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a tactile lexicon sustains POV coherently. Rhythm modulates with pressure (seep/slow beats vs. bright closing choir). No head‑hopping or stance drift; diction feels organic to the storyteller’s sensibility. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High density, but metaphors cohere around texture, sound, bone, and flight, avoiding mixed vehicles. Lines do multiple jobs (world, motive, and action entwined), and momentum rarely stalls. Minor risk of saturation, yet cadence and clarity hold through the peak. No loops or scaffold artifacts in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: translating tactile memories via cursed diamond within an echo‑bone canyon feels original and inevitable in hindsight. The risk of making the body the medium of language pays off at the statue/heart closure. Recurrences (heron wing crack, bird‑grammar) are earned and transformed. Concept commits fully without hedging.</comment>
