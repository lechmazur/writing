<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s motives and contradictions are vivid and embodied—the stone chip, the breath‑counting walk, and the “foundation questioned” tag show a mind torn between preservation and survival. Her agency drives the collective reorganization and the coded summons, with micro‑choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Emotional texture is particular (calliope, rice‑paper poems) without therapy‑speak shortcuts. If anything, the personal cost remains more conceptual than felt pain on the body/relationship level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑POV, clean causality: graffiti → midnight assembly → overnight reorg → inspectors recoil → charged poise ending. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: privatization is postponed and meaning reweighted; the price—ongoing threat—remains on the page. The drive lens reads Hybrid (situational pressure with textural build) and holds. The only slight softness is that the “map” need is absorbed into tactics rather than progressing as a concrete subplot.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The raft carnival is exquisitely specific and functionally determinative: its modularity enables the overnight spatial shuffle that alters the inspectors’ read. Sensory detail is purposeful (calliope, popcorn smoke, rice‑paper poems) and filtered through Lina’s bias. The stone chip recurs to charge the final image. World rules feel consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the imminent privatization, tightening via the midnight decision to reconfigure the city rather than capitulate or scuttle. The reversal—the inspectors’ confusion—earns the postponement. Cost is legible but modest (a stayed execution rather than a wound), keeping the peak from absolute severity. A sharper on‑page sacrifice (lost income, broken alliance) would raise stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of ownership, survival through transformation, and the ethics of “loving without owning” surface through events and images, not sermonizing. The dual allegiance refracts each choice, culminating in a final image that says “we are still becoming” without tidy moral. Subtext in the grotesque mask tactic and rice‑paper poems deepens the critique of branding and erasure. No thematic overstatement; complexity holds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—lyric yet controlled with a consistent perceptual signature (“games were rigged by uncertainty”; “counting her breaths in fours”). Distance is steady, with purposeful compressions. Dialogue is minimal but functional and subtextual (“We can refuse to sign…” against the fire‑written “reclaim”). A tiny register blip (“投射的火花”) reads as a flourish that may jar some but doesn’t break control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, images are fresh, and sentences carry multiple jobs without scaffolding. Lyrical density is high but rarely purple; momentum holds through the plan and execution. Minor risk of over‑ornament in a phrase or two, yet clarity never slips. The final cadence lands with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A floating carnival city resisting privatization via spatial re‑choreography and coded graffiti is a striking synthesis. Familiar gentrification themes are transformed by specific tactics (grotesque logos, rice‑paper poem prizes) and a resonant object. The ending’s conceptual reframing feels both inventive and inevitable. Bold without gimmick.</comment>
