<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (collecting “textures of different times”), and contradictory impulses appear in scene: she tries to stop writing out of fear but continues because “understanding outweighed caution.” Embodied perception (moss luminescence, vibration through wrist bones) keeps emotion grounded. Final cost is felt: she sacrifices a forgery and accepts a heavier truth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: quiet setup → lamp/hum → involuntary dictation → glider ignition → bonsai transformation. Closure lands on the page with cost (sheet burned, “heart heavier by one truth”) and a coherent before/after. Orientation is established early (who/where/when) without confusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: the bonsai labyrinth guides her path, the lamp constrains tactics, moss records time, and altitude/dome light charge images. The final image (lamp to ember; bonsai grown, town’s seeded silence) is inseparable from place and objects. Specificity filters through Aurelia’s professional eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing time’s texture without exhausting longing—tightens as the lamp’s hum rises and her writing turns from recording to dictating. The attempt to stop (micro-turn) sharpens price and agency before the glider act triggers irreversible change. Consequences persist in the reconfigured world and in her accepted burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of history as curated desire emerges organically via forgeries becoming real and silence as “a library of moments.” Slight deduct for explicit thesising—“history is a bonsai, pruned by desire”—which edges into stated moral in the penultimate beat. Nonetheless, the ending reweights prior images with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature; POV remains tight to Aurelia. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (hush → hum → ignition) without head‑hopping. Patterned elisions are taught and paid off through the lamp and bonsai motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; sentences do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Lyrical richness skirts purple but stays coherent; metaphors align with established physics and motifs. No loops or scaffold distract from the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Invented histories instantiated via a bonsai labyrinth and a humming lamp is a striking, integrated conceit. The glider‑into‑ash fertilizing “counterfeit decades” is an original, earned turn. Risk‑taking and synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
