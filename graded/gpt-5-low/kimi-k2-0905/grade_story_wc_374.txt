<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s drive to understand weather-carriers is clear and consistent, and her embodied perceptions (tastes of ozone, old snow) read as character‑specific. The shift from skeptic to mapper of people is earned by the encounter but pays a relatively low on‑page cost. Internal contradiction is muted—she accepts the revelation with little resistance or friction. Secondary characters function symbolically more than as pressure agents, limiting crucible dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural structure coheres: the staged arrivals (storm woman, frost man, aurora child) build to the election reveal and reconfigure Mira’s aim. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: from hunting anomalies to recognizing distributed emotional weather. The cost is primarily conceptual (abandoning skepticism), legible but soft. A truncated last word (“The lavender”) doesn’t break closure but slightly scuffs cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lavender bluff under aurora is vivid and sensorially layered; the environment actively convenes participants and perfumes the air, shaping the ritual feel. The tin compass ring functions as a micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image and constrains Mira’s orientation. World rules (forests voting, electromagnetic symphony) are learned through observation and event rather than dump. Detail selection stays purposeful and filtered through Mira’s sensoria.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure deepens via pattern: the convergence forms a triangle, the ring spins wildly, and the election premise narrows options to acceptance. Stakes are internal (understanding/role), and escalation is more density than conflict; there’s one meaningful tightening at the reveal. Price is subdued—no hard trade‑off beyond a reorientation of vocation. Still, the cadence shift at the meeting provides sufficient turn for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—individuals “carrying weather” as communal emotional labor—emerges from concrete images and culminates in a reweighted mission. Subtext runs through taste, scent, and the forest “elections” rather than moralizing, though one line (“They were elected by the world itself”) edges toward explicit statement. The final reframe (map people, not storms) resonates and lingers. Complexity is maintained without false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyric, and consistent with Mira’s sensorium; brief dialogue carries subtext (naming her “the skeptic”). POV stays clean, with no head‑hopping. Rhythm mostly suits the mood, though density occasionally flirts with purple. Due to line‑level debt in the final third, high‑band lift is curtailed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is often beautiful with high information density, but figurative saturation is near‑constant, risking over‑richness. The fragmentary final word (“The lavender”) is a visible artifact in the closing beat, scuffing cadence. A few near‑duplicate motifs (tastes and aurora qualities) reappear without new pressure. Overall clarity holds, but the artifact and heaviness reduce polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Forest elections, taste‑based sensing, and an emergent tin compass synthesize into a memorable mythos that feels specific rather than templated. The child “remembering tomorrow and yesterday” and the political/ecological selection reframing are fresh. Risks land without obscuring clarity. The core turn grows organically from seeded images.</comment>
