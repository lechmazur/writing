<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elena’s motives (to stage grief as art) are embodied through concrete micro‑choices: carrying/placing the chair, calibrating sight lines, donning the shard‑mask, and scattering powder. Contradictory impulses—comfort vs. absence, truth vs. self‑story—operate on the page. The cost registers in her acceptance of a story that can’t be completed, with the mask pressing where her grandmother’s hands once were. A touch of declarative summation trims peak ambiguity but doesn’t flatten her interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and actions accrue toward a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing at the final spiral. Orientation is clear early, and each beat (chair at vanishing point → mask → powder spiral) coheres causally in this mode. Closure lands via the final image reweighting the premise with felt cost. Slightly static midsection cadence keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The vanishing‑point gallery, lighting shifts, and spatial math of sight lines actively shape tactics and charge the ending image. The chair’s physical placement and the spiral’s geometry are inseparable from meaning. Specific, tactile objects (powdered porcelain, cane seat, track lighting) are filtered through POV. Setting constraints and object‑as‑setting execution elevate the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: whether grief can be made legible without completing the story. Escalation reads as deepening density (chair settling, mask fitted, powder widening into spirals) with the lighting shift intensifying pressure. The option foreclosed is the fantasy of a complete narrative; cost is acknowledged on the page. No large reversal, but one substantial tightening is present for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring images (mask shards, powder, rocking) and culminates in a resonant final tableau. However, explicit thesis lines (“safety is always a mirage…”) in the last paragraph constitute thematic echo/moralizing that undercuts subtext. The rest of the piece earns complexity through particulars and implication. Strong resonance despite on‑the‑nose articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is distinct and stable, with a controlled rhythm suited to the art‑installation frame. Diction matches the sensibility and never head‑hops; perceptual signature is specific (geometry, texture, light). Compression and patterned elision are taught by paragraph two and maintained. Minor flourishiness remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density, and images often pull double duty (powder as ash, mirror as memory). A few metaphors verge on purple or stack closely, but coherence holds and momentum persists. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep flow strong. Slight figurative saturation prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Porcelain shards from a grandmother’s bathroom reworked into a mask, staged at a vanishing point with a powder spiral, is an original and integrated conceit. The synthesis of grief, perspective, and installation art feels specific and inevitable by the end. Risks in structure and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. Only the brief thematic overstatement tempers the peak.</comment>
