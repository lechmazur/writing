<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elena’s motives—memorializing and reframing her grandmother’s death—are concrete and embodied in precise actions (chair placement, donning the mask, scattering powder). Her self-deception (“just furniture,” “merely materials”) plays against compulsion, revealing real contradiction. The final stance reads as an earned endurance with cost: accepting absence by fixing it into ritual form. Minor limitation: the price remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized through a contested choice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear; each action densifies meaning toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the installation’s steps cohere causally. Closure lands in the spirals and still chair, reconfiguring safety and memory with a felt cost. The arc lacks a pronounced turn; escalation is steady rather than sharply tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery and rocking chair create a perspectival constraint that shapes tactics (angle calculations, chair at the convergence). Lighting shifts and spatial geometry charge the final image, integrating environment into action. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered (track lights, cane seat, runners’ whisper). A hair shy of 9-band only because the environment mostly frames meaning rather than forcing a hard choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (how to embody grief and incomplete truth) are legible early and deepen via mask application and the widening spiral. Pressure builds by accumulation—comfort → absence → reconfiguration—without a distinct on-page reversal. The cost is present (a renunciation of comforting fictions) but not dramatized against live resistance. Tension is sustained but quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motifs (porcelain, rocking, powder, vanishing point) braid effectively toward a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the explicit thesis lines (“safety is always a mirage…”) in the final paragraph tilt toward moralizing and reduce subtextual charge. The piece still earns reflection through particulars (medicine cabinet shard, glitter ornaments as echo). Thematic complexity is present but partly stated rather than fully inferred.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical single-POV voice with consistent perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Diction and cadence suit the character’s artistic sensibility and grief-state. Occasional density skirts purple but remains legible and purposeful. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with strong verbs and multi-tasking images (powder as ash, glitter, mica). Some metaphor stacking and conceptual repetitions in the final third slightly blunt momentum and clarity. Syntax varies and paragraphing breathes with the scene. Minor overwriting keeps it out of the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The porcelain-mask-from-bathroom-tiles, vanishing-point staging, and powdered spiral yield a fresh synthesis. The installation-as-grief engine feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is cohesive and not gimmicky. A bolder, more surprising turn under pressure could push it higher.</comment>
