<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mireya’s motive—to restore the tower–elevator dialogue—reads clean and consistent, and her choices (selecting languages, persuading the cuckoo, addressing the elevator) drive the piece. Interiority is conveyed through sensory-musical perception rather than exposition, which feels specific. Internal contradiction is minimal; her competence rarely strains, and the cost is mostly fatigue. Still, the closing endurance—accepting exhaustion to carry the bridge—lands as an earned, quiet change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: actions cascade from the snapped weight to liturgical repair to the 4:43 transformation and reciprocal song. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where the system’s conversation is restored and reweighted (bird becomes elevator; shared custodianship). Causality is legible and tidy without contrivance. The cost is modest but present on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tower, planet rings, speaking tube, and weight are tactile and integral; tools and distances constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory specifics are fresh and POV‑filtered (prairie wind vernacular; “copper artery”). World rules remain stable within the lyrical mode. Economy is high; nearly every detail serves pressure and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (farmers need the elevator’s note; silence aches) and pressure deepens as Mireya moves from fix to covenant. Escalation is primarily density/ritual rather than jeopardy; the tightening is the time window to dawn and the elevator’s ultimatum (“build me a bridge”). Cost and trade‑off are gentle, not searing, which tempers peak tension. The 4:43 turn is a satisfying intensification rather than a hard reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bridge as song is earned through repeated, concrete acts of translation and repair; the final roadway of resonance reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext about dissolving human/machine silos accrues through images (violins from augers; infants in belts) rather than thesis. One explicit aphorism (“a bridge is a song…”) skirts statement but is motivated by character and craft. The ending lingers with conceptual and emotional aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—lyric, precise, mechanically musical—and consistent in POV. Diction modulates with pressure (workmanlike verbs in fixes; elevated cadence in vigil) without drift. Dialogue is sparse but textured (the elevator’s line is memorable and characterful). Rhythm supports momentum and hush without sameness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet controlled; images cohere to the mechanical‑choral palette with minimal overreach. Information density is high; lines often do double duty in setting and theme. Minor risk of purple is managed by clear action beats (opening drawers, wiring, rehanging). Final lines crystallize motifs cleanly with no scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—language drawers, a talking grain elevator, a cuckoo that emerges as an elevator—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. The piece commits to its conceit and follows implications to a fresh closure image. Emotional specificity keeps it from reading as mere cleverness.</comment>
