<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mireya’s motive—restore the tower-elevator dialogue before dawn—is clear and embodied through her tactile, musical methods. Interiority is particular (she “feels” wheeze and hunger like chords), and actions align with values. However, internal contradiction is minimal and struggle is mostly time-bound; she accomplishes each step with high competence. The cost lands as fatigue and responsibility rather than a sharp moral trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with clean causal links: broken weight → repair → negotiation → woven liturgy → reciprocal chorus at dawn. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the speaking tube and clockwork rules are consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the tower and elevator form an ongoing “roadway of resonance,” with Mireya’s vigil and exhaustion as cost. The decisive cadence shift at 4:43 and the final antiphony deliver an on-page before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower, language drawers, and speaking tube aren’t mere backdrop; they supply constraints and tools that shape every choice. Sensory specificity (brass rings, lead pine cone, cedar ribs) is purposeful and POV-filtered through musical/choral perception. The environment literally charges the final image (tower answering elevator). World rules hold steady without expository drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the signal before dawn) is established early; pressure tightens via the elevator’s grievance and the live night clock. Mireya’s agency drives the deepening—switching from repair to diplomacy to liturgy. Escalation reads as density/cadence increase under the accumulative lens rather than sharp reversals, yet the “build me a bridge” demand reweights the task. Cost registers as stamina spent and the acceptance of stewardship.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—bridging silos of human/mechanical, justice/river/engine into shared song—emerges through concrete acts, not sermonizing. Recurring images (weight, chain, speaking tube, avian automaton) reprice at the end, charging the communal chorus and the “roadway of resonance.” The line “a bridge is a song you can walk across” toes the edge of aphorism but is earned by prior particulars. The emotional aftereffect lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice marries technical diction to choral imagery with consistency. POV distance stays steady; the elevator’s single line carries subtext and pressure. Rhythm modulates well across beats (repair, negotiation, vigil). No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely disciplined; metaphors are coherent and multi-functional (music/time/agrarian). Information density is high with minimal redundancy; sentences propel rather than stall. A few heightened phrases risk purple but do not obscure sense or closure. The final images are clean and unsmothered by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—choral linguistics as mechanical diplomacy between clock and grain elevator—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, animate infrastructure) pay off and remain legible. Turns arise from established tools and worldview rather than late rule drops. The result reads singular and memorable.</comment>
