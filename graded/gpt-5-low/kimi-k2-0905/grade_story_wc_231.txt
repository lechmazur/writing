<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Maris’s interiority is specific and embodied—she reads absences like signals and makes micro‑choices (pinning the flower, scanning for gaps, then releasing it) that reveal duty vs. contamination by the stranger’s residue. The contradiction—keeper of light vs. carrier of borrowed memory—pressures her actions. The final renunciation costs personal memories on the page, earning the closing stance. Minor note: the psyche remains composed even at the apparition, but the restraint fits her vocation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Patterned anomalies escalate causally toward a clear closure: apparition → understanding “gift as loan” → decisive release with cost → world resets. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when) with a taught “observe gaps” method that the plot pays off. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid with a legible price. No dangling set‑ups; the logbook line returns as conceptual glue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse, mist, beam, and opal dock are integral; weather and optics govern tactics (reading absences, scanning between pulses). The environment charges the final image (“opal dock…closed eye”) and constrains sound and sight. Details are sensorially varied and POV‑filtered by a keeper’s attention to rotation and timing. World rules stay stable, learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the light/self from a cycle of borrowed memory—intensifies as anomalies compound. The apparition reframes risk, and the release of the Edelweiss forecloses a path with a visible price (loss of personal memories). Pressure coheres under the taught lens of “gaps,” tightening options. The belated horn and returning gulls serve as earned consequence, not convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: keepers as witnesses between seen/erased; memory as debt vs. duty. The Edelweiss’s repricing from gift to loan reweights prior images and anchors the moral calculus. The ending’s quiet reconfiguration (“attending,” not “investigating”) resonates without stating a moral. Subtext in the logbook line and reflection‑lag avoids didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV with disciplined metaphors (“gaps,” “borrowed memories,” “milk stirred with silver”) that track to the concrete world. Distance control is steady; certainty matches what Maris can infer. Elision is purposeful and paid off when the method and loop resolve. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; lines often do double duty (setting plus theme). A few rich metaphors cluster but remain coherent and avoid mixed vehicles; rhythm varies with pressure. Minor risk of purple texture is kept in check by precision and causality. No loops or filter stacks dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse praxis recoded as reading absences; a dried alpine flower as a memory debt instrument—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The investigation method shapes both plot and theme, not just mood. The final repricing of a “gift” to a “loan” feels both novel and earned. Boldness heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
