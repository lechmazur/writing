<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (send a distress signal before air runs out) is clear and intensifies to the key sacrifice of the lilac vial. Her internal conflict—flee vs. stay; hoard the last Earth-scent vs. spend it—registers in concrete, embodied terms. Micro-choices (kicking deeper, prying the console, touching coil to perfume) reveal values under pressure. The costed renunciation at the end (leaving the empty vial) feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: hush muffles; discovery of organ; scent-to-frequency gambit; temple amplifies; rescue answers. Closure lands with both a decisive change (hush to resonance, rescue en route) and a resonant reconfiguration (temple adopting her memories), with the vial’s sacrifice as price. Orientation is clean early and the hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds through the lilac-tinged reply. The final offering of the vial on the console makes the before/after legible with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater temple is tactile and constraint-bearing: shrinking air, flooded nave, stone tendrils, coral organ, all shaping tactics. Tools (copper coil, console) and the vial-as-micro-setting charge the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid across modalities (sound, pressure, scent, light). World rules (hush, organ mechanics) are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival/rescue) tightens at the moment she chooses to expend the vial, foreclosing a personal lifeline. The organ’s stuttering to singing provides a meaningful turn driven by her agency, not coincidence. Cost is legible: lungs burning, risk of dying before rescue, and surrendering her last Earth-scent. Pressure remains coherent and grows under the chosen lens to the lilac-tinged reply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs. erasure and solitude transformed into signal emerge organically from particulars (perfume as preserved ephemera; temple’s instinct to forget). The final image reweights prior material without moralizing: stone yearns after tasting the ephemeral. Subtext works through image and action (the temple adopting her liturgy), eliciting a lingering aftereffect. Any near-declarative lines are supported by scene pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical single-POV voice sustains through pressure, modulating rhythm at turns (the scent conversion beat, the reply). Diction feels character-coherent for a cartographer-poetic mind under duress. The one line of dialogue (“We hear you, cartographer.”) lands as earned music rather than exposition. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful, with images doing double duty (lilac drop as star, hush as curator). Momentum is maintained; sentences advance action or charge atmosphere with minimal scaffolding. Minor density spikes flirt with purple but do not blur causality or the closure image. Syntax varies to suit breath and stress, especially at the organ’s activation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Perfume-to-frequency via a coral organ in a temple that prefers silence is a fresh synthesis. The “gathered hush” premise is transformed into a choir of memory with specific, non-obvious turns. The lilac-tinged broadcast and bubble blossoms feel inevitable in hindsight once the rules are taught. Risk-taking in concept and image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
