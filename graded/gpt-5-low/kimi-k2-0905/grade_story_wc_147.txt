<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is immediate and intensifying (get a signal out before air runs out), and her contradictory impulses (flee vs. go deeper; keep the vial vs. spend it) play out in concrete choices. The sacrifice of the crystal vial is a specific, felt cost tied to identity and past. Interiority stays embodied (“knees bruised by pressure and guilt,” “lungs burning”) and decisions align with character. Minor note: she reads highly competent with few lasting flaws beyond guilt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: hush dampens the call → discovery of organ → conversion of scent to signal → amplified broadcast → rescue reply and arrival. Orientation is swift and legible; single-scene pressure tightens logically. Closure lands as a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: the temple shifts from suppressor to amplifier, and Mira pays a visible price (vial, near-asphyxia). The persistent constraint (shrinking air) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The underwater temple is tactile and operative: flooded nave, stone tendrils, coral organ, lapis tiles, all constraining options and providing the means of solution. Sensory specificity (lilac scent, luminous plankton, violet strobing) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image (organ bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms; temple continuing to sing). World rules feel consistent within the piece’s lyric-magical logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates through one meaningful deepening: move deeper to the organ and expend the last personal anchor to prime it. The live clock (air pocket shrinking) and antagonistic hush/tendrils tighten options. Agency drives the turn; the solution is not luck but a high-cost, character-driven tactic. Consequences persist: the vial is gone and the temple’s state is permanently altered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme develops organically: memory vs. oblivion, solitude into signal, maps as love’s proxy. The lilac vial’s transformation into frequency reframes “ephemeral” as durable communion, answering the central question without moralizing. Subtext hums in images (temple adopting her past as liturgy) and the ending reweights prior material with lingering ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical-close third carries consistent diction and rhythm, modulating effectively under stress. The lone line of dialogue (“We hear you, cartographer.”) lands with subtext and restraint. No POV leakage or stance confusion. Slight lushness presses the edge but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is polished, image-dense, and propulsive with minimal scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and in service of scene pressure. Syntax varies to match tension; key beats remain clear. A touch of purple density at peaks prevents the absolute top band but does not blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: translating scent into signal through a coral organ, a temple that prefers silence learning to yearn, and lilac bubbles as reply. Risks (mythic-scientific blend, high lyricism) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the set-ups (coil, vial, hush, organ). The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
