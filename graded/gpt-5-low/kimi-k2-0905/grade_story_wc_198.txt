<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desire and duty are clear and embodied: he plays to hush a code-voiced prophecy while fearing its death-date clause. Micro-choices under pressure (altered fingering, the copper-tasting diminished chord, the retrograde erasure note) reveal a credible hierarchy of values. Inherited motive (mother’s breath-measured lesson) deepens without drifting into summary. The ending’s endurance cost (throat raw, tomorrow he must return) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure coheres as sound, space, and refracted glass tighten toward the erasure note. Closure lands on the page with cost via a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise): he averts the naming at the price of ongoing vigilance. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the pattern is taught early. Setups (atrium echoing, prophecy encoded in intervals) pay off causally in the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto’s acoustics and the greenhouse’s prism behavior actively shape tactics; he adjusts fingering to sympathetic glass and leverages space as a second body. Weather and light matter: the “first blade of sun” and accelerating dew change timing and texture. Details are specific and filtered through a musician’s attention. The final image (dewdrops necklace on the bell) recharges earlier environmental cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: prevent the prophecy from locking in his death. Escalation tightens as the hush “pushes harder,” the atrium flares, spectral voices name futures, and he counters with increasingly precise tactics. The peak choice—the backward-traveling erasure note—narrows options and exacts a cost. Pressure remains coherent and internally motivated; no convenient outs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through event and image: music answering code, silence as agency, inheritance vs. fate. Recurring motifs (negative space, breath on winter glass, dew) are reweighted at the end without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on how absence (erasure) can be an act, with human cost. Nostalgia and communal expectation braid in subtly via the mother and villagers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains without slipping registers; diction and rhythm feel native to this consciousness. Psychic distance remains steady, with modulations at stress points (the “Not yet” whisper) that fit the moment. Elision is purposeful and pattern-taught. No head-hopping or credibility breaches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density prose largely earns its figures; images are fresh and carry multiple jobs. Minor risk of lushness is managed by clear action lines and varied cadence. No template loops or filter stacks; repetition (“negative space,” “quietly vivid”) reads as motif rather than churn. The final sentence lands cleanly, free of muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—jazz technique against a coded prophecy via negative space—is striking and executed with integrity. Environmental ingenuity (prism acoustics) and the conceptual erasure note feel inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth (duty’s cost over victory) resists the safety middle. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without losing coherence.</comment>
