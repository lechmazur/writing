<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren’s motive—pursuing origins against bureaucratic containment—is clear, embodied, and drives concrete choices (ignoring the hail, speaking “mayu,” descending, transmitting image over coordinates). Her dry wit and confidence read through action rather than labels, and the Registry tension gives her a credible internal conflict. The visible costs (tearing the page, risking dismissal as myth, burning the last coffee) ground the endurance at the end. Slightly more on-the-page friction between duty and compulsion at the moment of descent could sharpen the contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Coherent causal chain: radio “convergence” → observation of condensation spiral → language-key test → descent → mapping/transmission → renunciation. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis: she chooses myth over coordinates, with on-page cost and a reweighted world-picture. Orientation is established early and the magic rule is taught by action (phrase opens ice) before relying on it at the climax. No stray setups go unpaid; the final spiral/frost image pays back the taught pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The outpost and frozen lake aren’t decorative; they constrain choices (rope, tripod, ice, warmth anomaly) and charge images that recur in the ending. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her cartographic bias (obsolete star charts, labeled tongues on rock). World rules (language as unlocking mechanics, bio‑illumination) are learned through doing. The final spiral frost on refrozen lake is a charged environmental closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth’s emergence versus institutional capture—tightens as coincidence (radio) prompts a test but is resolved by her agency: speaking the key word, descending, then subverting the Registry via transmission and renunciation. The page tear and refusal to give coordinates foreclose paths with cost. Escalation is a single strong deepening consistent with the accumulative lens rather than multiple reversals. A touch more resistance at the language-key moment could heighten pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of origins, language as creation, and knowledge’s institutional erasure accrues through particulars—the phrasebook, labeled streams, microorganisms spelling words—without sermonizing. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: origins converge when witnessed and released, not captured, with a conceptual and social price. Recurrences (spiral, river-words, map as projection) are reweighted at closure. The Helsinki/Quechua coda widens resonance without flattening ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Close third is steady, with a clean, distinctive perceptual signature: cartographic metaphors and precise, unsentimental noticing. Lyric diction is controlled and voice-consistent under stress; no head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (she “understood then”) reads as earned inference, not authorial cheat. Minimal dialogue is functional and potent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images do double duty (throat cartilage, shattered mirror) and track physically and thematically. Figurative language is varied and disciplined; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Rhythm modulates with pressure (crackle, descent, estuary) and the final sentence lands cleanly. A couple of stacked modifiers approach lushness but stay coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—phrasebook as key, condensation spiral as cosmological guide, microorganisms projecting maps, and bureaucratic erasure—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking serves stakes rather than cleverness, and the imaginative turns stem from established patterns. The falcon-as-herald and the atlas page dissolving into the world are striking and specific. Nothing reads like a template beat.</comment>
