<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (solve the quarry disappearances/awaken empathy) drives concrete, character-specific tactics: cross-referencing rentals, mixing ribbon fibers into pigment, and the final delivery to the sheriff. Interiority is embodied through sensory noticing and process rather than labels. A credible inner contradiction—needing to forgive her face-blindness while forcing recognition—surfaces at the peak. Relationship pressure is minimal, but single-POV micro-choices under stress are strong.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coherent causal chain: research → quarry setup → pigment from ribbon → painted puncture → water clears → mask recovered → name triggers divers. The magical mechanism is taught early and enacted, not tacked on, and the closure lands on-page with concrete consequence. Cost registers as relinquishment of the work to the sheriff and a charged acceptance of her cognitive limitation. Orientation (who/where/when) is secured quickly and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry is tactile and operative: mist, chalked limestone, floodlights, and black water constrain action and charge the final image. Recurring objects (ribbon, mask, lights) are integrated with environment and ritual. Sensory specificity (gardenia scent, cables snaking into water) deepens tone while guiding choices. The place decisively shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forcing recognition vs town’s amnesia) tightens through the disciplined ritual into a decisive turn (lancing the painted heel). Escalation is protagonist-driven; coincidence (scent release) complicates but does not resolve. The cost is quieter—emotional renunciation and exposing her work to authority—but palpable. Pressure coheres under a causal–lyric hybrid without stalling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Opposites (seen/unseen, living/lost) unify through repeated images and culminate in the painting confronting the recovered mask. The piece interrogates communal memory and the ethics of looking without sermonizing, though “Evidence reborn; empathy may follow” edges toward explicit thesis. The final reconfiguration reweights the premise with social cost. Thematic strands arise from action rather than meta-commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person voice with a distinct perceptual signature (procedural attention, sensory hierarchies) remains stable. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure; no head-hopping or distance slips. The archival call is used as sonic texture rather than an expository crutch. Diction and syntax feel unified with the focalizer’s craft and state.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines carry multiple functions (image, action, theme) with minimal redundancy. Figurative language is rich but coherent and tethered to scene logic; rhythm varies and propels. No scaffold loops or template cadences; punctuation and grammar are clean. A few heightened metaphors flirt with purple but stay disciplined and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face-blind portraitist weaponizing pigment made from evidence to reverse erasure is a fresh, integrated conceit. The “lance” turn literalizes a thematic aim in an inventive, earned way. Genre blend (procedural and magical-realist lyric) feels cohesive and bold. The final image synthesizes method, motif, and social stakes with originality.</comment>
