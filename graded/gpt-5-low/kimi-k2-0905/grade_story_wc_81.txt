<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (trace the catalogue’s origins) is concrete and persists under pressure, with embodied beats like stamping her wrist and working by touch. Her contradictory impulses—devotion to order vs. suspicion that the catalogue is indexing her—surface credibly and guide choices. The final renunciation (to rewrite remembering the land) feels earned, though the personal cost against the Council is mostly implied rather than tested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean single‑scene structure with because/therefore links: blackout → stamp’s unscrambling → bruise‑pattern reading → darkness test → city‑grid reveal → new indexing decision. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing; the story’s premise is reweighted (origin = erasure) and tactics shift accordingly. The cost remains conceptual rather than concretely jeopardizing her—effective but not maximal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The flooded library and algae‑lit city are vividly rendered and integral to action; the blackout and water directly shape tactics (extinguishing the lantern; plankton reveal). Recurring objects (stamp, drawers, lantern) function as micro‑settings that constrain choices. The environment charges the final image, though a single on‑page external obstacle beyond water rise could have intensified immediacy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through the lantern‑off choice, a decisive deepening under the accumulative lens. The water level, dying lantern, and power return form a quiet but coherent clock. Costs are primarily ideological; a sharper tangible risk or loss would elevate the felt price at peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of institutional erasure versus memory accrues through particulars (bruised cards, negative‑space map) and culminates in a reclassification to remember. The subtextual idea that archives are instruments of governance, not neutrality, is dramatized rather than declared. One aphoristic closing clause skirts moralizing but is anchored to the stamp’s image, keeping it earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“tranquilly perceptive,” “reclaimed stillness”) remains consistent and controlled. Rhythm varies with pressure; the black‑out moment’s pared diction pays off. No head‑hops or stance slips; diction stays plausible for this mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; few to no loops or scaffolds. Some figurative richness approaches purple but remains coherent and in service of mood and action. Syntax and paragraphing pace the accumulative pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stamp as negative‑space map mirroring a drowned street grid is an elegant, memorable turn; the idea of an index that indexes the populace back is fresh. The blackout enabling truth via bioluminescence reframes familiar tropes. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity.</comment>
