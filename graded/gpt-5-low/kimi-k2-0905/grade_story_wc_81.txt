<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—uncover the catalogue’s origin—drives every beat, and her micro-choices (grouping bruised cards by touch, extinguishing the lantern, rewriting headings) reveal a specific, disciplined mind under pressure. The internal tension between duty to the Council and fidelity to truth is present, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized interpersonally. Embodied detail (ankle-deep water, tingling stamp) grounds emotion without therapy-speak. The final stance—choosing remembrance—reads earned, if the external risk is only implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the first lines; causality holds: blackout → stamp unscrambled → tactile search → embrace of darkness → revelation → decision. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the catalogue is an instrument of erasure, and Mara reconfigures its taxonomy to remember. The return of power underscores the before/after. The cost is felt more as latent defiance than immediate consequence, but it’s legible enough for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is tactile and active: darkness, rising water, algae tubes, and phosphorescent plankton directly shape tactics (she must kill the light to read the stamp). The environment’s rules are learned through action, not explanation, and the pumps’ return creates a clean end-beat. Object and setting interplay—the stamp and water—charges the final image. Specificity remains purposeful and filtered through Mara’s professional attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early—truth versus institutional erasure—and escalate via concrete constraints (dimming lantern, rising water, silence). The tightening moment is her choice to extinguish the lantern, narrowing options and inviting risk to gain knowledge. Resolution is earned by her new taxonomy, though tangible consequences are deferred. Tension operates more through discovery pressure than direct opposition, but it coheres under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, power, and erasure emerge organically from image systems (bruised paper, negative-space map, light/dark). The final reweighting—“honest origins” as curated forgetting—feels inevitable and resonant. A few lines verge on thesis (“knowledge begins where silence is stamped back into speech”), brushing explicit moralizing without toppling the craft. Subtext still leads, supported by action-driven insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a meticulous professional under unusual awe. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (quieter in stillness, clipped at turns) without head-hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off (the darkness hypothesis). The perceptual signature—indexer’s taxonomy bias—inflects noticing in a distinct way.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, theme, and motion—without bloat, and rhythm varies. Figurative language is rich but mostly precise; images like “water dripping from chandeliers like slow applause” land cleanly. Minimal scaffolding and no meaningful loops; momentum persists through action-based discovery. A few elevated phrasings press toward purple but don’t obscure sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—a sunken library, an ink-stamp map legible only in darkness, and taxonomy as political erasure—feels fresh and coherent. The plankton-lit reveal is inventive and earned by prior particulars. The piece commits to its premise without hedging, letting object, setting, and theme fuse at closure. Risks in tone and imagery heighten rather than confuse.</comment>
