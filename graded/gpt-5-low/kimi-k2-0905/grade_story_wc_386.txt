<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marrow’s motive—to salvage something pure—feels specific and coherent, and her choices (lighting cold candles, bargaining with the glacier, lifting the globe, leaving the mirror) track. Interiority is present through tactile attention (skin sticking to ice) and vocation-shaped noticing. The piece could press harder on contradiction or cost in the moment (she succeeds with little friction), which limits the felt struggle. Still, the final acceptance of cost—letting the mirror go—reads as an earned, quiet renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: dream → shrine → glacier’s crack → corridor of memories → retrieval → exit → reflective coda. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the intact globe recasts the “windows of connection,” and leaving the mirror to the glacier carries conceptual cost. Orientation is clean throughout, and set-ups (cameo faces, snow globes, cold candles) pay off in the ending image. No causality breaks; the world’s rules are consistent within the lyric logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier/shrine ecology is vivid and functional: cold-burning candles reveal windows; air-pocket corridors and silted wreck constrain movement and route choices. Recurring objects (snow globes) and the environment charge the final image (mirror claimed by glacier). Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered, with tonal unity that avoids postcard description. The setting actively shapes tactics and the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—recovering the pure thing before the glacier “digests” it—tightening when the glacier cracks and later begins to close. Escalation is primarily textural but legible: the windows seal, passengers dissolve, dawn dims starlight. The conflict resolves through endurance/attention rather than confrontation; while effective, the path is relatively smooth. The cost is present but gentle, keeping this just under the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—wreckage cradling light, communal memory leaking between souls—emerges through actions and objects rather than statement, with the snow globes’ reweighted meaning at the end. Subtext in the “cameo” dream-roles coheres as a tapestry when faces find peace. The final charged poise—leaving the mirror, carrying knowledge forward—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Any explicitness (“knowledge that even wreckage can cradle light”) remains anchored in concrete image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with Marrow’s vocation and the piece’s dream logic; diction and rhythm are controlled and varied. No head-hopping or distance slips, and elision patterns are taught and paid off. A few lush metaphors crowd the line, but they rarely blur sense. The perceptual signature (oceanic/icy acoustics, tactile cold) feels particular and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with image-forward lines that work double-duty; minimal scaffold or loops. Some figurative layering edges toward abundance (“hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness”), but coherence holds and rhythm carries momentum. Syntax varies, paragraph cuts matter, and the final sentence lands cleanly. Minor purple notes keep it a notch below exemplary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Wreck-diver ghost whisperer + glacier shrine + melted snow globes as collective-dream conduits is an unusually fresh synthesis. Turns arise from established motifs (cameos, windows, candles) rather than late rule changes. The future-sight within the globe both risks and enriches the premise without gimmickry. The piece commits to its vision and earns its strangeness.</comment>
