<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, character-driven motives (curiosity, invisibility, kinship with the ghost) lead to concrete choices—descending the staircase, opening the hidden door, accepting the “voice.” Interiority is specific to a pit musician’s liminal status, though contradictions under pressure remain largely thematic rather than dramatized via tough trade-offs. Emotional embodiment is effective (water parting, splintered podium), but cost to self or relationships is muted. Final acceptance reads earned, if more conceptual than viscerally costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural structure holds: images in the program cue steps (staircase → door → case) toward a closure that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and set-ups (program, ghost’s silence, flood) pay off. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—embracing the between-spaces and playing the unsung—but the on‑page cost is softer than ideal. Still, the because/therefore chain reads clean within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is tactile and active—water levels, lantern flicker, submerged archives—shaping movement and discovery. The environment constrains tactics (wading, hidden staircase behind velvet, water parting) and charges the final image when he plays as the water recedes. Sensory selection aligns with a musician’s bias (acoustics through water/air). Minor overt symbolism appears but doesn’t blunt the world’s specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to remain invisible/supporting or embrace disruptive, liminal music—intensifies through the descent and discovery. The meaningful tightening arrives with the hidden door and the choice to accept the ghost’s voice. Stakes remain primarily internal with limited palpable danger, so price feels conceptual rather than bodily or relational. Nevertheless, pressure coheres and grows to a credible stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Thematic weave (silence between notes, flooded liminality, unsung voices) is organic and reprises in the ending. However, several explicit statements (“real art lived,” “permission to exist in those between-spaces”) edge into moralizing and dull subtext in the final third. The images themselves carry the theme well when allowed. Resonance lingers, though more could be trusted to implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by a musician’s ear and the watery acoustics. Lyric cadence varies effectively, and focalization stays tight without leakage. Diction suits the mood without register drift, though a few lines tilt toward thesis-statement. Overall, confident, controlled voice under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line work is vivid and largely economical, with images doing multi-duty (program as lantern-lit flip-book; dress like a jellyfish). Some repetition (“between-spaces,” “water-damaged”) and occasional purple or summary sentences slow momentum slightly. Rhythm and syntax remain varied and clear, especially through the descent. Final image lands cleanly despite minor overstatement earlier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ghost story plus flooded opera house plus water-damage-as-code is a fresh synthesis executed with conviction. The communicative method, acoustical liminality, and instrument-as-voice twist feel non-obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric accumulative design, quiet conceptual closure) pay off. Minor thematic over-explication prevents a higher tier.</comment>
