<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Casper’s need for applause/possibility is concrete and governs each micro‑choice (coin to chest, flip, tying thread, walking the stage). Interiority is sensorially particular rather than labeled, and his collaboration with Lila reveals a lived relationship under pressure. The change—his outline sharpening and carrying an “endless encore”—reads as an earned reconfiguration. Slightly limited by minimal on‑page contradiction beyond want vs despair.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: echoes and threads densify into a present-tense reconfiguration (heartbeat/applause) with a felt price (Lila’s vanishing; continued invisibility). Orientation is clear early and remains stable (theater → maze → orchard stage). Closure lands on the page with a decisive cadence shift, though the cost is more bittersweet than wrenching.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theater/maze/orchard are richly tactile and synesthetic, with details integrated through action (coin pressed, maze narrowing, stage as ritual site). Environment constrains choices (maze “knows his longing,” garden center forces the rite) and charges the last image (orchard as hidden wing awaiting the next ghost‑light). Sensory specificity across smell/sound/texture elevates atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming possibility/memory) is signaled early and tightens through the woven ritual culminating in the heartbeat and applause. Agency drives the turn (coin + thread + stage work), not coincidence; Lila mid‑scene intensifies but doesn’t solve it for him. The cost is present but gentle; pressure rises more through density than jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory-as-performance, communal remembrance, and possibility vs despair surface through image and action (applause from leaves; orchard existing via mourners). The final repricing—an “endless encore” borne privately—reweights the premise without moralizing. One line edges toward thesis (“make them feel time is a song they almost remember”) but remains embodied enough to avoid didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a synesthetic perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with the ritual’s intensification. Dialogue is sparse but character‑specific and functional. POV is stable and confident; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Minor flourish risk, but the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; lines generally propel rather than stall. Figurative language is sustained but coherent within a synesthetic system; little redundancy or scaffold. No cadence templates or filter stacks; punctuation and syntax are clean. Slight purple glimmer in places but it doesn’t blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: stage ghost ritualized through a coin painted with tasted starlight, a maze that rearranges under longing, and an orchard applause. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the object/method ecology. Risk‑taking is purposeful and integrated, yielding an original final image. Minor familiarity in “ghost seeks encore” is fully transformed by execution.</comment>
