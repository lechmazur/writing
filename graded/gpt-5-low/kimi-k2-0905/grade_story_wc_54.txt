<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—engineering “equations for hope”—is clear and drives tactile choices (rerouting pumps, hacking a beacon). Interiority is character‑specific, filtered through an engineer’s lens. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a personal price beyond leaving without applause. Still, her micro‑choices reveal values with credible restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean accumulative structure moving from exploration to reactivation to public signal, culminating in a conceptually reweighted terminal (farewell → welcome). Because/therefore linkages are intact (sextant → manifold → beacons → REFUGE). Closure lands on the page; cost is modest but legible (labor, relinquishing the tool, departing unseen). The drive lens holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The spaceport’s architecture and detritus actively shape tactics (exposed irrigation, crew tunnel cache, balcony, UV beacons). The sextant and beacon function as micro‑settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her professional bias. World rules remain consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily conceptual (reconfigure a dead terminal into a refuge), and escalation is gentle: discovery → repurposing → signal. Agency drives each turn, but pressure lacks a sharp cost or live risk that forecloses options. The tightening is real (from private tinkering to public beacon), if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hope as redirected flow is dramatized through concrete acts; the final image reinterprets departure gates as arrival gates. The sextant’s transfer to a child and “datum zero” elegantly reframes the math as communal. A slight tendency to state the thesis (“if hope equals flow…”) trims subtlety, but resonance remains strong. The piece earns reflection through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct engineer‑lyric voice: precise, tactile, and quietly awed. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with POV; no head‑hopping. Compression serves momentum and image without obscuring sense. The “stoic wonder” tone modulates without flattening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High line‑level control: vivid images (“maze of intentions,” “drip not water but cool light”) carry multiple jobs. Figurative density is rich but coherent; minimal redundancy or scaffold. A couple of abstract formulations flirt with didacticism but do not slow the prose. Rhythm supports the accumulative build toward the beacon’s flare.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Ingenious synthesis: civil engineering as hope plumbing, sextant repurposed into a parabolic charger, nutrient lines rerouted to light. Fresh revaluation of transit spaces and labels (farewell → welcome) lands with inevitability. Risks a high‑concept lyric approach and makes it coherent. The object/setting interplay feels singular, not templated.</comment>
