<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Alden’s motive (keeping unspoken words) is clear, embodied in ritual and object-handling, and culminates in a credible renunciation (breaking his silence to commit). The internal contradiction—stay and mend versus leave and release—is legible and resolved with cost. Interiority is shown through his perception of ash/ghosts and tactile engagement with the box. Slight repetition of “tranquilly perceptive” softens edge but doesn’t harm the final choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual → new ghost → discovered fracture/dream → choice/vow → sealing. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the vow and placement of the box in the hive reconfigure stakes with cost. Orientation and rule-set are taught early and pay off. The fracture functions as a concrete pressure point tightening to the decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The oasis/apiary ruins and the stained glass box are vivid and functionally constraining; the object-as-setting charges the final image. Sensory specificity (ash like bees, smoke, clover scent at the end) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The world rules remain consistent and learned through action. Environment directly shapes the climactic choice and its imagery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve or release unspoken words) is set early; escalation arrives via the child’s transfer and the hairline fracture/dream. The choice forecloses a path and exacts a price (vow broken, long-term endurance pledged). Pressure grows coherently under the accumulative lens without needing multiple reversals. Quiet but unmistakable tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of covenant, memory, and the ethics of holding silence emerges organically through bees/comb/weight motifs. The final revaluation (“not a chain but a comb”) and the whispered vow reweight prior images without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and mute exchange, producing a resonant afterimage (clover scent). The insight feels earned through particulars, not dictum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature tied to bees, ash, and weight. Diction is consistent and modulates at the end for effect with the single spoken line. No head-hopping or stance drift; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. Rhythm supports pressure and cadence at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with purposeful metaphors that cohere to the beekeeping/smoke lexicon. Momentum holds; minimal scaffolding and no significant loops. One minor repetition (“tranquilly perceptive”) nicks freshness but not clarity. The closing image is crisp and unblurred by overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Ghost ecology via beekeeping, a stained-glass reliquary of unspoken words, and a covenant-as-comb synthesize into a fresh frame. Risks in tone and lyric density pay off with a specific, inevitable-feeling resolution. Turns arise from established pattern rather than late rule changes. Memorable particulars prevent template drift.</comment>
