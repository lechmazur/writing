<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied (lantern heat, counting steps), with credible contradictory impulses: intrusive flashback vs. professional steadiness. Her investigative micro‑choices under pressure (decoding tallies, extracting the box, deciding to include the unsanitized truth) align with motives. A few direct statements (“This was why she had taken the case”) edge toward telling, but they don’t undercut the earned shift. The final choice feels like an earned endurance/renunciation with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: descent → alcove → tallies → hidden journal → personal tie → decision. Orientation is firm early; the single‑scene investigation tightens logically around the discovery. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (choosing to speak truth beyond data), with a felt cost implied by the father tie. The father reveal is abrupt but plausible and thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tunnel is vivid and functional: iron rungs, alcove geography, darkness that the lantern actively counters. The environment and the lantern together shape perception and options, charging the final image. Details evolve with action (tallies discovered through touch; box behind a pipe) rather than static description. The setting’s metaphor (“throat”) skirts familiar but is contextually earned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth vs. complicity under lingering control—tightens at the journal find and the personal connection. The pressure remains coherent, interweaving external investigation and internal triggers. The cost is quieter (moral/existential), but the narrowing from “empirical only” to “tell the carved story” reads as a meaningful trade‑off. A slightly sharper on‑page risk would elevate the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong thematic braid: memory, control, complicity, and liberation refracted through the lantern and drought logistics. “The water remembers” reweights guilt and systems of power. A line near the end states the thesis outright (“didn’t require death, only the courage to speak the truth”), softening subtext. Despite that, the last image reframes the lantern’s purpose with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, measured cadence that matches Mara’s temperament. Sensory precision and selective metaphor create a perceptual signature without head‑hopping. Occasional explanatory sentences flatten the music briefly, but rhythm and stance hold. The modulation under stress (flashback hit, grounding via heat) is deft.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive sentences with good information density; sensory details do multiple jobs. A few familiar metaphors (“like a throat,” “bones picked clean”) and minor echoing do not stall momentum. Syntax varies well and the final line lands clean. No notable loops or filter‑verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of a preventable‑death investigation with drought politics, coerced engineers, and an Underground Railroad lantern is fresh and coherent. The memory motif is integrated tactically (triggered by environment) rather than as ornament. The arc favors quiet moral reconfiguration over a twist, which feels earned. Some imagery choices are conventional, but the overall synthesis is distinctive.</comment>
