<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and specific—she returns to inscribe a forbidden “cosmic verse” on her body—and every action flows from that drive. The internal contradiction (choosing absence yet compelled back) is dramatized rather than explained. Micro‑choices (dancing the gaps, coaxing dust, accepting bruised constellations) reveal values under pressure. Stakes feel personal and costly without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from first step to the final stanza as dust dwindles and dawn approaches. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she becomes the forbidden memory—paid for by exile, risk, and sacrificing the moonstone’s last grain. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the sunrise clock provides tightening. No causal breaks; the fountain/dust/sunrise cadence coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden and dry fountain are tactile, with crickets, dew, and starlight braided into action rather than set‑dressing. Environment and tools constrain choices: dawn will “seal the ink,” the fountain rim stages the dance, moonstone dust functions as a charged micro‑setting. World rules (nostalgia ban, censors) are learned through behavior, not exposition. The final image recharges the setting as stars “rearranging… into a dancer.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming memory/identity under a ban) tightens through the dwindling dust and the sunrise deadline. The “final verse demanded sacrifice” is the key escalation, narrowing options and making cost explicit. Resolution is earned by agency: she completes the stanza at her pulse and accepts the reconfigured self. Tension remains coherent without an antagonist, interweaving internal and external pressures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: body as archive against state erasure, exile redefined as interior vacancy that must be refilled. Recurring images (tide, anchoring, moonstone, gaps) shift meaning at the end, offering a non‑literal answer: she embodies the memory the world bans. No moralizing; resonance rests in concrete images and conceptual cost. The closing walk toward a long‑waiting horizon carries earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled POV with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit a ritualized act under pressure. Elision is purposeful and consistent; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. A few high‑density metaphors flirt with overload but remain legible and voice‑true. No dialogue needed; interior texture carries momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with strong verb choices and layered imagery that does multiple jobs. Minor risk of purple density (“obsidian grace,” multiple constellation metaphors) but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t stall. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies with purposeful cadence. The final lines sharpen rather than blur the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: authoritarian memory ban meets tide‑dance poetics and embodied constellations—distinct and memorable. Risks (lyric abstraction, world hints) pay off through concrete ritual and cost. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (dust to orbiting minnows to spent period). The vision reads singular rather than stitched from tropes.</comment>
