<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lysira’s motives—refusing propaganda, pursuing a covert reclamation of memory—are specific and embodied through dance and pain. Contradictory impulses (choosing absence yet being gnawed back by it) animate her. Micro-choices escalate (circling the fountain, summoning dust, committing lines to skin). The cost is legible in the depletion of contraband and the irreversible self-marking.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned actions (observing gaps, summoning dust) densify toward a charged reconfiguration. Closure lands when her skin becomes the “forbidden memory,” a before/after with cost (spent dust, permanent inscription, renewed risk under the ban). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the sunrise clock tightens the final beats. The final image reweights the world’s rules without breaking them.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The twilight garden is tactile (moss warmth, dew, long-dry fountain) and interacts with action (dew takes “prints of absence,” crickets’ hush shapes method). The moonstone dust functions as micro-setting/tool, charging the final image and constraining choices as it depletes. Sensory detail is rich across modalities, mostly integrated through her performer’s attention. A slight surplus of metaphor occasionally risks ornament, but spatial and rule coherence hold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim memory against the nostalgia ban—tightens via the dwindling dust and sunrise sealing the ink. Escalation is internally driven: each etched line raises commitment and narrows retreat. The final period “demanded sacrifice,” making cost explicit. Lack of an on-page antagonist is offset by coherent pressure from time, law, and resource scarcity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory as contraband and art as insurrection emerges through concrete acts (verses braided on skin, tides danced from absence). The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: she becomes the memory system the regime cannot confiscate. Recurring images (tide, moonstone, gaps) evolve in meaning at closure. No moralizing; the insight arrives through image and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent with a dancer’s sensory intelligence and defiant poise. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (faster cadence as she races sunrise). Purposeful elision is taught and maintained; no head-hopping. A few high-ornament lines flirt with excess but do not blur focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax and high information density per sentence. Figurative language is abundant but largely coherent and purposeful; a few stacked metaphors verge on purple yet maintain clarity. Momentum holds from setup through the sealing constraint. No loops or scaffold clutter distort the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “nostalgia ban” world and moonstone mirror-dust ritual feel freshly synthesized, not a veneer on a stock arc. The tactic—observing gaps to fledge words—reimagines resistance with specificity. The final reconfiguration (“becoming the forbidden memory”) feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk pays off without obscuring sense.</comment>
