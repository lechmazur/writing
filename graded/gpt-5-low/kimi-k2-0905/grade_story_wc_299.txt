<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is concrete and embodied, with contradictory impulses (hoarding the cloth vs. wanting to toss it) dramatized in scene. Her competence and shame coexist credibly, and the final choice to call the school is earned by the orange-speck memory turn. Actions align with motives across beats, and the cost (risking exposure after public failure) is felt. Secondary character pressure is minimal but functional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-POV, one-scene frame with clear anchors and a tight accumulative build from cloth → echo → speck memory → call. Closure lands as a decisive change (she initiates a workshop), with an implied cost of reentering a judged arena. Because/therefore linkages are clean even in lyric mode. The cost is present but a shade soft, keeping this just short of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The quarry trailer and valley are tactile and selective: diesel, dust, blast horn, and metal hush marry setting to motive and memory. Environment actively charges the final image—the valley’s echo reframes applause and prompts action; the cloth functions as micro-setting on the dash. Sensory hierarchy is roadie-specific, with sound shaping attention. Details are purposeful and evolve with the scene’s pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (purpose after public failure) is signaled early and tightens through the echo and the paint fleck, culminating in the phone call. Internal and external pressures braid well, though the on-page price is largely emotional rather than visibly consequential. The turn is earned and narrows options (choosing to reengage community over isolation). A small added friction or loss would have further sharpened cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of applause vs. being needed, resonance, and foundations emerge from particulars and reweight at the end. The line “Applause wasn’t the prize; being needed was” tips toward explicit moralizing and slightly flattens subtext in a late beat. Otherwise the echoes, dust, and cloth do the quiet work, inviting reflection without sermonizing. The final cadence retains ambiguity about future cost in a productive way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, sensorially biased toward sound, and consistent in free-indirect access. Lyric compression is controlled; register fits Mara’s world and state, with a few well-placed metaphors that serve character. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the narrative stance remains steady. Rhythm modulates effectively with pressure (the phone call’s crispness after lush description).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: vivid diction, varied syntax, and purposeful metaphors that rarely overreach. Minimal scaffolding and no loops; information density stays high with images doing double duty. A couple of figurative flourishes risk lushness but do not obscure clarity or momentum. The final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of a roadie-turned-appraiser in a quarry using acoustic echoes to reprice “applause.” The cloth and orange speck turn feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The quarry acoustics as applause is a memorable, non-obvious move. Risk-taking is measured and coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
