<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mason’s shame, stubborn craft, and longing are embodied in tactile choices (patching the mic with the relic scrap, speaking the unfinished set-list). His contradiction—clinging to a past token vs. sacrificing it to make something living—plays out on the page. Reactions and technical know-how feel character-specific rather than generic. Minor note: the foreman’s quick pivot slightly softens interpersonal pressure but doesn’t undercut Mason’s earned shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: humiliation → canceled contract → quarry office → envelope/Polaroid prompt → mic repair → echo test → new role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (relinquishing the souvenir’s status and risking voice). The Polaroid’s “If found, return the sound” cleanly motivates the attempt without deus ex machina. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; causality is tidy and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer and bowl create constraint and payoff: the PA system, the echo-lake geometry, the diesel-paper atmosphere, and the “office surplus” crate all shape choices. The setting charges the final image—the valley’s half-beat reply is only possible here. Detail selection reflects Mason’s sensibility (gear, voltages) and stays purposeful. Micro-setting as tool/environment fusion is exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on purpose and livelihood; they tighten as Mason chooses to risk voice and repurpose his last relic. The decisive deepening is the repair-and-broadcast, foreclosing nostalgia-as-keepsake for craft-as-conduit. External resistance is light, but internal pressure credibly escalates and the price is felt. The foreman’s arrival resolves socially without feeling coincidental because it’s drawn by the echo.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—after the applause, finding resonance through listening and repair, not spectacle—emerges through object work and setting rather than lecture. The scrap’s revaluation and the echo’s reply enact the thesis. The final sentences verge on direct statement but remain earned by prior images. Subtext around labor memory and archiving gives the piece breadth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person close carries a distinct, tactile lexicon (amps, +52V, safety earth) that reads as Mason’s mind. Rhythm modulates well from shame to craft to release; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare but functional and subtextual (the foreman’s request lands because of what we’ve just heard echo). Consistency and confidence never break plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, image-dense, and purposeful; figurative language (applause like summer thunder; valley delay) serves action and theme. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter; information density stays high. Technical diction is accurate and character-motivated. A few lyrical flourishes approach sentiment but are grounded by concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of roadie lore, appraisal work, and a quarry’s natural delay line is fresh and specific. The Polaroid prompt and “return the sound” thread synthesize into a non-obvious, inevitable-feeling pivot. Risk-taking (a quiet, craft-centered climax) pays off with clarity and resonance. The archive-of-workers’ voices extension widens stakes without feeling grafted.</comment>
