<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rowan’s motive—learning the “rhythm of repair”—is clear, embodied, and drives every micro‑choice under pressure. His doubt and grief complicate competence, culminating in a costly choice to step through and accept a new role. Interiority is precise and character‑particular, not generic. Slight safety lies in the near‑tidy emotional calibration at the end, but the cost (door sealed, past foreclosed) keeps it earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: prophecy → search → failed gear tests → mirror insight → key repaired → door/chamber → irrevocable step. Closure lands on page with cost: the doorway vanishes and he accepts custodianship—an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid. Setups (eclipse-timed lock, broken key) pay off cleanly without coincidence solving the problem. Orientation is crisp from line one; no penalties.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen library and mirror hall aren’t postcard backdrops; cold, frost, and reflective variance directly shape tactics and the solution. Tools and micro‑setting (rimed mirrors, black bronze door, eclipse key) constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑biased (a locksmith’s lexicon). Consistency of world rules (mirror as better‑draft archive) is learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens: failed humming, mocking reflections, then the reversal via recognizing asynchronous mirrors to heal the key. The cost and narrowing are clear—time bound to totality, and the eventual sealing‑in. Escalation stems from Rowan’s agency rather than luck. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential, with internal and external threads interlocking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Repair as forgiveness emerges organically through object work and choice, not moralizing; the final line reweights the entire premise. Recurring images (ticks, eclipse, key, mirrors) shift valence from control to acceptance. The workshop scene reframes grief into custodianship without sentimentality. Ambiguity remains where it should (what is lost to gain this rhythm), deepening resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is controlled, sensorial, and locksmith‑specific without drifting registers. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and elisions are purposeful and paid off. No head‑hopping or stance confusion; focalization remains tight to Rowan’s perceptions. A few ornate phrasings skate close to purple but stay legible and motivated by mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet propulsive; sentences typically do multiple jobs and avoid scaffold. Figurative language is mostly coherent and patterned (ice, reflection, cadence), with minimal redundancy. A couple of heightened phrases (“hauntingly bright,” “driftwood nostalgia”) risk lushness but don’t blur causality or the closure image. Mechanics are clean and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—using a hall of mirrors to restore a broken eclipse key and reprice repair as forgiveness—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Genre elements are transformed by specific craft detail and a distinctive sensibility. The mirror’s “better drafts” rule is an elegant, original engine for both plot and theme. Risk‑taking in imagery and premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
