<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s competence, ear for walks, and tactile map‑work motivate clean, specific choices; the stranger’s legacy pressure is credible. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted—Mira adapts smoothly with little visible cost. Relationship dynamics are steady and respectful, not quite crucible‑hot. The final realization feels earned but largely conceptual rather than wrested through struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single‑scene causality is clear: storm disables GPS → maps/ear guide them → whisper‑key sequence opens the chamber → conceptual repricing of the labyrinth’s purpose. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, held through the resonance motif to closure. Closure lands on‑page via discovery and reframed purpose, though cost is conceptual rather than visceral. No orientation debt; the early anchors are strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The container labyrinth, auroral storm, and acoustics are vivid and purpose‑driven; the environment directly shapes tactics (whispers over shouts, GPS failure, resonance at the star junction). Details are filtered through Mira’s professional bias (creases as topography, metal vibrations), integrating world with action. The setting charges the final image—the chamber of keys/coins under harmonic surge. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around proving the whisper network amid storm constraints; escalation arrives with the seven‑corridor star, the three‑whisper challenge, and harmonic surge. Opposition is minimal and largely environmental; risks/readable prices remain modest. The key turn is protagonist‑driven and reweights options. Strong deepening, light cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of quiet power vs. noisy modernity emerges organically through action and objects (maps, whisper lock, coins). The intergenerational network offers resonant subtext. However, the explicit thesis line (“sometimes the quietest voices travel farthest”) edges into moralizing, blunting subtlety. The ending still reweights prior material with a clear conceptual aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a distinct perceptual signature: the ear for walks, tool‑focused noticing, and clean, subtext‑carrying dialogue. Voice modulates aptly with the storm’s intensification without register drift. Speech patterns distinguish the academic stranger from the seasoned worker. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is precise, rhythmic, and economical; images like “corrugated corridors” and “topography of dead ends” do double duty. Minor repetition of whisper/echo imagery skirts purple but remains purposeful. Syntax varies and momentum holds through discovery. No loops or artifact scaffolding drag the final beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The acoustic‑machine labyrinth, sound‑key, and whisper network under aurora create a fresh synthesis. Turns arise from established particulars (maps, ear, storm), not late rule changes. Emotional truth—legacy, craft knowledge, quiet communication—grounds the novelty. It takes a meaningful risk in concept and commits cleanly.</comment>
