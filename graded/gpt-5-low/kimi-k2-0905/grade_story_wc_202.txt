<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear motive (seeking “overlooked histories”) drives concrete choices: pausing at the stall, leaning into the painting, stepping through, and relinquishing the shard. The internal tension—keeper vs. returner—registers in the cost of letting go, even if resistance is understated. Interiority is specific and embodied (copper/salt taste, rope‑sway vertigo). The renunciation feels earned by the boy‑self recognition and the mother’s maxim.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural progression tightens from market observation → painting’s micro‑detail cue → portal crossing → return and renunciation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (giving up the fragment and identity shift from “translator” to “listener”). Orientation is clean from the first lines; the pattern (hidden details as doors) is taught and paid off. Final images (makeshift lighthouse, laughing children) are causally and thematically reweighted by the exchange.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The market, rope bridges, and rooftop city are vivid, sensorial, and consequential (sway/vertigo, exit bridge, altitude). The recurring object (lens fragment) functions as micro‑setting, charging choice and the last images. World rules (paintings unfasten time via details) are taught through action rather than exposition. Atmosphere supports the tide/lantern/light motif without feeling ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring histories by returning what was taken—tightens decisively upon recognizing the boy‑self and stepping through. The protagonist’s agency determines outcome; the price is explicit: loss of the fragment and a relinquished role. Tension scales via the painting’s tilt and the consequent identity re‑frame at the end. The conflict remains coherent without needing an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, return, and memory cohere through recurring light/sea/market images and culminate in a felt repricing of “keeping” as “letting go.” Subtext works through action (the exchange) and images (spiraled lanterns, makeshift lighthouse), lingering beyond the page. Slight explicitness (“intuition is not a compass but a tide,” “We keep the light by letting it go”) edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, shaving subtlety. The resonance still lands due to the specificity of the final images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, singular lyric voice with strong perceptual signature (scent/taste of copper and salt, rope‑hum, pigment‑warm dusk). Distance and tense remain stable; brief dialogue is natural and purposeful. Rhythm modulates effectively at the crossing and closure without head‑hopping. Diction feels character‑bound and consistent with the world’s texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is polished, varied, and propulsive; images often carry multiple jobs (setting, motive, theme). A few repeated locutions (“elusively tangible”) and aphoristic lines flirt with overstatement but do not blur sense. No scaffold or synonym loops; clarity remains intact in peak beats. Final cadence cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The alchemist’s market above roofs, paintings as temporal doors via hidden details, and a translator of “almost‑lost” voices synthesize into a fresh, inevitable turn. The exchange with one’s child‑self feels both surprising and prepared by prior particulars. Risk‑taking in structure and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The vision reads singular rather than stitched from tropes.</comment>
