<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mireya’s motivation is crystalline and embodied (“decode… before the arbor drifted”), and her occupational habits color every choice. Interiority is particular (mossy humming, seed‑sorting to calm), but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers. Micro‑choices (prodding bark, weighting leaves with monuments) reveal values without speechifying. The change at the end is credible but paid with minimal personal cost beyond fatigue and risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: beats accrue via leaf‑syllables, monuments, and a keyleaf that completes twelve, leading to on‑page DC (naming) and visible effect (rain, descent). Orientation is clean from the first sentence; causality is consistent. Cost is modest but present in the ticking clock (tree rising, wind) and her physical risk aloft. The reveal line borders on mechanical (“The forgotten thing…”) but the sequence earns the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor shapes tactics (climbing, wind exposure, need to weight leaves) and charges the final image (hovering above wheat, descending). Sensory integration is rich across modalities (soot taste, bark exhale, nettle‑iron rain). Details are filtered through a seed sorter’s eye, giving purposeful specificity. Environment and objects constrain choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode before drift) is clear; escalation arrives via the rising arbor, the gust, and the keyleaf completing twelve. Agency drives resolution (prodding, weighting, assembling, naming), and coincidence only complicates. The price—time pressure and physical risk—is felt but gentle; there’s little foreclosed alternative beyond failure. Still, the cadence tightens and resolves cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Reciprocity, memory, and covenant emerge organically from concrete acts (monuments, weighted leaves), and the final image reweights those motifs. However, the explicit thesis line (“The forgotten thing is the covenant…”) and the named moral (“Reciprocity”) undercut subtext in the final third. Resonance persists via the transformed landscape and seed‑gleam, but the moralizing trims ambiguity. Thematic integration is strong despite that blunt statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close has a distinct perceptual signature—botanical, tactile, ritual—and remains stable. Rhythm modulates with pressure without opacity; images are purposeful rather than ornamental. Spoken lines are minimal and effective, not breaking distance control. Diction coheres with the character’s world and skill.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet controlled; most metaphors align with the physical logic and POV. No evident loops or scaffold, and syntax varies with momentum. A few intensifiers risk purple (“mossy delight,” “drinking moonlight under the sunless sky”) but remain legible and motivated. The closure beat reads cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The concept—ciphered leaves, moonstone dust monuments, and a skyborne arbor—feels singular, with tactics and outcomes growing from those specifics. The keyleaf and “twelve syllables” ground a fresh myth mechanics. Only the direct thematic utterance nudges it toward the familiar; otherwise the synthesis is striking and cohesive. Risk‑taking enhances coherence and payoff.</comment>
