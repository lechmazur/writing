<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (companionship refracted through “learning buildings”) and a credible shift to keeper/teacher land with cost as the tutor dissipates. Interiority is specific and embodied through tools and textures (seal, soot, stress fractures). The relationship dynamics with the tutor and the Mrs. Chen coda sharpen the protagonist’s loneliness without sentimentality. Slight softness: acceptance of the role comes smoothly with limited on‑page resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: meteor shower → seal → gargoyle speaks → tutor vanishes → narrator assumes role. Orientation is crisp from the rooftop arrival; the magical rules (meteors in hexameter, buildings speak via stress) are taught through action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (loss of tutor; inheritance of burden/“agreed upon lies”). The final “stay” reprises and reweights the premise without a mechanical tie‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, gargoyle, and meteor shower are not décor; they shape the ritual and the final image (“stay” on the window; garden as crown burden). Object‑as‑setting (desk seal) functions as a tool that charges space and choice. Sensory selection is purposeful (steam as incense, soot memory), maintaining tone and POV bias. World rules remain consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to listen and assume the keeper role—tightens through the interrogation of the gargoyle and the tutor’s vanishing. The cost (solitude, responsibility, polite erasures kept) is legible at the end. Escalation is gentle but distinct: meteors intensify, language clarifies, agency shifts to the narrator. It’s more deepening than reversal, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Agreed upon lies,” memory vs. erasure, and care‑as‑translation braid through concrete acts (borrowing sugar, the mislabeled thermos, the seal imprint). The concluding “stay” reframes comfort as complicity, a conceptual repricing that lingers. No sermonizing; insights arise from particulars (future perfect of walls, gargoyle’s accent). The Mrs. Chen beat widens the theme without diffusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled first‑person voice with an architectural‑linguistic lexicon remains stable and apt. Rhythms modulate with pressure; images are precise and character‑filtered. Dialogue is minimal but charged (gargoyle’s single welcome). No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (meteors as hexameter; steam as script). Figurative language is coherent to the domain; repetition (“agreed upon lie,” “stay”) is patterned, not looped. Line rhythm varies, and there’s little scaffold. Any purple edges are disciplined by motif and action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tutors of dead languages as summoned needs; buildings speaking via stress; meteors scanning in Latin hexameter. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (seal → interrogation → vocation). Risks (lyric mode, conceptual closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
