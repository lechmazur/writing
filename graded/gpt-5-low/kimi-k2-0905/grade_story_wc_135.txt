<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—restore a city by assembling what was scattered—drives concrete choices (seek records, secure trumpet parts, persuade the woman) and reveals a principled, wounded competence. Interiority is specific and embodied (“salt crust,” “valve…absence of sound louder than any note”). The request to “hearten” conflicts with the bitterness of erasure, and the final act carries cost in relinquishing guarded silence. Secondary characters apply pointed pressure without diluting focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear because/therefore chain: exile returns; needs records; therefore seeks trumpet parts; therefore must gain entry; therefore must persuade mouthpiece‑keeper; therefore the note. The closure lands on the page with a decisive act that reconfigures the city’s sonic landscape. Cost is legible in the woman’s surrender and the narrator’s risk of public breath after erasure. The causal spine is tight despite lyric texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: storm‑drunk bell, ink pooling, gutters singing, cliff cemetery. The tool-as-setting (trumpet components) constrains choices and charges the final image. Environmental particulars evolve causally (rain causes staggered intervals, dictating the piece’s cadence logic). Specificity feels lived rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a fractured city be heartened—tightens through obtaining and assembling the missing parts, culminating in persuading the vigil-keeper. The mid‑story turn (gaining access to “Possible Music,” then learning the mouthpiece is with the woman) narrows options. The final breath is a chosen risk that forecloses the path of private, silent endurance. Prices (memory relic surrendered; public exposure) are felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Absence, fragments, and reconstitution accrue into a resonant answer: communal heartening requires recombining dispossessed parts at personal cost. Recurring images (valve, staggered intervals, outlawed language) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The promise to “compile the echo” reframes archiving as an ethical act, not mere record‑keeping. Ambiguity remains humane rather than foggy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature; metaphors are coherent and character‑bound. POV is stable and confident, with dialogue carrying subtext (the clerk’s condition; the woman’s “taste of exile”). Rhythmic modulation mirrors pressure, culminating in the breath “through staggered intervals.” No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; lines often perform multiple jobs (world, theme, and pressure). Figurative language is rich yet disciplined, with no muddy or mixed vehicles. Variation in sentence rhythm supports momentum to the closing image. No paraphrase loops or artifact drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise and lexicon (“Possible Music,” “reactively visionary,” “ivory harbor”) feel singular and integrated, not quirky for its own sake. The trumpet’s reassembly as civic reassembly is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk—melding bureaucratic satire with elegiac lyric—pays off without obscuring clarity. The final tone folding into doorways is an ingenious closure image.</comment>
