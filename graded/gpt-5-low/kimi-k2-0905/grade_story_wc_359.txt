<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (to certify wonder) drives concrete micro‑choices (reading auroral glyphs with skin; angling the wrist; timing the strike). Interiority is embodied through synesthetic perception rather than labels. Internal contradiction is light—duty vs. awe hints at tension but rarely forces a fraught trade‑off. The gift exchange with the sculptor adds grace, not pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single, coherent scene with a live clock culminating in a simultaneous strike delivers on‑page closure with cost (bell cracked; world reweighted). Because/therefore linkages are clean: glyphs → tuning → poised strike → fused impacts → release. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) holds. The trailing fragment (“The amber music sheet, now”) is a line‑level slip but doesn’t break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ice cavern, glacier‑cut bell, amber sheet, and under‑ice aurora are richly sensory and function as constraints and tools that shape tactics. Environment directly conditions the act (striking through auroral color; echo trapped in glacier) and charges the final images (cracked bell; listening quiet). Details remain POV‑biased and purposeful. Scale and spatial logic stay clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit and pressured by a precise timing constraint; escalation tightens toward the single, irrevocable strike. The price lands (bell cracked; world altered), and the protagonist’s agency drives the outcome. Stakes skew conceptual more than perilous, so jeopardy feels serene rather than harrowing. Still, the cadence shift at impact is decisive and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—wonder vs. utility/ornament—emerges through action and image (sound carving hush; aurora nested in snowflakes) and is reweighted at the end. A touch of declarative statement (“Wonder, now unfettered…”) flirts with telling but the surrounding imagery keeps it earned. The final listening‑quiet and humming earth offer resonant repricing without moralizing. Complexity lingers in the crack/certification pairing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a stable close third‑person focalization; synesthetic idiom feels integral, not ornamental. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure, peaking at the fused impacts. No head‑hopping; compression is taught and legible. Minor overrichness occasionally grazes purple but preserves clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is largely precise and musical, with multi‑tasking sentences and minimal redundancy. However, density of figurative language stays high even in peak beats, and a terminal fragment (“The amber music sheet, now”) reads like an accidental truncation. That artifact in the final third dampens the afterimage and bars higher bands. Otherwise, mechanics and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strikingly original synthesis—synesthetic bell ringer, auroral score, glacier‑forged bell, and the bureaucratic‑mythic act of certifying wonder—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction pay off with coherent world logic and a fresh closure image (quiet that listens back). Emotional truth rides the lyric premise without gimmickry. Minor familiarity in a couple of metaphors doesn’t dent the distinctive core.</comment>
