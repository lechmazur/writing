<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular: she must teach darkness to value stars, and she does so through micro‑choices (adjusting shutters by fractions, resisting the urge to speak). The internal contradiction—“the secret pressed... wanting to be spoken” versus her chosen silence—generates lived tension. Backstory (the canal took her voice) personalizes the cost and informs present tactics. The earned stasis at dawn feels credible: she accepts the daily reweaving despite fatigue and forgetting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: shutter codes, mirror use, and darkness’s responsiveness thicken toward a cadence shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: darkness learns to hold light; she transfers the secret and accepts ongoing maintenance. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp by the opening lines. The cost is conceptual but legible on the page (her silence/endurance; stars’ ephemerality), avoiding an explain‑everything tie‑off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canal, cobalt dock after rain, shutters, and wet stones are tactically used to shape choices (angles, reflections, ripples). The dental mirror functions as a charged micro‑setting tool that constrains action and culminates in the final image (the captured star). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, not touristic. World rules (darkness responding to vibration/light) are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent and early: can she teach darkness without breaking her silence. Pressure tightens through the secret’s urge to be spoken and the increasing complexity of shutter patterns, culminating in the mirror pressed to her chest. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial but still narrows options (speak and scatter the code vs endure and complete the transfer). The felt price is endurance and daily reweaving rather than a dramatic reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as empathy reframes darkness from malice to loneliness, rendered via action (vibration transfer, light patterns) rather than moralizing. Recurring images (mirror, shutters, spirals) accrue meaning and reweight at the end. One near‑explicit sentence (“darkness was not evil but lonely”) risks didacticism but is earned by the concrete preceding sequence. The final charged poise honors complexity: understanding must be renewed daily.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—measured, image‑driven, with disciplined distance. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; modulation tightens as the ritual intensifies (mirror hum, pressing to chest). Diction is consistent and apt for the fable‑like register. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful repetition (spirals, shutters) that advances meaning. Figurative language is coherent and anchored to concrete action; minimal redundancy. A few phrases verge on overt statement but do not dull the closure image. Rhythm supports the stillwater tension without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: a canal guardian using a dental mirror and shutter codes to teach darkness through silent empathy. The method, object, and theme interlock with conceptual integrity and a non‑obvious moral calculus (endurance over declaration). The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in premise and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
