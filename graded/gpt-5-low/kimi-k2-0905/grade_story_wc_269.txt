<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s motives—witnessing, caretaking, and following the summons—are clear and her choices (prying the panel, diving, sacrificing the page) align with them. Grief and duty subtly conflict, though interior contradiction could be sharper under peak pressure. Her conceptual shift from proving loss to remembering the way back is earned and character-specific. Embodied detail (tapping, handling gear) reveals her under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: anomalous tapping → atlas fragment → hydrophone signal → dive → pillars → activation → reframed role. Orientation is strong from the first line and the accumulative pattern holds through closure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a concrete price (relinquishing the page and accepting a new burden). A hairline limit is that peril and logistical costs of the dive are largely implied rather than pressured on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and particular—the stilted station, hydrophone static, thermocline, carved limestone—filtered through a professional gaze. Tools and environment constrain action (solitary station, hydrophone, single-person sub) and charge the final image (station as “gate left ajar”). World rules feel consistent without exposition sprawl. The station and sea act as micro-settings that shape choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering why the path disappeared) tightens through the underwater discovery and the choice to insert the page. Escalation is primarily knowledge-deepening rather than danger-tightening, but it coheres under the accumulative lens. The price—losing the artifact and accepting a renewed, solitary watch—reads, though physical risk is soft-pedaled. The protagonist’s agency drives the meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure and witness as keeper of return routes arises from concrete acts and motifs (tapping, maps, submerged data). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: not proof of loss, but a living archive waiting for the right reader. The “periodically eternal” cadence gains ethical resonance at the end. Subtext of human custodianship under ecological grief lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with a consistent perceptual signature; diction is marine-technical where needed and sensorially precise. Rhythm modulates well between stillness and descent. No dialogue, but the internal voice maintains control and focus under pressure. A few metaphor heights approach purple but stay anchored to action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (atlas as relic and key; tapping as ritual and code). Minimal scaffolding and strong cadence; sentences push the scene forward. Figurative language is rich but generally coherent; no loops or filler. A couple of decorative phrases flirt with excess, but clarity at the climax holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of climate grief, archival tech, and ritual code; the atlas-page key to a data-reef is striking and earned. The tapping motif as both habit and handshake with the seafloor is inventive. Risks taken in tone and imagery pay off without obscuring coherence. The mythic-ceremonial architecture under a scientific frame reads original rather than derivative.</comment>
