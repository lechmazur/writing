<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s duty-bound, grief-tempered motivation is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (prying the panel, launching the sub, inserting the page). Interiority is textured and embodied without therapy-speak. The contradiction—witness of loss versus keeper of a way back—lands at closure. Slight ease in decoding the mystery keeps it short of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong accumulative structure: tapping → hollow panel → atlas → hydrophone pings → descent → pillar mechanism → conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands on-page with the page sealed and the role redefined. The underwater tech is a bold turn but sufficiently foreshadowed by the rhythmic code. Cost is felt via relinquishment and duty, not spectacle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the station’s tools and isolation dictate tactics; the ocean layers (lagoon, thermocline, ridge) stage each turn. Recurring objects (sensors, hydrophone, sub, pillars) constrain choices and charge the final image of the station as a “gate left ajar.” Sensory detail stays purposeful and POV-filtered. World rules feel consistent within a lyrical eco‑SF mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering a disappeared path) is signaled and tightens through the answering taps and the descent. Escalation is knowledge- and pattern-driven rather than peril-driven, fitting the lens. The decisive act (inserting the page) narrows options and triggers irreversible change. Cost is quieter than visceral, but legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing beyond proof, memory as re-seeding—emerges from particulars (tapping, maps, pillars storing ecosystems). The ending reframes the role from archivist of loss to guide for regrowth without moralizing. Recurring images reprice meaning (“three short, two long,” “drifting moored”). Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature (marine lexicon, ritualized action). Rhythm modulates with pressure—hushed at the surface, taut in descent, spacious at revelation. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful. High polish without over-ornament.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lean for lyric mode: images do double duty and propel momentum. Metaphors are apt and coherent (“reef like broken teeth,” “atlas page…like a gull with a broken wing”). No paraphrase loops or scaffold; sentence variety supports flow. Diction stays consistent with the POV’s world.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Eco‑mythic SF with ritual code as key to a data‑reef is a fresh synthesis. The twist reads inevitable in hindsight via the tapping motif and page-slot fit. Risk-taking heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
