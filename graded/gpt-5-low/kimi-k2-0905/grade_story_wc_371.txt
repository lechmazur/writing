<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mila’s motive—resisting the city’s erasure—drives clear, tangible choices (refusing to eat the loaf; planting it instead). Interiority is specific and embodied (“heuristically gentle,” “tears salting the crust”). The gardener provides a subtle crucible that reframes guilt into action. Slight limitation: Mila’s flaws remain emblematic rather than personally thorny beyond the mission.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the loaf discovery → planting → sprouting → unclocked mosaics → reopened bakery form a coherent, tightening sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (secrecy, restraint, vigilance). Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality cheats. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional, but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: intersections with asphalt scars dictate where memory can be “uncloaked,” and the secret tea house supplies ally, cover, and method. Sensory specificity (paper lanterns, mosaic gods, flour ghosts) is purposeful and filtered through Mila’s noticer sensibility. World rules remain consistent and learned through action. The environment meaningfully charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—countering creeping normality—intensifies through the guerrilla plantings, the shoots’ emergence, and the frost-night reveal. The meaningful tightening is Mila’s decision to plant (foreclosing the immediate comfort of eating) and to persist quietly under scrutiny. Cost is present as risk of failure, secrecy, and ongoing vigilance rather than overt peril. Tension is steady, if quietly scaled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The piece articulates a rich theme—sacred in the ordinary; absolution as cultivation—through concrete acts with evolving meaning (bread → seedlings → mosaics → reopened bell). Subtext hums in the gardener’s line (“Guilt rises like yeast; plant it”) and in the commuters’ half-noticing. The ending’s conceptual repricing is earned and lingers without moralizing. One line (“bread is daily resurrection”) edges toward statement but remains grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular, lyrical third-person voice maintains stable distance and perceptual bias; “heuristically gentle” and “breadcrust armor” feel distinctive, not generic. Dialogue is minimal yet charged, with subtext carrying meaning. Rhythm modulates effectively between hush and revelation. No head-hopping or register slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is controlled: images do multiple jobs, and the prose avoids scaffolding and synonym loops. Lushness is purposeful, not purple, with varied syntax and strong verbs. A few intensifiers recur (“tenuous,” “uncloak”), but they support pattern, not bloat. Final cadence resolves with a clean, charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a “creeping normality noticer” weaponizing bread via guerrilla gardening to restore memory is both novel and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in premise and diction cohere and heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The reweighting at the mosaics and bell turn transforms the conceit into a lived ethic. Emotional truth grounds the magic.</comment>
