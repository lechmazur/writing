<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (“scheming pacifist”) drives every beat, and her contradiction—teaching release while harboring resentment—peaks credibly in the shadow-Lira confrontation. Interiority is embodied through the tactile music box and somatic recall. The choice to absorb her own anger and leave the box reads as a costly renunciation. Minor limitation: secondary figures (soldier, girl) are evocative but function mainly as mirrors.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the sanctuary’s rules and the music box pattern escalate to the shadow-Lira turn and resolve in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise final image. Closure lands on the page with cost (music box broken beyond song; Lira metabolizes her own anger; she leaves the tool). Orientation is clear from the outset and remains stable despite the surrealism. Because/therefore linkages are implicit but coherent across image sequences.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary’s breathing walls and “reappears when needed” rule constrain action and charge the ending. The music box functions as micro‑setting/tool that governs tactics and the final image. Environmental shifts mirror internal loosening without feeling schematic. Spatial and rule consistency are maintained under the surreal logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure meaningfully tightens when shadow‑Lira appears and the pin snaps further, forcing Lira to pay a price by taking in the pain she condemned. The dominant stake—convincing war‑ghosts via non‑force—converges with her internal reckoning. Resolution grows from her choice and forecloses the easier path of unilateral fixing. Stakes stay intimate but feel consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of release versus resentment is earned through specific somatic memories and the object’s failure, not summaries. The “teaching peace” thesis risks abstraction once (“calculus of vengeance…zero”) but the images re-anchor it. The ending reweights the premise: the lesson resides in turning a damaged wheel, not producing sound. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with controlled cadence suits the meditative stakes; psychic distance is stable. The single sharp dialogue line from the double cuts cleanly and escalates pressure. Diction stays coherent to the piece’s ritual/surreal register. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: images are fresh, syntax varied, and momentum maintained. Figurative density is high but purposeful, with few mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffolding dull closure; the final sentences land cleanly. A couple of abstractions flirt with purple but do not obscure sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of somatic memory, a broken music box, and a metaphysically responsive sanctuary feels singular and inevitable by the end. The shadow-self turn is an earned intensification rather than a gimmick. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without harming clarity. Memorable images and a non-obvious moral calculus distinguish the piece.</comment>
