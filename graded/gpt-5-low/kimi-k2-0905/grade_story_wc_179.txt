<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s desire to “convince the war-ghosts” is clear and actions align, and her interior contradiction crystallizes when the shadow-Lira forces her to metabolize her own resentment. Embodied moments—dog bandaging, strawberries, cellar—ground emotion credibly. The renunciation (leaving the broken box, embracing pain) exacts a felt cost. Minor abstraction in “cellular memory” is redeemed by concrete enactment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: each ghost’s release builds to the counter-pressure of the sanctuary’s demand for balance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the box breaks beyond music, Lira accepts pain, and the sanctuary stills. Causality is coherent within the established rules (sanctuary “accepts currency,” shadow as balance). Cost is legible on the page at the climax and in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary’s mutable rules and the tactile music box function as setting constraints; the broken pin directly shapes tactics and the final image. Sensory specificity (walls breathing, gunpowder residue in spirit skin) is purposeful and POV-filtered. Environmental transformations mirror internal loosening without feeling like mere symbolism. The place’s rule of reappearance charges the final beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: can pacifism release the grip of resentment here. Pressure escalates when the pin snaps further and the sanctuary conjures shadow-Lira, narrowing options to a painful inward turn. The price—absorbing the burn of bombs, surrendering the box’s song—is clear and reconfigures tactics. Resolution flows from Lira’s agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness, memory-as-body, and balance emerge through images and choices rather than moralizing. The “currency of recalled tenderness” motif accrues and is reweighted when Lira must apply it to herself. One declarative line (“Lira’s scheme was simple…”) brushes thesis-y but is grounded by subsequent action. The ending’s quiet charged poise invites reflection without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyrical cadence; diction and images suit the surreal frame and Lira’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well through intensification (pin snapping, shadow confrontation) to the hush of the ending. No head-hopping or stance slippage. Elision is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut and musical; images work in concert and avoid mixed metaphors. High density supports momentum with minimal redundancy; sentences often do double-duty. A few lush phrases risk purple but remain coherent and purposeful. The final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a “scheming pacifist” leveraging bodily kindness-memory to disarm war-ghosts within a self-balancing sanctuary. The shadow-self as cost mechanism is elegant and earned. The broken music box as method/limit is fresh and crucial. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
