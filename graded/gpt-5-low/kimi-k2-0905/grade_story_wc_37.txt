<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, urgent motivation (rekindle the realm) drives concrete micro‑choices—singing despite fracture, using the mica, and finally self‑wounding to recover memory. Interiority is embodied and particular (“phosphor that stung like remembered joy,” shards in ribs). Internal contradiction—amnesia vs. purpose, solo will vs. need for chorus—registers under pressure. Slight archetypal flatness beyond role keeps this shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Structure tightens cleanly: attempt (solo lullaby) → complication (tarry vines, broken mica) → decisive turn (self‑wounding, recovered name) → reconfigured tactic (canon inviting mirrors). Closure lands with visible cost and a felt before/after: night scab lifted, dawn self‑sustaining. The accumulative lens holds, with causal beats linking each escalation. Orientation is clear from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse and mirror rules are vivid, specific, and functional (obsidian panes, alembics, tarry vines) and they constrain choices and tactics. The mica window functions as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image and choices. World rules are learned through action (songs weave dawns; mirrors must reflect others). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the keeper’s aim.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving the realm) is tested on the page with one strong tightening: the attack that breaks the mica forces a higher‑cost choice. The self‑inflicted wound and shift to communal canon mark earned adaptation, not coincidence. Pressure remains coherent from silence → chorus → sunlight breach. Visible prices and narrowed options make the peak turn credible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of interdependence and communal memory emerges organically through the act of singing one another’s verses and the mirror’s refusal to reflect others’ light. The recurring objects/images (mica, woven dawns, tarry scab) reweight meaning at the end. One line states thesis a bit baldly (“Understanding bloomed…”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall resonance is strong and earned by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically confident with a consistent perceptual signature and controlled modulation under stress. Diction fits the mythic register and remains coherent with the POV. Occasional explanatory phrasing edges toward summary but does not disrupt distance or clarity. No dialogue needed; narrative rhythm supports escalation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is rich and precise; images pull multiple duties without obvious scaffold. Metaphoric density is high but pattern‑consistent and legible, avoiding muddle. Minor moments verge on purple, yet momentum holds and no loops or template cadence undermine the climax. Final lines compress with clean propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard, mica window, and woven dawns synthesize into a fresh, coherent mythos. The self‑wounding to turn solo song into communal canon is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in imagery and conceit heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
