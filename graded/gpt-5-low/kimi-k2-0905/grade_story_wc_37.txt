<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—she aims to rekindle the realm—and her choices escalate credibly (singing, conducting, then wounding herself with the mica). Embodied moments land (“phosphor that stung like remembered joy,” “voice cracked yet stubborn”). Internal contradiction is present but light; she wavers at the missing chorus but largely operates as a resolved figure rather than a conflicted one. The final renunciation—letting the community keep her name—reads earned and paid for with bodily cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: song → orchard responds → vines attack → self-wounding/name recollection → canon that invites reflections → dawns erupt. Closure lands on-page with cost (shards in ribs, blood/mica fusion) and a Decisive Change for the world. The Global Drive Lens reads primarily Causal with lyric accumulation, held through closure. Orientation is clear early (who/where/goal) and strengthens the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse and its rules are vivid and functional—alembics, quicksilver roots, obsidian panes—shaping options and supplying pressure (tarry vines, the membrane-wrapped space). The mica window and glass environment constrain tactics and charge the final image (mica dust fused with flesh; greenhouse as transplanted heart). Sensory detail is specific and POV-filtered without becoming a static tour. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive a dying realm) is signaled early and tightened by the missing chorus and the night’s active resistance. The reversal/tightening beat—vines lashing and the window shattering—forces a costlier tactic (self-wounding, name-return-as-refrain). The shift to a canon that demands mutual reflection constitutes a meaningful deepening rather than a lucky solve. Prices are legible and carried into the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres around communal memory, reciprocity of reflection, and song as social fabric, culminating in the canon that “begged every reflection to sing its neighbor’s verse.” Recurring objects and images reweight at the end (mica, woven dawns, greenhouse as heart). One line articulates the thesis overtly—“the realm was dying because every mirror refused to reflect another’s light”—dulling subtext slightly. Overall, resonance is earned through particulars and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close carries a distinct perceptual signature, with controlled cadence that tightens under pressure. Diction remains coherent and character-bound, and modulates effectively at peaks (from hush to bell-like vibration). No head-hopping or stance drift; purposeful compression is taught early and maintained. Minor flourish excess aside, voice is confident and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is strong, with high information density and purposeful images doing multiple jobs. A few stretches verge on purple or stack figurative layers (“tin foil scales,” “clockwork seeds ticking backward,” “tarry vines”) but clarity holds. Rhythm varies well, and there’s minimal scaffold or loop. Final images are clean and charged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical greenhouse, mirror-world reciprocity, and song as reparative technology feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Key turns arise from established elements (mica, chorus, canon) rather than late rule drops. The final repricing—mirrors must reflect another’s light—recasts prior imagery with conceptual bite. Bold choices heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
