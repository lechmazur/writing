<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—guarding the lighthouse from forgetting—drives every micro‑choice, from adding the flat black stone to bottling the sea glass. His interiority is embodied and specific (the oarlocks matching her steps; the green warmth through the glove). The reticence and ache coexist credibly, and the final endurance reads as an earned stance with cost. The fear she has stepped over the rail sharpens his actions without melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure holds cleanly to the end, with the lamp’s earlier failure tightening the present beat. Closure lands as a charged poise: the stone’s click reconfigures options (she lives; the chain holds) while his bottled light marks a costly, chosen endurance. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; no causality breaks. The final image pays off seeded motifs without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room and its objects (Fresnel lens, brass rail, stacked stones, flask) are tactile and POV‑filtered, shaping tactics (where to place stones, how to “bottle” safety). Weather and structure pressure him (wind through cracked panes, dark arriving sooner). Recurring objects charge the final image (sea glass warmth in his palm). Detail density is purposeful and character‑specific, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres under an accumulative lens: lamp dies early, horizon “stitched with black wire,” fear she’s gone; he escalates by adding a second cairn and sequestering the glass. Stakes are singular—maintain the chain and witness absence—and the cost is his ongoing solitude and limited agency. The stone’s click tightens to a fragile reprieve rather than relief without price. Quiet, but the deepening is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Memory versus oblivion, witnessing as a form of protection, and anonymous intimacy emerge from concrete acts (stones as letters, bottling safety). The final repricing—light as witnessed absence rather than illumination—reweights the whole piece. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the charged objects. The child’s skiff and widow’s cove thread ethical grief into the present without drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature (“salt‑ghost,” “dawn trapped under skin”), modulating with tension without losing control. POV is stable and modest; inference reads as inference. Diction and rhythm fit the character’s reticence and craft. The elisions (their unseen correspondence) are taught and paid off by the closing click.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images are fresh and coherent. Figurative density remains legible; no mixed metaphors distort action. Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates near turns (“A stone clicked overhead…”). No loops or synonym churn; final sentence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The anonymous stone‑letter exchange and “bottling” safety is a striking synthesis, making a familiar lighthouse frame feel new. Risks (quiet plot, object‑driven code) heighten meaning and are fully integrated. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the pattern taught. Emotional specificity avoids template melancholy.</comment>
