<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—the bead’s “cider and copper and goodbye” and lungs “working like bellows with no sound” make the cost visceral. Her decisive choice to crush the amber and surrender her voice is clearly motivated by the recognized bargain. Slight opacity remains around whom the message serves and why she accepts so quickly, muting internal contradiction at the peak. Still, the Earned Stasis lands credibly with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: discovery → assembly → portal → bargain → sacrifice → aftermath. Closure is on-page and costly; the final image (petal with runes, beadless tears) confirms consequence. Orientation is solid from the outset (loom spinner in orchard at night) and the accumulative texture supports the causal throughline. A minor gap in pre-bargain motivation prevents the leap to truly exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard, bamboo, loom, and puzzle operate as charged environment and tools that constrain options and shape the ending. Setting is inseparable from action (threads tether the portal; sap beads accrue as messages). Sensory detail is specific across senses without museum-tour excess. The world’s rules are learned via use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure tightens from an expectant silence to an irreversible sacrifice; the bargain focuses the dominant stake. The chime, dimming orchard, and swallow-shaped absence escalate cleanly under the causal lens. Cost is unmistakable—her voice for distance—and persists in the aftermath. A touch more articulated inner resistance at the decision beat could heighten the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silence as currency, memory as distance, and craft as bridge cohere through recurring particulars (swallow-shaped void, ant wing, sap). The final stasis reweights prior images into a map of sacrifice without moralizing. The petal and seasonal rewinding complicate loss with restorative consequence, sustaining ambiguity that invites reflection. Subtext hums in gesture rather than thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains pattern and rhythm without head-hopping. Diction is consistently character-filtered; images recur with purpose and modulation. Psychic distance stays stable as pressure rises, tightening cadence at the sacrifice and relaxing into the quiet coda. No gratuitous exposition or summary intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with strong verbs and precise images; syntax varies to match pressure. Occasional flourish risk (“stoically sparkling”) toes toward ornament, but coherence and propulsion hold. Figurative logic remains consistent (loom, thread, silence) with minimal overlap. No loops or scaffold bog down the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—loomcraft as speech, puzzle as absence-image, voice spun into thread—is fresh and consequential. Risks in concept and diction pay off in a specific, inevitable-feeling sacrifice. The world’s micro-mythology (sap beads as future messages) extends the premise without gimmick. Emotional truth outpaces mere novelty.</comment>
