<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and pressure-shaped: to seal a covenant before dawn erases the old sky. Contradictory impulses—fear of being mocked by “empirical irony” vs aching devotion—play in-scene and culminate in renunciation. His vow “to teach no king” is an earned endurance with visible cost: self-erasure and silence. A touch more friction or risk during the sanctum entry would lift it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: drawing schematics → lattice appears → door opens → sanctum → vow. Closure is a charged poise/earned stasis; the price is the choice to guard the unknown rather than share it as power changes hands. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the dawn clock pressures the sequence. Cost is legible in the final image (absence, unclaimed tablet, unsettled dust).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: cedar doors, cracked lapis lions, copper door, clerestory—details constrain choices and enable the sanctum’s reveal. The tile as tool-object and the palace architecture directly gate progress. Tone and atmosphere (dusk, dust, lapis light) serve both pressure and theme. The ending image recharges place into a charged, ongoing covenant.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—make the covenant before regime change—is clear and tightens once with the sanctum’s terms. Escalation is primarily internal and textural, but the act of completing the diagonal forecloses a future path (service to kings) with cost. Lack of a hard external obstacle slightly softens pressure, yet the renunciation reads consequential. The dawn herald arrival retro-justifies the urgency without resolving by coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—devotion encoded in number outlasting empire—emerges through action, not assertion. The magic square reframes ritual, and the ending reprices knowledge as sacred secrecy rather than power. The sister invocation deepens the ethical core without sermonizing. The final image lingers with conceptual and emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent, elevated lyric voice suits the antiquity and the mathematician’s reverence. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with patterned phrases (“empirical irony,” “dusky harmony”) working as motifs rather than tics. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping. Slight risk of lushness crowding breath in peak beats keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet purposeful; sentences often do double duty (world + pressure). Imagery remains coherent to the register (lapis, cuneiform, lattice) with minimal redundancy and no muddled metaphors. A few high-ornament lines flirt with excess but don’t blur causality. Rhythm varies enough to carry momentum through lyric accumulation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a Babylonian magic square as key to a sanctum, “encrypted devotion” literalized, and a vow to become silence. Turns feel earned by prior particulars (schematics → lattice → door). Risks in diction and concept pay off with a distinctive afterimage. The piece commits to its premise without hedging.</comment>
