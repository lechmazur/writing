<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Naram-bel’s motives—preserving a cosmology before conquest—are clear and intensify under the ticking dawn. His fear of testing the tile vs. the urgency to act creates credible internal friction that resolves in an Earned Stasis vow. Interiority is specific to his vocation (schematics, numbers, constellations) and embodied through tactile choices. The final renunciation carries felt cost: self-erasure from courts and kings.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: drawing the schematics → lattice reveal → door opens → covenant scene → vow and disappearance. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal anchors, and closure lands as an Earned Stasis that reconfigures his role and options. The cost is on‑page (refusal to teach kings, life spent guarding the unknown). Orientation is firm by ~120 words and supports the ending’s charged return with the herald.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The palace and its sanctum are vividly realized and integral: the cedar doors, lapis lions, and clerestory directly steer movement and choices. The magic square functions as micro‑setting and tool, constraining tactics and charging the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through an astronomer’s eye. The environment’s rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save a cosmology vs. the conqueror’s erasure—is signaled early and tightens as night runs out. Escalation occurs through deliberate acts (schematic, door, covenant) culminating in a vow that forecloses public knowledge. The price is the protagonist’s isolation and refusal of power. Tension is mostly inward but coheres with the external clock of dawn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: number vs. ritual, devotion encoded rather than declared, knowledge safeguarded by renunciation. Recurring images (dust as constellations, lapis, the square) deepen meaning and reweight at the end. The “encrypted devotion” motif crystallizes when his marginal notes return as prophecy. No moralizing; the piece sustains ambiguity about power and secrecy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with controlled distance suits the mythic-historic frame. Diction is consistent with the character’s learned, devotional mindset and modulates under pressure without breaking stance. Elision patterns are taught early and paid off clearly. No head‑hopping; the perceptual signature is distinct and steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple jobs and rhythm varies with the scene’s pulse. Lush metaphors stay coherent to the astronomical/architectural lexicon. A few intensifiers (“empirical irony”) recur, but do not blur sense or slow momentum. The final image is sharp and earned without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of Babylonian milieu with a mathematically charged mysticism feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The magic square’s procedural use avoids tropey “key” conveniences by rooting in schematic thinking. The covenant-as-silence reframes heroism as renunciation. Risks in diction and structure heighten resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
