<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—mapping empathy onto action—drives every choice, and the rescue visibly costs him (smashed mirror, branded palms). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (listening to silence like foghorns, shadow‑laced coat). Relationship pressure with Sira sharpens decisions and alters their state by the end. Slightly low tension in contradictory impulses—he’s almost too calibrated—keeps this just below the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: shard → mirror vision → improvised spear → ladder descent → net haul → on‑page rescue. Orientation is established early (who/where/when) and held without confusion. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost and a reweighted final beat. The motif of the “weighted breath before reply” coheres as a ticking frame rather than a gimmick.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, mirrors, ice, ladder, net, and pruning hook all constrain tactics and shape the outcome. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose‑driven (salt spray glaze on rungs; ice grinding chord). World rules are learned through action, not dump. The environment charges the final image (collapsing on the terrace, net like a treaty).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save Sira before the ice closes) is clear and tightens meaningfully with the crack below and the noose‑of‑seconds motif. Escalation arises from Kael’s agency (repurposing mirror, coordinating by angles, physical haul). Costs are legible (risk, injury, breaking a unique tool). The conflict intertwines external peril and the ethical calculus without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transforming empathy into action is dramatized through specific acts (reconstituting possibility, using mirrors to map and move). Recurring images (mirrors, maps, light) accrue meaning and shift at the end (“net…like a treaty”). One line edges toward thesis‑statement (“to map empathy onto action”), slightly reducing subtlety. The final tableau carries earned resonance without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical close‑third voice with controlled diction and a coherent perceptual signature. Brief dialogue lands with subtext and function (map‑like instruction, final whisper setup). Distance control stays steady under pressure; no head‑hopping. High rhetoric remains character‑plausible and modulates with urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with strong verbs and vivid specificity; rhythm tightens at peak beats. Occasional density risks purple but remains controlled and clear. No paraphrase loops or template cadences dull momentum. Final lines are crisp and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse orchard, vintage mirrors as navigation, empathy as cartography—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Tactics spring from premise rather than grafted cleverness. Risk‑taking in imagery and method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The mirrored spear and “angles as Morse” are particularly fresh.</comment>
