<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motives and contradictions are vivid and active: a trained suppressor who chooses to overrule protocol by swallowing her stored empathy. Micro-choices (feeding the shard sorrow, stepping through the mirror, using the revocation phrase) align with a clear internal axis. Embodied texture (trapped reflection as collateral; “terrifying and bright”) grounds the cost. Minor convenience in the leap to understanding the Keeper’s scheme keeps it shy of perfect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain from shard → mirrors → harbor → confrontation → return, with cost and an on-page decisive change. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric accumulation, and the closure image (new beacon; border as bridge) carries a conceptual price. Stakes (“before dawn,” floes grinding the lighthouse) are paid off via the transformed sphere and thickened border. No orientation debt; the pattern is taught and sustained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, mirrors, and shard function as charged environment and tools that constrain choices and charge the final image. Weather/ice apply pressure; mirrors gate access; the sphere as a new beacon binds place to outcome. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful across visual, tactile, and sonic lines. World rules are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintain the border; stop the apathy economy) tightens through the choice to sacrifice detachment for compassion. The reflection-collateral and empathy ingestion make the cost legible; the revocation phrase turns the confrontation. Internal/external conflicts interlock without coincidence doing the work. Slightly expedited confrontation keeps it short of maximal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of empathy versus professional detachment and the commodification of feeling emerge from concrete acts (crates of emotions, swallowing empathy, beacon dripping into dreams). The final image reweights the protocol without sermonizing, though “the only protocol that mattered” edges close to overt thesis. The Keeper’s self-fragmentation conceptually reframes the system’s rot. Resonance lingers via the orchard tasting of apples rather than salt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Purposeful compression (e.g., montage of mirror images) is taught and legible. Dialogue is minimal but potent (“I witness you whole”) and functions as action. No POV leakage or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and strong verbs; images do more than one job. Lyric metaphors are disciplined and coherent to the world’s logic; momentum rarely snags. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; closures are crisp. A few elevated turns verge on purple but stop short of blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse orchard, mirror-market for emotions, revocation by witnessing wholeness—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric compression, conceptual economy) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Objects and setting are repurposed ingeniously through closure. Emotional truth anchors the novelty.</comment>
