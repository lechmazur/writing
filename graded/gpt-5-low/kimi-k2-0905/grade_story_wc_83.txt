<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Grief, guilt, and ruthless pragmatism coexist on the page, culminating in a self-sacrificial choice that’s earned by prior actions. The “death’s accountant” realization cuts through any safety-hedging and reframes his agency. Embodied beats (crystal against ribs, taste of cake) anchor interior stakes. Minor abstraction creeps in occasionally but doesn’t blunt motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: geode → mapping potential → deliberate perturbations → accelerated harvesting → final jump that realigns the telescope and diverts a strike. Orientation is swift and stable; the clock (“circuit breakers cooling”) shapes tactics and the ending. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with legible cost (his death) and a charged final image. No teleports or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating observatory, helium sacs, circuit breakers, and quantum telescope go beyond backdrop to constrain choices and enable the ending. Environmental mechanics (listing starboard, railing, .003-degree alignment) directly charge the final act. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through the narrator’s scientific grief. World rules feel consistent and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming unused potential vs moral cost) tightens as he escalates from mapping to sabotage to self-sacrifice. Each turn extracts a price (geode fragments, ethical degradation, finally his life). The final jump is an earned, costly narrowing of options, not a coincidence. Internal conflict interweaves with external stakes without slack.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: harvesting possibility as a commodified grief, the ethics of perturbation, and choosing whose harm is borne. The crystal’s evolution from gift to weapon drives the moral repricing. A line or two edges toward thesis articulation, but the ending’s image does the heavy lifting without sermonizing. Resonance lingers in the wedding-flute dust motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled first-person voice marries scientific precision with lyric grief. Lexicon and rhythm are consistent under pressure, with measured escalations (“.003 degrees”) that fit the mind at hand. No dialogue needed; interior cadence functions as action. Distance remains stable and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, concrete images; lines often do double duty. Occasional figurative lushness risks purple but stays coherent and purposeful. No loops or template cadences dull momentum. The final sentence resolves by image and action with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: geode as reservoir of unlived potential, perturbation theory as ethical engine, and a physical sacrifice to nudge world-scale harm. Risks taken (lyric-science fusion, resource economy of “might-have-beens”) feel inevitable by the end. The closure image transforms prior particulars rather than relying on gimmickry. Fresh, memorable, and conceptually integrated.</comment>
