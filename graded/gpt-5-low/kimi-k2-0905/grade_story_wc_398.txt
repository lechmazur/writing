<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marco’s interiority is vivid, embodied, and particular—the leaf scent “like bruised herbs” ties memory to sense, and his micro-choices (placing the fragment on the cedar table, deciding to regraft, to sleep there, to write a new note) flow from his contradictions of resignation vs. hope. The realization that “the error lay in the prophecy, not the protagonists” credibly reframes his desire. Emotional cost is felt in risking reputation and reopening an old wound. No dialogue is needed; his self-persuasion functions as action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: rediscovery of the fragment → pavilion vigil → lecture/grafting parallel → decision to regraft and to write a counter-note. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after and implied cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines (bus, hill, vineyard, pavilion), and one continuous scene coheres. If anything, the cost remains mostly implied rather than tested, keeping it just shy of 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is richly integrated and purposive: bus, pavilion, vines, saffron light, and the station’s silence all charge choices and the final image. The pavilion’s light and the bus schedule shape time and mood, and the letter acts as a micro-setting object. Sensory specificity is filtered through a vintner’s priorities without tourist-catalog drift. Minor caution: density skirts overt symbolism but stays controlled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate on whether he will accept the families’ verdict or reprice it; escalation occurs as metaphor becomes tactic (deciding to regraft disparate vines, writing the new note). The tightening is quiet but real, narrowing from elegiac observation to a risk-bearing plan for the vineyard and for reaching out. The price is implied (agronomic risk, social rupture), not dramatized, which limits peak tension. Still, the cadence shift to committed intent lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image—grafting as a lived counter-argument to “we are impossible.” The final repricing—“destiny is only the first draft”—is a touch aphoristic but earned by the concrete grafting plan and the bus-note echo. Subtext works in the saffron light, the station’s silence, and the ember of ink going out. The piece resists a tidy moral by choosing risk over reunion certainty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-filtered through a vintner’s lexicon and attention. The rhythmic control supports pressure, with sentences expanding for reflection and tightening around decisions. No head-hopping or register drift; the “gentle persuasion” tone matches his temperament. A few aphoristic lines brush the edge of declarative theme but do not break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and economical for its lyric density; images often do double-duty (saffron light, char, bus ember). Figurative threads stay coherent (wine/weather/graft) with minimal mixed-metaphor risk. No scaffold loops or template cadences; momentum holds despite reflection. Slight purple pressure at peaks is controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Star-crossed lovers reframed through viticulture and literal grafting feels fresh, not gimmicky. The letter fragment as ember and the bus/station motif yield a memorable synthesis. While love-as-graft isn’t wholly new, the execution shows specificity and integrity. The risk-taking is quiet but purposeful.</comment>
