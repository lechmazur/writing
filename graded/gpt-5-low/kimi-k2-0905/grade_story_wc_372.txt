<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (“gently meticulous”) drives every micro-choice from aligning the cracked slide to sampling faster as fuel dwindles. Interiority is embodied (blood beading on frozen mercury, frost on eyelashes) rather than labeled. The arc is an earned endurance/renunciation: she preserves numbers knowing their meaning is dying. Slight limitation: little contradictory impulse on the page; she rarely wavers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive tightens through the measurement ritual to the glass’s shattering and the conceptual repricing of “vows” into sap. Closure lands with cost: the vows die in-scene, tools break, and she accepts a translation of grief into meaningless sweetness. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/why), and the final image reweights the premise decisively. The lantern fuel clock and escalating failures provide concrete cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen library’s “quartz hush,” subzero air, and copper fittings are not postcard scenery; they constrain tools, sound, breath, and storage (lead box, feathers). The setting informs tactics and stakes (frost-brittle slide, ice tuning fork, mercury tablet’s temperature dependency). The environment charges the final image as hush “swallow[s] even her footsteps.” Sensory detail is precise and filtered through vocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the single stake: capturing the vows before extinction. Escalation is clean: initial readings → fractures and decay → fuel dwindling → shattering slide and blood on the tablet. Agency appears in her adaptive tactics (shorter intervals, recording, choosing what to preserve) and final renunciation (numbers over meaning). Stakes are mostly conceptual, but the embodied costs keep them felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation vs. forgetting; data as elegy; stewardship failing while wonder persists longest. The piece resists platitude; “translating grief into data” is both indictment and solace, reweighted by sap rising “sweet and meaningless.” Recurring images (light, frequencies, hush) evolve toward a resonant non-literal answer. No sermonizing—meaning is carried by action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with controlled cadence and precise lexicon tied to vocation (mercury tablet, tuning fork, xylem). Psychic distance stays stable, and elision is purposeful without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure (quickened measures, stuttering projections). Elevated diction matches the mythic-scientific register taught from line one.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense and purposeful; images do multiple jobs and propel mood and action. Minimal scaffolding and no loops; sentence variety supports momentum toward the shattering and hush. A few metaphor-rich lines approach saturation but maintain coherence and don’t blur causality. Final images are sharp and clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—archival science as ritual magic, vows as measurable spectra, data infused into a tree’s xylem—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (poetic science, conceptual closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. The world feels singular and internally consistent. Emotional truth grounds the novelty.</comment>
