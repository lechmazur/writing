<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and motive: she honors the vows through measurement until the archive begins to archive her, forcing a conflicted choice. Contradictory impulses are live on the page—duty to measure vs. refusal to let meaning be reduced. Her decisive renunciation (halting the chronometer, fogging the slide, reclassifying it) reads earned and paid with the cost of abandoning her vocational creed. Embodied reactions (pulse falter, breath fog, careful note‑taking) ground the lyricism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive taught early via ritualized measuring and intensifies through apparitions and the book recording her backward life. Closure lands as an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she refuses measurement, reframes the slide, and exits into unwritten air. The causal chain within the lyric mode is coherent and the cost legible; one tight turn (the archive starts archiving her) meaningfully narrows options. Minor copy slip at the very end doesn’t break closure but mars finish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is vivid and functional: frost, lantern, chronometer, prism, and shelves constrain behavior and charge the final images. Tools (lantern, slide, harp‑chronometer) operate as micro‑settings that shape tactics and the decision to stop. Environmental phenomena (illusions peeling, tremor, cloud‑roof parting) evolve with the action. Sensory selection stays POV‑true, with cold, hush, and light as operative textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to keep measuring or to preserve meaning beyond measurement—is established and tightened by the library’s counter‑move (archiving her). Escalation is a clear pattern break under the accumulative lens: she narrows the beam, magnifies a vow, then halts the instrument. The cost is felt: she forecloses her professional mandate and accepts uncertainty. Pressure remains coherent without requiring an external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—measurement vs. meaning, memory vs. oblivion—emerges through objects and acts rather than exposition, with a reweighted final stance. The vow “Meaning endures where measurement fails” risks explicitness, but its diegetic status and her counter‑inscription keep it earned. The closing reclassification to “Possibility—unmeasured” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity lingers productively in the cost of stepping away from the archive’s ethos.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is confident and consistent; diction and rhythm fit the character’s sensibility. Perceptual signature is distinctive (quartz hush, icicles of ink, harp‑chronometer) and modulates under pressure without opacity. No head‑hopping or stance slips; free indirect access flows with scene. A clean, memorable cadence supports the closing images.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, with high information density and purposeful imagery; most metaphors cohere and carry load. Minor risk of purple is held in check by action integration. A noticeable copy error/truncation in the last line (“took off her spect”) mars polish at the finish. Otherwise, rhythm varies well and scaffolding is minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—a frozen sky‑library where vows are measured as light—feels singular, with fresh tools and charged turns. The self‑archiving beat and the counter‑inscription reframe the premise elegantly. Risks in lyric density and conceptual closure pay off without losing clarity. Small conventional notes (overt thematic phrasing) keep it just shy of the very top.</comment>
