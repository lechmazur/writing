<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—translate a silenced world—is clear, embodied, and drives concrete choices (entering, mapping, performing, departing). Her grief/fear/wonder stack credibly, though internal contradiction under peak pressure is more implied than dramatized. Actions align with motives and the reframed drive at the end reads earned. The visible cost is modest but present (battery death, renunciation of restoring “sound” for a new language).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each fork-beat densifies the pattern toward a Conceptual Repricing—the world isn’t silent but translated. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and set-ups pay off (scanner, forks, conservatory, battery). Closure lands on the page with cost (battery dies; she chooses to leave the image rather than chase a fix), and options are reweighted. The final image crystallizes a before/after without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is tactile and integral: frost, dome, benches, and stage shape tactics and charge the finale (melting sheets as “liquid notes”). Tools-as-setting (scanner, forks) are embedded in place, and professional perception steers detail selection. The environment evolves with action (thermal bloom, thaw), not static description. Specificity is high and consistently filtered through a sound-scientist’s bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early; pressure deepens as she moves from test pings to full “performance,” culminating in the battery dying and her acceptance. Escalation follows the lens: pattern intensifies, then cadence shifts (“played harder, faster,” then cut-off). The price is conceptual/emotional rather than catastrophic, but it’s felt. A single meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as translation, not absence—emerges from concrete acts and images (heat-mapped instruments, thawing “perfect fifths”). Subtext in audience silhouettes and the treble-clef breath is resonant. One explicit thesis line (“she understood then…”) edges toward stating the moral, slightly reducing subtlety. The finale reweights prior images without neat moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a scientist-artist lexicon; rhythm modulates well through accumulation and release. Diction is precise without register drift, and patterned lyricism is taught early and sustained. No dialogue, but interior filtering remains character-specific. The closing cadence is controlled and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid, economical, and largely double-duty; images are fresh and coherent. Figurative density is high but purposeful, with minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. A few heightened metaphors approach purple but remain legible and voice-true. The final images land sharply without scaffold clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Conceptually bold: a soundless world where music is mapped through heat/emotion and tuning forks become a visual-thermal instrument. The synthesis of tool, place, and motive feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual pivot) heighten stakes without muddying clarity. The ending’s treble-clef breath and “perfect fifths” thaw are distinctive and memorable.</comment>
