<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to translate the new silence—drives every choice, and her embodied responses (mittens biting cold, counting steps as measures) feel particular. The shift from survivor’s grief to active composer is earned through on-page labor. Internal contradiction is light but present (fear/grief/wonder braided), with a modest cost (battery death, leaving the image behind). A hair of neatness in the explicit realization tempers the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each fork intensifies the conservatory’s thermal symphony, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “silence.” Closure lands on the page with a concrete price (battery death) and a charged final image (child’s treble clef cloud, thaw in “perfect fifths”). Orientation is clean early and the world-rule constraint shapes tactics. The ending reconfigures options rather than tying them off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory and its tools (scanner, forks) are tactile, rule-bound, and decisive in action. Environment constrains choices (no sound, sub-zero frost) and charges the final image (image burned into frost; dome weeping). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful across senses, not just visual. The setting’s evolution tracks causally as Mara plays.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres internally: Mara must find a way to “play” without sound, escalating through mapping, composition, and intensity until the battery’s loss forces a stop. The cost is visible and alters options (recording ends; she leaves the masterpiece behind). Stakes remain personal yet consequential via the city’s reweighting. Slightly lower visceral jeopardy keeps it shy of top-tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through enacted transformation—silence as a dialect of heat and light—grounded in concrete acts rather than sermon. Recurrences (frost, aurora, instruments, child’s clef) modulate meaning at the end. One explicit thesis sentence nudges toward telling, but most resonance is earned through image. The afterimage invites reflection beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close with a distinctive, lyrical yet controlled texture fits the concept and stays within Mara’s sensibility. Diction is confident, images precise, and cadence modulates with escalation. No leakage of knowledge beyond POV; compression is taught and paid off. The voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; figurative language is fresh and thematically coherent (heat, light, frost, aurora) without muddle. Rhythm varies and supports momentum. A couple of lush lines flirt with purple but remain purposeful. Mechanics are clean and sequencing is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—post-Hush music translated via thermal emotion—feels singular and fully committed. The tuning-fork/heat-map notation and the frost-captured symphony are striking, inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth undergirds ingenuity; not just a clever conceit.</comment>
