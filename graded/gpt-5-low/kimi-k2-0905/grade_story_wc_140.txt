<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s drive—to prove her erased self by weaving memory—grounds every choice, culminating in sacrificing her former name. Interiority is concrete (brine, machinery, barcode beeping invalid) and actions align with motive. The internal contradiction—remaining nameless while asserting communal memory—lands credibly at the end. Secondary presence (the dying captain) applies relevant pressure without hijacking her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments → poison label → captain’s recorder → dissemination across containers. Closure lands with cost via the death certificate surrender and the label’s repurposing (CR + Decisive Change). Causality is clean, with one tightening per turn (discover label, receive recorder, evade drones, stamp container). The price and before/after are legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The port’s container labyrinth and tides constrain movement and tactics (stairs, hatches, acoustics, surfaces for adhesion), charging the final image. Sensory detail (sodium moons, fog, salt, metal) is purposeful and POV-filtered. World rules (poison erasing histories) stay consistent and are learned through action. The label-object-as-setting meaningfully anchors the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—obliteration vs. remembrance—tightens as Mara shifts from collecting to broadcasting under patrol scrutiny. The captain’s confession and recorder raise the price and provide a concrete method. Agency drives the solution (inverting the poison’s label; seeding walls), and the cost is the relinquished former identity. Pressure remains coherent through the drones’ sweep and the night-to-dawn clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of institutional erasure versus communal memory emerges through particulars (archivist’s death, corrupted ledgers, sonic palimpsest). The inversion of poison into antidote reframes the premise without moralizing; the final stamped line functions as embodied thesis, not commentary. The ending reweights prior images (tide, label, laughter) with conceptual cost. Ambiguity (still nameless) lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person closely tracks Mara’s perception with consistent diction and controlled metaphor. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure (fog-thickened hush to dawn release). No dialogue clutter; reported speech remains in-scene and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet disciplined; images often do double duty (sodium moons, containers groaning like whales) without muddle. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; syntax varies and propels. Metaphor density flirts with purple but stays coherent within the maritime-industrial palette. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bureaucratic-death/poison-erasure premise feels fresh, and the tactic of broadcasting micro-scraps to confuse drones is inventive. The port-container labyrinth is not a backdrop but an active instrument. The inversion of the poison label as a memory seal is a satisfying, non-obvious turn. Risks in lyric compression pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
