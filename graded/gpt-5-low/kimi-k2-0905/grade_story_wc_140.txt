<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, character-particular motive—refusing bureaucratic erasure by accreting others’ stories—drives concrete micro-choices (pocketing the ampoule-count shard, swallowing the stevedore’s sentence, keeping the reel). The internal contradiction between the poison label’s “chemical ending” and the chosen composite identity is dramatized, not declared. Emotions are embodied through tactile acts (tape against chest, frost-breath like cassette ribbon). The final renunciation—embracing a stitched self—reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held; the reel discovery and “press” realization provide a decisive deepening toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisply set within the opening lines; the port/tide clock coheres the window. Cost appears on-page in the turn from poison/erasure to self-lamination and departure toward the harbor mouth. The beats link via therefore-consequence within an accumulative cadence rather than and-then drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The port’s container labyrinth shapes access, acoustics, and options, culminating in the “press” that literally and conceptually compresses voices into skin. Tides impose timing and alter stakes (urge deeper pre-ebb; reveal footprints). Reused objects (projector, crates, label) are embedded in setting use, not scenery. The closing image is explicitly charged by place: the metal city’s groan, morning horn, and harbor mouth refract the new identity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to exist legibly vs. erasure) tightens through the reel’s revelation and the press metaphor, forcing the choice to laminate and move into morning as a composite. Escalation is an intensification of density and cost consistent with the accumulative lens. External pressures (tide window, surveillance evidence) meaningfully compress options. The price is felt but remains conceptual/emotional rather than materially punitive, keeping this just shy of top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of bureaucratic annihilation, memory as material, and identity as collage emerge via objects and acts rather than thesis lines. Recurring motifs (label, tide, echoing containers) shift meaning at the end from threat to chosen armor. No moralizing; ambiguity persists (poison “loyalty” vs. reassembled self). The final cadence offers a resonant answer: survival through ethically fraught accretion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first-person with a precise perceptual signature sustains control; figurative reach rarely oversteps. Brief quoted voices land with differentiated idiom and subtext (“whistle… like my wife calling me to supper”). Distance is stable; elisions are pattern-taught and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening around the reel and loosening into the closing horn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; lines often do double duty (image + motive). Figurative language is vivid yet coherent to the world (press/laminate, cassette-ribbon breath); no mixed-metaphor muddle at peak beats. Syntax varies and propels; no looped stems or synonym churn. The final image cleanly recharges earlier motifs without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise (death-certified alive person laminating a self from portside fragments) feels singular and fully inhabited. The surveillance reel and container-press reweight the conceit in non-obvious, inevitable ways. Risks in lyric density and mosaic accumulation pay off with clarity and charge. Emotional truth anchors the strangeness, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
