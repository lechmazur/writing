<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—she seeks closure by “reading” scars and pays the price by reopening the wound. Interiority is embodied (iron and lilac, throat scrape) and character‑specific. The decisive act (“Trade requires fresh loss” → she bleeds) is earned and alters her stance. Minor ambiguity about contradictory impulses exists but grief’s pull serves as the credible driver.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: serum → plant telepathy → coffee‑ring tunnel → trade → blood → miracle released → seed swallowed. Orientation is established by ~120 words (quiet tower at dawn; anesthesia). Closure lands on the page with cost and a legible before/after (question mark to period). The pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting and objects do real work: coffee rings become a tunnel; the courtyard soil contains the miracle; the hourglass recharges the ending. Sensory specificity (“meteor hush,” frost‑rimed glass) is purposeful and filtered through grief. The micro‑setting constrains the choice and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—releasing the miracle/achieving closure—tightens sharply at “Trade requires fresh loss.” The visible cost is her blood and the relived memory (sister’s laugh). Agency drives the turn and resolution; coincidence does not solve anything. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of grief, time, and translating scars into story emerge through specific images and acts, not summary. Recurrences (hourglass, rings, wound) reweight meaning at the end; the “period” line elegantly reframes the wound. The final plant sentence risks slight didactic shading, but remains in‑world and earned. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A lyrical, coherent first‑person voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“chlorophyll code,” “meteor hush”). Distance control and certainty match what the POV can know; elisions are purposeful and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head‑hopping. Diction is consistent and character‑true throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, varied rhythm, and purposeful metaphors. A few rich stacks flirt with excess but maintain coherence and momentum. No scaffold loops or clutter; the closure image is crisp. Minor lushness is the only restraint on a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: coffee rings as portal, plant telepathy as grief‑translator, and the displaced miracle as living light. Risks in concept and diction pay off structurally and emotionally. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight and specific to this vision. The final reconfiguration (seed swallowed, wound as period) is memorable and non‑derivative.</comment>
