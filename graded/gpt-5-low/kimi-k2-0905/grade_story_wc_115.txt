<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are clean and pressure-tested: a skeptic compelled to verify, with embodied choices (lifting, listening, unscrewing, replacing) that reveal values under strain. Her internal contradiction—skeptical yet drawn to ritual “measurement”—acts simultaneously in scene. The closing renunciation (secular forgiveness) feels earned by prior acts and costs her former stance. Minor note: the brother’s role is offstage, so relational crucible pressure is indirect rather than face-to-face.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: physical investigation escalates via the wheel, the tag, and the rhythm from above. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets the confession and allows the “turning” to stop, with conceptual and emotional cost on the page. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why); no causality breaks. The single-scene cadence tightens elegantly without over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tunnel/factory system and the beaded valve wheel are tactile, sensory-specific, and integrated with action. Environment constrains choices (rails, hatch, culvert; sound cue shaping tactics) and directly charges the final image (the wheel’s measured spin). Detail selection tracks Mara’s priorities and bias, avoiding tourist cataloguing. Tone and physicality align to deepen atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—testing and reweighting the truth—tightens through the wheel’s handling and the discovery of names. The decisive deepening (the tag and the wheel’s “balance”) narrows options and forces a stance change with a felt cost. Stakes remain intimate rather than outwardly perilous, but the interweave of internal and environmental pressures keeps tension live. No coincidence resolves the core problem; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: skepticism, ritual, labor, and guilt are refigured through “weight,” “balance,” and “measurement.” The final image answers the central question non-literally: forgiveness as secular weighting that lets machinery/ghosts rest. Subtext (rosary echoes, psychics-as-scripture) enriches without moralizing. Ambiguity about the supernatural remains purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical free-indirect voice matches Mara’s mind—mechanical, tactile, faintly caustic yet open. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure, with brief dialogue lines landing subtext. No head-hopping or stance drift; certainty aligns with what she can sense or infer. Very minor risk of lushness, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied rhythm; most sentences do multiple jobs (image, action, theme). A few metaphoric stacks (“damp wool,” “lead slug,” “mercury or guilt”) flirt with excess but don’t blur causality or cadence. No looped scaffolding or filter-verb stacks; sequencing is clear. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Factory-ghost folklore is freshly embodied through industrial tactility (beaded wheel, drains to culvert) and the appraisal conceit. The talk-radio psychics angle is a surprising, coherent engine for tactics and theme. The reinterpretation of the brother’s guilt feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold, specific synthesis without gimmickry.</comment>
