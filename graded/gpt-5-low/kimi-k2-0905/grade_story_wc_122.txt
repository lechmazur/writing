<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is crystal clear and embodied in tactile listening; her contradictory impulses (seeking pain to escape numbness) play out credibly on the bench and floor. Micro-choices—repairing the needle, choosing the backward spin, building the drum—align with her need. The relationship with Temen adds pressure through care and craft rather than conflict, which suits the scale. The final renunciation of numbness carries felt cost as grief arrives fully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clean: work → playback → drum-making → fused vibrations → acceptance. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (“Grief arrived fully… and she welcomed it”). Orientation is anchored early (who, where, stakes), and causality holds. Persistent constraint (deafness) and tool pressure (needle/disc) shape tactics to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern, hides, cedar dust, pedal lathe, and phonograph are lived-in and functional, constraining what’s possible and charging the final image. The body as micro-setting (listening through bones/skin) deepens specificity. Weather and the cavern mouth frame the cadence shift to snow and “seasons turning.” Tools evolve with action; the object-state changes matter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—breaking numbness—tightens through the backward lullaby and the parallel drum birth, culminating in the cost of fully felt grief. Escalation is internal but legible and paced via tactile intensification. A visible option is foreclosed: the protective numbness. Lack of external antagonism is not a deficit at this length given the clear pressure arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motifs (hush, filament, backward song, drumbeat) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end without moralizing. The “filament of hush” returns with altered charge, and the snow’s hush mirrors interior resonance. Insight arises from concrete action rather than thesis. The final image answers the central question by embodying living-with-grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is precise, sensuous, and tethered to Mara’s perceptual limits; sound is filtered as vibration, which keeps register honest. Rhythm modulates with pressure—from patient craft to charged stillness—without head-hopping. Sparse signed dialogue is purposeful and subtext-rich. Diction is cohesive and character-apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density; figurative language is vivid and purposeful. A few lush metaphors approach the edge of purple but stay coherent, with no looped scaffolding or cadence templates dulling momentum. Syntax and paragraphing breathe with scene needs. Final lines land cleanly in image-action without explanatory drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a deaf teacher seeking backward music in a drum maker’s cavern via a repaired needle (“filament of hush”) feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction pay off through integrated craft and closure. Tools and tactility ground the lyric frame, avoiding gimmickry. The backward lullaby reimagined as grief’s unwinding is memorable.</comment>
