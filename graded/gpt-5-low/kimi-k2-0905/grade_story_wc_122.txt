<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to pierce grief‑numbness) is clear and drives concrete choices—repairing the needle, playing the disc, building the drum. Interiority is embodied through tactile listening and vibration rather than label‑speak; contradictory impulses (seeking hush to break silence) play in scene. Temen adds gentle relational pressure and collaboration without stealing focus. The earned shift—welcoming grief—forecloses avoidance with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tactile setup → repair → backward playback → drum‑making → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief fully arrives and is accepted, with the needle kept as a priced token. Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality is coherent and object‑driven. The cost is on the page—she trades numbness for raw pain and a permanent reminder around her neck.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern and tools are vivid and functional: cedar dust, hides, lathe, drum frame, and phonograph constrain action and enable tactics. Object‑as‑setting (needle, drum, phonograph) charges the final image and her micro‑choices. Sensory detail favors touch and vibration in character‑specific ways. Weather/snow and subterranean frost mirror interior shifts without overstatement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but legible and escalate as she commits from idea to embodiment—repairing, risking the backward play, then fusing drum pulse with machine vibration. The meaningful tightening occurs as the disc nears its beginning/spent state, pressing a now‑or‑never resonance. The price (welcomed grief) is explicit and irreversible. It remains a quiet arc, but pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence transformed into lived feeling emerges organically through action, not moralizing; subtext lives in touch and craft. Recurring images (needle/filament, hush, vibration) reweight at the end. One line (“numbness is only silence waiting…”) edges toward thesis‑statement but is largely earned by prior particulars. The final image resists tidy moral and settles into charged poise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third maintains a distinct tactile lexicon consistent with a deaf music teacher’s attention. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with modulated lyricism under pressure. Dialogue-by-sign is minimal but precise and functional. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the voice sustains the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; images do double duty (e.g., “lullaby rewound into its mother’s throat”). Minor risk of purple is contained; momentum rarely stalls and there are no paraphrase loops. Syntax varies and line clarity remains high. Final beats are clean and un-muddled by metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—deaf pedagogy, drum craft, a broken phonograph, and backward memory work—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The “filament of hush” conceit is fresh and integrated into tactics and closure. The risk of lyric excess pays off with tactile specificity. Emotional truth reads particular rather than template.</comment>
