<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to witness and dissolve isolation—is clear and embodied in concrete choices (slipping from the convoy, pressing the pearl to stone, donning the crown). The confession “I inspect tombs because I am afraid of living rooms where no one speaks” reveals contradiction without therapy-speak. Her final renunciation (becoming the mirror’s tender) carries a felt cost and follows from those choices. Slightly limited by minimal counterpressure from external forces.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: pearl → door → spiral confessions → mirror → crown → dissolution. Orientation is clean early (who, where, when) and closure lands on-page with conceptual and emotional cost. Setups (pearl glow, unlisted vault, confessions) pay off causally in the mirror’s reconfiguration. No contrivances or resets disrupt the chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystal caves are sensorially precise (salt/iron air, frozen chord stalactites, nautilus spiral) and act as a functional system (calcite responds to pearl, mirror as portal, root-crown). Environment constrains and enables choices, culminating in the charged final image in glass. Details are filtered through Mara’s vocation and longing, not a tourist catalog. The cave’s rules remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and deepens: a secret door, etched confessions, the demand to witness, then the irreversible crown choice. The dominant stake—connection vs. isolation—tightens toward a price (leaving the convoy/life to become a keeper). Escalation is protagonist-driven and the cost is legible in her absorption into the mirror. The conflict is primarily internal, but it reads with sufficient urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image—confession as communal bridge, radiance as forgiveness—not through moralizing. The pearl’s “latent radiance” and the mirror’s stitching literalize the dissolution of walls without didacticism. The ending reweights the premise: she trades certifying tombs for tending a living network of ache and light. The mother’s face/charge adds generational resonance without softening the cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and purposeful; syntax modulates with pressure. Diction tracks Mara’s sensibility (inspector’s pragmatism meeting the cave’s numinous logic). No head-hopping or stance wobble; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. The rhythmic control sustains the reverent hush while allowing a crescendo at the mirror.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet mostly disciplined; metaphors (throat, chords, nautilus, membrane) cohere thematically and spatially. Minimal scaffolding and no loops blunt momentum; sentences often do double work. A few piled images approach purple, but they remain legible and propel rather than stall. The final cadence is clean and clarifying.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A striking synthesis: a bunker inspector drawn into a confessional crystal ecology via a pearl that detonates as clarifying light. Familiar apocalypse tropes are transformed into an intimate ritual of witnessing with fresh mechanics (calcite confessions, root-copper crown, mirror stewardship). The turn to “inside-the-glass tending” feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
