<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is vivid and particular—shifting from certifying what stands to preserving absences—and every micro‑choice (ink offering, smuggling confessions into cracks) aligns. “Stoically sensitive” is embodied (the gull’s cry; the chill marble) rather than labeled. The ethical cost of altering surveyed repairs is implied but not confronted on the page by counter‑pressure. A sharper on‑scene consequence or relational crucible would nudge this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clean: a ritual sequence intensifies toward writing directly on the stone and a final conceptual repricing (“every separation…a kind of foundation”). Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise—she seals the notes, closes the inkwell lighter, and walks away. The engineers’ report frame sets stakes but remains ambient, leaving the causal line of external risk underused. Still, the on‑page cost is felt in the renunciation and secret inscription.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion, ladder, fissures, and hydraulic lime are tactile and motive—water and rot constrain how and where she works; the voided keystone charges the final image. Sensory detail is precise across modalities (rusted chains as censers, lake‑grass smell). The inkwell and stone become micro‑settings that govern action and meaning. World rules are consistent and learned through her practiced attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure mounts through a deepening ritual: from a dissolved ink drop to papered fissures to writing on the stone itself. Stakes remain primarily internal and ethical; the permitted tide and engineers’ trust add situational tension without direct pushback. The cost is a quiet renunciation—choosing clandestine memory over pure duty—clear but not harrowingly tested. One explicit constraint forcing a trade‑off in the moment would strengthen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: absence as presence, preservation versus loss, the ethics of recording versus mourning. Recurring images (ink, fissures, keystone void, drawbridge) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final understanding—that separations are “foundations” needing care—feels earned by action. Ambiguity lingers productively about legacy and discovery of her notes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice with a surveyor’s sensibility filters every detail; psychic distance is steady. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, culminating in the keystone beat. No head‑hopping or stance drift. A few lush constructions flirt with purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; images often do double duty (chains as censers, ink as confession). Syntax varies and momentum holds; no loops or scaffold. A minor risk of figurative saturation in the middle (“hushed of arches,” “code of hollows”) but clarity stays intact. The final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—embedding confessions into structural repairs—feels genuinely fresh and thematically integrated. “Interlaced absence” as both method and worldview is inventive and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (high lyricism; quiet conflict) pay off with coherence. Only the lightly engaged external frame keeps it from the very top.</comment>
