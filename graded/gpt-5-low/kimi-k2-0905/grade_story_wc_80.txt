<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motives and interiority are precise and embodied; her stoic sensitivity drives concrete micro-choices (descending, offering ink, hiding confessions). The contradiction—engineer of endurance turned archaeologist of loss—reads credibly and yields action. Stakes remain mostly internal, with limited external resistance, slightly muting visible struggle. Still, her renunciations (of formal duty and direct address) land with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual of planting notes escalates toward the keystone void and culminates in a CR/RR (“every separation… a kind of foundation”). Closure is on the page with conceptual and emotional price (clandestine memorialization, lighter inkwell). Spatial and temporal anchors are clean; the drawbridge/tide window provides a persistent constraint. The final cadence reweights the premise without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion and canal mechanisms are deeply integrated, shaping tactics (wading, prying mortar, accessing the keystone void). Sensory specificity is rich yet purposeful, filtered through a professional’s eye. Recurring objects (inkwell, chains, fissures) charge the final image. The environment constrains choices throughout and frames the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through an intensifying ritual: small fissure to larger wrested stone to the keystone’s absence. Agency drives each deepening, and the cost is emotional, not logistical; there’s no antagonist but the window and secrecy act as pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs at the central dome with a direct inscription. Stakes remain intimate, which slightly softens the sense of risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “interlaced absence” is enacted, not preached, through the method of sealing confessions into wounds. The final insight (“every separation… a kind of foundation”) reweights prior images and avoids moralizing. The notes’ content adds subtext about love, dependence, and failure without closing ambiguity. Resonance lingers in the imagined future scholars discovering her sutures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person close with a distinctive, lyrical texture that matches Mara’s sensibility; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure at the dome. Perceptual signature is strong (engineer’s tactility and reverence for structure). No head-hopping or stance slips. A high lyric register is sustained without register breaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are dense but controlled; images often do double duty (ink as offering and confession). Occasional flourish edges toward purple (“censers that had forgotten their prayers”) but clarity and propulsion never falter. No loops or scaffolding; syntax variety supports cadence. Final sentence cleanly recharges motifs without overrun.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of engineering survey, clandestine memorialization, and “interlaced absence” is fresh and unified. Risks (lyric solemnity, ritual method as plot) pay off in a singular vision. Key turns feel inevitable in hindsight under this premise. Specificity in tools and acts resists generic lyricism.</comment>
