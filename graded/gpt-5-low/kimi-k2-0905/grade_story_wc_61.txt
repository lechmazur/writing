<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—share light without fire—drives clear, character‑specific choices (following the sharp echo, pressing the gear to the beacon). Interiority is textured and embodied (“hearts ache,” the prophecy tightening around his ribs). The generational fracture furnishes real internal conflict between rooted endurance and transmission. His renunciation (leaving the gear, choosing wave over root) feels earned and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: sonar pulses, pattern data, echo → beacon → activation → garden’s reconfiguration. Causality is legible: the new echo triggers pursuit, the beacon enables “light without fire,” and the gear’s ratio resolves into rhythm. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual cost (breaking the family pattern; relinquishing the heirloom). Orientation is clear by ~120 words (who/where/what), with no teleports or rule breaches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nebula garden is not postcard décor; hydrogen blossoms, falling petals, and pollen tactically engage sonar and charge the ending image when the blossoms glow. The gear functions as micro‑setting/tool constraining options (its “refusal of finality” until paired with the beacon’s ember). World rules are learned through action, not exposition. The final tableau—petals suspended, then cool illumination—reweights everything established.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break the generational loss pattern vs. become a bloom) is legible early and tightens with the anomalous echo. The choice to step off the path and interface gear with beacon is the meaningful turn; internal and external pressures braid effectively. Cost is subtler (renouncing rooted sorrow, leaving the heirloom) but present; the resolution is protagonist‑driven. Slight softness on explicit consequence prevents a higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: transmission vs. rootedness, memory without burning, patterns that can be broken by becoming the wave. Recurring images (gear/ratio, petals, echo) shift meaning at the end without sermonizing. The grandmother’s line reprises with altered weight, offering an earned, non‑literal answer. A hair of explicitness in the final aphorism keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is a distinct, controlled lyric register aligned with Kael’s perception; diction is consistent and credible for the world. Psychic distance modulates purposefully under pressure. Purposeful elision (family history, pattern data) is paid off in the beacon scene. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lines carry multi‑function density without purple sludge; metaphors extend coherently from the established physics of this world. Rhythm varies, and sentences avoid scaffold or synonym loops. Key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. The closure image is crisp and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—cosmic horticulture, a quasi‑mathematical heirloom “approximating infinity,” sonar as prayer—feels singular. Turns arise from established particulars, not late rule changes. The beacon twist transforms prior motifs and reads inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in tone and imagery heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
