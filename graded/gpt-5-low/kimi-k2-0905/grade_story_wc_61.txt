<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—“share light without using fire”—is clear and consistent, and his internal contradiction (rooted inheritance vs. desire to break the pattern) is dramatized. Micro-choices under pressure (following the sharper echo, stepping off the path, marrying gear to beacon) reveal his values. The cost is conceptual (renouncing the destined bloom/sorrow) rather than visceral, slightly softening impact. Still, the embodied ache and the monument-leaving make the shift credible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: sonar pings → sharper echo → beacon → reweighted rhythm → flameless illumination. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration; the “crack” sealing provides conceptual cost and a before/after legibility. The beacon’s discovery leans mildly convenient but is causally tied to the sharper echo. Orientation and temporal frame are clear early and feed the payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and functional: hydrogen blossoms, pollen, and petals shape access and action (parting to reveal the beacon) and charge the final glowing image. The recurring object-as-setting (gear) also functions as a micro-setting constraint. Balanced sensory detail avoids a static postcard feel. High control, though I’m capping per global gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the start and tightens with the sharper echo and the choice to fuse gear with beacon. Escalation is primarily a density increase that reweights options; agency drives the turn. The price is more conceptual than felt pain, which slightly mutes the knife-edge. Still, the narrowed path from “become a bloom” to “become a wave” reads earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: inheritance, pattern-breaking, roots vs. wave, and “light without fire” transformed into communal, cool radiance. The final image reweights the premise without over-explaining, though the softened prophecy line edges toward explicitness. Subtext operates in echoes and cadence shifts rather than statements. Emotional aftertaste is contemplative, not saccharine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person close is consistent and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature (scientific-poetic diction). Rhythm modulates with pressure (sharper echo quickens, suspension slows). No head-hopping or stance drift. A few lush turns flirt with purple but remain controlled and character-filtered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do double duty (world + motive + pressure). Minimal redundancy; motif returns are functional, not looped. Figurative language is rich but coherent; no mixed-metaphor snags at the peak beats. Pacing keeps momentum despite lyric density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a gear that “approximates infinity,” sonar through hydrogen blossoms, and a hidden beacon enabling flameless transmission. Turns are earned by setup (generational fractures, rooted stance) and refigured by the final rhythm. The risk is genuine and cohesive, with no gimmickry. Global gate cap applied.</comment>
