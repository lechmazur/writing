<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are vivid and consistent—contain memory, harvest lessons, resist and accept—expressed through embodied actions (carving, whispering commands, hanging the latch). Contradictory impulses (cage vs. key; keep closed vs. open) are dramatized rather than declared. Micro‑choices under pressure accrue credibly to an Earned Stasis. Slight loss: the internal struggle never faces an external counterforce in scene, limiting crucible intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: carving and object‑returns deepen pressure toward a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she repositions the latch, sets the carving for morning light, and reframes memory as both cage and key—with clear emotional cost. Orientation is clean from the first sentence; no causality breaks. The live constraint of grief and the “kettle” clock shape the cadence without needing overt plot turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skylight loft, rain, kettle, tools, and latch are tactile and continuously used; the environment filters through a circus‑honed attention. The skylight light and nail/latch charge the final image, and the jars literalize “containment” as setting‑as‑system. Sensory detail spans smell, touch, sound, and light with purposeful selectivity. The world’s rules remain consistent and integral to choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to live with grief/memory) is signaled early and tightens as carving moves from blank to charged object. The meaningful turn is the acceptance pivot: from “keep the cage closed” to acknowledging memory as cage and key, enacted by hanging the latch and staging the carving for dawn. Cost is palpable in rust‑hued sawdust curls and the blood memory. Escalation is intentionally quiet; a slightly sharper mid‑scene test could heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from objects and acts: cages, latches, commands, jars, and carving synthesize grief as management of danger and love. The final realization avoids moralizing, offering a nuanced reweighting: memory as both prison and liberation. Recurrences (“here and gone,” “wait, watch, come”) shift meaning by the end. A hair more friction around the ethical cost of “opening” would push it higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person closely held to Mara’s perceptual signature—circus lexicon, tool‑truths, storm and sawdust—remains stable and precise. Rhythm modulates with pressure; sentences breathe and tighten around pivotal images without opacity. No head‑hopping or register drift; patterned elision is taught and paid. Diction stays character‑plausible and distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line craft is lush yet purposeful; most metaphors cohere to circus, wood, rain, and blood, pulling double duty. A few density spikes flirt with purple but maintain clarity and momentum. Syntax varies, scaffolding is minimal, and the final image is crisp. Minor repetition (“here and gone”) reads as designed motif rather than loop.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The circus widow carving a reliquary from grief with the cage latch as talisman is fresh and integrated. The jars (“Manes & Mettle,” etc.) and command words recast training as mourning practice, an inventive synthesis. Risks are taken in sustained lyricism and object‑driven structure without obscuring coherence. Slightly familiar grief tropes appear but are transformed through particular craft.</comment>
