<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and enacted under pressure; she refuses gunfire, manipulates superstition, decodes, and prioritizes seeds over spectacle. Interiority is embodied through breath, chain, and patient tactics rather than abstract labels. The main limitation is minimal internal contradiction—she’s almost unerringly competent, with little visible doubt or flaw complicating choices. Still, micro-choices reveal a firm hierarchy of values with on-page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: piano code → vault location → nonlethal impediment → timed artillery → access and planting. The live clock (“before the wall comes down”) constrains tactics and pays off when the shell hits, reconfiguring options without coincidence resolving conflict. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: liberation reframed through seeds with cost (sirens converging, ground temporarily lost). No orientation debt; the lens holds to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The carnival environment and its tools directly shape tactics (chains, mirrors, prize netting, operator hatch) and charge the final image (cellophane arrow reflecting in mirrors). Detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist’s priorities. World rules stay consistent, with setting evolving under artillery and dust. The environment constrains and enables choices at every turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect and access the seed vault) is established early; escalation tightens through the guard incursion and the artillery countdown. The choice to impede without firing forecloses easier paths and raises risk, yielding a concrete consequence. The dance-back entanglement is a smart, character-driven turn rather than a coincidence. Cost remains legible at the end with the regime closing in.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Recurring images (cellophane arrow, minor-seventh chord, seeds) accrue toward a resonant answer: liberation measured by what endures and grows. The seed scattering and sky-shot create subtext without speech. However, the explicit line “liberation is only the first prize; the real victory is what you plant afterward” edges into direct thesis-statement territory, slightly diminishing subtlety. Overall, thematic integration is strong despite that on-the-nose moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, coherent lyric voice with rhythmic control and tactility; metaphors stay inside the carnival/seeds lexicon. Psychic distance is steady; brief dialogue lines are apt and sharpen status dynamics. Patterned elision is purposeful and paid off by closure cadence. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful, motif-consistent imagery; sentences propel rather than linger. Minor risk of ornamental richness, but images cohere and advance action. No loops or scaffolding dulling momentum; syntax varies to match pressure. Final lines land cleanly with charged economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a regime-toppled carnival, a piano-coded vault, cellophane-fletched arrow, and seed-liberation reframing revolt. Turns feel earned from established particulars, not late rule changes. The risks taken in tone and object-motif integration heighten stakes and coherence. The final image feels inevitable and fresh.</comment>
