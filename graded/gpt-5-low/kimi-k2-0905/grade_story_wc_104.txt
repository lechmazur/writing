<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motive (“plant resilience”) and concrete micro‑choices under pressure; competence feels earned via eleven years of waiting. Interior contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers—which trims depth. The chain as ongoing constraint adds texture, but flaws or blind spots never truly snag her. Still, actions align tightly with her values and reveal character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: decode → locate → distract/impede → wall falls → access vault → seeds scattered → banner arrow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (sirens nearing, chain still on, no time to secure safety). The piano‑cipher setup pays off without feeling convenient. Orientation is crisp from the start.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vivid and functional: chains, netting, mirrors, and the Tilt‑A‑Whirl booth all shape tactics and outcome. Micro‑objects (cellophane, aluminum) constrain choices and charge the final image. Environmental pressure (wall about to fall; superstition of guards in the dark) is integrated with action. Strong, selective sensory detail without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and tight: protect and recover seeds without triggering premature collapse. Escalation is protagonist‑driven—the ghostly distraction, the waltz into netting, the timed dash. Tangible costs and a narrowing window keep pressure on, though she faces few true setbacks. The siren‑converging end preserves consequences beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme coheres (liberation vs. what follows; resilience as true victory) and images earn resonance (arrow/banner; seeds in cracked soil). However, the explicit moral line “liberation is only the first prize; the real victory is what you plant afterward” undercuts subtext near the end. Much else works by implication and image, so the overt statement slightly blunts the afterglow. Still, the final cadence carries a meaningful reweighting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, confident lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful diction; the ringmaster line lands as character‑specific bravado. The prose modulates under pressure without losing texture. Brief dialogue is functional and subtextual. POV holds steady with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density and kinetic imagery; most sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative language is lush but coherent, with only slight risk of purple in stacked metaphors. No scaffold or synonym loops slow momentum. Final images are clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: abandoned carnival as war‑torn site, cellophane‑fletched arrow, piano‑cipher to a seed vault—ingenious and purposeful. Risks in tone and motif cohere and heighten stakes. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the established logic. The closing banner‑arrow over sleeping seeds is memorable and specific.</comment>
