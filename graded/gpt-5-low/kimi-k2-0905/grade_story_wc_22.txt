<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (“to let a garden reclaim the battlefield”) drives repeated, tactile choices (crushing pods, singing old tongues, waiting). Interiority is embodied via “narrow vastness,” bird‑dialects, and material tokens (the rusted button). The final easing of breath reads earned by ritual persistence and on‑page acceptance from the reef. Minor limitation: few contradictory impulses are dramatized under real counterpressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and holds: ritual acts layer until the concord accepts the “truce encoded in chlorophyll.” Orientation is clean from the first lines; causality is lyrical but coherent. Closure lands on the page with cost—the first shoot breaking, the box emptied, and his inward constriction easing. The price remains mostly emotional rather than situationally forced, holding it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The jetty/reef ecology is vivid and functional: bullet‑holed planks, coral dust, and phosphorescence shape the acts and the final image. Sensory selection is character‑specific (storm‑fisherman, dead‑language ear) and integrated with action. The setting charges the climax as roots “tighten warped timber into something like prayer.” No static cataloguing; world rules are consistent within the mythic register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting grief/war into growth) tightens through tern warnings, dwindling time, and the reef’s conditional acceptance. Escalation reads as density and cadence shift rather than reversals; the moment of phosphorescent emergence and the shoot’s break crystallize commitment. The cost is felt mainly internally with modest external resistance. Strong, if quiet, pressure for this length and lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Reconciliation through ecology, language, and memory emerges from particulars (seed pods, barnacle “drums,” children’s secret vines) without moralizing. Recurring images reprice meaning at the end (iron → roots; battle‑cry → pollen; names pronounced by bees). The “narrow vastness” motif matures into an earned, unsentimental mercy. Ambiguity remains alive (gift or accusation) while stance is clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with precise lexicon (“submerged concord,” “truce encoded in chlorophyll”) remains stable and POV‑true. Rhythm modulates with pressure, balancing long, sinuous sentences against clipped, charged lines. Elision is purposeful; no head‑hopping or register slips. Brief quoted lines operate as action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; verbs are strong and scaffolding is minimal. Figurative threads cohere (reef/war/garden) and avoid mixed metaphors. The lushness nears saturation but maintains clarity, especially at closure (“first shoot breaking”). No noticeable loops or cadence templates dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a coachman‑planter translating birds and barnacles to broker a reef’s truce through seeds. Risky, specific choices feel inevitable in hindsight and cohere tonally and thematically. The button, merfolk idiom, and “narrow vastness” avoid gimmickry by integrating with action and cost. The final reweighting is both surprising and earned.</comment>
