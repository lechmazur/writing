<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Richly contradictory interiority (engineered drought vs. reverence for the birds) drives concrete actions—kneeling, split nails, tears, the ritual with the music box. Motivation is specific and sustained, and the micro‑choices (winding the box, placing the egg) align with his amoral calculus. The emotional progression is credible and embodied, not just asserted. The arc lands as Earned Stasis/acceptance rather than a full pivot, but it feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive coheres: map → nest → winding → apparition → dissolution → egg as “fossil of sound.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with legible cost (a valley killed to house an echo, mines persist). Because/therefore links are clear within the lyric logic; no soft reset. A small textual fragment mid‑late (“He’d come to release them and found they’d released”) wobbles polish but not closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The salt flat, thunder, and lithium context are vivid and POV‑filtered; weather and drought constrain action (no rain will come) and charge the final image. Recurring objects (music box, egg) function as micro‑settings. Specific sensory detail (mineral crust, corroded brass, mother‑of‑pearl sheen) deepens atmosphere without catalogue bloat. World rules stay consistent within the lyric supernatural frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (release/preservation) and tightens as the storm nears and the music box winds down. Agency drives escalation: he follows the crack‑map, digs, winds, and places the egg, with the price (permanent drought, moral cost) explicit. The cadence shift at the box’s slowing and the ghosts dissolving reads as a meaningful deepening. Stakes remain intimate but consequential; no coincidence resolves anything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation as violence, philanthropy as self‑myth, extinction’s echo as the only immortality. The final images reweight the premise without moralizing—ghosts sink into salt, the egg becomes “fossil of sound,” mines continue. Ambiguity is meaningful (reverence vs. complicity) and resists platitude. The resonance lingers beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Controlled, distinctive lyric third‑person with consistent distance; diction and metaphors fit the focalizer’s sensibility (engineer/collector of loss). Rhythm modulates with pressure (clicking mechanism, lengthened lulls). No head‑hopping; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. A single mid‑late fragment slightly mars finish but the voice holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density with strong images and mostly disciplined figurative language. Minor overwriting risk is managed, but one visible artifact (“He’d come to release them and found they’d released”) reads as an unfinished sentence in the final third. Repetition (“fractured grace,” “echo”) is mostly functional but borders on insistence. Proofreading polish would lift this materially.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—lithium‑funded drought as a reliquary for spectral birds summoned by a corroded music box—is fresh and coherent. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the chosen logic; risk‑taking is purposeful rather than gimmicky. Emotional truth (guilt, self‑myth) underwrites the strangeness. Small polish issues prevent an even higher mark.</comment>
