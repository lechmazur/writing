<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and specific—she seeks the hum to keep her “brittle awakening” from cracking, trading communal memory for momentum. The decisive choice at the henge (company vs. self) is earned by prior setup and carries felt cost. Interiority is embodied through tactile images (gnomon mirroring every cell), though contradictory impulses remain more implied than dramatized in real time. Secondary presence (archivist) applies slight pressure but remains peripheral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: library → leap → henge choice → ascent; causal throughline is clean, with the core turn at the stone circle. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis when she chooses “self” and splits memory; later images extend rather than undercut it. Minor ding for the final sentence’s truncation, which blurs the last cadence even though the earlier closure is intact. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is superbly integrated: tidal library dictates timing (“No exits, only tides”), the cloud‑sea enables the leap, and the hidden henge constrains the choice. Recurring objects (sundial, bluestones) operate as micro‑settings that charge the final images. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across senses. World rules are consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining self without shattering into extinction‑loneliness—tightens at the henge where she pays by forfeiting communal memory. Escalation reads as a deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate to the lens. Costs are legible (memory split, herd lost) and drive subsequent tactics (strapping the sundial, becoming “her own dawn”). Some later marvels feel epilogue‑like and slightly diffuse the peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of solitude versus independence emerges organically through concrete acts (placing the sundial, splitting memory, “teaching her lungs to photosynthesize independence”). The equation “solitude equals momentum” risks on‑the‑nose statement but is earned by the prior imagery and choice. The final prairie image (despite truncation) gestures toward a resonant reconfiguration of silence into agency. Ambiguity invites reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by the quagga/human hybrid sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (quicker at the leap, ceremonial at the henge) while remaining legible. Minimal dialogue is effective and character‑specific (“No exits,” “only tides”). No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; metaphoric texture is rich but largely coherent and purposeful. Minor purple accumulation in the post‑closure ascent and a final truncated line nick momentum. Syntax varies well; no notable loops or scaffolding. Clarity remains strong even under lyrical pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—last quagga, tidal library, sound‑henge, atomically reflective sundial—feels singular and thematically integrated. The core turn (trading memory for momentum) is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and diction pay off without obscuring the drive. Only the slight over‑extension after the core turn and the clipped final line keep it from the top band.</comment>
