<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and temperament are clear and consistent, and her socially perceptive read of others credibly redirects her tactic from speech to image. Interiority is embodied (paint‑stained fingers, sand grit), with a gentle contradiction between whimsy and unease. However, pressure on her is light—she meets little resistance—so the cost and struggle feel modest. The final endurance/stance is earned but not deeply contested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmosphere thickens, the tile sparks resolve, the mandala accrues until a communal Charged Poise settles. Orientation is swift and clean, and the final image reconfigures options—shared attention replaces silence—without violating the setup. Cost is conceptual (renouncing speech, expending finite art in a transient medium) rather than dramatic, yet it lands. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, but it reads earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s acoustics-turned-failure and the lavender mist actively shape tactics: speech would be swallowed, so she chooses sand patterns. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful; the tile and mist recur and charge the final image. World rules feel consistent and are learned through action, not exposition. The environment functions as constraint and catalyst, not just backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—creating meaning without words—is established early and tightens as the mandala grows and onlookers gather. The key deepening beat is placing the tile at the center, which reweights the hush. Pressure rises coherently, but opposition is largely ambient; no real trade‑off beyond effort and risk of nothing happening. The price is felt but quiet, keeping escalation effective but not bracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of communal meaning‑making under linguistic collapse emerges organically through images and choices rather than thesis statements. The tile’s reprise at center concretizes the idea of repurposed resonance; the hush is reinterpreted as charged attention. The final line resists moralizing by offering a starting point, not an answer, though it edges close to articulation. Subtext lives in bodies loosening and gazes converging.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is supple, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s perceptual bias toward texture, color, and pattern. Psychic distance is steady, and diction remains coherent without register slips. No dialogue appears, which suits the premise and avoids false notes. Rhythm modulates well from atmospheric opening to concentrated close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with high information density—images often do double duty for world and theme. A few phrases (“lilac unease,” “fever dream,” “soundless scream”) brush purple, but they remain legible and controlled. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax maintain momentum. The final image is clear and unfumbled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—art as nonverbal interjection in a silenced whispering gallery—feels fresh and specific. Chalk nebulae, a whispering tile, and sand mandala tactics cohere into a memorable, non‑templated vision. Risk lies in committing to a quiet, accumulative closure, and it pays off. Emotional truth carries the novelty without gimmickry.</comment>
