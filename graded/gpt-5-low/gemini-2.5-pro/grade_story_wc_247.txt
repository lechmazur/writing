<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—to translate silence into music—is clear and embodied through tactile actions (camera clicks, hand‑signs). Interiority is specific and sensorial rather than abstract, with a credible push from Lyra’s urging. Internal contradiction exists (joy in finding vs sorrow in loss), though it remains more conceptual than behaviorally conflictual. The final endurance/renunciation is felt via Lyra dissolving, but his struggle rarely bites back beyond lyric resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned mapping deepens to the ferry‑landing nexus, where the cadence breaks and reweights the stake. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration: the harbor’s silence becomes song, and Lyra’s voice dissolves—an emotional cost. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when anchored). The causal thread within the pattern (mapping → “Deeper” → “Now” → disruption) is coherent and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harbor is vivid and functional: pylons, crane shadow, waterlogged bench, and the erased ferry landing focus his mapping choices. The environment constrains and guides tactics (he hunts loci of forgetting; the ferry landing becomes the decisive site). Details are selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. The final image is charged by setting as the harbor’s atmosphere literally transforms.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—disrupt the harbor’s crushing stillness—tightens credibly when Lyra pushes him to the “place where the forgetting is total” and at “Now.” The escalation is a clear density increase culminating in his most complex verse. Cost is mostly emotional and conceptual (expenditure of self, Lyra’s dissipation) rather than materially constraining, but it is legible on the page. Tension is sustained through cadence and choice rather than antagonist mechanics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and art’s ethical charge evolve through concrete acts (mapping, pleading with silence) rather than sermonizing. The final reweighting (silence transformed into an ongoing, melancholic song) offers an implicit answer about remembrance without didactic moral. “Joyful sorrow” is earned via particulars (the bench, the lost boat, the choir‑like resonance). Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with close focalization; the diction suits the sensibility of a ritualistic artist. Lyra’s minimal dialogue carries subtext and pushes action without breaking POV. Rhythm modulates well at the climax as gestures become a “desperate, beautiful ballet.” No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and propulsive; images do multiple jobs (camera as divining rod; harbor as cathedral). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and not mixed; cadence varies and supports momentum. Minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops; syntax clarity persists through the peak beat. Closing lines efficiently reframe prior motifs without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A striking synthesis: a film‑less camera to capture absence, a bespoke sign language to score silence, and a harbor’s amnesia given music. The “mapping silence” method is specific and drives tactics and outcome. The final repricing of silence feels inevitable in hindsight under the established pattern. Risky lyric mode lands cleanly without obscuring stakes.</comment>
