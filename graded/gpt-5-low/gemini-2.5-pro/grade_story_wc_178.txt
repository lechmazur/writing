<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kavi’s frugality and scientific rigor drive his choices with admirable consistency, and the “empirically ironic” push toward miracle feels character‑true. Interiority is specific (silence and starlight as hoarded resources) with concrete micro‑choices in the ritual. The internal contradiction (skeptic’s method for a mystical aim) is present but rarely stressed under pressure, so conflict feels smooth rather than contested. The renunciation at the end reads earned but the cost is more conceptual than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single‑scene build holds under a Hybrid lens with accumulative dominance; the ritual intensifies to a visible reconfiguration (the nebula’s reveal) and an Earned Stasis coda (dismantling the altar). Orientation is crisp from the outset and the set‑ups (tile, schematic, alignment) pay off cleanly. The cost—keeping the secret, choosing inward treasure over power—lands, if quietly. The because/therefore chain is intact, though the pressure is more tonal than adversarial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ziggurat observatory, obsidian dust, and chalk‑water string are vivid, profession‑filtered, and integrated into action. The environment enables and subtly constrains tactics (height, quiet, alignment window) and charges the final image through the dismantled altar. World rules feel consistent and lived‑in without museum‑tour bloat. Sensory selection favors purpose over cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncloaking a secret—stays clear, with a meaningful tightening at the alignment moment and the tile’s placement. Pressure is largely internal and procedural; there’s little counterforce beyond time and precision. The price (solitary knowledge; renunciation of worldly stakes) is legible but soft. Tension works at a quiet, sentence‑scale cadence rather than through hard reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around conservation, devotion encrypted as mathematics, and the trade of public power for private revelation. The final gesture—carefully erasing the altar and pocketing the fulfilled tile—reweights the piece without moralizing. The science/mysticism braid earns its resonance through particulars rather than declaration. Ambiguity invites reflection while remaining grounded.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third voice is assured, textured, and consistent with Kavi’s perception and lexicon; rhythm modulates well from preparation to hum to hush. Elevated diction suits the character and setting without drifting into abstraction. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. The narrative confidence avoids over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑dense with generally clean momentum; most lines do more than one job. A few lush phrases flirt with purple but remain coherent and purposeful. Syntax varies; no noticeable loops or scaffold. The final image lands clearly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ancient Babylon, a magic square as ritual interface, and “encrypted devotion” offer a fresh synthesis executed with integrity. The reveal avoids cliché spectacle for a precise, textural miracle, and the earned secrecy is an elegant risk. The concept feels singular to this character and world. Small costs prevent it from tipping into mere ornament.</comment>
