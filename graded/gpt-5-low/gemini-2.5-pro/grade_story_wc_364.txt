<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (“to coax resilience from rubble”) drives credible, costly choices. His fear sits beside resolve, and the barter of cherished sensory memories embodies a lived contradiction. Interiority is concrete (plums, breeze), not label‑speak. The quiet decision to descend again tomorrow reads as earned endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: off‑world theft → failing arches → mine descent → memory barter → geode activation → arch stabilizes. Closure lands on the page with tangible cost (lost tastes and breezes) and a decisive external change (blue‑traced arch). Orientation is clean early and the lens remains causal throughout. The single scene holds scope and pays off its set‑ups without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The world is vivid and functional: floating arches shedding dust, scarred mines as “old wounds,” a geothermal cavern with a lifeless geode. Environment and objects constrain choice and charge the ending—he must go underground to affect what’s above. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elian’s bias. The final blue‑lined arch reweights the setting’s stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the start and tightens at the barter: the price of revival will be personal memory. The escalation is primarily internal-to-ritual, with one meaningful deepening rather than multiple turns. Cost is unmistakable, though external opposition is minimal. The earned result reframes options (he will return diminished yet resolute).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of sacrifice-as-healing and using wounds to mend wounds develop through concrete acts, not sermonizing. “Bartered awakenings” integrates rule and meaning; the plum/breeze forfeitures avoid platitude and sting. The ending’s image—azure lines steadying an arch—offers a resonant, nonliteral answer about resilience. Ambiguity remains where it should: how much of himself he can afford to lose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical without drift, and aligned to Elian’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate with the ritual’s gravity and the climb back to light. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; certainty stays within plausible knowledge. The prose avoids explanatory crutches and trusts image to carry meaning.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean, economical, and textured; images do double duty (silk as tool and twilight). Figurative language stays coherent and purposeful; no loops or scaffold bloat. Rhythm supports momentum from descent to offering to aftermath. Minor flourish never tips into purple or obscures action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: floating lithic arches, a geode awakened by bartered sensory memories via a magician’s silk. The healing‑through‑wound tactic is thematically and tactically integrated. Turns arise from prior particulars rather than convenience. The final reweighting (visible revival at personal cost) reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
