<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—to reconcile rival towns through choral harmony—is clear, consistent, and rooted in personal history via the rosette. His internal tension between resignation and persistence is credible and culminates in a concrete methodological shift. Emotional texture is embodied (breath, shoulders, silence) rather than labeled. Secondary characters are collective rather than individual, limiting relational crucible nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece coherently builds from failure to a pared‑back method, landing in a charged, unified hum. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: he renounces addition for subtraction, and the group yields pride to breathe together. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; single transition is clean. The cost is largely conceptual (letting go of history and words), felt but quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn atmosphere are vivid and character‑filtered, with the rosette functioning as a micro‑setting tool that drives the epiphany. Specifics (old paper, dry leaves, fretwork) are tactile and purposeful. The environment directly shapes the tactic shift at rehearsal. Tone and space charge the final image without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are focused early: can he forge harmony from inherited animosity. Escalation tightens via the deliberate subtraction tactic—no lyrics, only breath, then a single note—narrowing options with a measured price (yielding pride, surrendering individual show). The pressure arc is more deepening than reversing, consistent with the lens. The cost is subtle and could sharpen with one concrete friction point resisted then released on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme—harmony through subtraction, craft as community ethic—emerges organically from object, setting, and tactic. The rosette metaphor evolves from artifact to method, reweighted at the end through the held note. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“Our resentments…that is the noise”), but the final image earns its resonance without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on patience and vanishing arts beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elias’s perception; diction and rhythm match his contemplative craft sensibility. Dialogue is minimal and natural, letting subtext operate through gesture and breath. Psychic distance tightens at the end without leakage or hedging. Voice avoids register drift and maintains a distinct perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, well‑paced, and image‑dense without purple overgrowth; sentences carry multiple jobs efficiently. Occasional familiar figures (“turning a tide with a teacup”) don’t stall clarity. Momentum holds as description folds into action and choice. No scaffold loops or filter stacks blunt the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “subtraction as harmony” tactic, embodied through breath and a luthier’s rosette, offers a fresh angle on communal reconciliation. The final hum as earned stasis feels specific rather than generic. While the core situation (choir healing division) is familiar, its execution is particular and sincere. The risk is modest but coherent, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
