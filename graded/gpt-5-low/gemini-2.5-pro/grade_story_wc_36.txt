<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority anchors every move: grief and purpose manifest in tactile choices (driftwood, the flute, playing a question). Contradictory impulses—keeper vs dissector, barrier vs weave—operate simultaneously on the page. The final renunciation (needle not hammer) feels earned and costly. Slight risk of neatness in the self-articulation tempers the top end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: placement → uncasing → playing → shimmer → insight. Closure is a conceptual repricing with on‑page cost; the final image reweights the guardianship’s purpose. Orientation is clean, single-scene cohesion intact. No dangling setups or causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon hush and driftwood spiral constrain tactics and charge the ending; the flute functions as micro‑setting that reframes agency. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered (heat‑haze shimmer, ozone phantom). Environment evolves with action (hush densifies, edges soften, then snap back). World rules are learned via use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal comprehension, tightened by a single decisive tactic shift (play a question, not a ward). Pressure coheres through the hush → shimmer → insight sequence, with a visible price (pain, acceptance of prior misreading). Stakes remain intimate but never abstract. No antagonist needed; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Harmony vs separation emerges organically through object and action (flute as needle vs hammer). The final note of truth reweights all prior images without sentimentality. One sentence edges toward thematic statement (“The guardianship was never about…”) but is earned by scene pressure. Subtext hums in the canyon hush and in how sound joins silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with stable close POV; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Perceptual signature (engineering of currents, tactile handling of the case) feels character-specific. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Lyrical compression remains legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; rhythm breathes with the scene. Occasional elevated metaphors (“cathedral of silent, waiting stone,” “avalanchingly quiet”) risk purple but stay coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks dull momentum. Final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar motifs (veil, guardian, flute) are transformed by precise tactic—playing a question and aligning driftwood with unseen currents. The harmony reframing feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is specific and unsentimental. Not radical in premise, but executed with fresh texture and integrity.</comment>
