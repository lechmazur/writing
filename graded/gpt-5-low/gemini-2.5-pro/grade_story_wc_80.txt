<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s stoic exterior and tender interior are dramatized, not told, especially in the frantic, bodily search for the inkwell. Micro‑choices—writing the salvaged sentence, deciding to seal it despite the mishap—reveal value hierarchy. The cost (scraped knuckles, risk, shaken composure) grounds his devotion. Slight idealization creeps in, but it’s kept honest by tactile detail.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: solitary mission → fissure found → inkwell lost → recovery → sealing completes the intention → final stasis of purpose. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he recommits to bearing witness at visible cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (drawbridge, marsh, pavilion) with a clean two‑shard return to the hut. Hybrid drive with accumulative lyric pressure at the end holds consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The marsh, the raised drawbridge, and the submerged pavilion are tactile and constrain action—the current creates the crisis and the fissure enables his method. Sensory detail (brackish water, iron‑scented ink, slick weed) is POV‑filtered and purposeful. The inkwell functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image as he cleans it. Space and weather remain coherent and dynamically affect choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the vessel of memory and seal the note—tightens when the rogue current upends control. The decisive beat (diving, finding brass by touch) narrows options and extracts a physical price. Resolution earnestly stems from his agency, not coincidence. While intimate rather than high‑stakes, pressure scales convincingly for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Memory versus erosion is embodied through particular acts (vellum slip, embedded sentence) rather than abstract statements. The final image—meticulous cleaning and acceptance of witness over rebuilding—offers a resonant answer without sermonizing. “Interlaced absence” accrues through the pavilion’s ghosts and reweights the ending. A faint whiff of thesis in “He did not build, and he could not reclaim” stays just inside earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elias sustains a distinct perceptual signature. Diction (surveying tools, tidal textures) aligns with his sensibility, modulating into clipped urgency during the search and easing after. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. The rhythm supports pressure and release without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient; images often do multiple jobs (ink as “iron and permanence” binds sense, theme, and object). Minor purple edges (“skeletal hand”) are balanced by concrete action and clean sequencing. No scaffold loops or filter stacks slow momentum. The final cadence is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—seeding foundational repairs with salvaged sentences—is fresh and thematically integrated. The inkwell rescue reframes artifact care as sacred and perilous rather than quaint. Specifics of place and craft keep it from template melancholy. It risks quietness and wins through integrity of vision.</comment>
