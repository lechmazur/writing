<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (quell the “sieved hush”) and embodied guilt (“watch hand” in palm) drive concrete micro‑choices (descending to the shore, sifting wood, thumb in groove). Internal conflict is credible: pride in false‑memory skill turned curse, and the final turn reframes that flaw into purpose. The shift to “restore true ones” is earned by the revelation and costs him morally. Slight telliness in the resolve paragraph keeps it short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: terrace grief → shore search → tactile trigger (gouged oak) → revelation of erasure → decision to rebuild memories. Closure is both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing—the silence becomes a weapon, and he redirects his vocation at personal cost. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear from the opening. The price is conceptual/emotional rather than enacted, but it lands on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and filtered through POV (“sandpaper on bone,” cobalt terrace) and the shore procedure materially enables the discovery. Recurring objects (driftwood piece and watch hand) charge the final image and reweight stakes. The environment feels chosen for both history with Anya and method. Not quite constraining tactics moment‑by‑moment, but it meaningfully shapes the turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early; pressure coheres as the search intensifies into the gouged oak beat. The meaningful tightening is the discovery that silence was engineered, foreclosing the option of simple mourning and forcing a new, costlier path. Resolution arises from his agency to repurpose his talent. Mostly internalized pressure keeps it a notch below peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, erasure, and ethical use of fabrication emerges through image and turn rather than moralizing. The “sieved hush” returns redefined as weapon, deepening the inquiry into truth versus protective lies. Final stance—forcing the world to remember—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the opening ache. Slight explicitness in the resolve paragraph trims ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is steady, lyrical, and character‑specific; diction like “sieved hush,” “acidic burn,” and “tempered regret” coheres with Elias’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates from meditative to charged at the oak discovery without head‑hopping. No gratuitous withholding; the reveal follows tactile contact in scene. Occasional elevated phrasing edges close to purple but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—image, action, and psyche—with minimal scaffold; the read‑aloud rhythm varies. Figurative language is strong and mostly clean; “sandpaper on bone” and “structured absence” are memorable without muddle. Minor repetition of concepts (“sieved hush,” regret) is purposeful rather than looped. A hint of declarative summary in the final resolve prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—black‑market genealogist who crafts memories, driftwood scrying, and industrialized erasure—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The core turn transforms tropes (lost lover, memory manipulation) into a personal mission with ethical bite. Specific objects (watch hand, gouged oak) deliver originality without gimmickry. Risk is meaningful and coherent throughout.</comment>
