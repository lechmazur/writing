<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—listening for unheard stories—translates into concrete, high‑stakes action, and her cultivated foolishness is an operative trait, not a label. Competence (embroidery as code, timing the transmission) is balanced by believable caution and concealment, though internal contradiction is mild. The emotional embodiment is strong in tactile details (needle, silk, breath syncing with the hum) but there’s limited on‑page fear or self‑doubt during the peak. The final endurance stance—returning to stitch and wait—reads as earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: observed anomalies → encoded map → timed burst during calibration → confirmation → charged waiting. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when clear within the opening), and the gyroscopic window provides a crisp structural spine. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the act is done, options reweighted, and the cost is the risk and waiting under threat of a coup. Minor limitation: much of the conspiracy is summarized rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory, the dome’s motion, and the eternal candle are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered, with professional detail used functionally (calibration channel as access). Environment constrains tactics—the telescope’s window dictates timing—and the candle returns to charge the final image. Sensory economy favors texture over catalog; world rules feel consistent. A hair more tactile obstruction from the space itself could push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwarting a coup) is clear and tightened by the three‑minute window, with a genuine timing squeeze and a momentary lag creating a credible pinch. Agency drives the turn: synchronizing her burst with the alignment handshake. The visible price is mostly implied (risk of discovery, the foreclosed path of safety), and on‑page resistance is light beyond the lag. Still, pressure coheres and grows appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of hidden labor, encoded truth, and silence as both cover and medium emerge through particulars (embroidery as map; candlelight as witness). The final image repunctuates the premise: giving voice to the “unheard story” reframes waiting as charged resistance. No moralizing; resonance arises from objects and action. Slightly heavier subtext in the midsection might deepen the counter‑reading of complicity versus watchfulness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Point of view is stable, selective, and plausibly informed; the prose carries a distinct, quiet precision consistent with Elara’s craft. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure (the lag beat tightens without purple drift). No dialogue, but internal texture functions as action. Elision is purposeful and paid off (her “adjacent possibilities” thinking leads to the decisive tactic).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful; images often do double duty (silk/constellations as code and cosmos). Density is high without clogging; minimal scaffolding or loops. A few abstract phrases (“silent symphony,” “ghost‑stitch”) lean lyrical but remain coherent and voice‑true. The closing cadence is tight and lands on a charged image without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The embroiderer‑as‑intelligence operative in a cosmic observatory is a fresh synthesis, and the calibration window as smuggled channel is elegant. The eternal candle motif avoids cliché through concrete function and reprise. Risks are taken in keeping the climax quiet and procedural, and they pay off. Originality is high though not radically transformative at the thematic level.</comment>
