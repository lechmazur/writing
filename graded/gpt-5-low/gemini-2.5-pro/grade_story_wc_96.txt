<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s monthly molt (Reckoner → Architect) gives him a credible internal contradiction that informs his choices, notably welcoming the drifters. Motivation to rebuild and seed poems is clear and embodied in action. Interiority is economical yet specific (“cathedral of decay,” the prison library memory), though the cost of suppressing the Reckoner is implied more than tested. Elara functions as stabilizing counter‑pressure, but their dynamic faces only a light on‑page test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scene layers salvage, backstory, and the poem “arsenal” until the drifters arrive and the stance crystallizes. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Silas offers shelter and a poem and the four begin sorting, a clear before/after. Causality is clean and contained to one location and window. The cost is mostly conceptual (risk, commitment), not explicit, which keeps it just shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted library under a star‑holed dome is vivid, tactile, and filtered through Silas’s sensibility; details like water‑warped spines and shattered glass do double duty for tone and world. The moonlight and ruin charge the final image and mirror the rebuilding theme. Setting modestly constrains choices (shelter, salvage) and supplies the tools of their resistance. It’s richly atmospheric without drifting into catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—protecting and rebuilding a haven of words—and the arrival of the drifters supplies the single tightening beat. Silas’s choice to welcome them rather than guard resources is the turn, tied to his Architect state. The visible price is underplayed; danger remains a suggestion rather than a felt cost. Tension is quiet but present, operating more in stance than confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: poems as seeds, rebuilding as resistance, and community as the counter to anarchy. The coffee tin arsenal and prison‑library memory ground the abstract in concrete particulars. The final image reweights prior motifs (moonlight, ruin, books) without moralizing. A couple of lines edge toward declared thesis (“This was their arsenal”), but they’re supported by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person limited voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and modulates with pressure. Dialogue is spare, natural, and purposeful—“The moon is new.”/“And so am I.”—carrying subtext about identity and stance. Diction fits Silas’s sensibility and maintains a distinct texture. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: images like “sliver of bone” and “luminous fracture” feel earned and controlled. Sentences vary rhythmically and avoid scaffold or loops; information density is high with few wasted words. A couple of elevated metaphors risk purple if overused, but the piece largely balances lyricism with momentum. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rebuilding a library post‑collapse via clandestine poems is a fresh angle, and the monthly persona molt adds distinctive texture. The poem‑as‑seed/arsenal conceit is integrated, not ornamental. The quiet turn toward community feels inevitable yet newly cast in this world. It stops short of a radical structural risk, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
