<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelan’s motivation and ethos—reverence, patience, and the ambition to “navigate without moving”—are clear and drive choices. Micro-choices (waiting rather than disturbing, using the flock, guiding rather than silencing) reveal character. However, internal contradiction is light; the piece leans on competence with minimal friction or competing impulses. The final renunciation/guidance feels earned but relatively low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single scene coherence and a tight accumulative drive are evident: new frequency → arrowhead → flock mapping → harmonic release. Closure lands on the page with the pulse’s softening and the arrowhead going inert, a clear before/after. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than concrete, but sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon of bone and echoes is vivid and functional; acoustics and avian life shape tactics and the solution. Details are selective and POV-filtered (dust, vertebrae, dusk-ravens) and recur to charge the ending (“acoustic heart”). World rules are taught through action rather than exposition. The setting constrains what’s respectful and possible, elevating the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (guide a wandering pulse; prove a form of navigation), and pressure tightens through the discovery and the flock’s chaotic scatter. The key deepening—seeing the hunter’s regret—reweights the task. Yet resistance is mild and there’s little jeopardy or sacrifice beyond attention and restraint. The resolution is earned but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of guidance vs. domination, honoring the dead, and the ethics of attention emerge through action and image, not statement. The final reassurance (“They are safe… You can rest”) reframes navigation as an act of care, reweighting the opening desire. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection without moralizing. The arrowhead and flock serve as thematic engines, not ornaments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a contemplative third-person close. Diction fits the world and character (“harmonic,” “acoustic heart”) without register drift. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure and release, especially at the climax. No head-hopping or unearned certainty intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is dense but clean, with multi-function lines and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent to the setting; repetition patterns are disciplined. Momentum is maintained through image-linked causality rather than explanation. Minor lushness never muddies clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—harmonic stone skimming, bone towers, echo-reading via flock patterns, and grief as a lingering frequency—feels fresh and inevitable. The method and resolution grow from the world’s logic rather than late inventions. The risk of a quiet, lyric closure pays off with conceptual clarity. Emotional truth grounds the strangeness.</comment>
