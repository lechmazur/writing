<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elian’s yearning for sincerity and his craftsman’s patience motivate consistent, goal-driven choices (assembling the map, following it, planting the seed). Interiority is textured through objects (fern, tools) rather than labels. However, internal contradiction and on‑page cost are light; the path from discovery to resolve is smooth. The identity shift (“not just a calligrapher... a cultivator”) lands but with limited felt sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: find fragments → reassemble → decode → descend → the postal plate opens the vault → conceptual turn to seed truth. Closure reads as a decisive reorientation (CR/Earned Stasis hybrid), with a final action of planting. The cost is mostly conceptual and anticipatory rather than dramatized, slightly softening the landing. Orientation is anchored early and remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, smog sky, maintenance shafts, and arboretum are vividly particular and filtered through a calligrapher’s gaze. Tools and environment constrain choices (nutrient‑paste lamps for work; plate as key; vault architecture) and charge the final planter image. World rules stay consistent and purposeful. A strong, atmospheric weave without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover authenticity) is legible, and pressure coheres through the map’s deepening to vault discovery. Escalation is exploratory rather than adversarial; options narrow via the plate/key beat. The final act (planting) reflects agency but the immediate price remains implied, keeping the tension moderate. A credible tightening, not a severe trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Recurring images (fern, postal plate, seeds) reweight at the end, binding honesty to cultivation in a fresh way. The revelation that “lost conversations” became the medium for growth meaningfully reframes prior details. A few lines verge on thesis statement (“He understood everything”), but the final act/image carries resonance. The piece invites reflection on public truth without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is steady, close third with a controlled, tactile diction matching a meticulous artisan. Rhythm modulates well between patient reconstruction and the quiet vault reveal. No head‑hopping or register drift; lyric touches feel voice‑motivated. Minor elevated phrasing appears but doesn’t break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional familiar metaphors (“sweet poison,” “oasis of honesty”) skim toward on‑the‑nose but are balanced by concrete specificity. Momentum is maintained through careful syntactic variation. Line‑level clarity supports the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—truth‑sensing flora, a postal plate key, and a seed bank of sincerity in a smog‑sealed city—feels distinct and inevitable in hindsight. The twist relocates “treasure” from archive to cultivation without gimmick. Emotional stakes are intimately scaled yet thematically bold. Risks are coherent and pay off in the final planting.</comment>
