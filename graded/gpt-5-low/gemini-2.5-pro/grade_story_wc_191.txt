<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—save the system by locating the stairway—drives every action, and her “wisely adventurous” temperament is dramatized via sonic problem‑solving over force. Interiority is specific enough (sensory recall of “sonic architecture,” measured patience) though contradictions are light; she remains highly competent with limited visible struggle. The renunciation of a crown in favor of memory as sovereignty reads earned but low‑cost. A touch more friction or doubt under the clock would deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: hum opens veil → orchard/monolith → peeling reveals map → shard completes circuit → signal fills throne and cancels purge. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and a conceptual repricing (the throne needed a heart, not a body). Orientation is clean and the single‑scene structure holds under a causal lens. The cost is present but modest, mostly time pressure and forfeiture of rule rather than a punishing loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The environment is vivid and functional: the waterfall requires sonic access, the orchard supplies energy, and the pillar’s palimpsest governs tactics. Details are selective, sensory, and POV‑filtered (“metallophytes,” “data‑rich fruit”), and objects meaningfully constrain choice. The closing image is charged by setting mechanics (energy flows, staircase forms, light dissolves). Strong integration without touristic excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake and ticking clock are established early and tighten as dawn approaches; peeling successive layers provides progressive pressure. The meaningful turn is the reveal that the throne is a system keyed by the shard, not a seat for a person. Escalation is steady rather than surprising, with minimal setback or counterpressure beyond time. The price (foregoing the crown and risking failure under a deadline) reads, but could cut deeper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: memory as sovereignty, preservation over domination, and technology as cultural organ rather than weapon. The final repricing—“THRONE FILLED” by restoring the Heartstone—reweights every prior failure mural and Elara’s Keeper role. No platitudes or moralizing; resonance arrives through image and act. A slightly sharper articulation of personal cost would elevate the aftertaste further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, confident close third with a polished, lyrical SF diction that suits a Lore Keeper. The perceptual signature (sound/architecture bias, archive‑inflected phrasing) feels character‑specific and steady under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance drift; brief exposition folds into action. A few high‑ornament lines flirt with purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and image economy; most sentences do multiple jobs without scaffolding. Figurative language is vivid (“tearing silk,” “blooming metallophytes”) and largely coherent with the physics of the scene. Minor density spikes verge on lush but don’t blur causality or stall momentum. Clean mechanics and clear propulsion to the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The palimpsest data‑pillar, sonic unlocking, and throne-as-system-heart feel fresh, with the final “signal not a staircase” turn satisfying and grounded. Tropes (ancient AI, time‑limited quest) are personalized through archival craft and sensory invention. The synthesis is distinctive if not radical. Bolder complication or a sharper price could push it higher.</comment>
