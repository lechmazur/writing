<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and propulsive: he wants to restore laughter and can only act through noise. The internal contradiction (“mournfully eager”) is dramatized in the failed pulls and the ferocity of the sound. Micro‑choices (garage → hallway; second pull → third) reveal a hierarchy of values under constraint. The closing sliver of peace reads earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional rather than explicitly priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: the density of sound and memory crescendos to a charged poise ending. Causality is legible (pulls → engine → hallway echo → wife’s recognition) and closure lands in the wife’s tear/smile as a felt reconfiguration. The cost is implied through “pouring his whole being,” not quantified, but sufficient at this scale. Orientation is clean early and never slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garage, the two‑stroke engine, and the tiled hallway as an “echo chamber tunnel” are tactically essential, not decorative. The setting and tool constrain choices and directly shape outcome (amplification enables recognition). Sensory selection—dust motes, cough of the engine—feels purpose‑driven and POV‑filtered. The final image is charged by place and instrument.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightened by constraint: he can’t touch or speak, only roar and layer a lullaby under it. Escalation is cleanly staged via the three pulls and the amplified corridor, culminating in the wife’s approach and recognition. The price is primarily internal and situational, but pressure coheres and grows to a meaningful cadence shift. No soft resets or coincidence resolutions undercut it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—grief tended through noisy care—emerges through image and action, not statement. The macerated leaves operate as earned subtext for neglect transforming into motion. The lullaby under the drone reframes haunting as communion, delivering a resonant, non‑literal answer at the end. No sermonizing; the ambiguity (“not laughter yet”) deepens aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise without head‑hopping; the ghost’s sensibility inflects diction and noticing. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to roar) and remains controlled. Elevated language suits the premise and stays consistent. No dialogue, but focalization and stance are steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight and propulsive; images earn their keep and avoid muddle. Repetition patterns (pulls; drone/lullaby) are purposeful, not looped scaffold. Minor purple notes (“symphony conductor”) are integrated and character‑specific. Syntax varies and supports momentum to the charged final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—haunting via leaf blower as symphony—is strikingly original and committed through tactics (echo hallway, lullaby woven into engine noise). The final reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight once the method appears. Risks in tone and conceit heighten stakes without gimmickry. Specificity prevents template drift.</comment>
