<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—decoding the leaves—guides concrete choices (sorting, monument‑building, the final prod). Interiority is textured and embodied (“mossy delight,” soil‑stained hands), but contradictory impulses under pressure are faint; he rarely hesitates or risks a loss beyond identity shift. The transformation is credible yet low‑cost on the page. The absence of a second character reduces crucible pressure but suits the scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative texture → causal trigger) holds: patterned labor accrues until a single prod causes the awakening (Decisive Change). Orientation is clean early, and set‑ups (folklore, Arbor‑Heart) pay off. The cost is mostly conceptual (relinquishing his purely quiet role), which trims peak impact. Still, the because/therefore chain is firm and closure lands on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The skyborne ashen arbor is vividly and economically rendered and saturates the action; the environment charges the final image as ash sloughs to green. Sensory filtering via Elian’s craft feels lived‑in; objects like bowls, leaf veins, and mica are specific and purposeful. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it frames and reweights the ending. Strong consistency of world rules through observed change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking the message) tightens when the anomalous leaf appears and the moonstone is placed; the prod is a clear agency point. Escalation is more tonal than perilous; risk and trade‑off are implied rather than tested. The payoff is decisive but achieved with little resistance. Pressure coheres, but the felt price is modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of the monumental power of the very small emerges through method and image, not sermon, and the final shimmer on his hands reweights the premise. Folklore about sacrifice and memory deepens the transformation from remembering to becoming. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“He was the one who had prodded the world awake”), but resonance prevails. The ending offers an earned, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person close carries consistent diction and rhythm, aligned with Elian’s tactile sensibility. Modulation at the climax is controlled; the pearlescent imagery intensifies without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Compression and elision serve the accumulative feel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, precise nouns, and images that pull double duty (the moonstone as memory and catalyst). Occasional heightened phrasing skirts purple but largely remains coherent and purposeful. Momentum holds without loops or scaffolding. Final cadence is clean and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor, leaf‑as‑memory system, and moonstone dust catalyst synthesize into a fresh mythic micro‑cosm. The turn via a gentle “prod” is an elegant subversion of epic triggers. Emotional truth (tender of small things awakening a world) feels specific rather than templated. Risk is lyrical rather than structural, but the piece commits to its vision.</comment>
