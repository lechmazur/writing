<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motive and tactics are clear and consistent; his shift from “operatively gentle” to a firmer ritual act reads earned. The generals are archetypal but effective foils, with Kaelen’s tremor and Vorlag’s grudging surrender giving credible cost. Interiority leans more on controlled rhetoric than contradictory impulses, limiting depth. Still, micro‑choices (scraping dust, choosing symbol) reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single scene, clear orientation, and a coherent Situational drive: the celestial window, the ritual tactic, the first signature, then the second. Closure lands on‑page with cost—identity and power relinquished in a charged, time‑bound act. The because/therefore chain (ritualization → Kaelen moves → Vorlag follows) holds without coincidence. Stakes are tested at the brink when “the moment was fraying,” providing a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terrace and moons are not just backdrop; moss and marble dust are used to inscribe the sigil that enables the turn. Sensory detail is purposeful (jasmine, cracked marble) and filtered through intent. The environment/time window constrains tactics and charges the final image. Object‑as‑setting (clipboard/treaty) complements the place’s ritual gravity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit and pressure coheres: exhaustion versus habitual war. The beat where consensus frays and Elias must “muster something more” is a genuine tightening that forces a new tactic. The cost is palpable though mostly implied (loss of warrior identity, humility). Tension escalates cleanly to the twin signatures without soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of redemption, ritual, and memory emerge through concrete acts (dust sigil, ancestral place) rather than symbolism alone. One line (“Redemption has a price”) edges toward moralizing, but the scene mostly earns its resonance. The final light of the two moons reweights the earlier invocations without telling us what to feel. Ambiguity remains about the hardness of the work ahead, which enriches the aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is poised and controlled, with a consistent close third tethered to Elias’s tactics and perceptions. Diction fits the ceremonial mood without slipping into academic register, and dialogue is succinct and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well from descriptive poise to clipped persuasion at pressure points. No head‑hopping or stance leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong images (“vellum a wound against the dark wood”) and efficient action choreography. A few metaphors flirt with purple (“shattered promise”) but don’t muddle sense or momentum. Minimal scaffolding, good sentence variety, and clean mechanics. The final cadence is earned and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A ritualized peace under a rare celestial event isn’t wholly new, but the dust‑sigil on vellum and the clipboard’s bureaucratic gravitas create fresh friction between sacred and administrative. The negotiator’s method‑as‑ritual feels specific and coherent. Antagonists are archetypal, slightly limiting originality in character. The closing image synthesizes the story’s particulars with satisfying inevitability.</comment>
