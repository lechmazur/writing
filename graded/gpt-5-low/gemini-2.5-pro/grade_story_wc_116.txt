<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (a keeper who must witness without judgment) and the pressure from Aeridor credibly forces a coping choice. The internal conflict—duty versus psychic survival—is dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (reaching for the box, folding, dipping fingers). The Earned Stasis at the end carries a felt cost in the admission that peace will crumble again. Slight neatness in emotional progression keeps it from feeling truly messy or dangerous under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece moves cleanly from oppressive density to a cadence shift of silence via a single decisive transition. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: a temporary renunciation with explicit cost (“I knew I would eventually have to trace its folds again”). Orientation is firm early, and the pattern is taught then paid off. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful, from moss‑cushioned flagstones to the “liquid starlight” river, and it governs options by offering the refuge. The origami swan and obsidian shard function as object‑as‑setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is balanced and POV‑filtered by a keeper’s priorities. World rules are learned through action (folding transforms space) without exposition drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are unified (mental integrity vs duty) and escalate via a density break: Aeridor’s noise compels the burrow. The tightening forecloses continuing to endure in place and forces the trade‑off of temporary abdication. Cost is legible in the final acceptance of return. It’s a quiet arc, but the pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for length and lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, the ethics of witnessing, and self‑preservation emerge organically from image and choice. “Regenerative silence” is not asserted but embodied in the river/refuge experience and reweights the premise at the end. The final image refuses tidy moralizing and lingers as a charged acceptance. Subtext—silence as an active force—operates without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric first‑person voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent, with diction that matches the keeper’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates from dense to hushed in concert with the move to refuge. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; purposeful elision (mechanics of folding) stays legible. Minor risk of lushness is managed by clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, layered images doing multiple jobs, and clean sequencing. The prose approaches lush but avoids purple muddle; metaphors cohere with the world’s logic (“ink bleeding into water,” “liquid starlight”). Minimal redundancy and solid paragraph rhythm. Final lines land by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The origami‑fold burrow to an obsidian silence along a starlit river is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight given the keeper’s role. The piece commits to its conceit without retreat, avoiding generic archive tropes. Emotional truth (the cost of duty) grounds the speculative. Bold choices serve theme rather than gimmick.</comment>
