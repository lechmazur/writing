<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—transmuting defeat into meaning—drives concrete choices (aligning etchings, humming), and her awkward confidence is embodied (nearly tripping yet persisting). Interiority remains specific to her tactile, sonic focus without therapy-speak. However, internal contradiction is light and the visible personal price of success is minimal, softening the arc’s felt cost. The care‑taking identity and maternal relic nuance her stance without generating live conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: alignment → hum → stones respond → network awakens → satellite acknowledges, delivering an on‑page decisive change. Orientation and window control are excellent for a single-scene piece. Cost is implied (risk, endurance, secrecy) rather than dramatized, slightly dimming the closure’s weight. The lens reads Hybrid (accumulative build with causal closure) and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective specificity: ferrocrete, monolith circle, broken dome, ghostly consoles, and the acoustic character of the bay all matter to tactics. The opera glasses and “margin of daylight” function as micro‑setting constraints that shape action and the ending image. World rules (stones respond to resonance, not brute force) are learned through action. Spatial choreography is clear and charged without excess cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the lull by reactivating the network—is established early and tightened through the precise alignment and the time constraint. Escalation is a single intensification: the hum blooms, stones answer, then the remote receivers respond. The price of the attempt isn’t strongly tested (no significant opposition or sacrifice on the page), keeping tension elegant but gentler than peak. Resolution is earned by her method, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Harmony over force and repurposed art as resistance resonate through tactics (opera glasses; sung frequency). The final satellite blink reweights the motif of silence/lull into an echoing chorus, offering a non‑literal answer: meaning is made collaboratively through tuned attention. Complexity comes from the ethical poise of waking a “leviathan” softly, not sermonized. Thematic ambiguity is present but safe—little counterpressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct sensory bias (tactile metal, sonic attention) that fits Elara’s method. No head‑hopping, and diction remains consistent; patterned phrases support cadence without opacity. Occasional elevated metaphors (“frozen lightning,” “thunderous serenity”) stay coherent to the piece’s register. Dialogue absence is appropriate to solitude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, action) with minimal scaffold; rhythm modulates as the hum builds. A few lush turns flirt with purple, but metaphors remain consistent and intelligible. No evident loops or cadence templates that dull momentum. Minor density in the opening descriptors is earned by later causal use.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an opera‑glass‑guided acoustic key awakening buried monoliths beneath a spaceport blends mystic and tech with integrity. The “margin of daylight” constraint and the satellite’s blink give non‑obvious turns that feel inevitable in hindsight. Tropes (lost rebellion, hidden stone circle) are personalized through specific tools and method. Not revolutionary, but confidently singular.</comment>
