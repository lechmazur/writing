<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyel’s contradictory impulses—guardianship versus homesick yearning—are dramatized in scene and culminate in a costly refusal. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (“interiorizing exteriors,” ice in his veins) rather than label‑speak. His final act—pouring longing and uncertainty into the pendant—aligns with established traits and reveals hierarchy of values. Minor abstraction at times (“make friends with uncertainty”) slightly softens the edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Structure is clean: intruder → pendant temptation → portal wound → renunciation; each turn follows motivated pressure. Closure is an Earned Stasis with visible cost (forgoing home) and a reweighted stance (“waiting to see what the morning would bring”). Orientation is firm early; the single‑POV window and one transition through sleep remain coherent. The situational lens holds without contradiction and the final suppression act lands on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen garden, mist, and stone library are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered, shaping tone and tactics. The pendant as recurring object and the mist as “uncertainty” materially constrain the choice at the end. Sensory specificity (ozone, icy tears, cerulean sky) is purposeful and integrated with action. The environment charges the final image and is inseparable from meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (duty vs. home) and tighten decisively when the portal becomes a “wound” demanding a stance. The escalation is coherent and culminates in a renunciation that forecloses a high‑value path. Cost is unmistakable: he suppresses the vision of home and accepts continued ache. The pressure is protagonist‑driven at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: choosing uncertainty over the false certainty of a corrupted return, and redefining “home” through custodianship. Recurring images (mist, frost, pendant) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final shift from “waiting for home” to “waiting for morning” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. A single explicit phrase edges toward on‑the‑nose, but it’s earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is consistent, textured, and modulates with pressure without head‑hopping. Diction fits the character’s feral yet tender awareness; rhythm tightens at the portal beat. No dialogue is needed; perception carries subtext. Occasional elevated abstractions are balanced by concrete images.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean for its lyric density, with strong verbs and multi‑tasking lines (“a wound…bleeding raw energy”). Imagery is controlled and coherent; repetition (“veil of sleep”) functions as motif rather than loop. Momentum holds through the climax without scaffoldy restatement. Minor lushness never muddies causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “feral library guardian” and “interiorizing exteriors” synthesize familiar portal/cultist tropes into a fresh, character‑driven calculus. The tactic of weaponizing uncertainty against a false certainty is non‑obvious and satisfying in hindsight. World texture feels singular and integrated. Surface elements are genre‑familiar, but execution and final turn feel distinctive.</comment>
