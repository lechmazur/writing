<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and particular—she hunts where unused love is stored—and her methodical, tactile choices (unspool, touch, push deeper) align with it. Interiority is embodied and specific (“dust… tasted of rust and regret,” “breathless on her stool”). The main limitation is a lack of visible internal contradiction or cost beyond melancholy; the arc is contemplative rather than contested. Still, the endurance/renunciation at the end (“Her work was done”) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density builds to a conceptual repricing that reweights the theater as repository. Orientation is clean from the first line (who/where/what) and the psychometry deepening provides the single meaningful turn. Closure lands with cost as a solemn, final stance and the canister’s careful rewinding. The pressure is quiet but coherent—no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Orpheum’s materiality (velvet seats, gilded arch, dust in the projector beam) is vivid and POV-filtered, and it directly charges the final insight that the place absorbs love. The booth and film equipment are not postcard decor; they are the engine of access and the container of residue. Sensory breadth is strong without cataloguing. This environment is inseparable from the piece’s meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused early: find the repository of unused love. Escalation is a purposeful deepening—touch, incubation, embodiment as Arthur, then following the light into the theater’s fabric—culminating in an answer. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (the pressure of yearning, breathlessness), which keeps it lower-temperature but still felt. One clear tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres through images of projection, absorption, and residue, culminating in the theater as vessel of love. Subtext mostly works through action and image (letters filmed, light soaking into velvet) that reweights the premise. However, the closing thesis line (“Unused love is never lost…”) states the moral explicitly, dulling resonance and triggering a penalty for thematic echo. The piece would be stronger letting the final image speak without assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a sensorium attuned to texture and time; no head-hopping or stance wobble. The diction (“hushed thunder,” “fractured time”) feels earned by the POV’s practice and aim. Modulation matches pressure—quieter at start, densest in the vision, then a clean decrescendo. No dialogue needed or missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry weight and do more than one job, with clean syntax and varied rhythm; images are coherent and not self-contradictory. Occasional stacked metaphors approach purple but remain legible and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding clutter; momentum holds through the reflective mode. The final image is crisp and unblurred by language.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Psychometry via film to harvest unspent love that becomes the soul of a place is a fresh synthesis. The filmed goodbye letters projected into an empty palace feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The risk—quiet, image-driven closure—pays off without obscuring clarity. Minor familiarity in phrasing around “unused love” keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
