<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motives progress cleanly from duty to obsession to a principled, “precisely humane” correction; the ledger scene makes his values legible. Internal tension—family myth versus communal truth—registers, though he encounters little active resistance and his hands “did not shake,” softening struggle. Concrete reactions to objects (label, tin box, photos) reveal character without therapy‑speak. The final act forecloses the easier path of silence and preserves cost in social memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats link tightly: resurfaced town → discoveries → archival pursuit → attic reveal → ledger correction → public exhibit. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph; a two‑shard structure holds together chronologically. Closure lands on‑page via the decisive, documented correction with appended evidence, carrying social and familial cost. No major causality gaps or unkept set‑ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: ridgeway, receded reservoir, Gilded Perch, and archives all feel tactile and distinct. The resurfacing physically enables the plot; the liqueur label returns to charge the final display. Sensory images (“sick man’s gums,” “mirrored hush”) build atmosphere without stalling momentum. Spatial and temporal anchors stay coherent as locations shift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing collective memory—tightens as Elias moves from discovery to public accountability. The ledger correction is a clear, costly choice, trading filial comfort for civic integrity. However, opposition remains largely abstract; no on‑page pushback or obstacle tests his resolve beyond interior calculus. Still, the escalation is coherent and ends with a meaningful narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of myth versus history is earned through objects and actions rather than sermonizing, culminating in turning a haunting into a history. The public exhibit reframes silence into communal understanding, a resonant answer to the opening hush. One line edges toward thesis (“spin stories into shared meaning”), but it’s backed by concrete choices and images. The label’s reprise and the ledger’s humane correction carry subtext about narrative responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close voice filters details through Elias’s sensibility and profession. Diction and rhythm modulate well between hush and resolve, without head‑hopping or register drift. Elision is minimal and purposeful; reflection stays anchored to present actions. No dialogue needed; the voice sustains pressure and clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and image‑rich with strong verbs and precise nouns; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few bold metaphors (“sick man’s gums,” “resonant wire”) risk purple but feel thematically unified and clear. No scaffold loops or cadence templates dull momentum, and the final image lands cleanly. Mechanics are clean and transitions efficient.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The resurfaced‑town premise is familiar, but the ledger correction, archival ink choice, and communal exhibit with the label offer fresh, specific inflections. The causal photo‑trail to a family truth feels inevitable in hindsight. Stakes are intimate yet communal, avoiding melodrama. Ingenuity shows in the “precisely humane” revision rather than a sensational reveal.</comment>
