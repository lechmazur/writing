<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—to preserve wonder despite his truth compulsion—is clear and enacted through the choice to withhold a direct answer and give the riddle. The internal tension between involuntary honesty and anti‑sterility ethos is credible and dramatized. Lena’s shift from weary official to charged seeker also reads cleanly. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: a single scene where the riddle and realization reweight the city’s crisis into a moral/energetic famine. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with the final image of managed lightning and the unopened box. Orientation is crisp and props track. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lightning tower, ozone/pollen air, and nectar dusk are vivid, selective, and tied to action and theme. The tower and boxes recur to charge the final image and the riddle’s imagery, not mere backdrop. World rules (rationed electricity, Hive) stay consistent and integral. The environment guides meaning more than constraining choice, which keeps it just below the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on truth versus sterile efficiency; pressure coheres but remains gentle. The tightening beat is Lena deciphering the riddle and the admission “No,” reconfiguring the crisis. Escalation is intellectual/emotional rather than choice‑constraining, and no hard trade‑off is paid on the page. The result is elegant but low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of wonder as vital energy emerges through objects, setting, and the riddle; the final cadence reframes the blackout as a moral starvation. Subtext operates well in the riddle and the closed lacquer box. A few explicit lines (“The routine had become a tomb.” “He had preserved a little wonder…”) nudge toward statement. Even so, the resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person close holds steady, with a lyrical yet precise narrative texture that fits Silas’s sensibility. Dialogue is natural, goal‑driven, and carries subtext. Rhythm modulates cleanly toward the charged ending. No head‑hopping or register slips of note.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: concrete sensory openings, controlled metaphor (“nectar dusk”), and efficient staging. Minor abstractions near the end slightly tell the theme, but momentum and clarity remain intact. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates intrude. Diction stays purposeful and clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bio‑mechanical drone‑bees nourished by civic vibrancy and a truth‑bound toll keeper using a riddle as key create a fresh synthesis. The lacquer box/matchbox pairing is memorable and thematically aligned. Risks are coherent and pay off without gimmickry. Novelty is strong though not revolutionary.</comment>
