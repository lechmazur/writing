<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and particular—she aims to hush, not unmake, the prophecy—and her actions align with that ethos. Interiority is steady and embodied (the brook baseline; the “cool and heavy like river stone” energy), but there’s little contradictory impulse or visible doubt to pressure her. Competence dominates; we don’t feel a genuine risk of failure or moral cost. The endurance at the end feels earned but low-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates through a density shift—mapping gaps, expanding pockets of silence—toward a Charged Poise ending where the hush settles and a fragile cost is signaled (“a fragile blanket laid over a dangerous fire”). Orientation is crisp in the opening lines. The cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping this strong but shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The brook, moss stone, and moonlight are vivid and functionally integrated—the brook’s sound as baseline is an elegant, specific use of setting. The origami wing works as a micro‑setting tool charging the final image. Rules stay consistent; description is sensorial without catalogue. Only limit: the environment lightly guides tactics rather than constraining a hard choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: quell an infectious, coded prophecy. Escalation reads as a widening hush network rather than reversal; it tightens once and resolves without a sharp trade‑off or loss beyond effort. The “fragile blanket” line hints at cost and future risk, but the on‑page pressure remains gentle. Effective, not harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silence as agency rather than absence threads the piece, reweighing power as peace instead of force. The motif of mapping gaps (not words) refracts a theme of subverting contagion by attending to negatives, which lands in the final quiet. No moralizing intrudes; resonance lingers. It could deepen with a clearer ethical edge or unintended consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (“terrestrially cosmic,” “river stone” energy) and measured cadence. The diction suits a ritual calm and modulates subtly as pressure rises. No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few elevated phrases approach purple, but the voice earns them.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑dense with good rhythmic variation; lines often do double duty (world rule + mood). Occasional intensifiers (“tranquil blaze,” “placid inferno”) stack but remain coherent to the aesthetic. Minimal redundancy; momentum stays intact through the ritual. Slight lushness softens edge but doesn’t blur clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Mapping silence” and the origami wing as fulcrum feel fresh; “terrestrially cosmic” neatly fuses earthbound and fated scales. The quiet, non‑combative resolution is a thoughtful subversion of prophecy tropes. The risk lies in restraint over spectacle and it pays off. Greater felt price would push it toward the rare tier.</comment>
