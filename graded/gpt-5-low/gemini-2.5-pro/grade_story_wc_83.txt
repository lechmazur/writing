<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Amal’s motivation is crystalline—grief transmuted into a physics-driven hunt—and her micro-choices (pushing the array, refining boundary conditions under time pressure) enact it. Embodied details (white knuckles, warm geode) keep emotion grounded. Internal contradiction is present as “bleak exhilaration,” though the conflict could tighten with one sharper costed hesitation. Actions and worldview align throughout.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: array overdrive forces a cooling window; she exploits it; diagnostics close in; the breaker resets as the solution spikes. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she gains a target (the resonance) with the conceptual cost of reorienting grief into pursuit. Orientation is strong from the outset; the scene stays within single POV and one location. The only minor softness is the speed of the “cascading solution,” which leans on genre tolerance rather than on-page friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory and its failing systems constrain tactics; the cooling breakers and coolant diagnostics literally shape her window. The geode functions as micro-setting, charging the final image and anchoring touch against the stark viewport Earth. Technical ambiance (arrays, quantum foam matrix) is integrated through action, not touristic listing. Tone and detail cohere without over-explaining world rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure escalates under the ticking-clock constraint, culminating in the breaker reset that threatens data loss. The core stake—pin down the reservoir before the window closes—tightens options and changes knowledge at the end. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than a concrete trade-off, but it’s felt and reweights future tactics. A single additional impediment or sacrificed option could have sharpened the price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grief as stolen potential integrates with the physics method, yielding a resonant final repricing: lost futures quantified as a frequency. Recurring images (geode, Earth’s “serene blue lie,” the capacitor’s tick) accrue meaning. A few lines verge on thesis-stating (“theft on a cosmic scale”), but the imagery mostly carries theme without sermonizing. The ending’s target reframes meaning rather than closing it neatly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice marries lyric intensity with technical lexicon credibly for a scientist under strain. Rhythm varies well across urgency spikes and contemplative beats. A minor textual glitch (“[ intricately tangible…”) and occasional purple edges slightly nick control but not coherence. POV distance is steady, with inference matching Amal’s knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and propulsive, but there’s some metaphor density that edges toward purple and one clear copy error that jars mid‑flow. Most sentences do double duty, and momentum holds under the clock. Occasional intensifiers repeat concepts (“humming truth,” “cosmic scale”) without adding new information. Still, clarity persists and the closure image is sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Combining perturbation theory with mourning to locate a “reservoir” of unused potential feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The geode as tactile grief instrument and the observatory’s mechanical stakes elevate beyond trope. Risks in diction and concept mostly pay off. A touch more lived specificity in the science process could push this into the rare tier.</comment>
