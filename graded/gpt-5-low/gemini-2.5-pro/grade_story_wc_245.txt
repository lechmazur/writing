<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive—seeking the Stillpoint to ease grief—is clear, embodied, and drives every choice. Interiority is textured through tactile listening and the ring’s cues, not labels. The internal contradiction (craving silence vs. discovering harmony) lands credibly at the end. Slight risk of tidiness in the acceptance beat, but it feels earned by the journey’s specifics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the melody accrues note by note toward a reweighting at the Stillpoint. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—his grief remains but settles into harmony. Orientation is clean and the rules stay consistent. The final step through moss transforms the premise on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and objects (ironwood, rivers, moss, fossil flower) are tactile and sonically specific, filtered through a unique sensorium. Environment constrains tactics (listening by touch, the constellation pause) and charges the final chord. The ring functions as a micro‑setting tool. World rules are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through accumulation: each found note tightens the quest and quiets internal chaos. The penultimate-to-final note beat is a meaningful deepening as he dowses “the space between things,” narrowing options. Cost is borne as endurance under sonic pressure and the acceptance that grief persists. Stakes remain single and focused without drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence reframed as harmony; grief reconfigured rather than erased. The final image answers the central question non‑literally via the unified chord. One line edges toward explicit statement, but it’s earned by the scene work. Thematic resonance lingers beyond the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct tactile-perceptual signature consistent to a blind mapmaker attuned to resonance. Rhythm modulates with pressure and avoids scaffold. No head‑hopping or register drift. Compression is purposeful and legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, action, and emotion—without padding. Figurative language is vivid yet coherent to the sonic/tactile frame; minimal repetition (“quiet blaze”) reads intentional. Momentum holds, and syntax varies cleanly. No artifacts obscure the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind cartography via touch-resonance, a melody‑map, and a Stillpoint as harmony—is fresh and organically executed. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (final note in the space between things). The risk to go fully accumulative pays off without obscuring clarity. Specifics resist template echoes.</comment>
