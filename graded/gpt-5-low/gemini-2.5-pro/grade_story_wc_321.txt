<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Finn’s resilient pragmatism reads cleanly in micro-choices (heading to the bridge, retooling the radio) and aligns with his deckhand competence. The “sudden, terrifying clarity” skirts an unearned leap, compressing struggle into intuition rather than showing a contested deduction. Emotional embodiment—hum as bone-deep, silence “louder than noise”—keeps him specific. Cost lands as solitary awareness when others reset to normal without memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: noticing patterned starlight/frost → reinterpreting static → composing a binding signal → return with reweighted reality. Orientation is swift and firm, and the closure is on-page with a concrete before/after. The knowledge leap is slightly convenient but seeded by repeated pattern cues. Cost proof: the ending’s restored world papered over for others leaves Finn altered and alone.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The spectral grotto, sideways clocks, and hourglass aren’t postcard texture—they dictate tactics (matching starlight rhythm) and charge the final image. Details are selective and filtered through a mariner’s pragmatism. World rules (static as whisper, geometry as signal) stay consistent and are learned through action. The hourglass reprises with altered state, deepening atmosphere and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: repair the seam or remain unmoored. Pressure coheres through a single tightening (from distress call to composed signal) with a clean agency pivot. Escalation is largely smooth; no significant setback or tradeoff beyond endurance and isolation. The price is conceptual/emotional rather than physical, but it registers at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motifs (hourglass, starlight geometry, static) accrue into a meditation on liminality and repair—what it costs to hold seams together when no one else remembers. The final image reweights the commute into a custodial passage “between what was and what could have been” without moralizing. Subtext of invisible labor and quiet heroism rides under the plot. Resonance lingers through the restored hourglass and papered-over memory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person tracks a singular perceptual signature—mechanical details meet numinous imagery without head-hopping. Diction stays coherent and modulates under pressure (from wonder to focused craft). Minimal dialogue functions as a reality check that heightens irony. No withholding; voice certainty matches what Finn can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work—image, action, and stakes—without obvious loops or scaffolding. Occasional purple glints (“solidified moonlight,” “ceiling of alien starlight”) are earned by consistency and do not cloud clarity. Rhythm quickens at the turn (dial work, resonance) and breathes at the coda. No tangled metaphors or register slips under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ferry-in-the-seam premise gains freshness through the radio-static-as-music method and pattern triangulation (starlight, frost, water). The hourglass transformation and memory palimpsest avoid genre boilerplate. Risk-taking stays legible and character-tethered. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight once the pattern logic is taught.</comment>
