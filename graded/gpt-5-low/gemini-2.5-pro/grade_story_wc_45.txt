<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific, embodied, and credibly conflicted: a rational bone‑setter aching for his wife’s faith. His micro‑choices—digging carefully, accepting the tooth, choosing to chart a new constellation—align with a widening motive and visible cost. The self‑indictment (“forgiving himself…would be the work of a lifetime”) lands as earned rather than tidy. No on‑page second character, but the relationship with Elara exerts persistent pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clear CR closure: the tooth’s discovery reweights the world; the final star‑chart act fixes a before/after. Orientation is clean (maze → garden; later, the oak table at night). Cost is legible in the acceptance of having wronged Elara and in the surrender of singular certainty. The two‑shard structure tightens coherently toward the charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The hedge maze, secret garden, rowan box, and oak table are vivid and integrated; the maze/garden enable the discovery, and the tooth object charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered (“bone setting” lens, “moon‑petal roses”). World rules are consistent with a brushed‑mythic realism. Environment and recurring object together shape the closure image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: surrender or defend certainty. Pressure escalates credibly from unease in the garden to the tangible tooth and culminates in a new act of mapping that forecloses his prior stance. The price—lifelong self‑forgiveness work and a reconfigured worldview—is unmistakable. Slightly quiet on external resistance, but the internal conflict tightens enough at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—accepting the fracture as the path to healing—emerges through concrete particulars (bone‑setting craft; the tooth; the constellation). The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. Subtext about grief, faith, and epistemic humility is carried by objects and action, not thesis. No sentimental overreach; ache is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is steady, textured, and character‑true; diction marries clinical craft with lyric grief. Rhythm modulates well between tactile action and reflective turns. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience; elisions are purposeful. Elevated language remains coherent with Elias’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images do double duty (“compound fracture of the soul”). A few lush phrases flirt with purple but maintain clarity and momentum. Syntax varies and supports emphasis; no noticeable loops or cadence templates. Final line resolves by image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Folk motif (changeling) is freshly fused with medical craft and star‑mapping, yielding a distinctive synthesis. The rowan box/tooth constellation turn feels both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Risks a quiet, interior climax and makes it land. Emotional truth reads specific rather than templated.</comment>
