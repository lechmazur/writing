<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation and a meticulous temperament drive concrete micro-choices (book placement, scarf tension). Interiority is filtered through tactile action rather than summary. Internal contradiction is light—he’s resolute more than conflicted—so the felt cost is mostly the tremor and renunciation at the end. Still, his “sanely eccentric” habits credibly govern tactics and reaction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and sensory pressure increase to a charged glimpse, then settle into an earned stasis. Causality is clean (arrangement → thrum → vision → collapse), with a modest on‑page cost (near‑miss, tremor, continued solitude). Orientation is strong from the outset; closure is a credible Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library and the scarf function as lived tools and constraints; volumes become coordinates and the scarf a geodesic, charging the final fold. Sensory atmosphere (ozone, nightshade, lamp bending) is vivid and purpose‑driven, filtered through Elias’s professional lens. The environment shapes what’s possible and colors the cost of returning to stillness. Rich specificity without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—piercing the “place where stories live”—is clear and tightens through one decisive intensification (the window opens, pulses the room, then shuts). Agency drives the turn; the elderly patron’s flicker underscores risk and boundary. Cost is modest but present: he fails to capture, pays in restraint, and re‑embraces waiting. The pressure arc is coherent if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: obsession, memory as non‑Euclidean, and the discipline of patient pursuit. The final image (folding the scarf after a near‑touch) offers a resonant, non‑moralizing answer—proof over possession, endurance with cost. Recurring images (geodesics, chromatic bend, scent) reweight meaning at the end. Ambiguity invites reflection without haze.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lucid third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—mathematical/poetic diction fits a liminal librarian. Psychic distance is steady, tightening slightly under pressure without head‑hopping. No dialogue needed; the voice modulates with the thrum and release. Elevated register feels character‑true and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, strong verb choices, and images that pull double duty. Lyric density is high but mostly precise; metaphors stay coherent with the math/poetry conceit. Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum is maintained through action‑bound description. A hair’s breadth from purple at moments, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—hyperbolic geometry as a practical method to access narrative space in a scientific‑poetry library—is fresh and convincing. The scarf as analog memory vessel is a distinctive inflection rather than ornament. Risks are taken in concept and tone without losing legibility. The turn feels inevitable in hindsight given the setup.</comment>
