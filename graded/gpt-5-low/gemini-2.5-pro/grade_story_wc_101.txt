<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motives (feed the community, then build intergenerational support) are clear and escalate credibly from suspicion to stewardship. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. hunger; secrecy vs. public declaration) surface in concrete beats. Interiority is specific (bell recognition triggers embodied memory) without therapy-speak. A deeper flaw or cost on the page for Elara would have pushed this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: donations → bell as personal message → Elara’s public declaration → communal action and donor’s seed/tools reply. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration toward self-sufficiency, with a felt cost of risk and labor implied in the garden commitment. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence is strong. The price is present but understated rather than sharply dramatized at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, and silver bell are vivid and functional, not decorative; the arbor constrains where and how choices occur and becomes the stage for the turn. Sensory selection (“amplified quiet,” wind through clay pillars) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. The bell as object‑setting charges the final image. A hair more tactile constraint from weather or terrain could have elevated further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (from consumption to cultivation) is signaled and tightened by the bell’s revelation and Elara’s decision to declare rather than ambush. The reversal from secrecy to public vow narrows options and invites risk. Consequence arrives next dawn with communal buy-in and donor’s shifted offering. On‑page cost is tasteful but relatively gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory-as-asset, anonymous solidarity, and transforming charity into legacy arise from particulars (bell chime unlocking elder stories; elders teaching youth). The final image reweights scarcity into shared labor without didactic summary. Elara’s spoken vows approach moral statement but remain diegetic and earned by the scene. The ambiguity of the donor’s identity enriches the piece without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with a lyrical yet controlled register matched to Elara’s sensibility. Rhythmic modulation supports the quiet escalation and the declarative peak. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Elevated diction stays coherent with the piece’s tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry density and momentum; images (“amplified quiet,” “rusted gates”) are apt and not overstacked. Minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; sentences vary in rhythm. Figurative language remains coherent and grounded. A touch more verb‑driven economy at the vow beat could sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise of anonymous aid shifting to communal agency is familiar, but the bell’s cultural specificity and the arbor locus feel fresh. The donor’s identity as a seed left buried is a neat, earned turn. Risk is measured and subtle rather than flashy. Overall, an original inflection rather than a radical reinvention.</comment>
