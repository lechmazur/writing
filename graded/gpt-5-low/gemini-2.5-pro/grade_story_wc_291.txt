<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—awakening empathy rather than seeking justice—is specific, credible, and governs every micro‑choice from the ritualistic setup to the final incision. His prosopagnosia meaningfully constrains perception and tactics instead of being a label. The selfish aim versus the solemn site creates a live contradiction that resolves into a costly ache rather than a tidy cure. A minor tell (“wasn’t here for justice”) skews expository, but the embodied process earns the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the quarry and ribbon enter as opposites; density and pressure build through the ritual until the scratch reweights the scene. Closure lands on the page as a decisive physical act that reframes the killer as void and yields an emotional cost (“a sharp, aching sorrow”). Orientation is clear early, and the pattern taught (unifying opposites) pays off structurally in the end. The persistent constraint (face blindness) shapes method and meaning at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The quarry and mist are not wallpaper; they condition the palette, the gesture, and the final incision that mirrors the earth’s wound. Tactile specifics (wet mist, granite walls, cold stone) are filtered through an artist’s eye and purpose. The ribbon as micro‑setting object charges the color logic and stakes. Environment actively informs the decisive choice, satisfying the high‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—summoning empathy—tightened by the worsening cold/mist and the disciplined process that corners him into the scratch. The pivotal act is protagonist‑driven and forecloses an alternative path (mere depiction) in favor of wounding the canvas. External opposition is minimal, but the internal tension escalates credibly under the chosen lens. Cost is felt, not just stated, in the post‑act shudder and ache.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through enacted oppositions—stone/mist, celebration/grave, color/gray—culminating in absence as the defining shape. The final line’s quiet ache is an earned, non‑moralistic answer to the central question of how empathy can be reached without faces. Subtext hums beneath the ritual rather than being declared, with the scratch serving as thematic hinge. No sermonizing or reductive binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and convincingly filtered through an artist’s sensibility without head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure, tightening toward the incision and breathing out in the final hush. No dialogue is needed; the perceptual signature remains consistent and specific. A few elevated idioms flirt with purple but stay purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and image‑dense with minimal scaffold; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (wound/void). Sentence variety and paragraph pacing support momentum from setup to scratch. Slight repetition (“unifying opposites”) is structural rather than redundant. No artifact loops or mixed vehicles dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A face‑blind portraitist pursuing empathy via a quarry‑ritual and final incision is a fresh synthesis. The decisive act of wounding the canvas as portrait and verdict is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and method pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
