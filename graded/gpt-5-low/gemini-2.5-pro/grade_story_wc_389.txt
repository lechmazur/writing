<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”—is clear and governs choices from tuning the ether to rejecting the two masters. Interiority is vivid and embodied (panic, trembling as he unfolds the map). Contradictory pulls (order vs anarchy; allegiance vs autonomy) operate in scene. The cost of his final renunciation is implied more than felt, slightly softening the character turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Beats link cleanly (signals → followers → Great Storm → two-voice ultimatum → chest opens → star map through cobalt glass → third option → broadcast). Closure is a Decisive Change with a light Conceptual Repricing in the gold-versus-blue final image. The chest unlocking at the crisis edge reads as convenient coincidence resolving the bind, dulling earned causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and cobalt glass are intensely specific and functional, not ornamental. The portico filters the starlight map to reveal the third path, directly constraining tactics. Weather and altitude pressure the scene (lightning, groaning spire, storm pausing). The final image reweights the color-world (blue to gold), charging the setting with thematic consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (choose allegiance to define the new age) is signaled and tightens under the Great Storm and dueling voices. The pivotal escalation is the forced choice that he subverts via the map-filter insight. Agency drives resolution (he broadcasts the third way), but the price of refusing both powers feels low on the page. Storm cessation risks undercutting perceived cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—rejecting binary tyrannies in favor of communal, human-made dawn—emerges through images (cobalt lens, woven starlight, blue to gold) and choices. Some lines verge on thesis (“a dawn built by human hands… find their allegiance in each other”), shading toward moralizing. Still, the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without over-explaining. Subtext of power, mediation, and allegiance persists across beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled, sensory, and consistent with a solitary radio mystic; diction matches the visionary POV. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (storm bursts, breathless unfolding, commanding broadcast). No head-hopping or stance slips. The brief quoted prophecy integrates as texture rather than expository crutch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful; images do multiple jobs (ozone/regret, “bruised-indigo lens”). Minor purple tendencies don’t obscure action, and sentence variety sustains momentum. No evident loops or scaffold; information density stays high. A touch more lexical restraint at the climax could heighten impact further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—a cobalt-glass prophet above a permanent storm, harvesting factions of shadow to architect a third way—feels fresh and coherent. The woven starlight map filtered through blue is a striking, specific turn. The chest’s convenience slightly blunts ingenuity by leaning on a familiar rescue device. Overall, the vision is distinctive and confidently executed.</comment>
