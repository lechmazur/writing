<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elian’s motives (duty, pride, hurt paternal love) are clear and sharpen under pressure, culminating in a credible renunciation of force for support. His contradictory impulses—clinging to tradition versus honoring Lyra’s view—act in scene and drive the final choice. The visible cost (abandoning his tools’ primacy, leaving the ribbon) reads. The only limiter is the neatness of the epiphany’s timing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: termination → secret return → tools fail → rummage → ribbon/seed → reconceived tactic → softened hum. Closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing with cost, reconfiguring “mending” into “supporting change.” Orientation is crisp early, and the single-scene scope holds. Slight convenience in the found object’s timing keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion is vivid and integral: the heights, rafters, and Heartwood directly shape access, perception, and tactics. Objects (resonant tools, ribbon) and environment charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered through the mender’s craft and quartz eye. World rules feel coherent without exposition dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving the Heartwood and reconciling with Lyra’s ethos—tightens from failed force to a risky reframe. The rummage-to-seed pivot is the meaningful deepening that changes options and knowledge. The cost is internal but legible (abandoning an identity-bound method), and the resolution is protagonist-driven. Pressure is steady rather than punishing, limiting the ceiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece deftly enacts “support vs. control” through concrete acts (seed insertion, loose binding), allowing theme to arise from event and image. However, the final moralizing line (“the most profound vows…”) states the thesis outright, damping subtext. The “deciduous vows” motif otherwise reweights well at closure. Strong resonance, slightly marred by explicit takeaways.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV voice is controlled, lyrical, and plausibly grounded in Elian’s craft; the quartz-eye perception adds signature. Rhythm adjusts with pressure, and reflective passages stay anchored to present action. No head-hopping or stance slippage appears. A few elevated phrases flirt with sentiment but remain within voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, action, emotion—without slack, and imagery (“a second, living architecture”) is vivid yet coherent. Syntax varies and momentum holds; no significant loops or scaffolding. Figurative density remains legible through peak beats, with minimal purple spill. Minor neatness in phrasing near the end slightly softens edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender in a cathedral-orchard, mending via seed and ribbon, is a fresh synthesis executed with internal logic. The turn from repair to support feels inevitable in hindsight and thematically specific rather than generic. Risk-taking in worldbuilding and solution pays off cleanly. Emotional truth anchors the novelty.</comment>
