<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and specific—her indoctrinated certainty fractures under accumulating, sensory‑anchored revelations, and her final renunciation is earned. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. witnessed life) operate simultaneously in scene, not as summary. The physical handling of the ampoule and the burial act externalize her internal shift with felt cost. Galen’s “incisively kind” pressure sharpens, rather than softens, her decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens: new knowledge (the “weakness” is a gill) therefore reconfigures the mission and compels the decisive burial. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the closure is an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change that forecloses a path with implied social cost. No teleports or rule breaks; set‑ups (ampoule, membrane) pay off. The cost is conceptual yet legible in the final beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater garden, filtration gill, and bioluminescent flora are not postcard details; they constrain choice and reframe “structural weakness” as a lung. The setting’s rules are learned by action (the swim to the membrane, the rebreather hiss) and charge the final image. Selective, purposeful sensory detail tracks Mara’s priorities. The environment meaningfully alters the moral calculus on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>One dominant stake is legible early (destroy vs. protect the city), and pressure tightens as the “weakness” is revealed to be vital infrastructure. The key turn is Mara’s agency in refusing the mission and burying the ampoule with visible foreclosing of options. Moral calculus is sharpened by the poison’s scope (toxic to all life here). Slightly limited by minimal external counterpressure or time constraint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of deprogramming, moral clarity vs. nuance, and the ethics of “purification” arise organically from objects and actions (foxglove, lung, burial). The living statue’s “incisively kind” guidance avoids sermonizing, and the final vine‑pulse offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. One line (“Your certainty was a cage”) edges toward explicit thesis, but it’s dramatized and paid off in choice. The aftereffect is reflective, not tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Mara’s perceptions; diction is consistent and character‑plausible. Telepathic “dialogue” carries subtext and pressure without breaking POV boundaries. Rhythm modulates with discovery and decision, avoiding committee voice. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but precise; metaphors (silt, lung, tapestry) align with the world and do not blur sense. Information density is high with minimal scaffold or repetition; sentences advance image and choice. No notable syntactic monotony or filter‑verb stacks. A few elevated turns flirt with purple but remain purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gill-as‑lung reveal, a telepathic living statue, and a piracy‑as‑purification critique feel fresh and integrated. The foxglove ampoule as moral instrument is specific and reweighted by the ending. The turn reads inevitable in hindsight under the established logic. Boldness is measured and coherent without gimmick.</comment>
