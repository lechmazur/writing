<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—he’s the Laughing Storm Herald shaping dawn—but internal contradiction is light until the final repricing. Embodied emotion (manic laughter, trembling exhaustion) lands, yet we get little friction between joy and doubt during the peak. Micro‑choices on the levers register but aren’t morally fraught. The end’s “the dawn was beginning to shape him” earns a modest change with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a coherent Accumulative/Textural drive; pressure builds as the storm approaches and the apparatus strains. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: he succeeds yet discovers an unintended prophetic dimension that now shapes him. The cost (exhaustion, device strain, relinquished control) is legible on the page. Turns are smooth rather than sharp, but the cadence shift at dawn satisfies.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Emerald Lighthouse, sea, and crystalline apparatus are sensuously rendered and integrated with action; the micro‑setting (wick, levers, beam) constrains tactics. World rules are taught through use (angles, reflection) rather than exposition. The dawn image recharges the setting at the end. A touch more tactile constraint from the environment in the climax could push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (shape the storm/dawn) is signaled early; escalation tracks via density: the storm swells, beam sculpts, wick nears failure. The tightening shows in the white‑hot strain and tower shudder, with his stamina as a visible price. Conflict remains primarily situational and procedural rather than morally compounded. Still, resolution is earned by his sustained agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Creation through destruction, authorship vs. interpretation, and unintended prophecy cohere without sermonizing. The glyphs read as art that becomes fate, and the final realization reweights earlier “graffiti” into consequence. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant. A slightly deeper on‑page friction between craft and hubris mid‑scene could heighten the thematic bite.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction fits the operatic premise and holds steady under stress. Rhythm swells with the storm and cools at dawn without head‑hopping. Occasional purple edges remain controlled. Information is filtered plausibly through the focalizer’s obsessions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with varied syntax and high information density; most images do multiple jobs. A few stretches verge on ornamental (“cosmos of stark, silent stars,” “celestial graffiti”), but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Technical terms (“total internal reflection”) integrate cleanly. No loops or scaffold visibly dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a ritual lighthouse, physics‑driven sorcery, and accidental prophecy feels fresh and specific. The method (angles, reflection) grounds the cosmic register with tactile originality. The final reconfiguration is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking is high without obscuring clarity.</comment>
