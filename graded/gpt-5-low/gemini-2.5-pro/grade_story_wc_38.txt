<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—liberating her mother by surrendering control—is clear, particular, and earned through the dance insight and the dice choice. Interiority is embodied (movement-as-thinking) and avoids generic labels. The final act costs her a core trait (control), which reads as a credible renunciation. A minor limit: internal contradiction could be sharpened under greater moment-to-moment pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, closing in a Resonant Reconfiguration as the hum modulates and the presence consolidates. Orientation is clean from the first lines; stakes stay coherent. The because/therefore is soft but intact: failed logic → embodied tactic → surrender to chance → system responds. Cost rests in concept more than concrete consequence, keeping this shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken lab’s hum, quartz-glass, bioluminescent algae, and plasteel desk are selective and charged, culminating in the chord shift and fractal bloom. Environment and objects constrain tone and tactics (solitude, pressure, lab systems as interlocutor). The dice and journal function as micro-setting tools that charge the final image. Near-exceptional; one more moment where the environment materially narrows options would push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberation) is signaled early and tightened by the realization that chance must be embraced. The meaningful turn is the surrender to randomness; it forecloses the path of pure control. Pressure escalates primarily internally; external stakes remain atmospheric rather than biting. Effective but not bracingly tense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of translating control into vulnerable strength is enacted, not declared—dance as cognition, dice as surrender, the mother’s presence as reconfiguration. Recurring images (hum, web, bone dice) reweight at the end without moralizing. The quiet ending resonates beyond the scene. Minor limit: the ease of the lab’s response trims some moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (code as music, movement as language). Psychic distance modulates effectively without head-hopping or register drift. No dialogue to test, but narrative stance remains coherent and character-bound. Lyricism serves pressure rather than obscuring it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean, rhythmic, and purposeful, with images doing double duty (hum as dirge/chord; fractal as web/snowflake). Minimal scaffold and no evident loops; diction stays controlled for the mode. A few stacked metaphors approach density but remain legible and aligned. Momentum and clarity hold through the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—undersea lab, lyrical cryptanalysis through dance, and surrender-to-chance via hangman’s dice—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The turn reframes the premise without gimmickry. Risk-taking in mode and conceit heightens stakes while remaining clear. Slightly conventional “system answers” beat keeps it just under 9+.</comment>
