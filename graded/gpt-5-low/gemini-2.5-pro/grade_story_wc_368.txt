<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kaelen’s curiosity post-transplant is clear, embodied in tactile choices (loupe, chalking sun trails) and culminates in the decision to approach the woman with the wing. Interiority is particular to a dye master’s sensibility; the donor heart adds a credible tug without drifting into diagnosis-speak. Internal tension (caution vs. compulsion to witness) is present but soft; the felt cost of the final stance is more conceptual than visceral. Secondary character pressure is quiet yet effective in the brief exchange.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned observation → anomaly of light → confrontation → conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what) and the closure lands with a reframed rule (“stories refract through you”) tied to concrete images (wing, sun trails). Cost is primarily conceptual—relinquishing an old explanatory frame—credible but not sharply priced in action. The donor heart throughline coheres the sequence without late rule-changes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house, chains, valley mist, chalked sun paths, and the morpho wing create a vivid, selective atmosphere filtered through a craftsman’s eye. Setting details recur to charge the final image (wing + sun trails), and the light geometry plausibly matters to his method. While the tea house doesn’t strongly constrain choices, the environment’s light behavior effectively shapes observation and tone. Sensory balance favors visual, but the texture is intentional and unified.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to understand the woman) is clear and escalates through disciplined observation to the risk of direct engagement. The meaningful tightening is his approach with the wing and articulation of the refractive thesis; this narrows the ambiguity and tests his hypothesis. The price is modest—exposure and potential rejection—so the tension remains lyrical rather than acute. Still, the cadence shift at the conversation is earned and reweights the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from dye craft vs. structural color and resolves in the prism insight; the final image resonates without a sermon. The dialogue line “Stories don’t stick to you; they refract through you” edges toward on-the-nose thesis, but is buffered by concrete staging (wing, chalk lines). Donor heart as echo adds ethical/identity undertones without overexplaining. The piece invites reflection on perception and witness with disciplined ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyrical voice grounded in the narrator’s sensory priorities (light, structure, color) carries the piece. Psychic distance modulates smoothly from reflective to immediate at the approach, and dialogue is economical with subtext. Diction stays within a plausible lexicon for a meticulous artisan with heightened perception post-surgery. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-dense, and largely multipurpose; metaphors (lodestone, prism, refraction) are coherent within the light motif. Minimal redundancy and good rhythmic control prevent bog despite high figurative load. Occasional heightened phrases (“quietly explosive,” “valley-mist wonder”) verge on purple but remain anchored by concrete objects and actions. Closing cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—dye master’s structural-color epistemology, floating tea house, sun-trail method, and donor-heart echo—feels fresh and necessary. The investigative tactic (using light patterns) is inventive and organic to character. The final conceptual repricing is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic and formal, not gimmicky, and they pay off.</comment>
