<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear, singular motivation (“share light without using fire”) and embodied sentiment anchor Xylar. The approach to the null echo, handling and releasing the gear, and retooling the pings are credible micro-choices. Internal contradiction (heritage-bound sorrow vs. radical hope) is present but lightly tested, making the epiphany feel somewhat tidy. Still, actions align with motive and the renunciation reads earned at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonar searching → null beacon → gear encounter → conceptual reframe → new broadcast. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost (abandoning the calculative legacy for self-expenditure). Orientation is clean early, and the single scene coheres. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but it lands on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and filtered through Xylar’s mournful sensibility, with selective, purposeful detail. The environment subtly shapes method (empathy “sonar” through hydrogen/helium veils) and charges the final image (“bloom”). The gear as object also charges setting texture. It rarely constrains physical choice, keeping this just shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tight; pressure coheres through discovery and the heretic’s failure. The meaningful tightening is the null-beacon and gear’s logic forcing a tactic shift from calculating routes to emitting feeling. Price is implicit (abandoning a tradition/tools and committing to ongoing giving). Escalation is restrained but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: renewal as erasure versus non-extractive light, with the gear reweighted as a beautiful, flawed idea. The ending image of broadcasting warmth elegantly answers the central question without a moral. A few explicit statements (“light… was an emission,” “the answer itself”) flirt with didactic clarity but remain earned. Subtext works via the garden’s “troubling serenity” recast as expectation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person close focuses on a distinct perceptual signature (empathy pings, dust as ancestral ghosts). Rhythm modulates well into the turn and final cadence. No head-hopping or stance slips, and certainty matches what Xylar could infer. Elevated diction feels voice-true rather than generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, and minimal scaffolding. Figurative density is high but coherent with the voice and situation, rarely purple. A few near-echoes (“quiet sigh of falling petals”) risk ornamental reprise, yet momentum holds. Final image is clean and recharged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Notably fresh synthesis: empathy-as-sonar mapping sorrow, nebula husbandry, and a lone analytical gear as relic of a failed salvation. The turn from logistics to emission feels inevitable in hindsight and true to character. Risks are aesthetic rather than plot-twist driven, and they pay off. The conceptual frame avoids cliché and feels authored.</comment>
