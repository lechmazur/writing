<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to counter the tricksters is clear and consistent, with embodied tension (“ozone and dust,” “bakelite cool”) and a credible dread/hope contradiction that propels choice. Her competence is balanced by fatigue and risk-awareness, preventing a fantasy of effortless mastery. Internal pressure culminates in a concrete micro‑choice at the console. The cost is modest but felt in the exhaustion and the acceptance of an ongoing fight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the virulent transmission prompts her because/therefore choice to deploy the counter‑signal, leading to on‑page social de‑escalation. Orientation is clean by 120 words, and the single‑scene pressure line is coherent. Closure lands via a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: slight calming in the quad and a resolved commitment to continue. The cost is more thematic than material, but it is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The university radio station and its analog apparatus shape tactics and enable the subsonic piggyback method; tools like VU meters and the waveform generator charge the final image. Sensory texture is purposeful and filtered through a practitioner’s eye. Space and objects are navigated with tactile specificity. The setting’s isolation also frames the ethical stance of “quiet resistance.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (countering divisive influence) is signaled early and tightens at the moment of engagement and the tense wait for effect. The slight de‑escalation in the quad functions as a meaningful shift in options. The price is primarily ongoing exposure and strain rather than a concrete loss, keeping the ceiling just below the highest band. Still, escalation reads cleanly under the causal design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of influence, counter‑resonance, and quiet defiance emerge organically from her actions and the sound/physics imagery. The ending reweights “power plays” through a non‑triumphal, earned modest victory that resists moralizing. A few declarative lines about the tricksters skate close to thesis, but the final hum image carries the charge. Subtext around arrogance vs. patient craft is coherent and felt.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close is steady, with a distinct technical‑lyric timbre that suits the character’s domain. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. Technical terms are used judiciously and remain within plausible lexicon for the POV. No dialogue is needed; the voice holds the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, concise, and sensory‑rich without purple excess; metaphors are coherent to radio/cosmic motifs. Information density is high, with minimal scaffolding and clear sequencing. The final image resolves by action and image rather than explanation. Minor intensifiers appear but do not slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of campus radio, cosmic tricksters, and neuro‑acoustic counter‑resonance feels fresh and specific. The quiet, technical rebellion angle avoids familiar “hack the signal” clichés by anchoring in analog tactility and measured stakes. Turns grow from established particulars. Risk is thoughtful and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
