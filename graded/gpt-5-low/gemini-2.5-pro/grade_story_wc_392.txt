<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s rationalist rigor collides credibly with involuntary sensations, and his micro‑choice to include the psychological context is earned by the notebook find. The internal contradiction (empiricism vs. haunting impressions) is dramatized rather than told. Emotional texture is embodied in tactile observation (mud, scuffs, high‑water mark) rather than labels. The cost—defying Fletcher—reads quietly but plausibly in character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens holds: empirical cause chain (flood → discovery → observations → notebook) intertwined with accumulative sensory waves. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in the decision to file a non‑conforming report, with conceptual cost to his standing. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The lantern’s reprise as “a cage” reweights the premise without mechanical tying‑off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel’s wet iron and low oxygen, the high‑water mark, and the live‑line rumble shape perception and trigger the decisive wave. The lantern functions as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image and constrains meaning. Details are selective and POV‑true, never museum‑tour. Environment actively participates in the turn rather than decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes focus on professional integrity vs. expedient sign‑off, tightened by the second sensory wave and the notebook discovery. The train’s reverberation escalates pressure in a single meaningful deepening. The price is subtle (career friction) but signaled. No antagonist on the page, yet the coherent pressure forces a stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Freedom/cage is refracted through the lantern, the Underground Railroad, and Elias’s refusal to flatten truth. The last look at the lantern as “a cage” is a clean conceptual repricing of the premise. The piece resists moralizing, letting scene particulars carry resonance. The ghost‑logic of memory entanglement serves the theme rather than functioning as mere flourish.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable, with diction calibrated to a precise, observant professional under pressure. Rhythm modulates well between sensory density and analytic clarity. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the Fletcher call establishes pressure and status. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; sensory lines rarely overstack. Minor familiar notes (“oppressive weight… begin to lift”) don’t blunt the closure image. No notable scaffold loops or filter‑verb stacks. Pacing supports the investigative cadence and the final resonance.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of a preventable‑death investigator with an Underground Railroad relic that imprints memory feels fresh and thematically tight. The revaluation of a freedom‑tool as a cage is an elegant, specific turn. Risks stay controlled; the piece avoids genre crutches and facile hauntings. The originality comes from synthesis and restraint, not gimmickry.</comment>
