<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority (jealousy of past selves, “feral nostalgia”) drives micro‑choices from pushing the scroll away to entering a trance and finally recommitting to write. Contradictory impulses (resentment vs longing for integration) operate simultaneously. The final stance shift feels earned by the embodied flight beat. Slight neatness to the epiphany, but it’s grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: frustration → trance/flight → reconfiguration → steady writing forms a coherent arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: chaos becomes a chartable landscape, with a visible behavioral change (he writes). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. Cost is subtle (relinquishing the jealous posture) but legible in the foreclosed self‑loathing stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cabin, dust‑lit window, birch bark, and high mountain air are vivid and POV‑filtered; the updraft and view from above are tactile. The birch bark scroll returns to charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, it meaningfully mirrors and supports the internal turn. Specificity and sensory selection are strong without overdetailing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—regain narrative coherence vs psychic consumption—is clear and tightens through the trance to the flight, which functions as the decisive deepening. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn and the resolution (choosing to write). The cost is internal (renouncing a defining resentment), which reads but isn’t deeply taxing on the page. Tension operates more lyrically than oppositional but sustains.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of temporal identity integration emerges through particulars (grave, backward clocks, map from above) rather than lecture. The final reweighting—chaos as chartable landscape—answers the central question without a tidy moral. A couple lines approach thesis‑statement clarity, but they’re earned by image and action. Subtextual map/flight resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First‑person voice is consistent, textural, and modulates from claustrophobic bitterness to clear, steady purpose. Diction fits the character’s contemplative sensibility without register drift. Rhythm tightens through the flight and relaxes into the closing calm. No POV leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong sentence‑level control with vivid yet disciplined figurative language (“child’s block nestled in a sea of green”). Minimal scaffolding; momentum carries through the turn. A few high‑density metaphors flirt with purple, but coherence and propulsion hold. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a lucid‑dream chronicler envying his own past selves, catalyzed by a vision of his grave, resolves via embodied flight as craft ethos. The “map from above” reframing is distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and succeed. Familiar motifs (flight as freedom) are personalized through the birch bark and occupation.</comment>
