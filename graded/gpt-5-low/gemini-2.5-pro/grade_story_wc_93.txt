<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael’s motives are clear and particular—protect the nexus and honor Elara’s promise while wrestling with a precognitive burden. Interiority is image-driven (magnetic boots groaning, eels tracing fractals) rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulses surface subtly (guard the patterns vs. spend the last‑resort star dust, ignore the eels’ distress vs. shepherd identity). The endurance choice lands, though a sharper on‑page cost to his psyche or relationships could deepen it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—vision of the tide triggers preparation; aurora arrival forces the keystone act; the star dust circuit splits the wave. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who/where/when). Closure is a Decisive Change with a felt price (deploying the finite star dust) and a small Resonant Reconfiguration (“borrowed dawn” becomes “his own”). The causal line is tight and unbroken.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frictionless world, tidal bluff, aurora, and basalt under magnetic boots constrain tactics and power the solution. Object‑as‑setting functions via the star dust anchor and the stone spiral as a circuit. Details are purposeful and filtered through Kael’s priorities; weather and world rules shape action. The final image is charged by setting reweighted (the aurora as tool rather than mere spectacle).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save the bluff and its patterns—is signaled early and escalates as the aurora “trigger” arrives with the wall of water. The tightening comes in the choice to use Elara’s last‑resort star dust, foreclosing future options. Resolution is earned by Kael’s agency and craft, not coincidence. A minor limitation: the solution unfolds smoothly with little visible risk of failure after the pour, softening peak tension slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of harmony versus control and promise‑keeping versus self‑preservation emerge through particulars: primes on obsidian, eel patterns, the aurora feeding a circuit. The ending reframes “borrowed dawn” into a nascent ownership without moralizing. The precog curse and mapping impulse unite conceptually in the harnessing act, suggesting coexistence with altered physics. Resonance lingers as an earned humility rather than a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a supple lyrical register that matches Kael’s mathematician‑herder sensibility. The perceptual signature is distinct (“thimbleful of night,” “panicked fractals”) yet controlled. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference remains within what Kael can know. Rhythm tightens appropriately at the pour and release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, character, and pressure—without padding. Figurative language is fresh and mostly disciplined; metaphors cohere to gravity, water, and light. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax variety sustains momentum into the climax and the quiet denouement. A hair more syntactic compression in the peak beat might heighten urgency, but clarity never suffers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—eel herding in a frictionless world, prime‑sigiled stones as a circuit, star‑dust as local gravity—is striking and feels inevitable by the end. The aurora’s redefinition from spectacle to instrument is an elegant, non‑obvious turn. Emotional truth (promise, burden, tentative mastery) grounds the novelty. Risk‑taking in world rules and method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
