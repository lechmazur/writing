<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—seeking the joy beneath Elara’s grief—drives specific actions (putting on the goggles, unfolding the vellum) and is shaded by guilt and loyalty. Interiority is concrete (“breath caught,” trembling) and the intrusion vs. duty tension reads. The ending choice to keep the secret reframes his service with a felt, if quiet, cost. Slight tidiness and low external resistance keep it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: elevator ascent frames time; sunlight sparks the goggles tactic; the diary decodes; the vellum unfolds; the discovery reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a burdened vow to guard the secret. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and all set‑ups pay off. Cost is subtle but legible in the trespass and chosen secrecy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound spire, crystal elevator, and sliver of sunlight are not decorative; the environment enables the decoding tactic and structures the scene’s beats. The goggles function as a micro‑setting tool that charges the final image when removed. Sensory specificity (polarized hues, glacial shell) is purposeful and filtered through goal‑pursuit. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres under a quiet, internal stake: to uncover a hidden joy without violating the dead captain’s dignity. Escalation is a steady tightening—the chimes, the decoding, the concealed vellum—and culminates in a discovery that forces a stance. The cost is the self‑imposed burden and the renunciation of disclosure, which reweights his promotion. It’s strong but remains gentle, with minimal friction beyond conscience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars—the goggles reveal not only text but a life reframed; grief as armor for maternal hope. The final cadence offers a resonant answer without sermonizing: love alongside pain, guarded in secrecy. One line edges toward explicit labeling (“not the diary of a broken captain”) but the images carry most of the weight. Aftertaste is reflective and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled close third with lyric texture and steady psychic distance; no head‑hopping or register drift. The perceptual signature—engineered light, polarized hues—feels character‑specific and world‑true. Rhythm modulates with the elevator’s ascent and beat reveals. Dialogue is absent by design, and the voice sustains pressure without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, action, and emotion—without scaffold or loops. Imagery is vivid yet disciplined; the figurative thread (light, polarization, shimmering script) stays coherent. Minor lyrical flourish never bogs momentum, and the final line lands cleanly. No artifacting, tense slips, or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—crystal elevator, ice spire, polarized goggles decoding grief into motherhood—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The method (scattered light) and the maternal reveal avoid genre cliché through tactile specificity. Risks are quiet but committed; no gimmickry. Not revolutionary, but distinctly imagined and integrated.</comment>
