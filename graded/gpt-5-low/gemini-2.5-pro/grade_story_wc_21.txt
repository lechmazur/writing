<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive (uncovering Elara’s truth) is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices under pressure (dismantling prior queries; reassembling a new, aftermath‑focused “statement”) reveal values and adaptability. Embodied stress (“searing reverie,” trembling fingers) grounds emotion. The despair/persistence contradiction is credible and active in scene. The endurance cost feels earned and specific to his flaw‑turned‑tool (retrocognition).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: change in tactic → phantom’s first response → deciphered coordinate. Closure lands with cost (weeks trapped, psychic burn) and a concrete before/after (from stalemate to key). Single POV, two shards, one transition—clean structure. Stakes stay narrow but coherent, avoiding convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the zeppelin’s isolation seeds the new approach; the obsidian lagoon’s silence dictates nonverbal parley, constraining tactics. Sensory detail is precise and POV‑filtered (“polished brass,” “sting of salt,” “perfect, dark mirror”). Objects-as-setting (urchin, stone, seaweed) charge the final turn. No museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake (unlocking the diary via parley); the meaningful tightening is the shift from asking about conflict to meaning/aftermath. The phantom’s slight nod is a subtle but effective reversal, leading to new knowledge. Costs are mostly psychic/endurance rather than a foreclosed option, which keeps the intensity just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, aftermath, and the ethics of preservation emerge through action (the rearranged message) rather than moralizing. The symbolic triad (stone/foundation, urchin/legacy, seaweed/benediction) reframes the conflict into consequence, yielding resonance without telling. The final coordinate functions as a conceptual repricing of the diary from confession to map.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close is steady and character‑particular; diction (“memory‑scuff,” “locus of her final, unresolved tension”) feels controlled, not mannered. Psychic distance tightens under pressure and releases at return, matching the beats. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean rhythm; figurative language is frequent but apt and coherent. Minimal scaffold or repetition; sentences vary in length and propulsion. One could argue a touch of lushness, but it sustains clarity and momentum through the turn and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating library, retrocognitive parley via beach detritus, and a moral pivot from conflict to aftermath—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The nonverbal negotiation is an inventive action engine rather than ornament. Risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
