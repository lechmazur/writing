<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s obsession is clear, consistent, and embodied in specific ritualized choices (boat, plate, palette). Interiority is textured but not deeply contradictory; he experiences tension as patient hunger rather than clashing impulses. The earned shift from hollowed longing to quiet contentment reads credible. Cost is mostly pre-paid (years of emptiness) rather than newly exacted on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual accrues toward the fog morning as a decisive intensification; the ending manifests a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the object rules stay consistent. Closure lands on-page as the presence vitalizes, with the long pursuit reweighted. The on-page cost at the end is soft but legible via the life already spent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archipelago, boat, fog, and library tools are vivid and filtered through Silas’s priorities. Environment and objects constrain tactics (eastern islet, sunrise timing, fog as final key) and charge the ending image. World rules (palette absorbs light) are learned through action. Atmosphere coheres without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the runaway dream) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the prismatic fog appears. Escalation is mostly density/pattern-based rather than adversarial, fitting the lens. The pressure feels serene rather than perilous, so cost and narrowing of options are mild. Still, the final act requires a committed, irreversible release of the collected light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Longing, art, and homecoming fuse through the “cipher” concept and the final image that transforms absence into presence. Thematic work rises from particulars (camera, wells of light) without moralizing. The ending reweights prior material with emotional honesty. Ambiguity remains purposeful (presence as feeling, not person), enriching resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close is steady, confident, and disciplined; diction suits the character’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates from ritual calm to charged hush without head-hopping or register slips. Elision is purposeful and pattern-taught. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext in image selection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, musical, and efficient; images carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme). Figurative language is rich yet coherent, avoiding metaphor tangles. Minor abstraction appears but doesn’t stall momentum or blur causality. The final lines resolve by image with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The light-absorbing palette, sunrise-as-syllables, and “cipher of longing” synthesis feels singular. Risks—mythic process, quiet internal stakes, non-literal climax—pay off with coherence. The transformation of absence into a tangible, felt presence is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. No gimmickry; the concept is fully committed.</comment>
