<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—restore the town’s “note” to rebalance a skewed world—is clear and enacted through specific, patient labor. Interiority stays character‑particular (craft, cadence, bodily hum) rather than abstract labels. Conflict is mostly endurance rather than contradictory impulses; the piece skimps on a sharper inner tension or visible cost beyond fatigue. Still, his micro‑choices of gait and route reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: the final tuning fork strike “settles into the ground,” reweighting the silence with a cost of ongoing return. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; causality is steady (footsteps layer → echoes arise → anchored hum). The cost is conceptual and temporal rather than acute, which slightly mutes the ending’s bite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purpose‑driven: the archway, cobbles, and windows filter through a tuner’s ear. The ebony fork and stones operate as micro‑settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory balance favors sound/touch appropriately to the premise, with the “hum” translating into bodily vibration. A minor reliance on repeated hush/ghost imagery keeps it just short of transcendent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: re‑animating a town’s pulse. Escalation occurs via density increase—footfalls → ghost steps → market apparitions—culminating in an anchoring act at dawn. Pressure remains gentle; no option is foreclosed beyond time and stamina, so cost reads as devotion rather than sacrifice. Still, the cadence shift at the square is a credible tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around balance as rhythm, not endpoint—“not with hammer and nail, but with a soundwave and a step.” Recurring images reweight at the end without moralizing. The piece resists platitude by making process the meaning, though a few declaratives (“This was his method,” “The phenomenon was not memory but creation”) skate close to telling. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close retains a distinct perceptual signature keyed to acoustics and craft. Diction and cadence are controlled, with lyric lift that fits the premise; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional explanatory lines flatten the lyric slightly, but voice remains coherent. Absence of dialogue is appropriate and never missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with varied rhythm and clean sequencing; images often do double duty for world and theme. A few near‑repetitions (“wild hush,” “hum,” “resonant”) and thesis‑style sentences add mild scaffold. Figurative language is mostly disciplined and sensory‑specific. Final line efficiently recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell‑tuner as metaphysical restorer via footsteps is a fresh, cohesive synthesis. The accumulative ghost‑sound revival feels distinct from standard post‑apocalypse tropes. Risk lies in the quiet, process‑driven structure, which the piece largely earns. Slight reliance on familiar “ghost town” textures keeps it shy of the most daring tier.</comment>
