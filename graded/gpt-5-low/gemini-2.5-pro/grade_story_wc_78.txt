<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kai’s competence, anticipatory anxiety, and craftsman‑mind are concrete and embodied (“not of fear, but of anticipation for the performance”). Micro‑choices (where to strike, when to time the notes) align with motive. Internal contradiction is light—he’s largely a serene adept—so the cost reads more physical than moral. Still, his worldview is revealed through action under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: omen in clouds → mapping on cedar → timed strikes → storm reweighted. Orientation is immediate and the single‑scene arc lands with a felt aftereffect. Closure is a decisive reconfiguration: the squall’s violence converted into a sustaining rhythm and an earned quiet. Cost is modest (exertion, risk), but legible within this scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ocean‑raft orchard is vivid and tactically relevant; the timbers transmit sound and thus become the instrument that enables survival. Weather and sea pressure action; sensory detail is selective and lived‑in (salt, blossoms, creaking wood). The mallet/cedar log as micro‑setting charges the final image. World rules are consistent and learned through doing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the floating orchard) is clear, and escalation arrives with the Razor Squall’s peak. The meaningful tightening is the moment he times the strikes to the waves, narrowing options to precision and endurance. Resolution is earned by his tactic rather than luck. Only the price signal is light; the piece could benefit from one sharper cost or near‑failure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of transmuting chaos into harmony and agency within systems emerge through image and act, not thesis. The storm‑as‑soloist motif pays off in the quiet, humming aftermath. The final sentence edges toward explicitness (“held a note of beauty”) but remains supported by the particulars. Resonance lingers as practice, art, and survival entwine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit a ritual‑craft aesthetic. No head‑hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress without breaking legibility. Elevated metaphors feel voice‑grounded. The cadence modulates effectively from hush to roar to hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with image, action, and worldbuilding doing double duty. Figurative language is rich but coherent and scene‑bound; minimal redundancy. Syntax varies and tracks pressure, giving propulsion during the storm. A few ornate phrases push toward purple, but clarity and momentum hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: an ocean orchard, a prophet‑percussionist, and fractal resonance as survival method. Turns feel inevitable from seeded particulars (cloud reading → sketched node → mallet timing). The risk is aesthetic and conceptual, not gimmicky, and it heightens stakes. The final hum reweights the premise memorably.</comment>
