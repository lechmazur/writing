<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alistair’s motives and method are clear and character‑specific, and his micro‑choices (looping the hum, capturing “truth,” introducing a glitch) track cleanly under pressure. Interiority is mostly implied through action and diction rather than deeply dramatized, so internal contradiction remains subtle. Elara’s embodiment (white knuckles, shudder, ragged breath) gives the stakes texture. The piece leans toward competence over flaw, which slightly limits layered conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sonic layering → glitch → master switch progression coheres and culminates in a conceptual repricing: the entity cannot withstand plural perspective. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (who/where/what). The closure cost registers in Elara’s ragged breath and the tiredness of Alistair, with the palette’s reweighted final image. Slightly light on overt price beyond conceptual defeat prevents a higher mark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cube room, dimensional anchor hum, loop pedal, and the palette create a taut, tactile micro‑setting. Tools constrain tactics (looping, glitching, master switch) and charge the ending image (palette drying to “just a color”). Sensory selection through sound and silence is purposeful and character‑filtered. World rules feel consistent without exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (save Elara before completion), and pressure tightens via pattern intensification and a decisive cadence break. The agency is Alistair’s throughout; each choice complicates or narrows options, culminating in the vacuum switch. The cost is primarily conceptual with modest embodied impact; still, the narrowing reads. A single, clean escalation suits the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth vs. limitation, plurality vs. monochrome—is enacted through sonic method and the palette’s evolution, rather than mere assertion. The line “refuted by perspective” edges toward explicit statement but is earned by prior beats. The final image of the drying gray as “just a color” resonates and reweights prior material. Ambiguity remains in a healthy register without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice blends ritualistic precision with tactile acoustics; “muffled clarity” holds across turns. Dialogue functions as action and carries subtext (the entity’s rigid diction vs. Alistair’s probing). Elevated register feels motivated by character and scene. POV control is stable with no leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with strong rhythm and minimal scaffolding. Imagery (silence as décor, truth looped into discord) is fresh and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Repetition is purposeful (looped “truth”) rather than an artifact. Minor lushness never bogs momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>An exorcism via loop pedal and rhetorical technique is a striking, cohesive spin on a familiar frame. The accumulative sound design as weapon, and the conceptual defeat, feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks (sound‑as‑structure, philosophy as tactic) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The palette’s charged reprise seals the ingenuity.</comment>
