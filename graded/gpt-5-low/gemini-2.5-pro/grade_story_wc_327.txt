<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (preserve the Old Tongue by translating texture into sound) drives concrete choices, and embodied detail (“copper‑veined hands…trembled”) grounds emotion. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (faith in matter vs elders’ belief in breath; confidence vs tremor). The peak choice—aligning the diamond at the precise moment—feels earned by prior obsession. Cost is more conceptual than personal, slightly softening the impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: long study → observed murmuration as syntax → alignment → canyon’s sudden silence → single true tone. Closure is a conceptual repricing: language lives in matter and can be voiced again; the on‑page beat (silence then tone) decisively reconfigures the world’s rule set. Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost is felt as the canyon’s annihilated noise rather than a personal loss, keeping it just below the highest tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: towers of bone, the dust‑colored sky, and the echo‑choked chasm directly constrain tactics and enable the solution. The diamond and spire act as micro‑settings that shape the final act, and the murmuration literally scripts the move. World rules are taught through action, not exposition dumps. The final image is inseparable from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extract a true word from the hurricane of echoes—is signaled early and tightens when the flock forms the creation spiral, forcing immediate alignment. The reversal (ceaseless noise to absolute silence to single tone) is clean and earned. Pressure is primarily conceptual and sensory rather than peril-based, with limited explicit price paid. Still, agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of language’s locus (breath vs grain) emerges through image and act—no moralizing. The starlings-as-syntax and the diamond’s fracture reframe creation and voice; the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. The “first true word” recasts the narrator’s purpose and the world’s history. Ambiguity lingers productively about future cost and scope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single, controlled POV with a distinct tactile lexicon; cadence modulates with pressure (from spacious worldbuilding to clipped, prayer‑like focus at alignment). No head‑hopping or register drift; the voice’s metaphoric system stays coherent to the world. Purposeful elision (“Silence.”) heightens the turn without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; metaphors are fresh and consistent (murmuration as script, diamond as filter). Rhythm varies with scene needs, and the final image is clean and potent. Minor lushness risks saturation but doesn’t blur sense or stall momentum. No loops or muddled vehicles in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: bone‑spire acoustics, cursed diamond as selective filter, murmuration as grammar, and texture‑as‑language cohere and feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks are bold yet legible, and the final repricing is fresh. Emotional truth—lonely purpose, reverence, terror of silence—grounds the strangeness. Nothing reads templated or derivative.</comment>
