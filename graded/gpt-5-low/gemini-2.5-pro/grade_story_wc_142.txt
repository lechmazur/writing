<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael’s motivation and internal split between anarchic love of the Revel and pragmatic survival are clear and consequential. His micro-choices—approaching Zola, choosing encoded order over open defiance—align with his “culture shock absorber” identity. The interiority is embodied (boots, calliope, stone chip) and character-specific. Cost is mostly anticipatory rather than paid on-page, limiting the ceiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Plan → implementation via graffiti → inspector’s reconnaissance → charged poise ending is coherent, with the early arrival serving as the tightening beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the city’s chaos now encodes order, reweighting the Consortium’s narrative. The cost is conceptual (risk persists) rather than materially paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The raft-carnival is vividly, economically rendered through selective, sense-rich detail that shapes tactics (graffiti as lingua franca, moving markets, waterbound mobility). The setting’s logic supports the plan’s plausibility and pressures stealth over confrontation. The recurring stone chip and waterline charge the final image. Description stays integrated with action and goal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surviving privatization on their terms—is signaled early and tested by the inspector’s visit. The meaningful tightening arrives with her early inspection, narrowing options and validating the stealth strategy. The visible price is mainly risk and restraint (renouncing open resistance), not a concrete loss, keeping tension credible but not scalding. Resolution flows from Kael’s agency without coincidence solving the problem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of order in chaos, resistance through culture, and survival under gentrification emerge from particulars (comet prices, serpent-map, unified markets) rather than thesis statements. The final act with the foundation chip reframes the past to arm the future, offering a quiet, resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext registers in how spectacle conceals mutual aid. Complexity is maintained: adaptation is necessary and bittersweet.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, sensuous, and character-filtered, balancing lyricism with clarity. POV stays clean and modest, with brief dialogue that advances action and subtext. Diction fits the world (calliope, data-slate, bunting) without register slips. Rhythm modulates effectively at pressure points (inspector’s pass, final shoreward pause).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight, with sentences carrying multiple jobs and few redundancies. Figurative language is vivid but controlled, avoiding purple excess or mixed vehicles. Momentum holds through exposition via strategic examples rather than explanation. The final sentence crystallizes image and meaning without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating Revel and tactic of civic reorganization encoded in graffiti feel refreshingly specific. The synthesis of carnival anarchy and covert mutual-aid logistics is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet, procedural stakes; offstage antagonist) pay off through a distinctive lens. Emotional truth balances novelty.</comment>
