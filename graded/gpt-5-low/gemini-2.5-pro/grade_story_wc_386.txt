<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to salvage something pure—is clear and consistent, and her choices (deepening the trance, constructing the shared dream) align with it. Interiority is specific to her vocation, though she faces little internal contradiction or meaningful doubt. The man is a functional foil rather than a complex character, and the boy is emblematic. The resolution feels earned but emotionally low‑cost for Elara, keeping this just shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the snow globe’s broadcast leads to the search, to the assembled dream, to the exposure, to the release. Orientation is clean early; the two‑shard structure (shrine → constructed outpost dream → return) holds. Closure lands on the page with a decisive reconfiguration: the boy’s soul is released and the object’s meaning reweighted. The cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and the research outpost are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory choices (“walls weep history,” “million-year-old cold”). The melted snow globe functions as a charged micro‑setting object that anchors opening and final image. Environmental logic (heat melt vs. ice) ties directly to plot and moral stakes. While the shrine doesn’t overtly constrain choices, the object charges the ending strongly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing the lingering soul by uncovering truth) are signaled early and escalate as Elara shifts from collecting glimpses to engineering a confrontation. The key tightening is her choice to build a larger shared dream, foreclosing gentler options. The exposure line creates a sharp turn; the antagonist dissolves a touch too readily, softening the felt price. Still, agency drives the final shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Truth versus curated lie, memorial versus prison, and the ethics of witness are embedded in concrete images (the snow globe’s reweighted return). “Borrowed starlight” reframes her vocation without sermonizing and charges the last line. The man’s smiling front that “doesn’t reach his eyes” and the boy’s peripheral cameos build subtext effectively. Complexity remains, with no moral spelled out.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s metaphoric sensibility. Psychic distance modulates well during the trance and the constructed scene; no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated diction fits the mythic register of the premise. The brief quoted line from the man feels purposeful and subtextual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑dense without slipping into opacity; lines do multiple jobs (world, mood, and stakes). Recurrences (snow globe, starlight, ice/heat tension) are disciplined and payoff. No noticeable loops, scaffold, or muddled metaphors; rhythm varies well. A few lush phrases flirt with purple but remain under control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “wreck-diver” of dreams in glacial ice is a memorable, specific reframing of psychopomp tropes. The investigative method via dream cameos and the heat-in-ice moral physics feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The final reconfiguration (prison → memorial) avoids cliché while landing emotionally. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
