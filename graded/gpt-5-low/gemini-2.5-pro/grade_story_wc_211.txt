<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elian’s vocation, ritual method, and oath frame a clear inner conflict that sharpens into a renunciation: he resolves to starve the coming silence by making the city forget. The emotional turn credibly costs him his life’s purpose. Interiority is specific (foghorn memory, tactile wax work) rather than generic. Slight limitation: we don’t yet see contradictory impulses collide on the page beyond the swift pivot from archivist to saboteur of feeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a clear CR/Charged Poise: foghorn silence → test shaving → dead‑tongue message → reweighting of the horn as ward → oath reinterpreted with cost. Orientation is clean early, and the because/therefore chain is tight. Closure lands with conceptual price (betrayal of vocation, threat to civic memory). Only minor: the plan’s feasibility is deferred, but that suits the form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and purposeful: orchard atop the Spire, caramel‑colored wax, diamond stylus, and the Maritime Museum throttle the senses through Elian’s bias. The foghorn as object/setting recharges the final image and rule‑set. While the garden doesn’t physically constrain choice, the sonic environment and archival apparatus meaningfully charge the stakes. Vivid sensory balance avoids tourist‑listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stake (protect the city from emotion‑eaters) coheres and tightens through the whispered revelation. The reversal—foghorn as ward, archive as lure—forces a costly stance: renounce his purpose to save people. Pressure is largely internal but credible for this length and lens. A concrete external impediment is absent, keeping escalation a hair shy of severe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory, preservation, and complicity braid cleanly; the final reweighting (to save the living, erase what makes them human) resonates without sermonizing. Recurring images (horn, wax, orchard) accrue meaning and flip at the end. The piece invites reflection on art/archiving as both ward and beacon. No platitudes, and ambiguity about the ethics lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely tracks a meticulous mind; diction and cadence suit a “venerable oath scribe.” Rhythm modulates from stately to chill without head‑hopping or register slips. Exposition is carried by image, not tell. The lyric density remains legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax; images do double duty (the stylus “tracing a silent groove” as concept and action). Minimal redundancy and no template cadence runs. A touch of purple is held in check by precision. Final lines land with a crisp, charged image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: emotional archivist + wax‑immersion + foghorn as sonic ward + predators drawn to “loud hearts.” The third‑grade field trip as cognitive key is idiosyncratic and earned. The turn retrofits earlier details with inevitability. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
