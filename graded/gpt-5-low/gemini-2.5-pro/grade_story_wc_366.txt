<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—protect the light to preserve a hard-won sense of safety—drives every choice and coheres with his reticence and ritualized stone‑language. Interiority is specific and embodied (oilskins, the sea glass’s cold weight), with a credible conflict between competence and helplessness toward the keeper’s fate. The farewell circle signals an earned renunciation with visible emotional cost. A hairline nit: the “singular command: protect” edges toward abstraction compared to the otherwise concrete texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: lamp fails → urgent voyage → ascent → discovery of goodbye → repair → farewell stones/beam reprise. Orientation is immediate and stable; the piece holds a causal drive lens through closure. The closure lands on the page with cost (light restored; relationship foreclosed), and no contrivances resolve pressure. The logbook line and final sea‑glass image elegantly seal the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sea, storm, cove, carved stairs, iron door, and Fresnel lens are vivid and functional, shaping tactics and mood. Weather and architecture constrain action (perilous mooring and ascent; mechanical diagnosis in the lantern room). The sea glass charges the final image, refracting the resurrected beam into theme. Detail is selective and filtered through a mariner’s priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: safeguard the light (and by extension the fragile bond). Pressure escalates coherently from the blackout to the storm crossing to the mechanical repair, with the discovery of the keeper’s departure deepening the cost. Resolution stems from Silas’s agency and culminates in a renunciation (the circle/farewell). The only slight limitation is that physical hazard resolves swiftly, but it remains sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stewardship vs. solitude, intimacy at a distance, and transforming grief into maintenance. The stones and sea glass evolve from tokens to a language of farewell and care, avoiding overt moralizing. “The ghost was just loneliness after all” reweights the haunted motif into human ache. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: keep the light, accept the cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical without drift, and consistently filtered through Silas’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure (storm urgency vs. measured repair) without head‑hopping or register slips. No dialogue is needed; the narration carries subtext and momentum. A couple of familiar phrases (“heartbeat in the storm”) are minor but do not blunt distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: strong verbs, purposeful images, and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language enhances rather than overburdens, and sentences do multiple jobs (action, mood, theme). No notable loops or cadence templates; pacing breathes where needed. A few conventional metaphors keep it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The stone‑stacking language and sea‑glass exchange render a familiar lighthouse premise freshly specific. The turn from “haunted” to “loneliness” feels inevitable in hindsight and thematically precise. Risks are quiet but real, leaning into restraint and ritual rather than spectacle. It stops short of radical formal innovation, but the synthesis is memorable and coherent.</comment>
