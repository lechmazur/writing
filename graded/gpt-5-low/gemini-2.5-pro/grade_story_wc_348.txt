<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—to atone and understand his rupture with Lena—is specific and drives every perception. His chemist’s lens personalizes interiority and reveals credible contradiction (control vs. awe), culminating in the concrete micro‑choice to touch the chrysalis and commit to writing. The change feels earned, with cost preserved as grief that “does not vanish” but loosens. Slight tidiness in the epiphany trims edge, but not credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear single‑scene accumulative structure: present‑tense observation → foam analysis → reframe of “divergence” → charged decision to write. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with felt cost (grief persists; control foregone). Orientation is clean from the outset, and causality holds within the chosen lens. The epiphany edges declarative in one line, preventing a 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The braided ravine, river foam, and chrysalis are tactile and filtered through a chemist’s bias, avoiding postcard description. Setting actively charges the final image (braiding as identity; chrysalis as promise) and constrains attention, thus choice. Sensory balance is strong (taste of wet stone and pollen; light through shell). A few symbolic correspondences are explicit rather than discovered, but the place remains integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he reconfigure his stance toward Lena—tightens through the foam’s pattern recognition, turning perception into altered option (a letter that celebrates, not apologizes). The cost is internal: relinquishing a rigid design for her life. Escalation is modest but coherent under an accumulative lens. No external pressure, but the internal pressure deepens convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The thematic braid of divergence, transformation, and impermanence is coherently earned through concrete particulars (foam dynamics; chrysalis). The final reweighting—celebrating the river holding both—produces a genuine afterglow. However, explicit thesis sentences (“Divergence wasn’t failure”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext in the peak beat. The piece would benefit from trusting images over assertions in the final third.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third voice is consistent, with diction plausibly technical yet lyrical, matching a polymer chemist’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well from analytic to tender. No head‑hopping or register slips; the perceptual signature is distinct (“monomers of air and water linking”). Minor moments of overt exposition slightly flatten music but not control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, character, theme) with clean grammar and varied cadence. Figurative density is high but coherent to the POV and rarely purple; repetitions are purposeful rather than scaffolding. One or two summary‑like lines state themes directly, trimming the line‑level shimmer. Momentum is steady with no loops or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Seeing river foam through polymer chemistry to reprice a parent–artist rift is a fresh synthesis. Recurring images (braid, foam, chrysalis) feel organic rather than gimmicked. The insight resolves quietly with authenticity rather than twistiness. Some metaphor axes are familiar, but the professional lens keeps it distinct.</comment>
