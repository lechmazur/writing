<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motivation (“to give rest a permanent address”) drives concrete choices, and embodied weariness colors perception. The stubborn resolve is dramatized in the decision to “fold the world” despite known cost. Internal contradiction is faint—he’s resolute rather than torn—so the peak choice reads low‑friction. Still, actions align tightly with traits and culminate in an earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: package → certainty → impossible‑space transit → missing heart → lens insertion → resolution of signals. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with an RR hue: the noise is transformed into tranquil inscription. Cost is present (immense pressure; ability’s toll) though not lingeringly priced after the act. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the chosen lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater library, basalt shelves, and inert coral‑pearl astrolabe are vivid and purposeful. The setting directly constrains the solution (a literal socket needing the lens) and charges the final image (tablets writing themselves). Sensory detail balances pressure and hush; world rules are learned by observation. Economy and specificity elevate atmosphere without drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending psychic cacophony—tightens through one decisive deepening: traversing the “impossible space” to install the heart. The pressure sequence and inert astrolabe focus tension effectively. The fit‑perfectly key moment borders on convenience, and the ongoing price is lightly sketched. Still, agency drives the turn and the cost is felt in‑scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Brokenness becoming the means of peace (fractured lens casting a net) delivers earned thematic resonance without moralizing. “Give rest a permanent address” refracts into the library’s function, reweighting the premise in the final tableau. The piece invites reflection on silence as resolution, not erasure. Complexity is quiet but clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Steady close third with a tactile, sea‑salted diction suits the character and world. Rhythmic control under pressure (“pulling the roaring ocean over his head like a blanket”) is confident and legible. No head‑hopping; elisions are purposeful. Lyrical register remains consistent with Elias’s perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images carry multiple jobs (world‑building, mood, and plot). Figurative language is frequent yet coherent and disciplined; few, if any, mixed metaphors. Momentum holds through long sentences that breathe without bogging. Final lines resolve by image without exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—undertaker as custodian of a sunken archive, revitalizing an astrolabe with a broken lighthouse lens—is striking and specific. The “occupying impossible spaces” transit is a fresh mechanic used with cost. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight once the object/setting logic is revealed. Risk‑taking in concept and image coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
