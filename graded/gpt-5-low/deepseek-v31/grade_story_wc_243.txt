<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kaelin’s motive and method are clear and consistent, with embodied restraint (“gentle, thorough”) set against “haunted euphoria,” producing credible contradiction under pressure. Micro‑choices (steeping solution, prising the locket, withholding tears, choosing to hand the locket over) reveal hierarchy of values. The late arrival of the son adds a relational crucible that she meets with action, not speech. The son is lightly drawn but distinct enough for the beat’s needs.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the causal chain holds: retrieve cache → extract data → learn sacrifice → son arrives → handover. Closure lands as a Charged Poise image with felt cost and a clear before/after reconfiguration (archive safekeeping → living delivery). The son’s arrival edges on convenience but it deepens rather than sidesteps cost. Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance at the end is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, phosphorescent sea, and nebula are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered; tools and materials (walnut ink, solution, tweezers) are tactile. The setting charges the final image—the jetty “seemed to brighten,” witnessing the covenant’s transfer—and anchors the cache niche and procedure. Environmental rules (twilight activating bioluminescence) are consistent and purposeful. Strong sense of place that shapes tone and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve and, ultimately, deliver the weight of a small moment) is clear and tightens from archival recovery to personal handover. The emotional cost is legible in her self‑control and the mother’s recorded sacrifice. Escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than a combat of wills, appropriate for the lens and length. Minor softness remains from coincidence resolving the external need.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of covenant, preservation vs. delivery, and the reweighting of “weight” to “light” emerges organically through object, setting, and choice. The final image reinterprets archival work as renewal, not static memory—resonant without overt moralizing (the single declarative “act of renewal” skirts telling but doesn’t overpower scene). The mother’s voice log adds layered irony and cost. Complexity lingers after the close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is steady, lyrical yet controlled, with diction aligned to character and vocation. Dialogue is minimal but natural and subtextual; the man’s rough hope and Kaelin’s silence carry charge. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Patterned lyricism is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences often do double duty (world + emotion). Occasional purple edges (“planetoid of grief,” repeated “haunted euphoria”) flirt with excess but remain coherent and specific. No looped scaffolds or template cadences blunt momentum. Final cadence lands with clarity and precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Archivist‑recovers‑memory is familiar, but walnut ink, proximate‑cause method, and the blooming jetty give a distinctive texture. The on‑page delivery to the grown child avoids mere archival sentiment and reconfigures the premise. Risks are quiet rather than structural, but the synthesis feels sincere and specific. Slight reliance on coincidence tempers ingenuity.</comment>
