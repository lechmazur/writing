<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is vivid and particular (“drowsy alertness,” skepticism battling visceral fear), and her micro-choices under pressure (approaching, interpreting, then turning the wheel) align with established traits. The reckless-explorer frame motivates risk-taking credibly. The cost lands in the final image as a burden assumed. The only softness is how quickly she makes the leap about talk‑radio psychics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: hum → valve → apparitions → radio bleed → interpretation → decisive turn → revealed backstory → felt aftermath. Orientation is crisp from the opening line and the single-scene window holds. Closure is on-page via the wheel’s click and the reconfiguration of who carries the truth’s weight. Minor convenience in her interpretive leap doesn’t break the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel, headlamp, and valve wheel are tactile and pressure the choices; the environment narrows options and charges the final image. Sensory detail balances sound, touch, and sight with professional bias (a “connoisseur of forgotten places”). The object-as-setting (valve) meaningfully constrains action. No static museum-tour drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth the buried catastrophe/truth) is signaled early and tightens as the voices cohere into a directive. The decisive turn of the valve forecloses stasis and exacts an emotional price. Stakes remain personal yet consequential; escalation is coherent under a causal lens. A slightly heavier on-page risk could have intensified the cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, communal denial, and modern “prayers” through media arise from concrete beats (ghost shift as talk-radio bleed). The final transfer of burden reframes the premise without sermonizing. Imagery and action, not abstract moralizing, produce resonance. Complexity holds: the foreman’s impossible choice is neither excused nor vilified.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and character-sourced, with diction that fits a wary, self-aware explorer. POV remains clean and bound to Elara’s perceptions even when the radio intrudes. Rhythm varies to match pressure, and the few dialogue fragments feel diegetically plausible. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, action, interiority) with minimal scaffold. Metaphors are largely apt and non-redundant (“pale eye,” “velvet silence,” “data stream of anguish”); cadence supports momentum. No paraphrase loops or muddle in the final third. A couple of elevated metaphors skirt purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The talk-radio psychics as a medium for ghostly communication is a fresh synthesis that reframes the haunting. The beaded valve wheel as both industrial relic and moral lever is elegant. The final conceptual handoff of “weight” achieves inevitability without cliché. Risks are purposeful and coherent.</comment>
