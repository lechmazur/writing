<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and embodied in meticulous actions (ink pellet, marginalia), and the confrontation shows calm competence under pressure. Interiority is elegant but restrained; we feel little contradictory impulse or frayed emotion in the peak beat. The relationship dynamic with the pretender is legible but brief. The endurance/renunciation cost is implied more by epochal patience than by an on‑page sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: research → rune drawn → attack redirected → tether severed. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/why). Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost to the pretender and preserved stakes in the library. The cost on Aetos’s side is light, but the earned setup and on‑page mechanism make the resolution feel legitimate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere and specificity are superb: fractured crystalline dome, petrified scrolls, dragonhide folio, ozone and decaying vellum. The setting isn’t wallpaper; the page and library become the tactical surface that channels the attack and charges the final image (pellet as period). Sensory filtering matches Aetos’s scholar‑titan bias. Vivid without clogging momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and tightens when the pretender arrives and tries to “sunder” the archive. Aetos’s agency drives the turn by pre‑priming the rune to transform the incoming force. The price is mostly borne by the pretender; Aetos’s risk exposure reads minimal, slightly softening perceived cost. Still, escalation is coherent and culminates in a concrete narrowing of the antagonist’s options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The piece coherently interrogates truth versus usurpation and the permanence of record; the iron gall ink and “cannot be unwritten” line anchor the theme. The final image reweights prior motifs (ink, book, starlight) without sermonizing, though that declarative line veers toward thesis‑statement clarity. Subtext in status inversion (small titan vs. stolen grandeur) is effective. Resonance is strong but not deeply ambiguous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A distinctive, elevated voice sustains lyric precision without losing legibility; diction suits the mythic‑scholarly POV. Dialogue is sparse yet carries status and subtext, particularly in the line exchange before the attack. Psychic distance remains stable; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates well from contemplative to charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful imagery; most sentences do multiple jobs. A few grand metaphors cluster (“breath of dead civilizations,” “graceful collapse”), but they stay coherent and do not muddy action. No obvious scaffolding or loops; syntax varies to maintain propulsion. Minor lushness at peaks keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “diminutive titan librarian” with iron gall ink and a rune of drift feels fresh and integrated; the magical redirection via marginalia is a smart twist. Genre elements are transformed through specific objects and methods rather than generic wizardry. While the usurper trope is familiar, the execution and textures create novelty. The final reconfiguration feels earned and particular to this premise.</comment>
