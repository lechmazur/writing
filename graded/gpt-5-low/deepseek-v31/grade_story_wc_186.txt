<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to prove coincidences have meaning) is clear and enacted through concrete choices—descending, retrieving, calculating, aligning. Interiority is textured (the “shard of hush,” the “crushing weight of failure”) though internal contradiction is modest. The weeks-long effort and poised moment of near-failure show credible endurance under pressure. Slight limitation: her competence faces little error or moral friction beyond perseverance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: seed → retrocognitive vision → undercroft discovery → coordinates → weeks of star-path work → alignment → initial silence → hum → beam. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (light rekindled) and a Conceptual Repricing (the message was survival, not distress). Cost is present as time, isolation, and risk of null result, if somewhat light. Lens holds as Causal throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Glass Humming Pavilion, cliffs, thistledown, and crystalline lattice are vivid and functionally integrated—environment hums, the plinth and housing shape tactics, and the final image is charged by place. Detail feels filtered through Elara’s lived priorities (star charts, apparatus). World rules stay consistent and are learned via action, not dump. Strong object-as-setting work with the prism and pavilion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle the light/send a sign) is clear early and tightens through the hunt for the aberrant path and the on-page test of alignment. The beat of “nothing happens” before the hum creates a palpable tightening. Costs lean emotional/endurance rather than material, but the moment of potential failure credibly pressures the choice. Escalation remains coherent and earned under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of chance-as-sign and hope under ruin emerge organically through thistledown, retrocognition, and the final beam as reply, not plea. The last realization reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the pavilion’s hum and the “shard of hush” broadens from technique to faith. Slight neatness, but emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with controlled diction and image systems (stone, wind, glass, thistle, silver). Rhythm modulates well—measured in calculation, tightened at the alignment. No head-hopping or register slips; inference stays within Elara’s plausible knowledge. Voice feels particular rather than generic-academic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, character, action) with clean propulsion and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“needle of thistle-blown hope”) without purple sprawl. No loops or template cadences dulling momentum; syntax varies to match pressure. Final line resolves by image with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Retrocognition + post-collapse star-beacon + “shard of hush” yields a distinct synthesis; the reversal that the message is a declaration of survival is satisfying. Familiar ruins-and-signal premise is personalized through tools, method, and tone. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and they pay off. Not revolutionary, but notably fresh and integrated.</comment>
