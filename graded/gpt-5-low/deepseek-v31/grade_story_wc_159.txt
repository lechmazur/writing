<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motivation with tactile interiority (“foxglove regret”) and embodied urgency. Choices (searching, inhaling the mist) align with stakes, but contradictions are light—she rarely wavers beyond dread. The arc lands as credible endurance with fragile hope, not a deep internal reconfiguration. A richer clash between caution and risk in the breath/light beat could elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: crack → search → vial → inhalation → light mend. Orientation is crisp and the closure occurs on the page with a decisive change and a modest felt cost (spent echo, lingering regret). The path is somewhat linear once the legend is recalled, but the widening crack provides a real clock. The ending’s charged poise—hope edged by loss—feels earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (opal library, jars of crystallized joy, distilled sorrow) filter through Aeliana’s priorities. The micro‑setting and objects constrain tactics: the archive enables the search; the cracked bamboo and orchid dictate the solution and charge the final image. Sensory palette is rich without stalling momentum. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early and escalates via the widening crack and dulling petals. The tactical tightening is single but meaningful: she risks herself by inhaling the mist to light from within. Cost is felt but mild; the solution arrives cleanly once the legend is invoked, with limited resistance or tradeoff beyond urgency. A complicating setback in the retrieval or performance could deepen pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (memory as sustenance, echo as light, names as chimes) converge into a quiet answer: preservation becomes rekindling. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext of solitude and custodianship shades the hope with credible loss. Complexity remains, as regret persists and the duty continues against “the immense and silent dark.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and cadence fit the mythic register. Modulation under pressure is smooth, with crisp sentence rhythm at key turns. No head‑hopping or stance slips; elision is purposeful and legible. A hair shy of exceptional only because the lyric register rarely risks sharper fracture under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs (orchid/chime as world rule and symbol). Lush prose remains clear; metaphors are coherent and not over‑stacked in peak beats. Minimal scaffold or loop. A touch of purple in places, but it serves atmosphere and does not blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Glass orchids nourished by memory, emotions archived as essences, and a song‑echo manifesting as light feel fresh and well‑synthesized. The repair via inhaled yearning is a specific, non‑obvious turn grounded in prior setup. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off. It stops short of radical reinvention because the obstacle yields without a nontrivial counterforce.</comment>
