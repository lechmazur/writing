<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to transform shame into strength and pass an exacting rite—remains clear and compels specific micro‑choices under pressure (pause, breathe, commit). Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (steam column, trembling hand, crystal bloom), with a credible contradiction between fear and focus. The child superstition becoming a deliberate technique reads earned by her history and current stakes, not a convenience. The change at the end forecloses a path (panic‑crystallization) in favor of a costlier, disciplined stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from hush to held‑breath to flare, yielding on‑page closure as the rune completes and breath releases. Orientation is immediate (platform, tea, exam), and each beat causally builds. Cost is visible in restraint and the risk of failure; the final image reconfigures meaning (scar → rune) with a felt before/after. The throughline holds without stray detours.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating platform, column of steam, and tea function as environmental instruments that calibrate silence and pressure; the quill as tool and the body as micro‑setting constrain action. Sensory selection is precise and purposeful across smell, touch, and sight. The final sip and distant storm re‑charge the early anchors and frame the earned calm. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and coherent (fortitude rune or falter), and escalation arrives via the involuntary crystallization—an embodied obstacle—followed by the breath‑held intensification. The decisive tightening is her refusal to exhale until the rune is complete, trading comfort for focus. While quiet, the cost is legible and the cadence shift lands. No luck or external rescue resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of repricing trauma into resilience and converting superstition into disciplined craft arise from concrete acts rather than overt moralizing. Recurring images (breath, steam column, scar/river/root) evolve meaningfully and culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. The ending offers a non‑literal answer—peace earned, not gifted—without sermon. Ambiguity remains only where it enriches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical, and sensorially biased toward poise and pressure, matching the character’s training and mindset. Rhythm modulates with the held‑breath sequence and releases cleanly at the end. No head‑hopping or stance drift occurs. Diction stays coherent without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: metaphors are controlled (river, root, amber) and aligned with the story’s physical logic. Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and action—without redundancies. There’s lushness but no purple drag; momentum holds through the inscription. Final cadence is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a rune exam rendered as a quiet tea‑ritual on a sky disc, with a stress‑crystallizing body turned from liability to strength via childhood superstition. The “held breath” motif becomes literal method and thematic spine. Risks in lyric compression pay off with clarity at closure. Tropes are transformed rather than displayed.</comment>
