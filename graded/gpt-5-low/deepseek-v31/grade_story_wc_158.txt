<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear—an insomniac poet tasked with transmuting planetary pain—and her choices (leaving the hut, entering the shell, deciding to carve) align with it. Interiority is specific and embodied (bare feet, humming through soles). The shift from “failure” to conduit is earned by the lullaby’s discovery, though true contradictory impulses are lightly sketched rather than pressed. Cost registers as exhaustion and relinquishing her prior self-conception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: aching soil → shell silence → wind-lullaby → translation by carving → planetary hum softens. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (centuries of wakefulness releasing into sleep, burden shared). Orientation is clean early and the one-scene arc is coherent. The decisive act—carving the final symbol—links discovery to consequence without deus ex machina.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell, broken moon, and salt-wind aren’t décor; the shell both shelters and provides the surface for the treaty, charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s vocation. Environmental logic stays consistent and constrains choice (she must go to the shell to hear and inscribe). The postcard and shell reprise in the ending to deepen atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolve the planet’s dissonance and clarify purpose—is signaled early and tightens as the lullaby introduces a concrete path that requires action. The escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens, culminating in the carving that forecloses the old “describe pain only” path. Cost is present but quiet (spent stamina, surrender of insomnia’s vigil). Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: transforming agony into peace via attentive translation, the ethics of witness, and the loneliness of giants. The ceasefire-as-lullaby reweights the premise without moralizing, though one line (“She was not meant to just describe the pain; she was meant to translate the peace.”) edges toward explicit statement. The final sleep and softened hum deliver a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers in the world’s history without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a distinct lyric texture; diction and rhythm suit the mythic, tidal register of the piece. POV modesty holds, with inference rather than omniscience guiding the “memory” from the shell. Cadence modulates from ache to hush cleanly. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but largely disciplined; images do multiple jobs and rarely stall momentum. Occasional density (“photosynthesizing pain,” “reef-shadow joy”) leans purple but coheres with the world’s logic and pays off in the ending. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support propulsion. No paraphrase loops or muddled metaphors at the turn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fossil cathedral singing a ceasefire for eons, translated by an insomniac poet into peace, feels fresh and inevitable once revealed. The “blossom armistice” and off-key wind as carrier are distinctive, not template. The risk—quiet, lyric closure with conceptual stakes—works without obscurity. Specificity of object and place lifts it beyond genre commonplace.</comment>
