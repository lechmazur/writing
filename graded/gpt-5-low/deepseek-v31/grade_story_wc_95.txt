<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motives are clean and aligned—both want to unlock the map—and choices track (he feints for a 45° guard, then yields advantage to salute and decode). Interiority is thin; we feel little contradictory impulse or cost beyond pride and restraint. Elara’s “diplomatic fierceness” reads mostly as posture rather than a pressure that complicates her choices. The partnership shift lands but with modest emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: duel-as-cipher → specific angle achieved → sundial alignment → hidden pane → book. Single-scene window with a clear before/after as opposition becomes partnership. Cost is light (status loss, risk of failure), which tempers the impact. Closure is on-page and legible under a Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atrium, sundial, and pane are not just décor; they constrain and enable the decoding tactic and shape the final image. The brook’s murmur sets a patient counterpoint that supports tone. Spatial choreography is clear from floor to wall to pane. Environmental specificity is functional and charged without overexposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake (finding the library via duel), and escalation tightens when the 45° guard is forced. The decisive turn is Valerius converting martial advantage into deciphering action rather than finishing the bout. Stakes remain conceptual rather than visceral, with minimal visible price. Still, agency drives the outcome cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ideas of translating violence into knowledge, mind/machine collaboration, and turning questions into destinations are earned through concrete action. A few lines verge on thesis (“translated the violent poetry…”), trimming resonance slightly. The final image (shared retrieval of the book, world holding its breath) carries quiet, credible weight. Ambiguity persists in a good way about future consequences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The elevated third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suits the ceremonial tone. Diction and rhythm modulate well between action and reveal, with no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful. The prose stays within the established register without strain.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are clean, with varied syntax and purposeful imagery; most sentences do more than one job. Occasional purple phrasing appears but doesn’t blur sense or momentum. No significant loops or scaffolding. The final sentences land with clarity and cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Duel-as-cipher mapped via geometry to a hidden pane feels fresh and coherent. The mechanical arm vs. fluid grace adds a non-obvious human/tech tension resolved through partnership. The sundial alignment is an elegant, earned twist rather than a gimmick. Risk-taking is measured and effective without obscuring clarity.</comment>
