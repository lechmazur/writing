<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied—his craft as rebellion and the tactile comfort of the kerosene rag ground him. Interiority is specific (chemicals, fuse‑work) and drives micro‑choices, especially after finding “RISE.” Internal contradiction is muted; he is steady rather than torn, so cost reads as endurance more than conflict. The closing renunciation—pocketing the warm rag and leaving—lands as earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly—the density of light/noise builds to a cadence shift when the mosaic is ignited and the crowd rises. Orientation is crisp early; single scene coherence is strong. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fortress community physically rises, reweighting the premise. Cost is subtle but legible as spent materials, risk, and disciplined focus under despair.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and functional: starless hush, “stone petals,” and the courtyard mosaic are not mere decor—they steer tactics and the finale. The kerosene rag and launch tubes act as micro‑settings shaping what’s possible. The floor’s “RISE” directly charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true, with technical textures anchored to action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (piercing communal despair), and pressure deepens through a pattern of escalating effects. The discovery of “RISE” tightens intent and redirects the finale into a ground‑trace—a meaningful narrowing. Visible sacrifice is modest; there’s little pushback beyond inertia and silence. Still, the cadence shift at the end reweights cost and consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Art as defiance emerges through repeated, concrete images rather than thesis. The mosaic word refracts into action (ignited letters) and then into communal embodiment (people rise), achieving thematic closure without moralizing. The “serious playfulness” of craft complicates the heroic frame with humility. Ambiguity lingers: the weight remains, but bearing it is reclaimed.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical yet specific, with a distinct technical lexicon (“slow match,” “strontium carbonate”) that feels earned. Psychic distance is stable, modulation under pressure is smooth, and no head‑hopping occurs. The chant’s evolution (hum → chemical litany → silence) reflects interior rhythm. No dialogue, but the prose carries subtext in image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is clean and propulsive; metaphors are coherent (“stitching the sky”) and not over‑stacked. Information density is high—lines often serve setting, character, and theme at once. Minor purple notes never swamp clarity, and there’s no notable loop or scaffold. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pyrotechnician‑as‑rebel frame feels fresh through tactile specificity and the mosaic twist. “Stone petals” and the ground‑trace finale add ingenuity to a light‑versus‑dark motif. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Risk level is measured but confident.</comment>
