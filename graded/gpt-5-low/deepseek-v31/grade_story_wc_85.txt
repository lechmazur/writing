<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are specific and conflicted—payment versus the need to weigh truth—embodied in tactile beats (numb fingers on carvings, the watch hand’s “heft”). Her guilt isn’t generic; it’s tied to past choices that now corner her. The on‑page renunciation (refusing to deliver the lie) is earned and costly. Minor ding: a few lines verge on declared feeling rather than dramatized contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Situational drive holds: shore → terrace with a single tightening—client’s direct demand—leading to a decisive confession with relational cost. Orientation is clean early; cause/pressure lines are coherent. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Decisive Change, foreclosing her lucrative path with this client. No stray props or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The shore and cobalt terrace are vivid, purposeful, and filtered through vocation; the watch hand works as a charged micro‑setting object. Environment shapes action (transactions finalize on the terrace) and charges the final image (metal gleam pointing to an uncertain future). Sensory economy is strong without tourist cataloging. Excellent integration without overstatement.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver the lie or not) is signaled early and tightened when the client demands proof. The turn—reframing the watch hand as a “key” to truth—forces a trade‑off, paying in lost client trust and income. Internal and external tensions braid coherently. The price is visible in the client’s exit and Elara’s acceptance of ongoing burden.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s weight versus fabricated lineage accrues through action and images (sieved hush, carvings, watch hand). The final choice answers the central question without a pat moral, reweighting pride/lineage as honesty/cost. One sentence edges toward telling (“immense, crushing weight of the truth”), but the surrounding imagery earns it. Subtext in silence and setting carries most of the load.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical limited POV with controlled diction; perception is character‑specific (genealogical and tactile focus). The single line of dialogue lands with subtext, and narration stays within plausible knowledge. Rhythm modulates with pressure without head‑hopping. A few elevated phrases flirt with uniform register, but control is largely firm.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are lean enough to move while carrying layered images; syntax varies and avoids loops. Figurative language is mostly clean and purposeful; no mixed metaphors that blur sense. Occasional abstract phrasing (“processed and intentional” silence) brushes purple but doesn’t slow momentum. Final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—black market genealogist reading driftwood carvings, a watch hand as truth‑key—is fresh and integrated, not decorative. The reweighting at the terrace feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric tone with a quiet moral turn) pay off without obscuring clarity. The ingenuity is emotional as much as conceptual.</comment>
