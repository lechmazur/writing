<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and temperament (“final project brief,” “gently systematic”) are specific and consistent, and her choices (building the translator, initiating contact) align with them. The embodied cost appears in her thinning body and eventual death. Internal contradiction is light—her “brazen calm” leaves little friction beyond mortality—so complexity is more steady than combative. Still, the micro-choices under pressure read credible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patient patterning (wiring, listening) culminates in a cadence shift when the lithicores respond and the orchard reconfigures. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: she succeeds but does not live to witness the aftermath; the diary and transformed orchard bear the price. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what). Causality is coherent without needing multiple turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars are tactile, sonically alive (“geothermal song”), and integral to tactics and outcome. The environment directly constrains the method (copper-branch-to-stone bridge) and charges the final image (stone and flora weaving architecture). Sensory detail is selective and POV-shaped, avoiding tourist cataloging. World rules (vibration/stone communication) remain consistent and dramatized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (achieve communion before death) are signaled early, with pressure tightening through time passage and bodily decline. The pivotal deepening arrives when intention is sent and the lithicores answer, reweighting options and costs. Tension is serene rather than combative, but the persistent clock and physical attrition lend credible pressure. One meaningful tightening suffices under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of interspecies respect, collaboration over domination, and listening across mediums emerge from concrete acts (copper translator, touching stone, shared remodeling). The ending reweights earlier motifs (diary, pillars, hum) into a durable ethical stance. A slight tendency toward articulated takeaway (“peace earned not through domination…”) trims mystery. Nonetheless, resonance lingers via image and consequence rather than moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled first-person voice blends technical attention with lyric observation, modulating with pressure into a charged stillness at the climax. The posthumous statement (“I did not live to see…”) is handled cleanly within a reflective frame, not breaking focalization. Diction is consistent with the character’s expertise and temperament. Rhythm supports the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lean and musical, with concrete verbs and purposeful imagery (“wire glinted,” “geothermal song”) doing multiple jobs per line. No paraphrase loops or metaphor tangles dull the climax; momentum holds through reflective compression. A few abstract phrases appear but don’t swamp clarity. The final image is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The copper-bioelectric bridge to living stone feels fresh, and the “architectural secret as language” reframes communion with nonhuman intelligence in a non-obvious way. The brazen-calm approach risks quiet, non-spectacle pressure and pays it off. World and method cohere into a memorable synthesis. Minor familiarity with “final work before death” is transformed by specificity.</comment>
