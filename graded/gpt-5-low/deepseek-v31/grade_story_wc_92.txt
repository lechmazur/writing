<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lysander’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and his calm, precise actions reveal character under pressure. Interiority is present but slightly idealized; we rarely see contradiction or real fray at the edges of his resolve. The dynamic with Captain Vorlag adds a credible relational crucible with her visible hesitation. The personal cost remains mostly conceptual (accusation of treachery) rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout → sundial code → hidden tool → etched frequencies → agents awaken → Captain’s test resolved by stance. Closure lands as a charged poise/resonant reconfiguration: the revolution begins and Vorlag refrains from violence. The cost is implied (betrayal, risk) more than dramatized in consequence, keeping it strong but not exceptional. Orientation is solid early; the lens reads consistently causal with a lyrical finish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally embedded: the blackout, balcony, bronze rail, and the fort’s “iron bones” transmitting resonance directly shape tactics. Object-as-setting (quill holder/sun‑steel) charges the final image. Sensory detail is economical and filtered through a professional’s focus. World rules feel consistent and learned via action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around executing the signal before being stopped; Vorlag’s arrival is a clear tightening. The choice to reveal the quill/sliver to sway her is an earned turn that narrows options. Stakes skew conceptual and ideological, with minimal on‑page price paid beyond risk exposure, softening the felt escalation. Still, the hum spreading across the fort reweights the stakes credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Light as hoarded power versus communal illumination emerges organically through action and image. The final “winking, luminous hush” offers a resonant, non‑didactic answer aligned with the silent revolution. One line (“Is it treachery to return light…”) edges toward thesis articulation but is grounded by the scene. The piece invites reflection on power and consent without flattening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, luminous narrative voice fits a disciplined sentinel under stress; diction and rhythm are confident without overreach. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and goal‑driven, especially in the Vorlag exchange. POV remains steady and modest in knowledge. Minor lyric heightening stays within the character’s plausible lexicon.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is tight with strong verbs and layered images doing multiple jobs. A few lush phrases (“obsidian monolith,” “cradle of sparks”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and in-tone. No scaffold loops or cadence templates slow momentum. The final image reprises motifs cleanly without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a sundial code to retrieve a bronze quill that transmits resonant frequencies via a sliver of mythic sun‑steel feels distinctive and purposeful. The silent, nonviolent revolution frame is a thoughtful twist on intrusion/heist tropes. Risks are taken in tone and concept without sacrificing clarity. Emotional truth is quieter than daring but authentic to the premise.</comment>
