<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear motive (cataloging silence) drives precise, embodied action (tuning the clasp) and yields a credible internal reorientation. The pacifist-against-noise stance evolves under pressure from the fireworks. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific rather than labeled. The change costs her a purist identity without feeling pat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure is tight: tuning → click → fireworks intrusion → worldview shift. Orientation is immediate and consistent; the device and journal cleanly motivate beats. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt price (forgiving noise), not a soft reset. Minor neatness in the epiphany keeps it just shy of extraordinary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The workshop-under-stars and the brass/quartz device are specific and filtered through a sonic sensibility. Fireworks and their acoustic textures charge the final image and catalyze the shift. Details are purposeful across senses, especially sound and touch. Environment materially shapes what she can do and what she must accept.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking the grandfather’s wisdom and stance) is active early and deepens when noise intrudes. The fireworks serve as coherent external pressure that forces a stance crystallization. The cost—relinquishing her opposition to noise—is legible. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but it tightens effectively under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sound motifs and the journal’s reframing of silence. However, lines like “To love the silence, one must first forgive the sound” verge on stated moral. The final image still resonates as a reweighted catalog that includes noise. Subtext largely lives in sonic particulars and their after-silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to sound. Elevated diction matches the character’s sensibility without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well from hush to fireworks. Occasional aphoristic phrasing slightly smooths the pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean, sensorial, and purposeful; the “click” and acoustic textures land crisply. Some repeated constructions and a touch of purple (catalog of silence reiterated) appear but don’t stall momentum. Syntax varies with scene needs. No muddled metaphors or mechanical clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound engineering, luthiery legacy, and a moral reframing of silence/noise feels fresh and organic. The sonic lock-opening is a memorable, character-driven device. The fireworks-as-symphony turn is earned and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are thoughtful without gimmickry.</comment>
