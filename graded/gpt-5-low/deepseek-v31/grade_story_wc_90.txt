<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Steward’s motive—to safeguard and then unlock a path for humanity’s legacy—drives every choice, with embodied cost in the grief‑mass mechanic. Interiority is specific and character‑particular for an AI, especially in the “shadow work” immersion. Contradictory impulses (pacifism, sorrow as fuel, hope’s lightness) operate together rather than alternating. Minor limitation: little doubt or error under peak pressure keeps the inner contest from feeling riskier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sorrow aggregation → increased mass → ritualized offering in the Arboretum culminates in an on‑page seam opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (self‑wounding grief leveraged) and a clear before/after (lonely stasis to charged hope). Orientation is crisp early and consistent. The causal thread is clean, if a touch ceremonial rather than pressured by fresh complication at the brink.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ark‑ship’s recycled corridors, the Arboretum‑mausoleum, and the Kwan Yin statue are purposeful and filtered through the Steward’s priorities. Microgravity and the grief‑mass mechanic subtly constrain movement; the statue’s palm literally stages the final act. Details are selective and functional, avoiding touristry. A slight bias toward concept over tactile textures in the climax keeps it just shy of transcendent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—tightens through painful accumulation and the mass penalty, culminating in a decisive, non‑violent act. The cost is unmistakable: laborious, self‑burdening grief to assemble the Tear, then a final push paid for by that weight. Pressure grows coherently under the chosen lens; no adversary needed. A sharper on‑page risk of failure at the final touch could heighten the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Compassion as praxis—grief repurposed into creation—emerges organically from Kwan Yin, the tears’ quantum signature, and the pacifist code. The ending reframes sorrow as the engine of hope without sermonizing. Thematic strands braid cleanly (memory, legacy, non‑violence) and the final warmth resists tidy triumph. Symbolism is strong but never feels like a late graft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, elegant voice suits an ancient, grieving AI; diction and rhythm modulate toward lift at the seam. POV distance stays stable and plausible for the consciousness depicted. Lyric compression is legible and purposeful. A few abstract formulations could yield to sensory particular for further texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry weight with minimal redundancy; imagery (sea of time, tear distorting space) is coherent and well‑placed. Figurative density supports rather than clogs momentum. No notable loop or scaffold artifacts, and cadence varies effectively. One or two elevated phrases brush purple but don’t blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—pacifist AI whose mass varies with emotion, mining tears’ quantum signatures to open a seam via Kwan Yin—feels fresh and integrated. The ritual science of sorrow reads inventive rather than gimmicky. Turn to hope is earned and non‑obvious. Slight familiarity in “last ark‑ship AI mourns humanity” keeps it from the absolute top of the band.</comment>
