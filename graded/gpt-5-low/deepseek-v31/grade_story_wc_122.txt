<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inara’s motive—defeating her emotional numbness—is crystal and drives concrete choices (the phonograph, reverse‑playing, staging the recital). Interiority is embodied through tactile perception rather than labels, giving specificity to her loss and hunger. Leo reads more functionally than interior, but his arc supports her central drive. A sharper on‑page contradiction (fear vs. risk) at the performance moment could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: teaching → discovery of reverse vibration → recital where silence is remade. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—she risks a public test and pays in vulnerability before winning a sacred silence. Orientation is clean early, and set ups pay off (phonograph, backward grooves). Causal pressure is gentle but enough for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drum maker’s cavern (sound‑absorbing, stone chill, hides) actively shapes tactics and primes the final image; it’s not just backdrop. Objects-as-setting (phonograph, cello bodies) channel the story’s tactile sense‑world and constrain choices. Seasonal detail (autumn → winter → spring) subtly modulates atmosphere. The final silent “applause” is charged by the space’s acoustic logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes—can Inara transmute numbness into a communal, felt attention—are clear and deepen as the recital approaches. The tightening turn is the public test where silence must carry; risk is implied, not dramatized through visible failure pressure. Agency drives the result (her methods, staging, Leo’s execution). Slightly more friction or potential for rupture in the performance would heighten cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of silence as presence, feeling vs. memory, and healing through attention arise from image and action, not thesis. The backward groove as “feeling, not music” reframes art and culminates in the silent, sacred approval—a resonant answer without moralizing. The closing reprices the entire premise with emotional authority. Complexity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled and sensorially specific to a deaf focalization; tactile metaphors feel earned. Distance stays stable, with rare slips handled as inference rather than omniscience. Rhythm modulates well from instruction to performance. Minimal dialogue suits the piece’s subtextual mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, with high information density and purposeful imagery (“a filament of hush,” “intent silence”). Figurative language is varied and coherent to the tactile premise; no notable loops or scaffolding. A few elevated phrases border on purple but do not blur clarity or momentum. The final lines land with clean, specific force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The central conceit—broken needle, reverse records as felt music, enthralling via the sanctity of silence—is fresh and integrated. Choices and objects are indispensable to the final reweighting. The risk of a quiet, accumulative build pays off without gimmickry. It reads like a singular vision rather than a template.</comment>
