<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and internal pivot—from guarding borders to intervening—are clear and earned by Kael’s plea. Her “calm intuition” leads to concrete choices (mirrors, mobilization). However, some emotional language skews abstract (“map empathy onto action”), softening embodied conflict. Kael functions primarily as catalyst, offering little pressure beyond the initial plea.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: intrusion → mirror method → vision map → mobilization → avalanche diverted. Closure lands with Elara’s repricing of “peace” and a tangible save, though cost is modest and largely conceptual. The montage-like middle remains coherent within length constraints. No major dropped setups; the method pays off promptly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct locales (lighthouse orchard, salt-bleached town, vintage mirror shop) are vivid and functional. Mirrors as environment-tools directly shape action, and the avalanche landscape sets concrete stakes. Details feel filtered through Elara’s role and priorities. The recurring crystal fragment charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and high (village survival), and pressure tightens once through the mirror-vision turn. Yet resistance is low: the plan works on first try, authority instantly mobilizes villagers, and no option is foreclosed with felt price. The climax arrives and resolves without a meaningful setback. Tension is present but not deeply testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of peace-as-action and empathy operationalized are coherent and seeded early. The mirror collage literalizes “seeing,” tying concept to tactic effectively. Explicit thesis lines (“true peace… is a dynamic force”) reduce subtext and nudge toward moralizing. The final crystal touch is resonant but a shade tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person close is stable with lyrical precision and clean dialogue beats. Diction is largely controlled, with occasional abstractions that flatten immediacy. Rhythm carries momentum through transitions without confusion. Distinct perceptual signature (guardian’s eye, procedural calm) holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentences are generally tight and purposeful; images (ice floes, mirrors) do double duty. Some elevated phrasing and thematic repetition edge toward purple but do not blur sense. Minimal scaffold and good propulsion across the mirror sequence. One minor typo (“future chose”) and occasional abstraction dampen peak charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and mirror-based reconstitution feel fresh and specific. The synthesis of magical-seeing with practical mobilization is inventive without gimmickry. The rescue framework is familiar, slightly limiting surprise. Still, the execution shows conceptual integrity and a memorable tactic-image pairing.</comment>
