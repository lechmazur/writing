<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and temperament are crystal clear and drive her tactics under strain, and her micro‑choices (abandoning sun‑reflections, opening to the void, switching to starlight) align with character. The embodied calm under pressure reads particular, not generic. Internal contradiction is light—she rarely wavers—which trims depth. The final endurance/renunciation feels earned though the personal cost remains mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure deepens from routine warding to light failure to empathetic offering to star‑weave acceptance. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when) and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a before/after (the canal now holds light from within). The cost is implied—patience, vulnerability, and relinquishing “simple reflection”—rather than dramatized as sacrifice, which tempers impact. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, wet stone smell, puddled sky, boathouse, shutters, and water behave as lived constraints and charge the final image. The dental mirror and shutter‑harp function as micro‑setting tools that shape options when light dwindles; the need for starlight arises from environment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with weather and dark water affecting tactics. Tone and world rules remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—holding back the formless gloom—is legible and tested when the sun’s light fails. A meaningful tightening occurs as reflection unravels, forcing Elara to risk a new method and to confront the darkness with empathy before weaving stars. The price reads in patience and exposure rather than tangible loss, so danger feels slightly abstract. Nonetheless, escalation coheres and resolves via her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of teaching darkness to cherish stars and gentleness as counter to despair emerge through concrete acts, not thesis. The final “two skies” image reweights prior material with a quiet, resonant answer. Ambiguity remains constructive (the darkness’s acceptance as a negotiated peace). No sermonizing or platitudes undercut the effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression supports atmosphere and action. Absence of dialogue is fitting and never felt like a dodge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean syntax and strong verbs; imagery (“shutter‑harp,” “borrowed jewels”) is vivid and coherent. A mild lushness flirts with purple but remains purposeful and legible under stress. No scaffolding loops or template cadences slow momentum. The final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Weaving starlight via a dental mirror and shutter patterns to negotiate with an empathized darkness feels striking and specific. The turn from reflecting sun to offering memory and stars is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and concept cohere with the setting and stakes. The piece synthesizes trope‑adjacent elements into a singular vision.</comment>
