<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (decode the leaves) and embodied actions (prodding with a twig; building shrines) reveal character. Interiority is textured but largely unopposed—contradictory impulses are faint, so the transformation costs little on the page. Still, her reverence-driven choice meaningfully alters her fate. The closing acceptance reads earned if emotionally low-friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build lands a decisive change and conceptual repricing (the Arbor becomes a library; she becomes its translator). Because/therefore links are soft but coherent: discovery → prod → vision → shrines → flare → transformation. Orientation is clean; the lens holds. The cost of transformation is implied more than dramatized, slightly softening closure impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Ashen arbor is vivid and integral: altitude, dusk “hush,” and leaf‑pages charge the final revelation. Details are selective and POV‑filtered through her craft and folklore. The environment redefines meaning at the end rather than serving as postcard backdrop. Strong purposefulness without overexplaining world rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure deepens via pattern break and cadence shift: the ordinary sorting ritual is interrupted by the alien speck, then ritualized monuments trigger the flare. Stakes are primarily conceptual; opposition is minimal and the price of change remains gentle. Escalation is nonetheless legible and coheres under an accumulative lens. The decisive turn originates in her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Earned thematic resonance: reverence for forgotten fragments unlocks collective memory; devotion transforms reader into librarian. The leaf‑as‑page motif reweights itself at the end without moralizing. Ambiguity persists around the cost of becoming a conduit, which enriches the aftertaste. A touch neat, but grounded in particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person with a distinct sensory bias (“mossy delight,” slate, sap) suits the fable‑like mode. Rhythm modulates at turns (hush deepens; flare). No head‑hopping or register drift; certainty aligns with her perceptions until the vision, which is cleanly cued. Voice sustains pressure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; imagery carries multiple loads (world, mood, theme). Minor purple edges remain, but clarity and momentum hold through the climax. Sentence variety and verb choice keep the piece moving. No significant scaffolding or loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tree‑as‑library with leaves as a continuous publication is a fresh synthesis, and the moonstone speck as forgotten fragment is an elegant trigger. The ritual of tiny monuments is distinctive and character‑revealing. Risks are purposeful and coherent, with an ending image that feels inevitable. Slight comfort in the outcome keeps it just shy of the rarest echelon.</comment>
