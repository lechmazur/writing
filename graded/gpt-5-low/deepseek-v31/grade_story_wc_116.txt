<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserving the library’s healing silence—intensifies credibly from observer to healer. The internal tension between “witness without judgment” and choosing to intervene is dramatized at the breach. Embodied perception (the hum as pressure on skin) grounds emotion without therapy-speak. The cost registers as exhaustion and a fragile, ongoing duty rather than a grand sacrifice, but it’s earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: hum → descent → refuge → rupture → origami instruction → filter-healing → restored silence. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and an Earned Stasis feel (“hers to maintain”). Orientation is crisp early; scope stays within a single throughline. The cost is modest yet legible; a slightly sharper on‑page price would lift this higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The overgrown library, catacombs, river, and obsidian refuge are vividly tactile and integrated into action. Environment constrains tactics (she must descend; the refuge contains ruptures) and supplies resources (silence drawn from stones/books). Sensory balance is strong (pressure, cold air, light). The final image is charged by place (“obsidian walls” reflecting calm darkness).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused: the library’s integrity. Pressure coheres and tightens as the hum escalates into a rupture, forcing a values test that forecloses pure nonintervention. Agency is clear in the choice to act as a filter rather than a barrier. The price is largely internal (exhaustion and acceptance of ongoing vigilance), credible at this length but not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of observation vs intervention, map vs territory, and healing through silence emerge through concrete acts (unfolding the swan; filtering the rupture). The final image reweights the motif—her refolding the swan signals a new stance without preaching. Symbolic elements (river, obsidian, light) stay integrated rather than decorative. Ambiguity is purposeful, with a felt, fragile peace rather than a pat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person close holds throughout; diction suits the fable‑like gravitas without overreaching. Perceptual signature is consistent (silence as force; light as “unfiltered reality”). No dialogue avoids stress tests of speech, but the interior cadence modulates under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work—worldbuilding, mood, and action—without bogging. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; repetition (“silence,” “crumbling”) supports motif rather than loops. A few elevated phrasings risk purple but remain clear and purposeful. Rhythm varies, and the closure image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—regenerative silence as a material force, an origami swan as geomantic map/instruction, an obsidian refuge containing “raw reality”—feels fresh. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule changes. The piece takes tasteful risks in conceit and diction without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth (choosing to judge) anchors the strangeness.</comment>
