<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elian’s motive is clear and specific—following resonance to the sorrow’s source—and his tactile way of knowing gives him a distinct interior life. The decisive choice not to draw a map but to saturate the ring instead reads earned. Internal contradiction is muted; he meets little resistance beyond endurance and the risk of being overwhelmed. Still, the embodied overwhelm at the tree and the renunciation of cartographic habit register as credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: hum → notes → silence → absorption is coherent and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration (ring now inward, vocation reweighted). Orientation arrives early and remains stable, with one continuous pursuit scene. Closure carries cost via the flood of loneliness and the permanent alteration of his instrument. The because/therefore chain is gentle but intact for the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and the petrified tree are vividly, purposefully rendered and directly shape choice (following notes, entering the silence). The platinum ring functions as a charged micro‑setting at the end, constraining the final stance. Multi‑sensory specificity through touch and vibration mirrors the POV’s biases. The environment meaningfully charges the final image without tourist cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens as the chaotic hum resolves into a path and then into a painful silence and overwhelming contact. The principal cost is internal—absorption and the forfeiting of an externalized map—which lands but remains quiet. There is no adversarial force or hard reversal, yet the single deepening is sufficient for this length and lens. The needle’s permanent inward turn forecloses a prior way of working.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of listening, cartography of feeling, and the ethics of bearing borrowed sorrow emerge through image and action rather than statement. The final reweighting—map carried inside, compass pointing to the wearer’s core—offers a non‑literal answer that lingers. The forest’s sorrow “not his own” reframes the quest without moralizing. Ambiguity around cost and peace coexists productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, tactile, and consistent with a blind cartographer reading the world by skin. Lexicon and rhythm support the lyric mode without slip into generic abstraction. Psychic distance remains steady and plausible; inference reads as inference. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, mood, and action—without padding; figurative language is rich but coherent and restrained. No scaffold loops or template cadences dull momentum. The cadence modulates toward a charged hush at the clearing and a clean, crystalline final image. Diction stays precise and sensorially anchored.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: tactile linguistics, an ultrasonic forest, and a resonance‑seeking ring culminating in an inward‑pointing compass. The final turn feels inevitable in hindsight given the established motifs. Risks in concept and diction heighten coherence rather than obscure it. The piece avoids template beats and offers a memorable, singular vision.</comment>
