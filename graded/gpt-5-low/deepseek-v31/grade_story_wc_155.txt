<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to reclaim lost joy—is clear, and her choices (abandoning the planned display to resurrect the old) track cleanly. Interiority is specific to her craft, with embodied frustration (“the fog threatened to swallow each nascent gleam”). Internal contradiction is present but gentle (ambition vs. humility/collaboration), and stakes remain mostly internal. A deeper flaw or cost on the page (beyond ephemerality) would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: discovery → research → execution → activation accrues pressure and meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the fragment completes the light‑grove and reweights her goal—joy via collaboration with the past—against the cost of ephemerality. Orientation is clean from the outset. The causal turn via the knowledge network is tidy and believable at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fog and orchard ruins are vivid and function as constraint: the fog actively resists the light, shaping tactics and tone. Tools and materials (lenses, dust) are integrated with setting, not paraded. The fragment as object‑setting charges the final image. Slight expansion of environmental resistance during the build could have intensified the constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is personal: will she find a path back to joy. Escalation is modest but coherent—fog resistance, craft difficulty, the mid‑scene knowledge pivot, and the renunciation of her original plan. The felt price is chiefly effort and the acceptance of impermanence. Pressure is quiet; one sharper trade‑off or visible loss would raise the band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of art as temporal collaboration and the reclamation of joy emerges through concrete acts (resurrecting the orchard via the fragment). The final image reweights the premise: beauty that is not solely hers, luminous against oppressive fog. A few lines verge on stating the thesis (“more beautiful... because it was not solely hers”), but the images carry most of the weight. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in craft and weather. Diction is consistent and apt; no head‑hopping or stance wobble. Rhythm varies well between action and reflection. No dialogue needed for this mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean, sensory, and purposeful; metaphors are mostly aligned (light, fog, orchard). Minimal scaffolding and no obvious loops; information density is strong. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but remains legible and motivated by voice. The final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Light‑painting with photochromatic dust in a fog‑shrouded orchard, fused with an archaeological fragment, feels fresh and integrated. The cross‑time collaboration inflects a familiar “artist rekindles joy” arc with specificity. The knowledge‑network insert adds a subtle SF texture without gimmickry. Risks are measured and coherent.</comment>
