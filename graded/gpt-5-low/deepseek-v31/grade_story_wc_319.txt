<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific and embodied (ink-and-leather longing against hoarfrost), with a credible contradiction between feral displacement and librarian duty. Her choice to mend the seam rather than go home is clearly motivated and costs her something she deeply wants. Micro-choices (picking up the pendant, reframing waiting as intent) reveal values under pressure. A touch of stated thesis (“preference”) trims ambiguity but doesn’t undercut credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene frame holds cleanly: frozen garden, guardian, pendant → perception shift → seam → choice → mending and aftermath. Drive lens: Situational with accumulative texture; coherent pressure culminates in Earned Stasis with an on‑page cost (forsaken home; pendant’s power consumed). Orientation is crisp early; stakes stay focused. The closure image (“held breath” silence) reweights the whole vigil without loose ends.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden is vividly rendered and functionally integral: its “interior truth” becomes the tactic that closes the rift, charging the final quiet. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered (mist, hoarfrost, crystalline hedges; “boundaries of light”). World rules are learned through action as perception tunes via the pendant. The setting’s essence—not just its look—constrains and enables choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect this place vs go home) is set early and tightens when the seam appears and the pendant warns of the cultist’s intent. Escalation is quiet but decisive: from passive waiting to intentional mending that forecloses a live option. The price—remaining in exile and burning the pendant’s power—is legible. No cheap coincidence resolves the conflict; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, uncertainty as companion, and re‑interiorizing the outside are earned through concrete beats (reading the garden; mending by holding summer-in-winter). The final “held breath” image resonates without sermonizing. A few lines edge toward thesis-statement clarity, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance exceeds statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close maintains consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Elevated diction fits a guardian of a non‑Euclidean library and modulates with pressure. No head‑hopping or withholding; elisions serve tone rather than dodge clarity. Rhythm varies well across observation and climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; images perform double duty (text of the garden; seam as poor stitching). Minor abstraction spikes (“interiorizing exteriors,” “preference”) don’t blur action or stakes. No scaffold loops or cadence templates drag momentum. The closure image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—feral librarian guardian, perception tuned by a cultist pendant, healing a rift by imposing the garden’s latent summer—is fresh and specific. The decisive act (mending by concept, not force) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and concept land without obscuring clarity. Familiar tropes are transformed through distinctive tactics and voice.</comment>
