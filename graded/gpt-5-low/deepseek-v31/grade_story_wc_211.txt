<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are precise and pressure-tested: oath-bound archivist turned would-be saboteur when her recording becomes an omen. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, the taste of chalk dust) and contradictory impulses collide convincingly at the climax. Micro-choices (needle adjustment, shaving the wax, deciding to smash, then freezing) reveal a hierarchy of values. The oath-versus-responsibility bind feels earned and costly on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational with a clean Charged Poise closure. Orientation is immediate; the causal spine—flawless prep → micro ridge → mis-etched Aramaic → ominous playback—tightens options to a single, high-cost decision. The final beat crystallizes a before/after with the oath and the active prophecy on the line; the cost is legible even in refusal. No stray set-ups or soft resets undercut the cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard-on-skyscraper and phonograph are sensorially vivid and functionally crucial. The environment’s hush after the foghorn silence is the material Elara “records,” and the wax cylinder’s flaw physically catalyzes the prophecy and charges the final image in her hand. Detail selection reflects her vocation; world rules are learned through action. Setting constrains choice and tones the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (archive the silence) and tighten decisively when the phrase fractures into a prophecy, reweighting every subsequent move. The reversal from preservation to destruction narrows options and imposes a moral price (oath-breaking vs. potential catastrophe). The garden’s tonal shift from velvet disquiet to blade-like dread escalates pressure without gimmickry. Consequences remain live even with an open final pose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: medium shapes fate; preservation versus prevention; language as conduit and hazard. The final charged stillness reframes archiving as potentially lethal, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The field-trip memory underwrites her gift without moralizing. No sermon; ambiguity lingers with purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely held to Elara; diction suits the vocation and mood. Rhythm modulates effectively from hushed preparation to dread-laden playback. No head-hopping or register slips; inference remains within plausible knowledge. The voice carries a distinct perceptual signature (tool- and language-focused noticing).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and image-rich without clogging momentum; most lines do more than one job. A few repeated formulations (“velvet disquiet”) verge on insistence but land as motif rather than padding. Figurative choices are coherent and grounded in the scene’s logic. Action order is clear, and the final line resolves by charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of archaic phonography, dead languages, and a rooftop orchard archive feels singular; the micro-mechanical ridge causing a world-tilting prophecy is a sharp, specific turn. The oath scribe premise reframes familiar preservation tropes with fresh stakes. Risk-taking serves character and closure rather than ornament. The final poised dilemma is inevitable yet surprising in its terms.</comment>
