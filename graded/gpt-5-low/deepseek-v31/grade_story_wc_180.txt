<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s conflicting impulses—age‑brittle resignation vs. responsibility to pass on craft—are dramatized in concrete choices (leaving the rafters, offering the ribboned apple). Lyra’s practicality pressures her and catalyzes the shift by dumping the bag. The relationship evolves credibly from friction to collaboration. The emotional cost (relinquishing a self‑protective vow and sanctum) is on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: breach → Lyra’s pressure → ribbon discovery → reframed vow → public offering → delay of demolition. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (wreckers delayed) with a tangible tactic. The cost is present (abandoning her defensive stasis), though the Councillor’s quick reversal reads easy. Orientation and lens hold cleanly throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters is vivid and integral, not decorative: it supplies the apple, defines Elara’s prison/sanctuary, and charges the final image (“sweetness preserved high above the world”). Environmental specificity shapes tactics (descending after a decade) and meaning. Details (roots through saintly statues, dappled light) are purposeful and filtered through Elara’s gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the imminent demolition (“wreckers tomorrow”), tightened by Lyra’s intervention and the forced choice to act. The ribbon discovery reweights options and yields a non-confrontational tactic. The resolution’s external cost is modest; the Councillor yields without counterpressure. Internal stakes and the relinquishment cost do much of the work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The deciduous/evergreen vow motif threads action to theme and reconfigures the final gesture without doctrinaire moralizing. The ribboned apple reframes loss as transmittable wisdom, giving the last image resonance. A few lines state theme overtly (“We were both blind,” “The vow…should be evergreen”), trimming ambiguity. Still, the piece invites reflection on legacy vs. letting go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with clean modulation from hush to resolve. Dialogue is purposeful with distinct idiom (Elara’s leaf‑soft diction vs. Lyra’s brisk charge). A small POV seep when the Councillor’s internal seeing is asserted, but it’s minor and inferable. Overall focalization remains stable and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images carry double duty (orchard as wisdom and prison), and sentences vary rhythmically. Figurative texture is rich without purple overload; scaffolding is minimal. Occasional aphoristic phrasing reads slightly on‑the‑nose but doesn’t stall momentum. The final sentence lands cleanly on image and consequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard in the rafters and quartz‑eye craft feel fresh, and the deciduous/evergreen vow lens is a novel moral calculus. Resolution by offering a ribboned apple is an elegant, non‑obvious tactic grounded in prior specifics. The turn feels inevitable in hindsight given the spilled bag and intergenerational aim. Only the quick civic reversal keeps it from the top tier.</comment>
