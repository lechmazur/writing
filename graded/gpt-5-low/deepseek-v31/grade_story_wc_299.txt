<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is specific and embodied—shame as a “metallic taste,” the reflex to inventory texture as defense. Contradictory impulses (fact-insulation vs. felt grief) operate in-scene and motivate his actions. The final stance is earned through the letters and unfinished song, though the acceptance lands a touch neatly. Minor risk of tidy epiphany slightly softens the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: public failure → low-status assignment → discovery → letters → reframed purpose. Orientation is solid early, and the two-shard structure (office → shed) is legible. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (relinquishing emotional insulation). The lens holds; the cost is felt if quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quarry office and shed are vivid and functionally integrated; the setting is inseparable from Leo’s death and the discovery. Objects (speaker cloth, guitar case, letters) act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, character-filtered, and purposeful. The quarry context meaningfully shapes what can be found and when.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (meaning after failure) is clear and tightens with the found case and letters. The “wrest” beat produces the key turn, and the new knowledge narrows his stance options. The cost is primarily internal and subdued; no external trade-off is forced on the page. Still, internal and external pressures interweave coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, purpose beyond applause, and the ethics of preservation emerge organically from objects and action. The letters offer counterpoint to performance myth without sermonizing. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“He wasn’t just cataloging the dead’s belongings”), but resonance outweighs the tell. The final image reweights prior motifs convincingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is steady, tactile, and plausibly elevated for a reflective, detail-driven POV; diction matches his coping by facts. Dialogue is minimal but natural, serving status dynamics. Rhythm modulates well at the discovery and realization beats. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean, vivid, and efficient; metaphors like “cathedral of rust” and “ghosts of diesel” are apt and not overstacked. Syntax varies, and information density is high without loops or redundancy. The prose carries momentum into the closure image. No artifacting or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a roadie-turned-appraiser in a quarry finding an unfinished song and letters that recast a death. Turns feel earned from character and place, not gimmicked. While the “found letters reveal hidden truth” device is familiar, the specific occupational and setting blend gives it lift. Emotional truth reads particular, not templated.</comment>
