<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s ethic “to share light without using fire” coherently drives every choice, and the internal breach—defying her lineage’s non‑interference—reads as a credible, costly turn. Interiority is specific to her perceptual idiom (light, resonance, petals) rather than stock labels. The contradictory impulses (stewardship vs. intervention) are dramatized in the gear/probe beats. The only limit is the cost remains mostly conceptual; we don’t glimpse relational fallout beyond her felt cage.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: gear discovery → probe arrival → decision to “break the cycle” → refracted signal → probe’s change. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change in the probe and a conceptual repricing of the gear. Orientation is clear early; the single scene stays tight. Cost is present (tradition broken, risk of transformation) but not materially tested beyond the internal breach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Nebula Garden is sensorially vivid and functionally integrated—she channels its energy and the petals recoil, then return to charge the final image. The gear and petals function as micro‑setting objects that constrain tactics and reweight the ending. World rules (resonant pings, refracting signals) are learned through action. Rich detail supports tone without excess cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the Garden’s meaning against quantification—is established and tightens when the probe begins “violent pinging.” The turn is Elara’s renunciation of the family pattern, choosing transformation over destruction. Pressure coheres under a causal lens; the visible price is mainly the renunciation rather than a concrete loss. A hair more consequence or risk on the page would heighten the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: a negotiation between control and understanding, computation vs. resonance, inheritance vs. chosen departure. The gear’s repricing at the end (“warm… approximating something true”) provides a resonant non‑literal answer. No sermonizing; images do the work. Complexity remains—she converts the probe without erasing the threat’s origins.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature rooted in light/sound metaphors and remains steady under pressure. Diction and cadence modulate at the climax without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision reads intentional and legible. No dialogue needed; the narrative voice does the heavy lifting cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are controlled and musical; imagery is dense but largely precise and multi‑tasking. Minimal redundancy; momentum holds through the climax. A few abstract formulations flirt with purple but don’t blur causality or the final image. The closing petal image pays off earlier text without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Repurposing a “calculating machine gear” as a prism to refract hostile data into narrative empathy feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The cloud‑deer, starseed, and resonance mechanics create a singular imaginative ecosystem. The risk—quiet conversion over confrontation—lands without gimmickry. Minor limit: the conceptual conflict leans more elegiac than harrowing, slightly tempering audacity.</comment>
