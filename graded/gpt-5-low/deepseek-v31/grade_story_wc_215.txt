<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s motives are coherent—he observes, infers, and finally takes custodial action—and his restraint aligns with “tranquilly perceptive.” Internal conflict is subtle (he cannot speak for them yet must act), but a true knife‑edge dilemma never quite materializes. The micro‑choices (following the gaze for days, cleaning the box, placing it in the sun) reveal values without sentimentality. The change is an earned renunciation/endurance: he accepts the burden of stewardship and forecloses speech as a tactic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from pattern (silent witnessing) to a charged object that reweights the covenant. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: placing the box where the sun ignites it, with the ongoing cost of custodianship. Orientation is clear early (recluse, oasis, ghosts) and causality is clean enough: the woman’s gaze drives discovery → interpretation → ritual placement. The cost is felt (“responsibility settle onto his shoulders”) even as the ending remains quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis and honey house are specific and tactile, and the sunlit windowsill charges the final image. The world rules (mute ghosts, heat, ash) are taught through action rather than exposition. The stained glass box functions as object‑as‑setting, constraining meaning and choice. Weather/light materially affect the resolution, deepening tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten when the new ghost’s gaze focuses pressure on the honey house, forcing Silas to search and decide how to honor the story. The decisive deepening comes with interpreting the panels and accepting stewardship; the price is ongoing responsibility and a chosen silence. The conflict remains low‑temperature but coherent and cumulative. One more concrete obstacle or competing demand could have sharpened cost further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of covenant, witness, and the ethics of silence emerge through images and actions (water for the farmer, the box as sermon), not meta‑assertion. The final image reweights the premise: care as moral stance in a ruined world. A couple of on‑the‑nose lines (“It was the covenant made physical”) shave subtlety slightly, but subtext prevails overall. The piece invites reflection on blame, regret, and stewardship without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third‑person close maintains a steady, lucid distance tuned to Silas’s sensibility. Diction is controlled and consistent; the perceptual signature favors patient inference over spectacle. No dialogue is needed; silence functions as action. Rhythm modulates well at the turn (discovery/cleansing) and at the charged final tableau.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with purposeful imagery and minimal scaffold; sentences often do double duty. Figurative language supports sense (the sun “ignite[s] its colours”) without purple excess. No loops or cadence artifacts blunt momentum; the prose breathes where needed. A few abstract nouns cluster (“covenant,” “responsibility”) but do not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghosts who communicate solely through gesture in a post‑blight beekeeping oasis, resolved by a stained glass reliquary, feels fresh and integrated. The turn—interpreting a mute archive into an ethic of care—lands as specific rather than generic. Risks are quiet but confident, avoiding genre cliché. Ingenuity arises from synthesis of setting, object, and ethic rather than twistiness.</comment>
