<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s contradictory impulses—skepticism and sudden openness—are dramatized through concrete choices (slipping away, using the tooth, entering the portal). Her historian’s eye and bonesetter lineage plausibly drive tactics and tenderness under pressure. The “alchemy/constellations” phrasing edges toward stated theme, but the core motivation and embodied action stay grounded. The final charged poise (holding Leo and the tooth before the Fae) reads as an earned stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: effigy → wrong detail → garden → tooth → portal → rescue → truce gesture. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the stakes narrow as each choice forecloses retreat. Closure lands as a charged poise with legible cost (risking the Fae realm, injury, and an uncertain truce). If anything, the portal’s mechanics arrive smoothly, but they’re set by the tooth and garden rules established on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hedge maze and secret garden are specific, tactile, and functionally necessary; the oak and fountain inflect mood while the oak physically provides the portal. Micro‑setting resources (sticks, linen) and space (the gap in the privet) shape tactics. World rules are learned through interaction rather than exposition. The final image is charged by place: mother, boy, tooth, and Fae framed by the oak’s threshold.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve Leo) is signaled early and tightens: private deduction → crossing into danger → setting the bone under looming Fae attention. The cost is tangible (Leo’s pain, Aris’s risk, an uncertain negotiation). Escalation is protagonist‑driven; each move raises exposure to the Fae. The ending’s truce stance forecloses immediate flight and reframes risk rather than dissolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of skepticism transformed by love and using error as bridge arise through particulars (the tooth as both proof and compass, “bridge, not a weapon”). The “alchemy/constellations” line veers toward statement, but it is enacted in the final gesture of offering truce. Subtext in the Fae’s watchful silence and Aris’s steadied voice resists moralizing. Resonance lingers in the image of holding both child and mistake toward peace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (historian’s evidence bias, bonesetter memory) that modulates under pressure. Limited dialogue is purposeful and natural; interiority remains within plausible knowledge. Diction is elevated but character‑coherent and steady in distance. Minor flourish never overwhelms clarity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient, with high information density and purposeful figurative choices (“waxen effigy,” “iron‑rich water,” “woven branches”). Momentum holds; no meaningful loops or scaffolding. A minor typo (“feltlarge”) and a couple of abstract phrases slightly nick the polish, but they don’t blunt the closure image. Rhythm shifts well between description and action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Changelings are familiar, but the historian‑skeptic lens, bonesetter craft as prayer, and tooth‑as‑bridge truce offer fresh inflections. The causal synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight. The “nostalgic innovation” tonal idea is distinctive and integrated. The ending eschews a fight for a poised negotiation, a non‑obvious, character‑true risk.</comment>
