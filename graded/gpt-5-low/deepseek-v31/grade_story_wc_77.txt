<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (break the curse) is clear and tightens under pressure; his embodied fear (“taste of ozone and rotting cotton candy,” raw throat, trembling urgency) reads specific. Contradictory impulses—terror vs. the will to write paradoxes—surface credibly in his micro‑choices. The advisor applies immediate pressure without stealing agency. The closing endurance (“not saved, but unburdened”) feels earned with a legible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: curse ➔ resuscitation ➔ advisor’s rule ➔ three paradox entries ➔ mirror implosion ➔ release. Closure lands on the page with cost via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the curse dissolves yet he exits merely unburdened. A persistent constraint (the luminance as time‑pressure beacon) shapes tactics. Slight convenience in the advisor explaining mechanics keeps it shy of 9+ but coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The funhouse is tactile and specific, with mirrors, podium, and decay integrated into action; the mirror becomes the battleground and swallows the fear. Sensory texture is vivid yet purposeful across smell, touch, and sight. Recurring objects (mirror frame, clasp, book) charge the ending. Environment constrains the confrontation without ornamental detours.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape scheduled death/fear) is signaled early and escalates coherently through each paradox entry, culminating in the final “Strength” note. Agency drives the turns; the advisor catalyzes but Elias must generate the contradictions. The “last ounce of will” frames a visible price. The tightening is singular but sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—fear collapses under self‑contradictory truth—emerges from concrete acts (the paradox notes) and reweights the final image (clasp becomes merely metal). Subtext hums in the repulsive allure/beauty of decay and the paradox of revival as ending. A brief explicit line from the advisor explains what the pages already show, slightly flattening the resonance. Still, the last walk into night lands with quiet, earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is steady, close third with a distinct sensorial lexicon that fits the character under duress. Prose modulates rhythm well, tightening during the mirror confrontation and easing at the denouement. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and pressure‑bearing. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is confident: vivid, economical images do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Occasional lushness (“cathedral of peeling paint”) stays coherent and voice‑true, avoiding figurative muddle. No loops or scaffold drag; cadence varies. Minor density in metaphor keeps it shy of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—resuscitation glow, cursed photograph, paradox notes in a dream dictionary confronting a mirror‑born dread—feels fresh and internally consistent. The funhouse mechanism and paradox tactic elevate beyond template horror. The advisor’s expository nudge is conventional but well‑integrated. Emotional truth (unburdened, not saved) resists neatness.</comment>
