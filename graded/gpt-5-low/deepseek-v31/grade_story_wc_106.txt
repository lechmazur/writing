<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (yearning to “press your ear against destiny’s door”) informs precise, character‑particular choices (the flower codes; the plea instead of a spell; the gantry leap). Interiority is sensorial and embodied, with fear and resolve coexisting under pressure. The contradiction is modest (awe vs. risk) but credible. No second on‑page relationship strand limits crucible complexity at peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: cues → infiltration → extraction → complication (constable) → reinterpretation → leap → charged poise ending. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she exits with the “moment” and assumes the cost of being its unworthy guardian. Orientation is crisp; scope stays within a single scene window. The price is felt more aesthetically than materially, keeping it shy of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Emerald Station and the gallery are vivid and purposeful: moonlight, the green copper roof, and the arched window/gantry directly constrain her exit choice. The jar and window together charge the final image with place‑specific texture. Sensory selection tracks urgency without tourist catalog drift. Excellent economy with no spatial hiccups.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (liberate and escape with the “illuminated moment”) is clear from the start. The constable’s approach credibly tightens options, foreclosing the flower‑coded route and forcing a riskier window/gantry leap. Agency drives the turn; the felt cost is exposure and physical danger. Pressure coheres to the final held‑breath beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: theft vs. guardianship, beauty’s liberation vs. complicity, destiny overheard rather than owned. The final image reweights the heist as custodianship, avoiding a tidy moral. A couple lines verge on aphoristic, but the scene work earns them. Resonance lingers through specific images (solar/lunar lights braided).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (light as motive, flowers as code). Rhythm tightens under stress without head‑hopping or register slip. No dialogue needed; the voice sustains momentum and tone. A few elevated phrasings flirt with purple but remain voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong line‑level craft: varied cadence, concrete verbs, images doing double duty (moonbeams as tool and theme). Minimal scaffold; no paraphrase loops; choreography is clean. Some lush metaphors stack, yet they remain coherent and scene‑bound. The closing sentence resolves by image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a thief of golden‑hour feelings, flower‑code espionage, and a jar of moonbeams used to decant light. Turns feel inevitable from seeded particulars; the final “unworthy guardian” reframes the caper. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, executed with confidence. Distinctive without gimmickry.</comment>
