<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (to chart a discovery) is clear and her micro‑choices (kneeling to decode, choosing not to call the captain) align with it. Interiority is concrete and embodied—heart hammering, tactile engagement with wood and glow. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle; she never wavers about sharing or the risk of being wrong. The cost is present but quiet (chosen solitude), which limits depth of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single, coherent scene under an accumulative/textural lens: glow appears, decoding escalates, coordinates reveal a void, then the phenomenon blossoms. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—her world and role reprice as “cartographer of the unseen,” with a felt cost in keeping it to herself. Orientation is crisp from the outset (airship, deck, hopscotch). The because/therefore chain is gentle but clean; pressure remains low‑stakes, keeping it short of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The airship, the weathered deck, and “stranded luminance” are vivid and functionally integrated; the old wood’s stored light enables the cipher. The hopscotch board and phrasebook are POV‑filtered tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and consistent in tone. The setting constrains discovery timing via glow, though not with hard limits, keeping it just shy of 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (securing and claiming a discovery) is clear, and escalation occurs as the cipher resolves into coordinates and the phenomenon manifests. The primary pressure is internal and procedural; there’s no counterforce or genuine risk beyond the moment passing. The refusal to summon others is a meaningful tightening with a personal cost. Still, the conflict remains gentle and never truly narrows options under threat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—solitary obsession, the language of nonhuman systems, and discovery as an act of translation—emerges organically through actions and objects (phrasebook, hopscotch, luminance). The final image reweights the premise: she chooses private cartography over communal acclaim. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the notion of learning “languages beyond human tongues.” Slightly quieter cost keeps it from a higher echelon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and observant, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by a mapmaker’s eye. Distance and tense remain stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm modulates well from methodical decoding to awe. A few elevated turns verge on lush but remain within the voice’s plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: precise nouns (brass, oak, murmurations), efficient syntax, and layered sentences that do multiple jobs. Occasional purple edging (“living rivers of shadow and noise”) is apt and controlled. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing maintain momentum. Not quite razor‑honed minimalism, but clearly publishable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—antique airship, stranded luminance, hopscotch cipher, phrasebook—feels fresh and coherent rather than assembled. The discovery reframes sky navigation in a specific, non‑obvious way tied to her vocation and solitude. Risks are tasteful and integrated; the closure’s restraint suits the concept. It stops short of revelatory risk because external pressure is low.</comment>
