<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Zephyr’s motivation is precise and coherent, and her renunciation—choosing to move despite a vow to master stillness—lands as a credible, character-driven cost. Interiority is particular to her vocation (listening, mapping, treating dust as archive). A touch more embodied stress in the climb/pry beat could deepen felt stakes. Still, desire, adaptation, and earned shift are all aligned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: failed echoes → bird-pattern inference → identification of the trapped pulse → physical intervention → restored resonance. Closure occurs on the page with the levered fissure and releasing wave, with a conceptual cost (redefining her ideal of navigation). A slightly clearer price (e.g., damaging the heirloom) could elevate. Orientation is strong and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bone-canyon acoustics and object ecology constrain tactics and enable the solution (fissure, resonance behavior, arrowhead use). Sensory specificity is tuned to sound and filtered through a skimmer’s priorities, avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment actively shapes choice at the climax. World rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake (restore the canyon’s pulse) tightens through a decisive deepening when the birds’ patterns reframe the problem. The final act is agentic and resolves pressure without coincidence. Cost is primarily conceptual and physical strain; a more explicit loss would heighten the sense of price. Tension scales appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: connection, stillness versus motion, silence as origin rather than absence. The final wave of “foundational silence” reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. One line edges toward direct statement (“to understand that everything is connected”), but it’s earned by particulars. The resonance lingers with a clean afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct acoustic lexicon fits the character and world. Rhythm flexes between contemplative and urgent beats without head-hopping. Diction stays coherent and voice-specific. Elision is minimal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; imagery is vivid yet disciplined. Repetition is motif-driven, not redundant, and syntax varies to maintain propulsion. No figurative muddle at peak beats; the final image is sharp. Minor opportunities remain to compress a few explanatory clauses.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise and execution feel fresh: acoustic navigation in a bone canyon, birds as topographic readers, silence reframed as source. Turns arise from grounded expertise rather than arbitrary magic. The arrowhead’s tonal-to-mechanical reweighting is elegant. Boldness serves clarity, not gimmickry.</comment>
