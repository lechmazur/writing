<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (finding where deleted files go) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (cross‑referencing, breaching encryption) align. Interiority is effective but mostly summarized rather than embodied; conflict between duty and risk remains implied. The “brightly attentive” trait feels lived, not merely labeled, but emotional texture could complicate her drive more. The final acceptance of a terrifying truth reads as an earned, quiet renunciation with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the breadcrumb sequence (numbers → date → archive → file 89) progresses cleanly to a conceptual repricing closure. The ending image reweights the premise (deleted = uploaded to an archival anomaly) with on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (“corporate memory keeper,” “Aethel Network”). Minor reliance on summary over dramatized beats keeps it shy of top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The hum of servers, glow of screens, and data vault specifics filter through Elara’s professional bias and set the tone. The scanned patch as a recurring object charges the final image, and the archive environment plausibly enables her tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, if more visual than tactile. Strong economy without postcard listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering truth versus corporate erasure and a nonhuman archive—tightens as clues concentrate toward the black box transmission. The reversal is knowledge‑based rather than confrontational, but the price (implicating the company and awakening a looming signal) is felt. Escalation is coherent and cumulative though largely investigative. A clearer immediate risk or trade‑off on the page would raise pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and corporate culpability emerge through particular images (timestamps, forgotten songs, the patch) rather than thesis statements. The final recognition reframes “deleted” as a metaphysical migration, deepening the ethical stakes without sermonizing. The “sensed absence” motif evolves from mood to meaning. Ambiguity lingers productively via the growing signal/call.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable third‑person limited with a cool, precise, slightly lyrical register that fits a data curator. Diction (“brightly attentive,” “curated”) matches POV plausibly and modulates toward dread at the end. No head‑hopping or forced omniscience; withheld material is revealed with purpose. A touch more idiosyncratic rhythm could heighten distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, compressed, and purposeful; sentences usually carry two jobs (world and plot). Occasional abstractions (“a masterpiece of omission,” “carefully constructed fiction”) are clear but slightly expository. Figurative control holds, with the “singing… downloaded” line delivering a sharp sensory turn. Minimal redundancy and good momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archival anomaly that “is data” and absorbs consciousness is a fresh turn, grounded by Fibonacci breadcrumbs and corporate secrecy. The patch and “echo of forgotten songs” give the concept a memorable texture. The investigative chassis is familiar but recombined with strong specificity. Risks pay off without muddling clarity.</comment>
