<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s fear is embodied and specific (the “cold, metallic taste,” the tightening chest), and her vow to “stand by the unremembered” credibly drives choices under pressure. The tunnel crawl is a clean micro‑test of motive versus phobia. Her conceptual shift—witness over data—feels earned by the translation experience. A slight leap in her rapid grasp of “phase transitions” trims the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, each step flows: tide window → entry → codex activation → trail → bulkhead → translation → decision to carry testimony. Orientation is clean by ~100 words and the clock remains live. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she foregoes data for witness with time pressure audible in the returning ocean. Cost is legible (abandoned data, endured terror, narrowed window).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cove’s “jagged teeth,” glass‑like accretions, narrow conduit, bulkhead, and undersea cables are vivid and tactically consequential. The tide window and claustrophobic geometry constrain movement and choices. The codex functions as a tool that reconfigures the room and path. Setting integrates with action rather than pausing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (answers/memory vs. fear/time) tighten through the crawl and culminate in the translation beat. The codex‑enabled path escalates coherently; the bulkhead forces a costly crossing. The closing choice to leave with testimony under literal pressure preserves consequence. Stakes remain personal but charged and do not deflate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of witness versus proof and remembrance versus official silence emerge from action, not thesis. The final decision reframes success as testimony, not data, without moralizing. The undersea cables’ “silent scream” and the unremembered as signal subtly widen the human/unknown boundary. Resonance lingers without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third is stable and textured; diction fits a practical, observant spelunker pushed into lyric awe by the codex. Rhythm tightens appropriately in high‑pressure beats and breathes in discovery. No head‑hopping or register slips. Lyric inflections are purposeful rather than showy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and action—with minimal scaffold. Figurative language is fresh and controlled (“a thought moving through a wire”); no muddled metaphors or loops. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the climax. Minor density spikes never blur causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Abandoned facility and cosmic‑horror edges are renewed by the codex light mapping invisible signals and the embodied translation. The witness‑over‑data pivot is non‑obvious and coherent with the setup. Risks in lyric science imagery pay off without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels particular and memorable.</comment>
