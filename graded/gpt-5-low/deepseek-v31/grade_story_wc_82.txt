<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and embodied—he seeks to transmute grief into a lantern for the lost shadow, paying with a piece of his soul. Interiority is textured via craft and sensation (“shattering sorrow gilded by the beauty of his task”). Internal contradiction is present but gentle (torment vs. beauty; descending while ascending), with little resistance beyond cost. The final acceptance feels earned through process rather than epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: loss → basilica recording (soul cost) → gem → transformation → lantern projection → reconfigured stance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with a concrete price (soul, fatigue) and a final image that reweights meaning. Orientation is clean early; the two-shard structure holds. Slightly low on external impediment, but the cost-driven turn suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful worldbuilding—the glass basilica, volcanic glass, floating tea gardens—filtered through a craftsperson’s eye. The environment supplies the unique mechanism (dream-recording lens) and the final image is charged by the lantern and workshop context. Sensory detail is economical and specific (thin, sweet air; twilight blue). The setting informs choices without museum-tour bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (making a vessel for grief) is signaled early, and pressure tightens at the basilica with the explicit soul-cost. The middle beat deepens through the labor of polishing and folding, culminating in a reweighted end image. Conflict is largely internal; escalation is gentle but coherent under a causal lens. The cost reads, though no turn opposes him beyond sacrifice and endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting grief through craft emerges organically from events and charged objects; no moralizing. The lantern’s “luminous torment” modulating to “luminous peace” provides a resonant answer to the opening void. Recurring images (shadow, glass, folding) gain new weight at the end. Complexity remains, as pain persists with structure rather than vanishing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent close-third focalization tethered to Leo’s sensibility. Dialogue is minimal but natural; the Keeper’s single line efficiently adds pressure and world-rule. Rhythm modulates well across ascent, ritual, and quiet denouement. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with strong verbs and concrete images; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple (“shattering sorrow gilded”) but remain coherent and purposeful. No visible loops or scaffold; momentum holds through the transformation sequence. The final line resolves by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dreams solidified into gems, grief polished into foldable glass, and a lantern projecting a shadow’s memory combine into a fresh, integrated conceit. The transformation is both literal and thematic without feeling gimmicky. Risks in tone and imagery pay off with a distinctive final tableau. Minor conventional beats (mentor-figure Keeper) don’t blunt the originality.</comment>
