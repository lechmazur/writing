<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “sympathetic skeptic” stance is clear and consistent, with a credible shift from analytic transcription to participatory reflection. Interiority is concrete (the entangled sensations of pressure, krill, grief), and actions align with his motive to create space for reflection. The internal contradiction—skepticism vs. wonder—drives the final decision. Cost is lightly sketched, with little on‑page friction beyond surrendering doubt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: whale songs → tile activation → richer memories → translation → reflective broadcast. Orientation is strong from the opening and the final broadcast produces a resonant reconfiguration (he believes; the song deepens in recognition). The because/therefore chain is coherent without mechanical plotting. The felt cost at closure is modest rather than sharply priced.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tower, dome, and sea are vivid and purposeful, enabling listening and later broadcast; the tile functions as a charged micro‑setting object. Sensory specificity (low‑frequency thrumming, stone vibration) is well chosen and POV‑filtered. Environment meaningfully shapes options (his location along the migratory path). Rich atmosphere supports the theme without overexplanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving/translating a non‑human emotional symphony—tightens toward the final night of migration. The escalation is a density deepening rather than a combative turn; the key choice is to broadcast the score back. Pressure remains coherent, but opposition is mostly internal and gentle, with limited visible price or foreclosed alternative on the page. The cadence shift lands, though the risk of interfering is not dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of empathy as structured resonance arises organically from particulars (tile, harmonics, communal whale acts). The ending image reweights prior material by making reflection reciprocal and audible. A few lines verge on telling (“their true song,” “he believed”), softening subtext. Still, the piece elicits a clean, earned uplift without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person limited voice is steady, precise, and lyrically restrained, matching Elias’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and inference remains within what he plausibly knows. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Occasional elevated phrasing is controlled and consistent with the contemplative tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are clear, with good momentum and multi‑tasking sentences; sensory detail often does double duty. Minimal redundancy and no disruptive scaffolding; figurative language stays coherent. A few abstractions (“profound kindness,” “beautiful symphony”) skim towards generality, but the concrete images carry them. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—magic square as translator of entangled whale memories in a stargazer’s tower—feels fresh and coherent. The reflective broadcast as mirror of communal empathy is a non‑obvious yet fitting turn. Risks are taken in committing to a quiet, accumulative form that resists melodrama. The piece retains emotional specificity over concept gimmickry.</comment>
