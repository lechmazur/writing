<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Aris’s scientific compulsion to “preprocess reality” collides credibly with emergent tenderness as she handles the wing, producing a lived contradiction rather than a tidy switch. Her micro‑choices (cataloging dust, returning daily, refusing immediate repair) embody motive under pressure. The final renunciation—leaving the roof open—feels earned and carries legible cost. A touch of reflective summary (“The dust was not a sign of death…”) edges toward tell, but it doesn’t undercut the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: dust observations build toward a conceptual repricing and a practical choice. Orientation is early and clean (who/where/when), and the mid‑turn (the wing discovery) redirects tactics. Closure lands on the page via the choice to keep the roof open, with the price (exposure, relinquished control) embedded in the final image. The cause‑chain is modest but coherent for the form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse isn’t backdrop; fractures, water stains, and the intact workbench shape what she can study and decide. The loupe and broken glass focus perception and limit tools, supporting the accumulative method. The final charged image—an open section of roof—reconfigures the space as a living conduit, not a sealed lab. Sensory and professional filters keep details purposeful and character‑bound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but concrete: control vs. surrender to ongoing change. Pressure coheres as the wing destabilizes her method and the daily dust‑study intensifies commitment to a new stance. The tightening culminates in the refusal to fix the roof, foreclosing a path toward immediate restoration. The cost is quiet but legible and tied to the environment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through specific echoes (neutron star decay mirrored in dust’s persistence) and is reweighted by the ending’s humble openness. The wing’s architecture reframes drama into continuity, resisting sentimentality. One or two lines risk explicit statement, but most resonance arises from action and image. The closure offers a non‑literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice blends analytic precision with lyric attention, consistent with a scientist under stress learning to see differently. The perceptual signature—“preprocessed certainty” versus loupe‑borne wonder—remains coherent and modulates with pressure. No head‑hopping or register slippage; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Rhythm supports the quiet escalation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with strong verbs and specific nouns (“nanostructured ridges,” “workbench,” “terracotta”). Figurative turns are apt and not overstacked; momentum is steady for a reflective mode. A couple of abstract sentences skim close to telling, but density and image‑work carry the load. The final line crystallizes prior motifs without flourish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of neutron‑star modeling with butterfly‑wing dust as an engine of grief‑work feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The methodological pivot from cosmic to microscopic avoids gimmickry and deepens character. The open‑roof choice is a precise, non‑obvious manifestation of the theme. Risks are taken in a quiet register and land cleanly.</comment>
