<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Leo’s contradictory impulses—hyper‑competent body under professional reflexes versus ocean terror—are dramatized in concrete micro‑choices (scraping glitter with a shell, planning the dive while nauseous). Motivation is clear and intensifies from deciphering the cast to plunging despite panic. The final shift (accepting fear as tool) is earned by prior beats and paid with visible cost (sobbing, gasping). Minor on‑the‑nose labeling of motive appears once but doesn’t undercut the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: betrayal → clue on cast → nautical decoding → dive → retrieval, with one transition (library to sea) and no dropped set‑ups. Closure lands as a decisive act and resonant reconfiguration; cost is embodied at surfacing. Orientation is firm by ~120 words (who/where/why). The causal lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rusted library and the ocean are vividly realized and purpose‑bound: the library frames the deciphering; the ocean materially constrains the climax and maps directly onto his phobia. Object‑as‑setting (seashell) also functions tactically and thematically. Sensory details are selective and POV‑filtered, with salt, corrugated iron, and murk serving pressure rather than ornament.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early (retrieve evidence/expose director, self‑redefinition), and pressure coheres and tightens as the only path leads into his worst fear. The key tightening is the deciphered location forcing a dive; the price is unmistakable on the page. Internal and external stakes interweave effectively. A direct antagonist is offstage but the engineered fear remains a live pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of betrayal, authorship of self, and vulnerability as power emerge through concrete images (shell’s whisper reweighted from lie to truth) and the chosen tactic (taking fear with him). A touch of explicit statement (“His motivation…to prove that vulnerability is power”) slightly blunts subtlety. The final image reinterprets earlier motifs without moralizing. Resonance lingers as a conceptual repricing of fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent close third voice with tactile, stunt‑professional perception anchors POV; diction modulates under pressure without leaks. Lyrical flourishes feel voice‑motivated, and compression during the dive is legible. No dialogue needed; narrative stance stays within what Leo can infer. One foreign‑character hybrid (“潮汐‑like”) is a mild register wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet vivid, with good rhythm and propulsion; most sentences do double duty. Occasional purple edges and a micro jolt in register (“潮汐‑like”) distract slightly. No scaffold loops or template cadence; action order stays clear. The final lines land cleanly without explanatory drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blend of a stunt double’s phobic interiority, a rusted geodesic library, and a child’s cast cipher feels fresh and organically fused to plot and theme. The “mentor’s betrayal” trope is enlivened by tactile specifics and the seashell’s charged reuse. The turn—acceptance rather than conquest of fear—reads inevitable in hindsight. Not radical, but executed with distinctive texture.</comment>
