<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear and rooted in vocation; her tactile relationship to trees and color reads particular. Under pressure we get endurance more than contradiction—little in-scene ambivalence or morally fraught trade-offs. Micro-choices (gathering essences, deciding to pour in her own hope/creativity) align with her traits. The cost is felt as soul-drain, but we don’t see a path definitively foreclosed beyond spent energy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught and held: gathering sensory “essences” intensifies into a charged infusion of the seed. Closure lands on-page with cost: the world’s gray remains, she’s depleted, but the seed hums and a fleeting brilliance reweights the stakes (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid). Orientation is clean from the opening and causality is coherent within the lyric frame. The final image credibly narrows future options toward stewardship of the charged seed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The waterfall parapet and mist aren’t postcard; they supply the exact energies she harvests, charging the method and the ending. Sensory detail is rich and POV-specific (moss as “cool, vibrant life”), with the sacred place functioning as a tool. The environment constrains choice—she comes here because it uniquely enables the weave. The final hum of the seed is inseparable from this site’s gathered vitality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens when the grayness pushes back and the tapestry flickers, forcing a deeper offer (succor) at visible cost. Stakes are singular and legible (preserve wonder’s color); the near-failure beat credibly escalates. Resolution stems from her agency rather than luck. The price is energy/essence spent, with the larger problem only partially relieved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship and creative reciprocity emerges through particulars—orchard craft, essence-gathering, and the choice to give rather than only take. The final charged seed reframes hope as a costly, ongoing duty rather than a cure. No moralizing intrudes; resonance lingers in the tension between fleeting brilliance and enduring pall. Subtext around art as care (pruning as shaping meaning) reads cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is steady, close, and confident; diction and cadence suit a lyric, craft-focused mind. Rhythmic control holds under peak stress without head-hopping or register slips. The narrative certainty stays within what she can sense or infer. A few elevated flourishes flirt with purple but remain voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum; images are vivid and mostly precise. There’s occasional density of modifiers and glow-words, but they don’t blur causality or the closure image. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs distract. Final lines are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard-pruner lens on a mythic “save the color” conceit feels fresh, and the mechanics of essence and succor are specific. The core idea isn’t wholly novel, but synthesis and execution elevate it. The charged, non-fix ending resists tidy mythic rescue. Further singularity could come from a sharper, idiosyncratic contradiction or cost.</comment>
