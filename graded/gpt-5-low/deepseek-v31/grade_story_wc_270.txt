<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—quietly evolving tradition—consistently drives her choices, especially the decision to decode and unseal. Interiority is specific (plant-murmur perceptions; the “burden and a promise”) but internal contradiction is mild, with little on‑page hesitation once the method appears. The secrecy about her gift and acceptance of enabling rather than controlling add texture. The final renunciation (to enable, not command) feels earned, though the cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: discovery → imperative → weeks of search → kite script → plant‑guided decoding → unsealing → release → resolution. Orientation is solid early, and the single‑scene flow with one ellipsis holds. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes tradition and her role with a felt duty to enable, not possess. Cost is present but light (relinquishing the “implanted destiny”); escalation is gentle yet coherent under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hot springs, steam, moss, and ferns are vivid and POV‑filtered, and they actively enable the decoding and the embryo’s revival (steam nourishing growth). Objects-as-setting (amber, kite, rock) are tactile and charged, culminating in the split shell in her palm against the mist. The environment’s specifics shape tactics and charge the final image. Economy is strong with purposeful sensory balance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether/how to unseal and what stance to take toward tradition) is clear and tightens at the kite‑decoding beat into the thumb‑press and click. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (wind) complicates but does not resolve alone. The price—letting the creature go and accepting an enabling role—lands but remains understated. Tension operates more as wonder than threat, which keeps the ceiling just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—tradition as living, not a cage—emerges from particulars (plant telepathy as living memory; decoding via natural forms; enabling instead of owning). The final image reweights earlier material, but overt statements (“some rules are meant to be unsealed”) drift toward moralizing and slightly blunt subtext. Still, the “seed insurgency” conclusion resonates conceptually with prior images. Earned insight outweighs the brief didactic tint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensorially precise; the perceptual signature (hearing plants as “soft murmurs”) is distinct. Rhythm modulates well from calm observation to the “sighing click” pivot and wonder of release. No head‑hopping or stance slips; diction fits Elara’s embodied, earthy perspective. The lyric register stays controlled without occluding clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful imagery, and minimal scaffolding. A few near‑summary phrases (“a burden and a promise,” “implanted destiny”) are slightly abstract but anchored by concrete action. No noticeable loops, muddled metaphors, or cadence templates; momentum is steady. The final paragraph edges toward thesising, but the image of the split amber and moss hum rescues it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Telepathy with plants used to decode a kite’s script to unseal an amber embryo at volcanic springs is an inventive synthesis. The release as “seed/concept” that reframes tradition feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric naturalism meeting quiet SF/fable) pay off cleanly without gimmicks. Minor familiarity in the “evolve tradition” phrasing keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
