<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her choices—pursuing the light, mist walking, and bracing the ice—align under pressure. Interiority is mostly embodied through tactile cold, breathlessness, and the felt ache for wonder. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely wrestles with competing impulses in-scene. The final renunciation feels earned but a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: glint → choice → traversal → discovery → collapse → improvised save → conceptual shift → departure. The closure lands on the page with both a decisive act (holding the ice) and a repricing of magic’s meaning; cost is visible in exhaustion and in leaving the system. Orientation is swift and stable; scope fits the length. The inferred lens is Causal and is held through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound spire, crevasses, mist path, and groaning glacier constrain options and shape tactics. The keystone and its glow charge the final image decisively. Sensory selection is purposeful, with cold, weight, and blue gloom narrowing perception in crisis. World rules (belief-stable arches, mist walking) are taught through action, not exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering sacred, unsystematized magic—tightens when the glacier cracks, forcing a costly, creative response. The reversal (imminent crushing) tests her commitment and narrows options to an improvised, risky tactic. Price is immediate (spent spirit, breathlessness) and seeds the larger renunciation. Pressure remains coherent and escalates once meaningfully at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Resonance arises from concrete images (the silver gleam, mist path, the keystone’s memory of sunsets) and culminates in a repriced understanding. However, several lines state the theme directly (“True magic wasn’t about force or efficiency...”), especially in the final third, dampening subtext. The final image still carries emotional aftereffect through “the light held.” Complexity is present but occasionally simplified by authorial assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady, with controlled lyricism that modulates under stress (terse during the collapse). Diction remains coherent to Elara’s sensibility, though at times drifts toward essayistic clarity. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm is varied and purposeful without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid, economical, and mostly free of scaffolding; sentences often carry dual duty (world + emotion). Occasional abstractions and thesis statements edge toward overtelling but do not obscure action or cadence. No major loops or metaphor muddle; momentum holds through the save and exit. Final line is clean and recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—automation vs. handmade wonder, “accommodated impossibilities,” and a keystone storing sunsets—feels specific and fresh. While the mage/keystone frame is familiar, the execution avoids template beats and grounds novelty in tactile stakes. The mist‑as‑path and belief‑stable arches are elegant reimaginations. Risks are measured and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
