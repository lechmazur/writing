<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive for silence is consistent, concrete, and forced into conflict by the eye’s seductive mono-focus. Contradictory impulses (rational forager vs. desperate seeker) act simultaneously in the storm beat. The involuntary truth trait manifests on the page and complicates her stance. The renunciation—use as tool not refuge—feels earned and forecloses an easier path with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene situational pressure coheres: rumor → orchard → discovery → temptation → calibrated refusal. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses a constrained tactic (momentary occlusion as trowel) over surrender to “a beautiful trap.” Cost is legible: she trades the fantasy of full relief for a narrow ledge of clarity tethered to another’s fear. Orientation is clear early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ravine orchard and storm are tactile and pressure the choice; the environment is not postcard—wind and hung trees mirror and constrain action. The glass eye functions as charged micro‑setting at the end, literally against her temple. Sensory specificity is purposeful (teeth vibrating, wind’s scream) and rule‑consistent. Setting charges the final image without over‑ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (psychic quiet) is engaged early and tightened by the eye’s promise vs. cost. The key turn is the recognition of the eye’s trap and the subsequent choice to use it as a tool, not a refuge. The storm beat escalates coherently and forces stance crystallization. Price is explicit: accepting an “endless scream” in doses to build true resilience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The piece interrogates safety versus stolen solace through concrete choices rather than thesis. Recurring images (storm, hanging trees, the eye) reweight at the end into a grounded ethic of cultivated resilience. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“This is not safety, it is a beautiful trap”), but the final action/image earns resonance. Ambiguity remains—peace is partial and disciplined, not free.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and specific, with a consistent perceptual signature (“rational truffle forager” filtering the world by utility and quiet). Elevated lyricism matches pressure without head‑hopping. Dialogue lines serve function and subtext via the involuntary truth ticks. Diction occasionally brushes register edges (“psychological safety”) but remains voice‑motivated by the premise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs and momentum; images are vivid with minimal redundancy. A few abstractions (“psychological safety,” “mono‑din”) slightly cool immediacy but don’t blur sense. Figurative density stays coherent under pressure; no paraphrase loops impede closure. Rhythm varies appropriately into the storm beat and the final quiet tactile act.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The empathy virus premise, a glass eye as singular mind‑occluder, and the forager frame synthesize into a fresh moral calculus. The reconfiguration (tool over refuge) feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in imagery and world logic is disciplined and coherent. Minor familiarity in phrasing doesn’t undercut the distinctive core.</comment>
