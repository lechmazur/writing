<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rio’s dual allegiance and “orderly intuitive” nature are embodied through choices—the covert graffiti campaign, keeping the stone chip, and agreeing to take the hybrid guild‑hall idea to the committee. Her contradictory impulses (bridge vs. resistance) act in scene rather than being summarized. Emotional texture is specific (the chip’s weight, the sensory dampening) instead of label‑only feelings. The cost is felt but subdued—risk to her position is implied rather than directly tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with causal backbone: Elias’s warning and the returned chip → graffiti execution → community uptake via the net‑mender → decision to carry the idea into official channels. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes resistance as guidance and commits to a tactic with stakes. Orientation and timeline are clear from the outset; the “survey tomorrow” adds pressure. The cost is mainly conceptual/emotional, but it’s legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The raft‑city carnival is vivid and integrated with action (graffiti on rust‑stained wall by the docks, tavern on the oldest pontoon). The foundation chip charges the final image and unifies past/future. Sensory detail is purposeful across modalities (light, sound, smell). While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it consistently informs them and the ending image resonates through place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—steering gentrification—is established early, with “survey tomorrow” tightening the thread. The escalation is a quiet deepening: the seventh mural elicits community action, producing a concrete hybrid proposal. The price remains soft (reputational/political risk is implied, not tested), which mutes peak pressure. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: not a wall against change but a channel to guide it; the murals’ symbols make subtext communal rather than didactic. The stone chip recurs to reweight belonging, and the final image marries legacy with negotiated future. One line states the thesis (“Not a wall… but a channel”), but it’s grounded in on‑page action and doesn’t collapse into sermonizing. The ending’s charged carnival music sustains resonance beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and textured; the perceptual signature (“culture shock absorber”) informs diction and filtering. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances the beat (the net‑mender’s “both” idea). Lyric touches are controlled and voice‑consistent. No head‑hopping or withholding artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with varied rhythm and economical detail; sentences often carry multiple functions (setting, character, theme). Figurative language is apt and not overstacked; repeated phrases are minimal and purposeful. The final paragraph balances lyricism with clarity. Minor sentimental edges don’t impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Graffiti as encoded community organizing within a floating carnival‑city being privatized feels fresh and organically earned. The bridge‑not‑barricade turn arises from specific particulars rather than a generic moral. The stone chip motif and encoded symbols add distinctive texture without gimmickry. Risk is measured but confident, and the synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
