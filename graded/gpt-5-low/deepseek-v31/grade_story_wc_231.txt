<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silas’s motive and methods are clear and particular (“curator of absence,” “observing gaps”), and his nightly descents and final relinquishment of the flower align with that psychology. The internal tension—devotion versus despair as interpretive frames—registers without overstatement. The brief relationship beat with the woman is understated but credible, with a clear status shift as he yields witness to her claim. Slight limitation: his struggle stays contemplative; few pressured micro-choices beyond the final offering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual descents build until a pattern break (the woman’s arrival) reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the act is recast from despair to navigation and he surrenders the flower. Cost is legible: he relinquishes guardianship of the riddle and accepts his role as witness, narrowing his path. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and set-ups (dock, flower, ritual) all pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse, mist, and opal dock are vivid and selective, filtered through Silas’s bias toward absence. The dock and nautical twilight genuinely shape cadence and stage the turning event. The Edelweiss as micro-setting/object charges the final image. Occasional lyric shimmer skirts symbol-for-symbol’s sake, but it remains in service to action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the gesture—is present early and tightens through the ritualized waiting. Escalation arrives via a meaningful pattern break (the woman), consistent with the accumulative lens. The resolution is earned more by persistence and reframing than by protagonist-driven reversal, keeping cost subtle. The felt price is mostly in renunciation rather than a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory, devotion, and witness emerge organically from objects and acts, not thesis statements; the “observing gaps” method becomes thematic. The final repricing—“not despair, but navigation”—reweights all prior images with emotional clarity. Subtext in the woman’s gaze and the offered flower avoids sentimentality. A touch of neatness in the explanation trims ambiguity but doesn’t cheapen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person close is steady, with a distinct diction that matches Silas’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but precise, carrying subtext and decisive information efficiently. Rhythm modulates well between lyric observation and event. No head-hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is controlled, with high information density and images that do double duty (the opal dock as tone and stage). Minor lushness (“curator of absence,” “milky, internal light”) remains coherent and doesn’t slow momentum. No loops or scaffolding; syntax varies and lands the final image cleanly. Figurative language stays consistent with the sea/light motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of forensic absence-reading with a mystical dock and a mountain flower at sea feels fresh. The reframe from suicide to navigational vow is earned and non-obvious. Risks are taken in tone and object-driven structure without sacrificing clarity. A familiar lighthouse frame is transformed by the method and final handover.</comment>
