<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—atonement through competence—drives every choice, and his interiority stays embodied in tactile habits (the labyrinth, the tapestry) rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulses (self-punishment vs. reengagement) surface credibly as he shifts from passive warden to active decoder. The final renunciation of self-torment reads earned by prior causality. Slight softness remains in the visible on-page cost at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: anomaly → decoding → plinth → keystone insertion → time resumes. Closure lands with both a decisive change (spell breaks) and a resonant reconfiguration (self-forgiveness). Orientation is clear early, and setups (thread, labyrinth, storm) pay off. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, keeping this just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: “woven hush,” gelid dew, the tapestry’s border as cosmological map, and the platinum labyrinth as micro-setting. Environment constrains action (plinth depression, frozen village) and charges the final image. Details are filtered through Kael’s chess-mind, avoiding tourist catalog. Sensory selection supports tension as the storm’s soundscape increments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres as the fraying thread compels decoding, with the thunder’s incremental growth functioning as a tightening cadence. The keystone choice is protagonist-driven and resolves the village’s stasis and his internal stalemate. The legible price is primarily internal; the external risk feels low, so escalation reads refined rather than perilous. Still, the narrowing of options and decisive act are clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The themes of guilt, skill-as-redemption, and mending vs. conquering are woven through objects and action; the final “mended a thread” image elegantly reweights prior motifs. Subtext of a strategist repairing his one misread rather than slaying a monster resonates. The explicit “He had forgiven himself” tilts toward telling, slightly reducing subtlety. Nonetheless, the emergent answer is earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third voice is controlled, lyrical without drift, and consistently filtered through Kael’s strategic sensibility. Rhythm varies well between hush and the click/thunder beat. No head-hopping or stance leakage; elision is minimal and purposeful. Lexicon matches the elevated, reflective mode while staying character-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high information density with images doing multiple jobs (tapestry border as world-rule and theme). Figurative language is sustained but coherent and not overwrought; minimal redundancy. Sentences move with momentum toward the central act. A few elevated turns risk purple, but they remain legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>While “frozen town broken by key” is familiar, the chess-mind decoding a tapestry’s cosmology and the micro-object keystone feel freshly synthesized. The “mend a thread, not slay a monster” turn reframes heroism in a specific, non-obvious way. Choices arise from character, not gimmick. The risks are aesthetic rather than structural, executed with confidence.</comment>
