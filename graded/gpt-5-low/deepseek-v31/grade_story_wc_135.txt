<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s goal is clear and consistent—restore suppressed truth and hearten the city—and her “reactively visionary” trait is dramatized when the memorial’s markings trigger her connecting leap. Interiority is concise yet character‑specific, with tactile ties to her vocation. However, there’s little on‑page internal contradiction or visible cost in her choice at the climax, keeping the arc from a higher band. The crowd/old woman response reveals her through action rather than summary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Hybrid with a causal spine: return → display → speech → on‑the‑spot discovery → accusation → communal response. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing plus a social turn, with the final touch‑ritual reweighting the object and the city’s story. Cost is implied (accusing old rulers publicly), but the scene softens risk via immediate acceptance, trimming impact. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single‑scene frame holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The harbor and post‑rain square are sensually vivid and filtered through a professional eye; details like “ivory quays” and puddle reflections build tone without stalling momentum. Crucially, the memorial’s inscribed angles function as micro‑setting that drives the pivotal discovery and charges the ending. Environmental specificity evolves with action (object placed on statue, public space as forum). Balance across senses and purposeful selection are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent and signaled early—win belief and restore a suppressed history—and pressure tightens when the memorial reframes the disaster as sabotage. The escalation is protagonist‑driven and changes options (from rumor to accusation), but the price paid is light on the page. The crowd’s swift alignment reduces resistance and diminishes felt jeopardy. Still, the turn meaningfully deepens the conflict from private conviction to public claim.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus institutional erasure emerges through objects, public space, and a communal ritual rather than sermonizing. The herald’s valve reconfigures from relic to indictment, and the memorial’s complicity sharpens subtext around civic memory. The ending’s tactile gesture (hand to valve, then heart) carries a resonant answer without stating a moral. Minor explicit phrasing (“reactively visionary”) nudges toward label but doesn’t undercut the organic build.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently focalized through Elara’s sensibility; diction and rhythm modulate well between atmosphere and discovery. No head‑hopping, and narrative certainty stays within plausible inference. Brief dialogue‑adjacent public address fits the register and advances action. The lyric texture never muddies causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful imagery. Figurative language is selective and aligned with sea/salt/stone motifs; few redundancies and no noticeable loops. Transitions are smooth and the final image lands cleanly. Occasional elevated labels are the only slight friction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The conceit of an “ocean‑spray archivist” and a single trumpet valve as civil memory spark feels fresh, and the memorial‑as‑cipher turn is elegant. The piece synthesizes maritime atmosphere with public historiography without feeling templated. The risk profile is moderate—subtle rather than formally daring—but coherence and specificity keep it distinctive. A sharper on‑page cost would elevate ingenuity at the peak.</comment>
