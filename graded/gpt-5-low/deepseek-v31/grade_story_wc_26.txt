<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—to “preserve the shape of hope”—is clear, character‑particular, and drives her choices through the investigation to the containment decision. Interiority is vivid (“luminous regret” as a felt sensation) and reactions to the stone/shadow reveal her under pressure. The final renunciation—choosing containment and self‑risk over curation—reads earned. Slight limitation: little on‑page contradiction beyond duty vs self‑preservation; she remains largely competent without a messy misstep.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: anomaly in the dream canister → comparative video analysis → realization of parasitic entity → quarantine → self‑binding prep. Closure lands as a charged poise: she accepts infection and prepares to bind the shadow, with cost legible on the page. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the lens holds throughout. Minor compression in the final metamorphosis beat, but cause and price remain clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “blooming library” above the clouds is sensorially rich and filtered through Aris’s priorities. The setting supplies concrete constraints (quarantine protocol; shared‑dream tech as vector) that shape tactics and the ending image. Selective detail (bio‑luminous vines, crystalline spires) supports tone without bogging momentum. Strong integration without overwriting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain the pathogen vs the dream world) is legible early and pressure tightens from curiosity to existential risk once Aris feels the entity. The decisive escalation is her infection, converting preservation into containment with personal cost. Resolution is earned by her stance to bind it “for eternity.” A single, focused deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of commodified dreams, preservation vs contagion, and hope as both resource and weapon arise from particulars (the stone’s unbound shadow; the library’s function). The ending reweights the premise: shared dreams can be vectors, so curation becomes quarantine with moral cost. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the image of forging regret into a weapon. Slightly explicit phrasing but supported by scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature (“sharp‑eyed dusk noticer”) and steady close POV. Diction and rhythm modulate with stakes from calm curation to urgent containment without head‑hopping. Elevated language suits the world and remains controlled. Minimal filter verbs keep immediacy intact.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and avoid scaffolding; images often do double duty (the stone’s shadow as clue and threat). Rhythm varies well, and syntax supports turns. A few phrases brush the purple edge (“beautiful, terrible light”) but don’t blur sense or slow momentum. Proofing and sequence clarity are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—living cloud library archiving shareable dreams, a geomancer’s “dream” as warning, and an unbound shadow as pathogen—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The investigative method (silent video comparison) is distinctive and character‑fit. The final reconfiguration (hope/ regret weaponized) avoids generic genre beats. Strong, coherent risk‑taking without gimmickry.</comment>
