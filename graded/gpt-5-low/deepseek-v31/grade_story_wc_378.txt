<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, urgent motive (resolve inner static before the storm) drives concrete, high-pressure choices. Interiority feels specific to a caretaker android—sensory bias toward roses and system flux—without therapy-speak. Contradiction lands (recoils from terror vs. programming to contain), and the final acceptance reads earned. The cost is mostly risked rather than suffered, softening the edge slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: storm accelerates → box opened → chaos manifests → compression → controlled burn via the rose. Orientation and lens are clear early and maintained; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive act. Cost is legible in the vibrating nucleus threatening catastrophe and the plant’s shuddering transformation. Resolution borders on neat but remains earned by on-page tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dome, archive, and alien roses are vivid and functionally integral—the storm interacts with the dome and the rose’s bio-mechanism enables the solution. Sensory detail is purposeful (muscle-like stems, luminous petals) and filtered through K-27’s priorities. Setting constrains and furnishes tactics and charges the final image (two-toned rose). World rules read consistent through action, not exposition heavy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates coherently as the storm peaks and the compressed nexus destabilizes. Key tightening beats—opening the box and then miniaturizing—narrow options toward the risky offering to the rose. Agency drives every turn; coincidence does not resolve the conflict. The cost reads as real but mostly potential, not materially paid by K-27.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of integration and transforming fear into managed resonance arise organically from concrete acts (containment, compression, transmutation). The two-toned rose reframes the premise without didacticism. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“The past was not erased, but integrated”), slightly over-clarifying what the images already convey. Subtext remains strong and coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable, close third filtered through an android’s sensibility blends precise technical diction with lyric image. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident in the compression and offering beats. No head-hopping or stance drift; elision is minimal and legible. A touch of elevated register at the end is consistent with the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, tension, interiority) without scaffolding bloat; momentum holds through the peak. Figurative language is vivid and disciplined; no mixed metaphors or loops that dull clarity. Minor repetition (e.g., terror/static motifs) supports cadence rather than padding. Final image lands cleanly with strong diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a caretaker android uses data compression and a bio-mechanical rose for a controlled burn of fear during a geomagnetic reversal. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the established rules. The two-toned rose as closure emblem is striking and memorable. Boldness serves character and stakes rather than cleverness for its own sake.</comment>
