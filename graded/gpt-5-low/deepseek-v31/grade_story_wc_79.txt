<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear, specific, and rooted in vocation; her quiet obsession and dread drive concrete choices (the descent and the whistle-blow). Interiority is vivid without therapy-speak, though internal contradiction is modest (purpose braided with fear rather than a sharp clash). The lack of an on‑page counterforce in dialogue limits relational pressure. Still, her final act feels earned by prior pattern-reading and legacy tool belief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: crack → descent → decoding → revaluation of the watchers → whistle command → course change. Orientation is crisp early, and the single turn is decisive with an on‑page outcome (the turtle turns). Cost is present but soft—risk and defiance more implied than dramatized consequence. Closure lands as a Decisive Change under a Causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The world is tactile and purposeful: moss‑draped shells, salt flats, and the heart‑chamber spirals are not decorative; they enable the pivotal tactic. The environment and a tool (whistle + shell mouthpiece) directly constrain and drive the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered (heat, resonance, calcium spirals). Rules are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redirecting a dying city) tightens via the crack’s opportunity and culminates in a high‑agency act. Internal dread vs. resolve adds pressure, and knowledge deepening reweights options. The price is present but underplayed—no immediate backlash or material loss shown on the page. Nonetheless, the shift in heading visibly forecloses the prior drift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resonant themes of forgotten knowledge and depth over distance emerge organically via pattern‑reading and the watchers’ redefinition. The final image (terror fused with hope in blinding dawn) offers a non‑didactic answer to the premise. No moralizing; insight is earned through concrete discovery. A slightly clearer on‑page cost would deepen the resonance further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled third‑person limited with lyrical precision suits the material; diction and rhythm are confident and consistent. No dialogue, but the voice’s perceptual bias (spirals, cartographic thinking) is distinct. Psychic distance tightens under pressure without head‑hopping. Elisions are purposeful and paid off in the chamber and at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; imagery is fresh and unforced. Minimal scaffolding, no looped paraphrase, and metaphors cohere with the world’s logic. Elevated diction fits the voice and never muddies causality. The final line lands crisply without purple overreach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>City‑turtles, pattern‑languages as navigational memory, and a reed‑whistle instrumentality synthesize into a singular vision. The watchers’ revaluation as invitations is an earned, non‑obvious turn. The piece commits fully to its premise; closure arises from prior particulars rather than a late rule change. Risk feels integral rather than ornamental.</comment>
