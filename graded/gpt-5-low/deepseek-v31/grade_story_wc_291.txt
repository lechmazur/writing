<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ellis’s prosopagnosia and methodical temperament create a credible internal conflict that turns when he touches the ribbon and allows feeling to temper technique. The shift from “machine of synthesis” to seeking the person behind features is earned and embodied. Slight neatness in the final self‑narration (“I drew who she was”) trims complexity but doesn’t undercut motivation. The cost—risking his reliable method and exposing vulnerability—is felt if understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (accumulative → causal at turn): the tactile contact with the ribbon triggers a because/therefore pivot that leads to a portrait the detective recognizes. Closure lands on the page with a reconfigured rule set—Ellis can “see” a face—while his limitation persists. Orientation is clean, and the two‑shard morning visit pays off the night work. Cost is present conceptually, though not dramatized as a loss beyond the renunciation of his colder process.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The studio over the misted quarry and the ribbon create a textured, purposeful environment that mirrors and charges the interior stakes; the mist pressing the glass at the end sharpens the final image. Details are filtered through Ellis’s perception with occupational specificity. The quarry doesn’t constrain action, but the ribbon as micro‑setting/object meaningfully does. Sensory economy stays tight and atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (making the portrait “true”) tightens when Ellis abandons a purely analytical tactic for an empathy‑led one, narrowing his options and committing to a risk. The decisive turn is his choice to integrate opposites, leading to external validation by the detective. Prices remain mostly internal and conceptual, keeping escalation strong but not punishing. Tension is quiet yet cumulative and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—seeing the whole person by unifying opposites—emerges through image and action (ribbon, quarry, mask), not just assertion. The final recognition reweights the premise: he can’t remember faces yet can truly “see” one, a resonant repricing. One line verges on thesis (“I didn’t draw what they saw. I drew who she was.”), but it aligns with the dramatization and doesn’t collapse into moralizing. Subtext around intimacy and anonymity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical cadence matching Ellis’s perceptual habits; diction feels precise without drifting into academic register. Dialogue is minimal but effective, with the detective’s reaction carrying subtext. The voice modulates at the pivot, softening with the new empathy. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are clean and efficient with vivid metaphors; rhythm breathes across paragraphs. A few images repeat or lean purple (“lance the abscess,” “mist… sleeping beast”), creating slight redundancy. Overall momentum and density hold, with most sentences doing dual duty (setting + psyche). Mechanics are sound and unintrusive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The face‑blind portraitist solving a cold case via an empathy turn is a fresh synthesis, and the ribbon as catalyst feels particular. Quarry/mist symbolism is familiar but executed with restraint and integrated into the arc. The final conceptual reweighting avoids a gimmick and feels inevitable. Not radical, but confidently singular.</comment>
