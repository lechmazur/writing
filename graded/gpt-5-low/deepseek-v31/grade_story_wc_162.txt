<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is precise and consistent—understand the “sacred thresholds” and find her father—and her fear/drive contradiction is dramatized (pausing at the archway, then stepping through). Micro-choices (reading the grain, deciding to cross) align with her temperament and escalate plausibly. Embodied responses (solidified air, crackling paper, deafening roar) keep emotions grounded. The change at the end—no longer lost, committed to finding him—feels earned and carries an emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal moves inside an accumulative frame): logbook → grain-decoding → insight about temporal thresholds → deliberate crossing into the storm-memory. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules are repriced (“map of consequence”), and she exits with altered agency. The cost is legible in the passage through terror (wind, screaming metal, seeing her father trapped in origin) and in accepting the burden of pursuit. Orientation is clear early and fuels the payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The Drifting Prism Terrace is vivid and integral; shifting light corridors and charged archways constrain path and choice. The environment isn’t postcard-static—it dictates tactics (intuiting routes, respecting thresholds) and charges the final image. Sensory choices are purposeful, with light, silence, and air made tactile; world rules stay consistent. Minor oddity (“潜在”) is a small line-level blemish, not a setting break.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (crossing the sacred threshold to confront the origin) tightens from hesitation to decisive entry. The key deepening is her decoding of the grain, which reweights options and narrows to one meaningful risk. The storm-memory sequence delivers a visible price (terror, exposure to the defining trauma) and confirms the stakes. Resolution flows from her agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Necessary distances” evolves from motif to governing ethic, reframed at the end as a “map of consequence.” The butterfly image reweights the premise without sermonizing; the final stance holds complexity—reverence and danger intertwined. A couple of declaratives (“He hadn’t built a maze…”) skirt telling but mostly crystallize earned subtext. The afterimage is conceptually and emotionally resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is controlled and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature (material-light metaphors, tactile silence). Rhythm modulates well between hush and storm; elision is purposeful. Slight register noise (“潜在,” “featherly”) stands out but does not break coherence. No head-hopping or unjustified omniscience intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is high-density and largely propulsive; images often do double duty (grain as weather code/history). Occasional purple touches and the stray character glitch mildly disrupt the surface but don’t hamper clarity or closure. Syntax varies; paragraphs earn their space with minimal scaffold. The opening and closing lines are strong, image-led cadences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—architected light-labyrinth as consequence map, wood grain as meteorological cipher, thresholds as temporal skin—is fresh and purposeful. The monarch as literalized butterfly effect risks cliché but is reframed through craft choices and the father-daughter vector. The piece commits to its conceit without retreat, and the final reweighting feels inevitable. Risks heighten coherence rather than obscuring it.</comment>
