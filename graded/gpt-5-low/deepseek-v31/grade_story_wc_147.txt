<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (rescue impulse layered over the desire “to harness the ephemeral”) are clear and drive credible micro‑choices under pressure. The crucial contradiction—weapon vs. unstoppering the vial—reads earned and character‑specific. Interiority is sensorial rather than diagnostic, though his flaw set beyond ambition/curiosity is lightly sketched. The stewardship acceptance lands with a felt cost but could cut slightly deeper into his prior self‑concept.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: call → temple → vial discovery → guardian → oxygen clock → decisive opening of the vial. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a resonant reconfiguration (from threat to recognition) and a conceptual cost (becoming steward). The oxygen alarm provides concrete pressure at the peak. The “civilization as library” insight arrives quickly but remains motivated by tactile contact with the vial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly specific and constrains choices (cold clarity, crushing depth, oxygen limits, stone dock, inner sanctum). Details are filtered through a diver’s urgency; the vial and the environment charge the final image. World rules feel consistent, learned through action rather than dump. The setting evolves with pressure (tremor, churn, guardian emergence) and shapes the decisive act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival vs. securing the ephemeral) tightens meaningfully when the guardian charges and the oxygen alarm sounds. The reversal—choosing surrender over combat—narrows options and forecloses a path with visible risk. External and internal pressures interweave coherently under a causal lens. Costs are legible but not brutal; the price is more conceptual/moral than bodily.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Preservation vs. oblivion, loneliness transformed by stewardship, and the ethics of taking vs. receiving are dramatized, not declared. The recurring “gathered hush” shifts from desolation to fulfilled purpose, reweighting prior images. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer through action and image rather than moral. Slight neatness in the “library of moments” frame keeps it a shade shy of the rarefied band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a controlled, aquatic cadence suits the material and holds under stress. Diction remains coherent to the POV’s sensibility; compression is purposeful at the climax. No head‑hopping or stance slips; perception stays anchored to Elias’s present. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple but maintain clarity and pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry strong information density with few redundancies; rhythm breathes and tightens appropriately. Figurative language is frequent but largely clean and purposeful; metaphors align with the marine/temple palette. Minimal scaffold and no loops dull momentum. A hint of lushness in early description is balanced by crisp action at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar deep‑sea/guardian tropes are refreshed by the memory‑vial “perfume” and the curator‑beast reframe. The decision to pacify by sharing consciousness rather than force feels specific and earned. The “gathered hush” motif and the tech‑meets‑relic blend create a distinct texture. It stops short of radical risk, but coherence and synthesis are high.</comment>
