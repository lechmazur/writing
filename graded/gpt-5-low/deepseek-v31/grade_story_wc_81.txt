<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—tracing honest origins—drives every choice, and his tranquil competence under blackout conditions feels earned and particular. The frustration → reframing micro‑turn gives him a credible interior shift without melodrama. Emotional texture is embodied (soundscape, touch of the stamp), if a touch cool. Deeper contradiction or a visible personal cost beyond intellectual stakes would push higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: blackout → need for light/tools → dead‑end shelf number → alternative hypothesis → stamp numbers → vault → charter. Closure lands as a decisive change in knowledge and a conceptual repricing of the city’s myth. The cost is primarily conceptual/social, not personal, but it’s legible in the final reveal of institutional deceit. Single POV and scope discipline hold throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sunken library’s pressure‑heavy hush and the blue glowstick are tactically embedded, constraining options and shaping discovery. The stamp and the iron door operate as charged micro‑settings that channel choice and culminate in the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true, with sound and weight under blackout conditions. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (verify the founding truth), and escalation coheres: the blackout and the false shelf number narrow options until the hypothesis shift. The key tightening beat—reinterpreting the ledger as pointing to a tool—feels earned and consequential. Costs remain primarily conceptual; a sharper on‑page price would amplify pressure. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is not coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of modest truth versus aggrandized myth emerges through particulars: the crude seal, the private vault, and the honest blot. The blackout’s “reclaimed stillness” reframes method as ethics, not just atmosphere. A few thematic assertions (“first draft…truest”) flirt with telling but are supported by scene work. The final image resonates without overt moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lucid, and quietly lyrical, matching a meticulous indexer’s perception. Diction maintains consistency and modulates with pressure (from expansive hush to focused inference). No head‑hopping or stance slips; inference stays within what Silas can plausibly sense. Slightly elevated register suits the setting and never clouds clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, action, interiority) with good rhythm and minimal scaffold. A few ornate phrasings risk purple but remain coherent and purposeful. No loops or mixed metaphors blunt the closure; information density is high without drag. Line‑level control supports propulsion through the investigative beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Archivist in a drowned library using an antique stamp as the key is a fresh synthesis executed with specificity. The investigative turn springs from character trait and object logic rather than gimmick. Emotional stakes are modest, but the conceptual stakes read cleanly and feel distinctive. Risks are measured and cohere without obscuring clarity.</comment>
