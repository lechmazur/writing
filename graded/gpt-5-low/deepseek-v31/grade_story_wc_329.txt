<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—to reawaken beauty—is clear and consistently drives his flight, tactics, and final risky act. Interiority is embodied (bone‑felt tremor, sterile air, copper coins) and his contradictory impulses (panic vs. insistence on beauty) play simultaneously at the peak. His choices escalate credibly: from performance to flight to a dissonant strike to sacrificing the locust shell. Minor mythic framing is concise and fuels present action rather than replacing it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: music triggers statues → run to the Warden because intent can signal → failed first attempt → shell sacrifice unlocks the DC. Orientation is solid from the opening and the lens stays causal through closure. Cost is legible on the page (shell destroyed, Warden self‑mutilates, city systems die). The decisive change is unmistakable as the statues shed stone and the city’s hum falters.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The city’s mechanical heart, sky‑bridge, and plaza with the sealed stump actively constrain path and options, dictating Kael’s route and target. Recurring objects (violin, shell) function as micro‑settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is balanced: subsonic tremors, soot, sterile hum, damp earth. The environment reconfigures at the end (verdant wave), directly charging closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving lost enchantment vs. capture/erasure) is signaled early and tightened coherently. The chase compresses options; the failed first attempt forecloses time and forces a higher‑cost tactic (sacrificing the shell). The Warden’s self‑uprooting provides a visible price and irreversible turn. Agency rather than coincidence drives each escalation beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of breaking free from imposed mechanism is enacted, not declared: the shell’s meaning transforms into action; the Warden tears out the clockwork heart. Art as intent (heart rhythms) versus mere sound deepens the inquiry into beauty vs. function. The final “resonantly soft silence” offers a non‑literal answer that reweights the world without moralizing. Complexity persists in the cost to the city’s order.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third‑person close remains steady, with lyric diction that matches Kael’s sensibility and escalates under pressure without slipping registers. The voice carries a distinct texture (“subsonic tremor,” “tarnished wonder”) and modulates at the climax into clipped, urgent beats. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Elision is purposeful and paid off in the realization about intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is taut and image‑dense with minimal redundancy; metaphors remain coherent to the world’s logic (brass automata, clockwork heart). Rhythm accelerates at action beats (“There was no time for a song”) and breathes at closure. A few elevated phrases push toward lushness but do not muddy sense or slow momentum. Final lines land with clean, precise nouns and strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Familiar steampunk/eco tensions are made fresh through specific inventions: intent as heart‑signal, the locust shell’s functional symbolism, and the Warden’s self‑extraction. Turns feel earned from seeded logic rather than late rule drops. The closing image synthesizes concept and character with crisp inevitability. Strong risk in marrying lyric tone to chase mechanics pays off.</comment>
