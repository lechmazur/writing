<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to store wonder in the cellar of reason”—is vivid and character‑particular, and her tactics align with her craft. However, internal contradiction and felt cost are muted; she meets little psychological resistance beyond quiet obsession. Micro‑choices (the mirror, mapping echoes) reveal a mind at work but not under real duress. The endurance change at the end reads earned but low‑conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: perception → investigation → reverse‑engineering → activation produces a clear cadence shift when the cavern sings. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant reconfiguration (“the land had been given back its hidden heart”). Cost is present but modest (time, obsession, the wounded season persists). Orientation is clean from the opening, with tight through‑line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The marble cavern, quartz veins, and acoustics are not mere backdrop; they dictate tactics (reflection angles, echo paths) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through a locksmith’s bias. World rules (echo engine, geology‑shaped resonance) stay consistent and are learned via action. The setting actively constrains and enables choices, elevating the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the mountain’s resonance—is clear, and escalation deepens through the mapping and reassembly toward the activation beat. The tightening is more procedural than pressured; risk and trade‑off feel low and near‑inevitable. The visible price is mainly time and focus; no live threat complicates success. The final turn is satisfying but gently earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—craft as a vessel for wonder—emerges organically from particulars and culminates in the echo’s return as a stored promise. The “cellar of reason” motif reweights the premise at the end without moralizing. Subtext of care versus decay is carried by image (polyphonic hymn, wounded season persists). Complexity is quiet but coherent and honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice blends precise craft‑lexicon with lyric observation, maintaining stable third‑person limited distance. Perceptual signature (peripheral focus, acoustic sensitivity) is distinct and consistent. Rhythm modulates well into the singing climax. Minor register spike (“tuned水晶”) is a small blip but doesn’t break POV integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are largely clean, dense, and purposeful with strong image economy; the closing cadence lands musically. Occasional purple tilt and one artifact (“tuned水晶”) nick the surface. Minimal redundancy; syntax varies and carries momentum. Proofing and clarity hold, especially through the technical middle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The echo‑engine premise, locksmith protagonist, and “harvest of echoes” synthesis feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The piece risks a calm, procedural lyric under world‑scale stakes and makes it cohere. Specifics (mirror mapping, geared timer, crystal resonator) avoid template fantasy. The final reconfiguration is conceptually original and earned.</comment>
