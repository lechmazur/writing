<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hira’s motive (to understand the donor heart’s narrative magnetism) is clear and drives concrete choices (three days tracking light, surrendering the wing, submitting to the projection). The internal contradiction—“watchful” craftsperson vs. “quietly explosive” post‑surgery impulse—feels lived and dramatized rather than declared. Interiority is specific to a dyer’s sensibility without therapy‑speak. The closing acceptance forecloses a prior path (self as singular author) with a felt identity cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence escalates by layered images (wing, sun trails, floating rock) culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: the donor’s narrative impulse reframes his quest from why to how. Orientation is clean and single‑POV; the closure lands on the projection scene with a discernible price (relinquishing sole authorship). The quiet stakes are clear, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: tracking “sun trails” constrains the approach; the floating rock tea house and its light create the conditions for the projection. The blue morpho wing functions as a charged object‑as‑setting, culminating in the wall illumination that reconfigures meaning. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered through a dyer’s eye for color. The environment shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on identity/integration; pressure coheres as he commits to the cryptic method, finds the tea house, and submits to the nonverbal test. The main tightening is the transition from seeking facts to witnessing a felt biography via illumination. The cost is subtly rendered (acceptance of a shared self), so while escalation is clear, it remains gentle rather than acute. No coincidence resolves the arc; agency carries it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of perspective (“iridescent caution”) and story‑magnetism accrues through concrete images and culminates in a non‑didactic repricing: the final shift from “why” to “how.” Subtext lives in the tea ritual, silence, and the projection’s choice to show “not facts.” One line skirts thesis‑statement territory, but the surrounding scene earns it. The ending lingers with a credible, complex reweighting of identity and perception.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a dye‑maker’s perceptual bias; diction and rhythm suit the meditative pressure. POV remains steady; dialogue is sparse and purposeful, carrying subtext without exposition. Narrative certainty tracks what he can plausibly infer. Line rhythms modulate well at the reveal without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑dense without collapsing into purple; metaphors (light, color, magnetism) cohere. Minimal scaffolding and strong verb choices maintain momentum. A few elevated phrasings approach flourish but remain clear and voice‑justified. The final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Organ‑donor identity explored through a ritualized, luminous quest is a fresh synthesis; the morpho‑wing projection is striking and memorable. The “story magnet” conceit gains specificity via craft (dye mastery) and world (sun trails, floating rock tea house). Turns feel earned by prior particulars rather than late rule changes. It takes tasteful risks in tone and image that heighten coherence.</comment>
