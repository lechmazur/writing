<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑specific—an artist solving a crisis through form, not force—and her agency drives the resolution. Embodied detail (tools, driftwood, knife) grounds her mindset. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from discovery to certainty with little doubt or competing impulse. The acceptance of long‑term guardianship lands conceptually but lacks an on‑page felt cost beyond exertion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: GPS failure → arch shelter → lantern slide revelation → reimagining → carving → restoration → renewed pact. Single scene holds together; orientation is early and stable. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (she inherits a role). The main weakness is the muted on‑page sacrifice; risk and cost are implied more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coastal storm, arch, and tool‑rich van are vividly integrated, constraining choices (seek shelter; use driftwood; work under gale pressure). The arch functions as both place and mechanism, charging the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful, especially the turbine‑hum motif that returns in the end. Minor lyric flourish risks over‑polish but never muddies space or rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stake—preventing the seam from closing—tightens via the slide’s warning and the storm’s urgency. A meaningful turn occurs when she reconceives fracture lines as a diagram and commits to building the buttress. The temporary “nothing happens” beat before the wood lights adds a small test of commitment. Cost remains light; the success arrives without a trade‑off beyond exertion and future obligation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: art as engineering of care, simplicity as answer to entropy, craft as interspecies covenant. Recurring images (slide, hum, arch fractures) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. A few abstract phrasings (“physics of faith”) skate close to statement, but they’re anchored by concrete action. The final gift of a blank slide neatly reprices her life’s trajectory.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in a maker’s eye. Diction modulates with pressure while staying in character’s plausible lexicon. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference reads as inference. A few elevated metaphors flirt with purple but remain legible and voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum and multi‑task—image, action, and implication often coexist. Minimal scaffolding; no evident loops or cadence templates. Occasional ornate vehicles (“petrified leviathan,” “physics of faith”) risk density under stress but do not blur causality. The final cadence lands cleanly with charged specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of driftwood craft with a time‑seam and lantern slide ancestry feels fresh and organically earned. The problem is solved through character‑specific intelligence rather than a generic spell or fight. Risks—quiet, art‑first resolution; nonverbal allies—pay off without confusion. Only the low on‑page cost keeps it shy of truly exceptional.</comment>
