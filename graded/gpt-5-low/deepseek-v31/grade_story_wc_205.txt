<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s drive is precise and particular—defunct revolutionary turned solitary reimaginer—and his micro‑choices (covering mirrors, holding the shard to storm‑light, translating via poem) align with that identity. The contradiction between craving proof and renouncing audience lands as a credible flaw. Embodied emotion is present via tactile ritual and object handling, not labels. The final acceptance of solitude reads as an earned renunciation with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ion storm and mirror‑covering narrow the lens to a charged revelation, leading to the poem‑method and a solitude‑tinged victory. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—he “wins” but at the price of being the sole citizen of his imagined world. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when). The causal string (storm → mirrors → removal of self → optics language → poem as proof) is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, visible threads of time, and ion storm are vividly rendered and functionally constrain choice (covering mirrors, using storm light). The shard operates as an object‑as‑setting that charges the final image. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action. Atmosphere supports theme without postcard cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove a civilization’s nature) is signaled early, and pressure coheres through the storm ritual into a revelation that alters options. The tightening centers on removing the present self (mirror‑covering) to read the artifact’s intent—a clear deepening with cost. External antagonism is offstage, but the internal conflict and philosophical stakes carry. The ending’s solitude is an unmistakable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of authorship, historical intent, and the cost of solitary vision accrue organically through mirrors, light, and the shard’s optics. The poem‑as‑method reframes scholarship as art, yielding a resonant non‑literal answer. A single declarative line (“His theory was not just correct; it was true.”) edges toward assertion, but surrounding images earn it. The final image reweights prior material with a lingering ache.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric voice is distinct, confident, and consistent with Kaelen’s mind—elevated diction reads motivated by character. Rhythm modulates with pressure (storm hush to revelation to quiet aftermath). No POV leakage or unmotivated shifts. Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density; images often do two jobs (world + theme). A few phrases recur (“burnished sorrow”) and the prose flirts with ornateness, but it rarely muddies sense or momentum. Syntax varies and the final line lands cleanly. No notable scaffold or loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—visible time, baroque asteroid, storm‑ritual mirror‑covering, optics translated into poem—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The methodological turn (poetry as proof) refreshes archeological discourse. Risks heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The vision reads authentic rather than stitched from tropes.</comment>
