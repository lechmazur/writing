<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s interior is specific and lived-in—her “historian of small gestures” ethic and crisis-actor past credibly drive her pivot from witness to actor. The boy’s sleeve-picking is a concrete pressure that forces her values into choice. The aid she gives carries personal risk and a subtle moral cost, not just sentiment. The before/after in her stance is legible without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal thread is clean: listening practice → anomalous sob → decision to intervene → concrete aid → reweighted final image. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: she “adds a piece” instead of only counting losses. Cost is implicit (risk in aiding a deposed guard and a reorientation of vocation) and present on the page. Orientation is clear early and the lens holds (situational with causal beats).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery’s acoustics materially enable the core turn—she hears what others wouldn’t—and the place’s aura threads the final cadence. Object and space interplay (chessboard, dust, dome) is purposeful and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent and the setting pressures tactics (low voice, directions, concealment). The environment charges the last image with earned reverberation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to remain a recorder or intervene under political danger—is signaled and tightened by the boy’s presence. The escalation is a focused deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate to length. The price is clear enough: exposure and redefinition of her mission; the discarded uniform becomes a charged token of risk. Tension operates at sentence and beat scales without deflation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of witness versus action, erasure, and the weight of “small gestures” emerge through images (sleeve-picking, pawnless board) rather than thesis. The final reweighting—adding a piece—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening premise. “Luminous absence” modulates from elegiac to warmed by risk, avoiding sentimentality. Ambiguity remains where it should: the boy’s fate and Elara’s future costs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyric but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s vocation. Dialogue is minimal, natural, and subtextual; the boy’s line compresses fear and status. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping or register shocks. Rhythm tightens at the decision point and relaxes into the closing image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: images carry multiple jobs and there’s little scaffold or redundancy. Figurative language is rich but not purple, and it tracks the physical logic of the scene. Sentence variety supports momentum and clarity at turns. Minor density in early metaphors doesn’t impede the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a crisis actor turned micro-historian in a whispering gallery, with a pawnless board as manifest, culminates in a humane, risky choice. The twist from counting to adding a piece is inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten coherence rather than decorate. Emotional truth grounds the conceit without trend-chasing.</comment>
