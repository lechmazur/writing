<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive and flaw (ambition curdling into impatience) are cleanly dramatized, and micro-choices—lining the pot with the burlap, reaching to move the plant, then refusing to move it—reveal values under pressure. Her interiority is specific to her sensory bias and craft, not generic. The final renunciation (sitting with the smell) is earned and carries a felt cost. Minor neatness in the epiphany edges toward tidiness but remains credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal throughline is strong: heritage cues → planting → anxious control → tactile contact → scent burst → choice to accept. Orientation is clear early, single POV is stable, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis with on-page cost (enduring the stench). No props teleport; set-ups (burlap message, seed’s legend) pay off. Slight summary in reflective lines doesn’t harm the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The setting and objects are vivid and filtered through Elara’s sensibility (treetop village, living bridges, herbal hut) with excellent olfactory detail. The corpse flower functions as micro-setting; its physical and sensory properties constrain choice at the climax. World rules are consistent and economical. Minor broader village features are atmospheric rather than pressuring outcome, but the plant and burlap do that work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding serenity within disturbance—is tested and escalates when impatience triggers the scent burst, forcing a costly stance. The tightening forecloses the “control/relocate” path; she renounces intervention and embraces endurance. The pressure coheres internally; no external antagonist is needed. Slightly smooth passage from shock to calm prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: rot transformed, patience inscribed, scent reinterpreted from assault to fact. The final image reweights earlier motifs without resorting to authorial exterior commentary. A few explicit thesis lines in the journal (e.g., “Serenity is not a separate state…”) verge on stating the moral, trimming subtlety. Still, the subtext of heritage meeting lived test resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close stays controlled, with a lucid, sensuous diction that matches an herbalist’s lens. Rhythm modulates well between hush and assault; the olfactory lexicon feels character-true. No head-hopping or stance leakage. Occasional abstract phrasing (“turning of the tide’s thought”) is lyrical but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with clean syntax and few redundancies; images are concrete and well-paced. Minor repetition (“journalize”) and a couple of explanatory sentences slightly dull peak tension but don’t stall momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent at the climax. Copy is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of corpse flower myth, family doodle custom, and an olfactory-centered serenity quest feels fresh. The scent-as-purification turn is grounded in action rather than gimmick. While the insight itself echoes familiar stoic frames, the specific integration of objects and sensory cost gives it distinctiveness. Risks are measured and coherent rather than showy.</comment>
