<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silas’s interiority is specific—his rasping laughter, ritual competence, and “shadowed elation” under pressure feel lived-in and contradictory. Motivation (guiding ships and shaping a new dawn) cleanly drives his micro‑choice to over‑amplify. The fearful awe at the end registers as a credible cost, though the price remains more conceptual than embodied. A touch more on-the-page hesitation or physical consequence in the peak beat could deepen the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: lens adjustment → beam behavior → storm herding → missed coup signal → public rechristening → Silas’s repricing of his role. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: he understands he can steer history and recommits with altered stakes. The “days later” shard is tidy and supports the turn without breaking the single-POV window. The cost is mostly moral/ontological rather than dramatized as loss, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Emerald Lighthouse, green prisms, and starlight wick are vivid, selective, and filtered through a keeper’s priorities. Weather and optics are integrated into action (the TIR moment) rather than toured. The object-as-setting (wick/prisms) constrains choices and charges the final image. Minor world texture (post-print era) supports tone without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake: whether and how Silas wields the lighthouse’s power during a monumental storm. The meaningful tightening is his slight over-adjustment that transforms the beam and raises consequences from maritime safety to geopolitical impact. Agency drives the turn, but the price is primarily internal—no foreclosed external option or evident loss beyond moral burden. Still, the end stance is clearly reweighted by that cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, the naming of events as power, and “ancient tools” guiding modern fate emerge organically from image and action. The line “He had touched the machinery of the world, and the world had turned” resonates as earned insight, not moral. The final ascent with renewed intent reframes the lighthouse as an ethical instrument. Ambiguity lingers productively about responsibility and hubris.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, salt-and-ozone lyricism that matches Silas’s mind. Diction and rhythm shift appropriately as pressure rises, especially during the optics revelation and the storm-lancing beat. No head-hopping or register breaks; the single shouted line fits voice and serves plot. Occasional elevated phrasing stays character-credible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work (setting, action, theme) without sludge; rhythm varies and momentum holds. Figurative language is controlled and anchored to concrete optics and weather, avoiding mixed metaphors. No notable loops or scaffold; transitions are efficient. A few lush lines flirt with purple but remain legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The starlight wick and physics-forward magic of total internal reflection feel fresh, as does the political ricochet of a joking name. The synthesis of craft detail with mythic consequence reads inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its premise without hedging or late rule cheats. Risk is focused and coherent rather than ornamental.</comment>
