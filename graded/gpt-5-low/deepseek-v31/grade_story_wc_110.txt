<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and consistent, with a credible moral conflict sharpened by the lens discovery and the choice to burn the logbook. Micro‑choices (pulling the donor file, using the lens, not making a copy) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The renunciation costs her professional creed, which reads on the page. A slight tilt toward didactic self‑justification in the last lines tempers the complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: delivery → lens → discrepancy → misfiled logbook → lens decodes → incineration. Closure lands decisively with visible cost (destroying the record), and the choice reconfigures her role. Orientation is early and stable; scope fits the length with one tight transition. Minor convenience (perfect lens reveal, handy incinerator) is plausible within the established world and doesn’t undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and object are exquisitely integrated: rain, crystalline forecourt, and climate‑controlled vaults shape tone and tactics. The projector lens functions as a micro‑setting tool that constrains knowledge and charges the final image. The incinerator in the forecourt directly enables the climactic act. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Anya’s archivist sensibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mercy vs. institutional truth) tightens from curiosity to an ethical crisis, culminating in an irrevocable act. The lens discovery escalates pressure by converting suspicion into condemning proof, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the destruction and the abandonment of archival duty. The conflict remains internal, but the moral calculus is clear and tense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of truth, mercy, and the ethics of record‑keeping emerge organically via concrete images (the lens as clarity/ distortion). The finale slightly overstates a moral (“recording only that which healed, not that which harmed”), dulling subtext. Still, the final reweighting—honesty of conscience over archival veracity—lands. The piece invites reflection without requiring extra scaffolding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third‑person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and character‑specific, with a precise curator’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates effectively from hushed observation to charged decision. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; elisions are purposeful and paid off. A few elevated turns flirt with sentiment, but remain within voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and do multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, plot). Figurative language is elegant and mostly controlled, with minimal redundancy. Syntax varies to match pressure and maintains clarity in the climactic sequence. Occasional abstract phrasing in the final paragraph softens the edge but does not impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Archive of Spoken Words and the projector lens as moral instrument feel fresh. The ethical turn—destroying evidence in the name of mercy—reads inevitable in hindsight given her values and the donation context. Risks (quiet, interior climax; lyrical tone) pay off coherently. Not revolutionary, but distinct and memorable.</comment>
