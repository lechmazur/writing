<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and sustained, and her micro-choices (venturing to the cathedral; deciding to reinvent rather than merely repair) align with a coherent interior drive. The grandmother/postcard thread personalizes the want and reframes the emptiness. However, internal contradiction is muted; the reckoning arrives cleanly, with limited on‑page ambivalence or cost in the decision moment. The emotional shift feels earned yet tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal progression is tight: patron’s hint → cathedral test → light reveals etching → return and recompose the mural. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with emotional cost (reinterpreting abandonment, relinquishing the “repair” plan). The two‑shard structure is clean, with clear anchors and one meaningful turn. The sunbeam is a coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves without her interpretive act and choice to repaint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly particular (amber pavilion, derelict cathedral, mist, angled sunlight), filtered through an artist’s eye. The cathedral’s glass and the need for strong light functionally constrain discovery, and the pavilion frames the final charged image. Sensory selection is purposeful and thematic without museum‑tour excess. A hair short of 9+ only because the environment nudges choice more than it forces a tactical trade‑off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (answer the nocturnal bloom/emptiness) escalates from inquiry to test to revealed pattern, with her agency at the open and close. The tightening arrives at the beam/etching discovery, reweighting her options from repair to reinvention. Cost is primarily internal and conceptual; tangible loss or refusal is light. Pressure remains coherent and grows under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of hidden forces, inheritance, and night‑blooming accrue through concrete images (postcards, stamps as distant blooms, etched moon‑pull). The final choice reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though the explanatory sentence about why flowers bloom at night borders on explicit thesis. The grandmother thread smartly reframes absence as guidance. Resonance lingers through the charged final embrace of pavilion and mural.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical, painterly lexicon that suits Elara’s perception. Rhythm modulates well across discovery and resolution without head‑hopping. Elevated diction feels voice‑motivated rather than imposed. A few grand formulations skate near overstatement but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and integrated imagery. Some purple strain (“celestial map of gravitational love,” “umbral tenderness”) risks excess but doesn’t blur sense. No paraphrase loops or scaffold drag. Momentum is steady through pivots.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cathedral optics, lunar pull on sap, and postcards as tidal messages feels fresh and emotionally true. The revelation via hidden etchings is familiar in shape but made specific by the gravitational metaphor and inherited longing. The final reconfiguration is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are tasteful and coherent, not gimmicky.</comment>
