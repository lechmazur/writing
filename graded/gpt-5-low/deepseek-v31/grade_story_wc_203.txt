<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Leo’s vocation, rule against engagement, and compulsion to look up create a credible internal conflict that culminates in a costly, value‑driven choice. Embodied perception (dust as timeline, elevator tech eye) grounds his motives. The renunciation of his “never engage” rule reads earned and specific, not generic. Minor safety: the choice carries emotional cost, though practical repercussion remains mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: silence → observation → ghost’s cue → ceiling panel → mainspring → vision → decision to speak. Closure lands on the page with cost (breaking a protective rule) and an immediate effect (the girl’s release). Stakes are coherent and narrow. The horological vision is a single rule‑bending beat that’s internally consistent with his ghost‑seeing premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned circus office is vividly realized across senses (old paper, popcorn, dust) and shapes action (ceiling access, desk drag, panel). The mainspring barrel and the ceiling function as object‑as‑setting that charge the final image and constrain choice. Professional perception filters details with purpose. Atmosphere and world rules stay consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to engage and witness) tightens as discovery reweights the moral calculus. The decisive turn—speaking to the girl and promising testimony—forecloses his prior stance. Cost is emotional and principled, not merely procedural. Pressure escalates once, appropriately for the length, via the vision that reconfigures stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around façades/cracks, hidden mechanisms, and the ethics of witnessing; the final image reweights prior material without moralizing. The “weightless burden” reframes ghost‑seeing and is released through truthful acknowledgment. The automaton/mainspring metaphor deepens meaning without shouting. Complexity is preserved in the cost of breaking his rule.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature—technical lexicon (“sheave wheel,” “guide rails”) braided with lyric observation—stays consistent. POV certainty fits what he can infer; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates effectively at the turn (vision → statement). Dialogue is minimal yet charged, functioning as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled and vivid with efficient, multi‑tasking sentences and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is dense but disciplined and scene‑bound. No notable loops or cadence templates dull momentum. A few lush phrases flirt with excess but do not blur action or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an elevator tech ghost‑seer reading dust strata in a circus ticket office and retrieving a mainspring that unlocks a moral repricing. The trope of helping a ghost find release is renewed through specific craft and tools. Turns feel earned by character rather than engineered. Not radically experimental, but confidently singular.</comment>
