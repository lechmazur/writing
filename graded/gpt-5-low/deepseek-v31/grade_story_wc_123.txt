<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—integrity in solitude—drives clear, escalating choices from measured routine to a risky act of whistleblowing. Interiority is specific (breath control, sensory vigilance) and her curiosity credibly overrides fear. The internal conflict (safety vs. truth) is present if a bit tidy; she solves quickly with high competence. The final act forecloses safety with a felt cost (waiting for footsteps).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: being followed intensifies alertness; the pigeon’s message triggers analysis; the deduction reframes prior “storms”; she redirects the report to a news hub. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she commits to exposure and accepts risk, concretized by releasing the bird and then waiting. A minor convenience is the swift permit cross‑reference, but it doesn’t undercut coherence or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The courtyard, high wall, dusk light, and raked gravel are vivid and functional, shifting from sanctuary to “command center.” Tools (tripod device, pigeons) are integrated, enabling the plan and charging the final image of stars above the wall. Sensory selection is restrained and purposeful, filtered through a professional observer.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the lie vs. preserve safety—is clear early and tightens with the follower, the urgent note, and the realization of exploitation. The decision to bypass official channels narrows options and carries a visible price. Tension is coherent without theatrics; the quiet escalation suits the piece’s scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Integrity versus systemic deceit emerges through actions and recurring storm imagery; her vocation becomes the ethical stance. The final image (“quiet beat of wings,” listening for footsteps) resonates without moralizing. One line (“The truth was her weapon”) skews a touch declarative, but subtext largely carries the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a distinct observational cadence that fits a meticulous recorder. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, maintaining clarity without over‑explaining. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference is framed as inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, economical, and propulsive with good image economy (“layered” quiet recurs purposefully). Minor risk of repetition in “layered” and a couple of abstract intensifiers, but momentum holds. Syntax varies and supports the scene’s breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dystopian cover‑up is familiar, but the angle—a solitary storm recorder using pigeons and data to pierce a quarantine ruse—feels fresh. The lateral, pattern‑finding mind applied to political deceit is a smart synthesis. It’s thoughtful rather than radical in risk.</comment>
