<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (find the withheld truth/Aris) is crisp and persistently enacted, and her professional lens (“sensory map maker,” redirect mastery) colors perception and choice. Interiority is specific and embodied (rusted gantries, cyclic resonance) rather than generic. However, contradictory impulses are limited; she rarely wavers under pressure, which softens the crucible. The final commitment reads earned but not hard-won by competing values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: shard → peak cycle → targeted weave → Aris scene → reprice of shard as anchor → decision to act. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise with visible cost (bearing Aris’s sacrifice), and the who/where/when are anchored early. Minor tell-y compression in the final third explains mechanics rather than dramatizing them, but it doesn’t break causality. The single-scene scope with one vision-shard works at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The derelict spaceport repair bay is vivid and filtered through vocation; overlays and rusted gantries create an integrated, tactile atmosphere. The green shard functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Environment influences perception more than it constrains choice, keeping this just shy of the top band. World rules feel consistent and learned through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/Aris) is signaled early; pressure tightens with the cycle peak and the vision, culminating in a reweighted mission. The decisive deepening arrives via the Aris confrontation and the “anchor” revelation. On-page opposition is largely observational, with little direct risk or trade-off beyond burden, keeping escalation measured rather than gripping. The final stance crystallizes credibly, not explosively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice, inheritance, and the ethics of withholding emerges organically from particulars (the redirect as love/price). The shard’s revaluation from compass to anchor is a strong thematic turn, reframing agency and duty. The ending resists moralizing while providing a resonant answer: the weight is the purpose she must carry. Subtext in “anchor” and the redirected shard avoids thesis-speak.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains a coherent, character-specific lexicon; the observational texture suits a map maker’s mind. Rhythms modulate well between lyric description and sharper pressure at the vision. No head-hopping or stance leakage; inference reads as inference. Slight elevation in diction is voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with high information density and purposeful imagery; lines tend to do multiple jobs. Occasional purple edges (“spaces between atoms,” “symphony of rust and silence”) skirt excess but remain legible and voice-true. Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable loops, with clean syntax and momentum into closure. Final line lands cleanly without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>While multiverse/anchor tropes are familiar, the “sensory map maker” angle and redirect-as-ethic feel specific and thoughtfully synthesized. The shard’s causal and thematic double duty elevates freshness. Emotional truth (inherited burden vs. protection) grounds the concept. Not a radical reinvention, but confidently distinctive.</comment>
