<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Arawn’s solitude, involuntary truthfulness, and fear of the box create a credible inner life that informs his choice between power and bees. The riddle prompts small, purposeful micro-choices that reveal competence under pressure. The final act aligns with his values (wonder over function) and bears a visible cost. Internal contradiction is present but mild; he resolves quickly without deep destabilization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: blackout → silence of hives → diagnostics → riddle → hidden reserve → forced trade‑off → action → charged coda. Closure is a decisive choice with cost (foregoing city reboot to revive hives) and a resonant final image (empty box, honey scent). Orientation is crisp early, and the drive lens (Causal) holds to the end. No plot amnesia or convenience undercutting the choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower’s conductor and grounding plate physically constrain the search and make the discovery/choice possible; the transmitter and lantern charge the final image. Sensory specificity—“nectar dusk,” hum of hives, the iron skeleton—serves both mood and function. World rules (lightning capacitors, auxiliary grid) are learned through action. The honey smell and lantern reprise setting and theme with precision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (city’s survival systems) with one meaningful tightening: the battery permits only one restart path. The ethical calculus (food vs. light) is sharp and resolved through protagonist agency with a tangible price. Escalation is steady rather than twisty, but the narrowing of options is unmistakable. The hum’s return provides felt relief while the larger loss remains.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Wonder versus function is dramatized, not preached: the bees’ hum and the empty box’s honey scent reweight the premise. The grandfather’s bequest and Arawn’s candid nature embed subtext around trust, fear, and earned meaning. The final image offers a non‑literal answer—wonder preserved through choice, not content—without moralizing. Complexity persists: he saves life at the cost of light, and the cost lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (“nectar dusk,” iron skeleton) that holds under pressure. The brief spoken truths feel character‑specific and functional. Rhythm modulates well between description and action; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Diction stays coherent with the world’s tone and Arawn’s perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive lines with vivid yet purposeful imagery; minimal scaffolding. Metaphor density is present but controlled, rarely tipping into purple. No notable loops or template cadence; information density is high. The final sentence lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a lightning‑harvesting tower, drone hives as municipal lifeblood, and a riddle‑guided reserve battery leading to an ethical trade‑off. The lacquer box’s empty reveal with honey scent is a memorable, non‑obvious turn. While elements echo genre traditions, they cohere into a singular stance. Risk is measured and effective without gimmickry.</comment>
