<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aveline’s drive—to seek closure by reopening wounds—plays out in concrete, character‑specific ways (coffee rings as micro‑reading, scars as macro‑text). Contradictory impulses coexist: compulsion to probe vs. the migraine‑like cost of plant telepathy. The displaced miracle revelation credibly reconfigures her belief and leads to the earned, risky act of unwrapping. Emotions are embodied (throb, tremble, shake) and choices align with motive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal middle (the plant‑tunnel) culminating in a Conceptual Repricing/RR. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who/where/when). The closure lands: scars revalued as seals, with the cost legible in pain, shaking, and the surrendered belief in perfect miracles. The hourglass’s emptied state and careful unwrapping provide a charged cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower at dawn, the cup, the ivy, and the hourglass are vivid and purpose‑driven; details are filtered through her sensibility. Micro‑setting (body/arm, bandages, hourglass) charges the final image and shapes the temporality of her choice. Plant presence isn’t ornamental; it’s the sensory network enabling the descent. Atmosphere (“meteor hush”) coheres and deepens rather than decorates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling with the new scar—tightens through the tunnel and revelation that the miracle escaped her. The cost rises from physical pain to existential absence, culminating in a small but meaningful act (unwrapping) that risks confronting truth. Escalation is internal but coherent and cumulative; no soft reset. Slightly quiet on external pressure, yet the internal trade‑off is clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of healing vs. wounding, attention vs. displacement, and the revaluation of scars are dramatized, not preached. Recurrent images (coffee ring, hourglass, ivy, scars) shift meaning at the end without tidy moralizing. The final sprout‑thought reframes miracle as attention, not acquisition, delivering resonance. No thematic overstatement undercuts the subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyrical voice with a distinct perceptual bias (objects as texts, plants as choir). Psychic distance modulates smoothly from tactile present to visionary tunnel without leakage. Diction stays coherent and character‑plausible; no head‑hopping. Elision patterns are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, rhythmically varied, and information‑dense; metaphors are purposeful and consistent (tide, tunnel, meteor hush). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences do more than one job. A few rich images stack but stop short of purple, maintaining clarity at the peak. Final image is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Telepathy with plants as a sensory conduit to a surgery’s “displaced miracle” is fresh and organically tied to character. The coffee‑ring micro‑method refracts the macro‑theme; the hourglass lends temporal texture without gimmickry. The turn (scars as seals of healing) feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold choices heighten coherence while remaining legible.</comment>
