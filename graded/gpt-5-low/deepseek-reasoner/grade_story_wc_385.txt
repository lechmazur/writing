<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her perceptual talent informs choices moment to moment. Interiority is vivid (reading echoes, the “reed‑blown melancholy”) but internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely hesitates or pays a personal cost beyond solitude. The merchant functions as an external foil more than a relational crucible. The final action aligns with her established traits and lands credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: shell warning → star‑arch → shadow path → confrontation → song that restores echoes. Orientation is secure by the first paragraph, and the lens holds to a decisive on‑page act with conceptual repricing (echo as soul‑truth). Cost is legible, though borne mostly by the antagonist. The progressive‑disclosure mechanic structures the middle without stalling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is sensuous and functional: star alignment, shadow‑weaving, and the amphitheater shape tactics and aim the climax. The seashell as tool folds into the environment’s acoustics; the canyon’s “hum” charges the final image. Sensory selection reflects Lyra’s profession and urgency. A strong integration that avoids postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (prevent soulsong theft; verify the warning) and tighten once at the amphitheater. The escalation is mostly guided rather than resisted; Lyra faces little risk or loss, and the scheme collapses swiftly once she sings. Still, the turn to use the shell as an instrument is a credible agency beat. The antagonist’s confession compresses pressure but remains functional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (echo, hum, webs, starlight) cohere into a clear thematic statement about truth answering truth. The final paragraph articulates the thesis a bit directly (“She had learned why some people echo”), dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the restored echoes streaming back provides earned emotional charge. Moral complexity is modest but consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyric, and consistent with a perceptual focalizer attuned to sound and pattern. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and distinct in register from narration. Rhythmic control is strong without head‑hopping or stance slips. Occasional high diction matches the mythic register established early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: vivid imagery, varied sentences, and purposeful figurative language. A few phrases edge toward purple, but they serve tone and do not obscure clarity. Momentum holds through transitions; little scaffold or repetition. The closing image resolves cleanly without summary bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The canyon echo singer premise, seashell oracle, and shadow‑woven webs feel fresh in combination. The progressive‑disclosure quest mechanic is familiar but enlivened by the acoustical world‑logic and final sonic act. The antagonist’s motive (hollow echo → theft) is tidy yet thematically apt. Overall, an original synthesis with confident execution.</comment>
