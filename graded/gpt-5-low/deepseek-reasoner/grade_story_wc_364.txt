<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (find Kael without melodrama) is clear and enacted through methodical prep and a calm, risky solution. Interiority is concrete in craft details and controlled breath, though true contradictory impulses (fear vs. resolve) are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in the peak moment. The choice to refuse the lichen’s bargain and improvise a puppet reads character‑true. The cost is modestly felt—she loses the silk and risks failure—but the stoic register avoids overstatement.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—preparation → descent → discovery → bargain → workaround—and the chain holds cleanly. Closure is a decisive change: Kael is freed; the price is the sacrificed silk and a narrowly averted self‑sacrifice. Orientation is crisp and uninterrupted, and set‑ups (silk, maps, hunger of the lichen) pay off. Cost is legible on the page, though not devastating, fitting the scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The world is striking and specific (orchard planet, silver leaves, floating arches) and the subterranean micro‑setting constrains action and solution. The magician’s silk and the lichen’s rule set meaningfully shape the final tactic and image. Sensory selection aligns with a blacksmith’s eye for tools and structure. The ribbon of sky and blue sheen charge the ending with place‑tied resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save Kael without surrendering her mind—is signaled early and tightened by the “terrible bargain.” Escalation is coherent: the discovery reframes the problem; the workaround demands ingenuity and a real forfeit. Pressure growth is steady rather than jagged, but the moral calculus sharpens credibly at the core turn. The resolution is earned by her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of resilience, barter, and refusal emerge through image and act rather than declaration; “azure defiance” reweights the final image. The world’s slow death and the lichen’s hunger mirror the cost of survival without sermonizing. The brother‑sister bond is rendered in silence, letting subtext carry. A touch more ambiguity about the lichen’s lingering threat could deepen aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third‑person limited is steady, with a measured, tactile diction that fits a meek, meticulous blacksmith. Rhythm modulates from preparatory calm to tensile focus in the cavern. No head‑hopping or register slips, and elision is purposeful. The lyric tilt stays within character plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑dense, and largely economical; lines often do double duty (world + character). Minor familiar turns (“the cavern held its breath”) don’t blunt clarity or momentum. Syntax varies, and paragraphs carry charge without loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and coherent at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: orchard‑world geology, consciousness‑feeding lichen, and a blacksmith’s crafted “mock consciousness” via magician’s silk. The tactic is non‑obvious yet seeded, and the azure motif is integrated rather than ornamental. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent, with a memorable final image. The ingenuity sits in character‑driven craft rather than twistiness.</comment>
