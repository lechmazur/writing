<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and competence are crystal clear, and her embodied fear-to-focus pivot (“Panic, cold and sharp… She could not fight them physically; she had to adapt.”) grounds credible agency. The internal tension between love and logic is present but mild; she meets pressure without a meaningful blind spot or costly misstep. Micro‑choices around tuning read specific and personal. The final identity shift (“part of the song”) is earned, though low on visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: ship intrudes → artifact wavers → she engages lens → counter‑wave neutralizes. Orientation is immediate; single scene with a clear tightening to the crescendo and an on‑page Decisive Change (ship silenced). The only shortfall is cost: the solution lands without a concrete price beyond strain, slightly softening closure weight. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina and lighthouse apparatus are vivid and functional; ice acoustics, brass rings, and lens optics shape tactics. The environment constrains choice (sound vs force) and charges the final image (golden light continuing as shield). Sensory detail is purposeful across sound, touch, and light. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently—approach thrum to “crescendo,” apparatus shuddering, final infinitesimal adjustment. Agency is central and the tightening is clear, but the on‑page price for success is light, with no trade‑off beyond effort. Stakes stay focused and visceral through sound and structural vibration. The reversal is earned by her tuned counter‑wave rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—adaptation and understanding over extraction/control—emerges through choices and the sonic counter‑move, not sermonizing. The sunset’s transience refracts into a “permanent solution,” a neat echo if slightly stated (“a logical outcome born from deep love”). Subtext of inheritance and stewardship is present in the worn key and grandfather’s journals. Resonance lingers, though a touch of explicitness trims mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close-third voice blends tactile engineering and lyric perception without drifting registers. Diction like “brutal C‑sharp” and “crystalline rings” feels character‑plausible and rhythmic under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance wobbles; psychic distance tightens effectively at the climax. Compression is confident without withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry momentum with efficient sensory density; syntax varies, and beats do multiple jobs. Occasional elevated phrasing (“fleshly ethereal,” “sonic absolution,” “perfect, purifying frequency”) brushes purple but remains coherent and character‑anchored. No paraphrase loops or mechanical cadence. The final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustics, sacred tech, and ice‑marina ecology feels fresh and specific. The tuning‑as‑counterforce turn is character‑driven and inevitable in hindsight. Not wholly unprecedented, but the tactile engineering and musicality elevate it beyond template. The risk of blending mystical and technical pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
