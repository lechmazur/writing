<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty-bound pacifier vs. “gentle radical”—are embodied in tactile choices (kneeling, offering the tessera, renaming). The retrocognition reorients her motives credibly without turning into a tidy epiphany. Status dynamics with the lieutenant are legible, and her defiance carries implied risk. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than concretely paid on the page, slightly softening the turn’s bite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: orders to rename and clear the family apply coherent pressure; the tessera experience deepens options; the decisive renaming reconfigures stakes. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). Closure lands via Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing (the sector’s name shifts meaning and future). On‑page cost remains implied (disciplinary danger) rather than enacted, trimming peak intensity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The plaza’s ash, fractured sky, and mosaic path are vivid and POV‑filtered; sensory details (wet mortar smell via retrocognition) are purposeful. The tessera functions as object‑as‑setting and charges the final image (sky as mosaic). World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. While the environment doesn’t physically constrain tactics, it meaningfully reframes the choice and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (erasure vs. preservation/mercy) is clear and tightens when the lieutenant issues the order. The retrocognitive surge deepens internal pressure, culminating in Elara’s public defiance and protective renaming. The price is visible in social risk and potential punishment, though not paid on the page. Tension scales cleanly without gratuitous reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of naming, memory, and mercy are enacted through the tessera and the act of renaming, rather than told; the final mosaic‑sky image reweights earlier material. Subtext operates in gesture (open palm, kneeling) and image (blue against grey). A few near-abstract phrasings (“aberrant mercy”) brush the edge of telling but are grounded by scene work. The ending resists moralizing and leaves charged ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close sticks to Elara’s perceptual signature; diction and cadence suit the setting and stakes. Dialogue is spare but functional and status-aware (“Designate Gamma-Seven is cleared”; “Hold”). Psychic distance tightens at stress peaks without leakage. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-dense, and mostly economical; key lines do multiple jobs. Occasional elevated or echoing constructions (“arms of steel,” “aberrant mercy,” repeated mosaic/fragment imagery) skirt purple but remain coherent and purposeful. Rhythm varies, and sentences propel rather than loop. No syntactic or clarity errors impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of militarized renaming policy, a tactile retrocognitive trigger, and a tessera-as-soul metaphor feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The final reconfiguration (naming as guard and story) is non-obvious yet earned. Risks in lyric density and concept are controlled, not gimmicky. Some genre familiarities persist, but the specifics elevate them.</comment>
