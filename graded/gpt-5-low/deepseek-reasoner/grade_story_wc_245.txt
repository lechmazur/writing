<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—mapping emotion and calibrating an internal compass—is clear and embodied through tactile perception and sonic attention. Interiority is vivid (“her skin drank the forest’s ancient, vibrational language”), but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or falters. The final change (reorienting the compass to her heart) is earned by prior pursuit rather than declared. Emotional cost is subtle—more a renunciation of external authority than a felt loss—yet legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as one scene with a clean cadence shift at the monolith and a closure of Conceptual Repricing (stillpoint internalized; compass reweighted). Orientation is swift and clean, and beats accrete via the musical trail. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, but the before/after is legible and on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Ultrasonic Forest is sensorially rich and purpose‑driven; its rules (audible only during the celestial pause) shape tactics and atmosphere. The compass ring and stillpoint charge the final image with setting‑object synergy. Details filter through her tactile/sound‑biased noticing, avoiding tourist cataloging. Strong, integrated world‑rule consistency without overexposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can she parse and carry the stillpoint) is signaled and tightened through the note‑trail culminating in the monolith. Escalation is a density increase rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens, but prices paid are soft and largely internal. The decisive deepening (knowledge given freely; compass reorients) arises from her committed attention. Lack of a sharper trade‑off keeps it just shy of high‑band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of cartography of feeling, inner navigation, and revaluing external instruments are embedded in events and images rather than told. The final image reweights prior motifs (map, ring, stillpoint) without moralizing, offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Ambiguity is purposeful and contained; if anything, the insight lands a touch tidily. Still, the restraint and patterning support a lasting afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elara’s sensory logic; diction is controlled and consistent with her tactile/sonic attention. Rhythm varies with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance leaks. The voice modulates into a hushed intensity at the monolith (“a quiet blaze of understanding”), matching the piece’s tonal aims. No dialogue needed; the prose functions as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; metaphors are largely coherent and motif‑bound (sound, mapping, stillness). A few lush phrasings flirt with purple but remain purposeful and clear. No loops or cadence templates; propulsion is steady for a quiet piece. Syntax and paragraphing breathe in step with the scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—ultrasonic forest, tactile language absorption, a dead compass reoriented to self—is distinctive and thematically integral. The note‑trail as language and the stillpoint as internal compass feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in committing to a quiet, conceptual climax, which the piece supports. Minor familiarity in the “truth was within” trope is offset by specific, grounded execution.</comment>
