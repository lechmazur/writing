<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—transmuting loss into a lasting resonance—reads clear, specific, and consistent with her exile and craft. The interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with tools and place, not therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction is modest (grief vs. rejection of “false comfort”), leaving little on‑page ambivalence at peak stress. The final choice (memory over new life) carries a credible cost but is emotionally tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual’s build—idea → apparatus → circuit → projection—tightens cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost: she constructs eternity but remains alone among echoes. Causal beats are coherent, with no late rule change undermining the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral: Paper‑Lantern Cove, the geographical center, copper arrays, and lantern strings function as a literal memory network that constrains tactics. The amber bottle, tripod, and wired lanterns charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a maker’s eye. World rules feel consistent and learned in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily internal and accumulative: purpose collapse → deliberate method → irreversible activation. The decisive tightening occurs when she commits the circuit and touches every lantern, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible but understated (choosing echoes over the living). Stakes remain coherent throughout, if low on direct resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory vs. death, authenticity vs. illusion, and purpose forged from loss emerge through events and images rather than lecture. The final tableau conceptually reprices “after the last wish”: no longer wishes granted, but wishes made permanent at the price of solitude. A couple of explicit theme lines (“rejected the false comfort”) tilt toward telling but don’t overwhelm. The resonance lingers without a neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The controlled close third carries a distinct maker’s lexicon and rhythmic confidence. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; elision is purposeful. Lyrical cadence modulates with action, especially at activation. Minor repetition dents freshness but not clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid, economical, and image‑forward; lines often do double duty (world and emotion). A few phrasal repeats and intensifiers flirt with purple but stay coherent and purposeful. Syntax varies and supports momentum; no scaffold loops or template beats. The final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The anomaly bottle as catalyst for a town‑wide memory resonance feels fresh, and the “working memory” method smartly literalizes cognition. Familiar ghost‑echo tropes are transformed by specific craft detail and civic scope. The choice to enshrine echoes rather than revive life is a non‑obvious, character‑true turn. Overall, a distinctive synthesis executed with conviction.</comment>
