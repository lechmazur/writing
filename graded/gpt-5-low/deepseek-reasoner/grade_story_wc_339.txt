<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s “quietly analytic” disposition and hollow reaction to triumph establish a credible motive for helping Mortimer, and her choice to methodically untangle the threads fits her nature. However, internal conflict is mild—she encounters little resistance or risk in executing the release. The relationship dynamic with Mortimer is clear and textured but largely cooperative, limiting pressure. The final reorientation toward Amelia reads earned but emotionally cushioned rather than hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: discovery → Mortimer’s proposition → methodical untangling → release → note → reframed understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt, if quiet, cost: Elara relinquishes her “closed door” stance for a curated peace. Orientation is strong and the single scene holds the lens without contradiction. The price is more reflective than risky, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly particular (mahogany shelves swaying, leather‑bound fish, motes in the murk) and the snow globe functions as a charged micro‑setting. Environmental texture supports tone and discovery, and the final image is enriched by place (a “submerged museum”). While the setting charges mood and meaning, it doesn’t materially constrain tactics, which keeps it below 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing a stubborn soul and reconfiguring Elara’s stance—tightens once she commits to the untangling method. The escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal; the release is achieved without missteps or counterpressure. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of her earlier worldview and the quiet of the soul’s departure. The conflict remains elegant but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonance accrues through the snow globe’s reweighting and the final note (“Tell Anna I love her. The tree was perfect.”) linking love, memory, and release. Mortimer’s line about “the final, necessary edit” edges into thesis articulation, dampening subtext in the final movement. Still, the piece avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in a concrete act of letting go. The Amelia reframing meaningfully echoes the core idea.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV control is steady, with a distinct, observant diction fitting a recovery specialist. Dialogue differentiates Mortimer’s archival gentility from Elara’s economy and advances the premise with subtext. Rhythm and syntax vary, and the prose modulates well from awe to precision. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: vivid but disciplined imagery, purposeful verbs, and few fillers. A handful of lyric flourishes risk purple but remain coherent and tied to POV. No loops or scaffolding slow the momentum; the beat where the globe warms and a sigh echoes is clean and striking. Copy and sequence read clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Deep‑sea salvage meets Death‑as‑archivist and a soul trapped in a snow globe is a fresh synthesis, executed with restraint and specificity. The “physics of letting go” motif feels original in framing, not gimmickry. The turn to the radio note is simple yet elegant. Risk is thoughtful rather than flashy, yielding memorable texture.</comment>
