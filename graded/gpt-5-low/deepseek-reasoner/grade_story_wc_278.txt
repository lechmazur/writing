<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven motive is clear, consistent, and scales into concrete choices (modifying equipment, rerouting the cry into amber). Interiority is vivid and character-specific (“meteor hush,” “laboratory of lost sounds”) without therapy-speak. The internal contradiction—preserving loss while needing to imprison a sound—registers, though the struggle is more lyrical than dramatized blow-by-blow. A touch more embodied hesitation in the climax could deepen visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: glitch → letters → origin/formulas → tethering act → cleansed firmware. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the closure is an on-page decisive change with an earned emotional cost (“not forgotten, but… laid to rest”). The amber functions as a persistent constraint shaping the final tactic. The loop logic (Alistair → Elara → cry) coheres without a late rule change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lab and tools are not backdrop; they dictate tactic (using translators, routing into amber) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity serves mood and action (spectrograms flatten, air hums with archived silences). The object-as-setting (amber) meaningfully constrains and concludes the choice. Atmosphere is consistent and purposeful without museum-tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (break the loop/hush guilt) is clear and tightens through the letter reveal and the risky redirection of the cry. The decisive act forecloses a path (feeding back into the system) and carries cost (imprisoning a sound; personal confrontation with the cry). Pressure rises coherently, if elegantly rather than brutally. Slightly low friction—her solution works on the first try—keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of grief preservation, guilt transference, and giving the ghost a home culminate in a resonant, non-literal answer (amber as tomb, “mapping her own sky”). Recurring images (constellation tattoos, spectrograms flattening into silence) reweight meaning at the end. No moralizing undercuts the resonance. The complexity is held in image, not stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lucidly lyrical, and consistent with a scientifically inclined artist; diction and rhythm serve pressure. Free of head-hopping and unearned omniscience. Elevated metaphors remain coherent with POV and do not eclipse clarity. Modulation from hush to scream back to hush is deftly handled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: few redundancies, clear causality, purposeful figurative language. Metaphor density is high but disciplined; images don’t conflict or blur sense. Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, plot) with good propulsion. A tad more syntactic variation at the climax could heighten urgency further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Constellation tattooist + sound-archive lab + haunted firmware + amber as data sink is a striking synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The letter device avoids cliché by integrating with tactics and guilt lineage. The final reconfiguration is fresh and emotionally true. Risk-taking in premise and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
