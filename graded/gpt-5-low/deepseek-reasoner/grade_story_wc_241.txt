<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (responsible widening of perspective) is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices—following clues despite irritation, lighting then extinguishing the lantern. Her interior contradiction (order vs. her father’s chaos) is embodied and specific, not generic. The final stance shift feels earned and carries emotional cost. Slight on‑the‑nose phrasing (“failed mystic of mathematics”) modestly flattens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: city breadcrumbs → library → lantern vision culminate in a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on‑page with cost as she extinguishes the candle and accepts a reweighted understanding. Orientation is early and clean; the causal thread from scrawls to “Lucian’s Folio” is coherent. Stakes narrow toward a single charged realization without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV‑filtered (wet asphalt, beeswax, mica), and the lantern functions as a charged tool that shapes the final image. The rainwashed library isn’t postcard décor; it supplies the chest and frames the thematic turn. Weather and place mirror inner weather without heavy‑handed symbolism. Minor flourish in description skirts purple once but stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Conflict escalates from abstract curiosity to a pressured test: accept or reject the father’s “religion” when the lantern multiplies possibilities. The decisive act—extinguishing the candle—forecloses a path while carrying felt cost. Internal and external threads interweave cleanly; no reliance on contrivance. The pressure is quiet but tight, appropriate to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of chance vs. certainty and “lucid contradictions” emerge organically through objects and action, not sermonizing. The final image (dust motes after extinguishing) reweights earlier motifs and lands as a conceptual repricing with melancholy cost. A few explicit labels tilt toward explication but do not overwhelm subtext. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“poet of probability,” “clover melancholy”) remains consistent and controlled. Distance and stance are stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm varies with pressure, and diction fits an academic mind without drifting into sterile academic register. A touch of explanatory phrasing appears but doesn’t sap voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, purposeful images, and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is rich yet coherent; no mixed metaphors or loops dull momentum. Sentences modulate well to support a quiet escalation. A few abstractions appear, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mica‑pane lantern as a superposition model is an inventive, specific device, and the gambler/probability‑professor dyad feels fresh. The synthesis of mourning, mathematics, and mysticism reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken in tone and concept without gimmickry. Minor familiar notes (library sanctity) are transformed by the execution.</comment>
