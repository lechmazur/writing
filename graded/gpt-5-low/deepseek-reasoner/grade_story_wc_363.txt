<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s goal and endurance are specific and consistent, and her choice to unmake her masterpiece reads as an earned renunciation with visible cost (collapse, loss of years of work). Interiority is concrete through tactile labor and fatigue rather than labels. Minor shortfall: little contradictory impulse beyond fatigue vs. duty, making her psychology elegant but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of gathering hush → bead discovery → mosaic method → unweaving culminates in an on‑page Decisive Change with cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and each beat logically builds to the climactic pluck. The return whisper seals closure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard/bamboo hush functions as resource and atmosphere, and the loom/amber bead operate as micro‑setting tools that constrain tactics and charge the ending image. Sensory specificity is steady and POV‑filtered. The world’s rules are learned through use without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake (deliver the message) is signaled early; escalation arrives via the bead’s stabilizing effect and the puzzle‑frame method, culminating in the sacrifice of the finished work. The cost is unmistakable and chosen by the protagonist. Pressure is gentle rather than urgent, but it coheres and tightens appropriately for the mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silence as medium, message, and sacrifice converges into a resonant, non‑literal answer: creation fulfilled by unmaking. The amber bead’s reweighting and the orchard’s breathed relief deepen the theme without didacticism. The final whisper reframes distance and home with earned grace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistent, lucid lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elara’s perceptions and labor. Rhythm and diction suit the contemplative pressure, with no head‑hopping or register slips. Purposeful compression across years remains legible and in voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and economical for the mode; sentences carry multiple jobs and propel toward the final act. A few ornate phrases recur (“stoically sparkling”) but do not blur sense or slow momentum. The closure image is clear and unencumbered by scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weaving and unweaving silence, stabilized by an amber bead and puzzle‑edge frame, feels freshly imagined and thematically integrated. The final act of deliberate dissolution as delivery is an elegant, non‑obvious turn that reads inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
