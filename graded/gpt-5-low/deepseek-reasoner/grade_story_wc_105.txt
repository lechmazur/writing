<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Aris’s obsession and professional competence align cleanly, with embodied emotion (synesthetic color-hearing, tears in the helmet) under pressure. Motivation is specific and sustained, and the final acceptance reads earned. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—driven healer versus witness—rather than dramatized as live friction in multiple beats. A touch more on-the-spot self‑conflict would elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure is clear, with a timed window, approach, eruption, capture, imprint, and conceptual reweighting at the rise. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she secures the imprint yet chooses witnessing over fixing with felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the open and the drive lens holds. The causal spine is simple but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abyssal orchard, ring of wrecks, and “forge under aurora” are vivid and purpose‑driven; the sub, vents, and collectors constrain tactics and timing. Details are POV‑filtered through a hearing‑designer’s synesthesia and tools. The environment charges the climax (vent eruption enables capture) and the final ascent image. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through the live window and vent eruption, culminating in the capture and imprint. Agency is steady (activate, navigate, command imprint), with a clear tightening at the eruption. The price is emotional rupture and acceptance of limits, which charges the ending. Stakes remain intimate but decisive for this scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance is strong—the piece reframes healing as witnessing, with the captured “absence” reweighting memory and grief. However, the line “Some things are not meant to be fixed, only witnessed” states the thesis directly, edging into moralizing and reducing subtext. Most thematic work is otherwise done through image and action. The final carry to the surface stays charged despite the explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (color‑sound synesthesia, technical intimacy). Distance and tense are stable; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythmic modulations match pressure spikes (eruption, imprint). A few elevated phrasings flirt with purple but remain coherent and voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet purposeful; images do multiple jobs (science as grief, silence as color). Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops; syntax varies to maintain momentum. Figurative language is frequent but largely harmonious with the world logic. A touch of compression at the thematic statement would sharpen the afterimage.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—collecting absences to imprint the sound of trust breaking in a submersible orchard—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in premise and sensory logic is bold and integrated, not gimmicky. Turns arise naturally from the setup (timed vents, family wound) and pay off conceptually. Emotional truth underwrites the novelty.</comment>
