<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s craft‑rooted interiority is specific and motivating; her credo “exchange certainty for curiosity” informs tactile choices (placing the nickel, completing the fracture). The embodied reactions under pressure (stumbling back; the careful tap) feel earned. Internal contradiction is mild—risk to her professional ethos is implied more than dramatized—so cost reads present but not searing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: breeze → resonance → vision → interpretive choice → completion → symphony. Closure lands on‑page via a decisive act (not repairing but completing the fracture), with a conceptual cost (departing conservation orthodoxy) and reward (legacy claimed). The cost could be underlined more viscerally, but the structure is tight and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sound‑wave garden is vivid and integral; mechanics (reflected sound, tuned fronds, lotus chord) constrain choices and power the ending. Objects (lotus, fractured sculpture) are used, not toured, and the final image is charged by place. Minor note: a hair more spatial pressure during the weakening song could heighten lived stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres: initial hum to accidental ignition to weakening cadence that forces Elara’s committed intervention. The narrowing window (song fading) functions as a meaningful tightening, and her choice forecloses the safe “restore” path. The price is primarily professional/philosophical, not immediate personal peril, keeping stakes high but contained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Curiosity vs. certainty and art as legacy/subversion are enacted through particulars (hobo nickel as heir‑marker; engineered flaw as future key). The “nested awakenings” reframes meaning without moralizing, and the last image reweights the premise. Slight neatness in the heir motif trims ambiguity but the resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled third‑limited voice with a tactile, sonic lexicon that suits a restorer’s mind. Lyric lift (“liquid jewel,” “sonic alchemy”) stays consistent and legible; no head‑hopping. Rhythm tightens appropriately as the garden stirs, avoiding over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines do multiple jobs—world, action, theme—without loops or scaffold; metaphors are apt and coherent. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains purposeful, and syntax varies with momentum. Pacing is clean through the vision turn and into the conclusive tap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of acoustical engineering, restoration ethics, and a hobo nickel omen feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. “Nested awakenings” is conceptually elegant and dramatized via sound mechanics rather than hand‑waving magic. The risk is stylistic lushness, but execution maintains clarity.</comment>
