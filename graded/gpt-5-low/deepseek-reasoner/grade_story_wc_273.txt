<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession is concrete (the ink experiment) and her “serene anger” gives her interiority specificity and tension. Micro-choices—spending the last vial, releasing the drop, abandoning the drone—align with motive and reveal cost. The contradiction between wildness and analytic rigor enriches her, though the insight skirts on-the-nose. Still, the final renunciation feels earned by the scene’s pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clean anchors; the accumulative/textural lens holds as image density crescendos to a conceptual repricing. Closure lands: she recognizes the mind’s lie and forecloses her prior tactic by leaving tools, paying a visible cost. Because/therefore linkages are intact (eclipse → experiment → sigil → realization → renunciation). The final walk into the desert is an Earned Stasis/CR hybrid with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The desert grotto, sandstone arch, and bowl/rock micro-setting are vivid and tactically used (shade for sensitive eyes, flat stone for ink). The environment charges the final image as the desert’s “indifference” becomes her chosen absorption. Details feel purposeful and filtered through her priorities; world rules remain consistent. Strong sensory texture without drift into museum tour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understand time’s dilation—is clear early; pressure tightens through the experiment and her last-vial constraint. The decisive deepening is the sigil and realization that reweights options, narrowing her path to renunciation. Cost is legible (tools and prior project abandoned; self-dissolution chosen). Tension is internal but sustained and escalatory under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of perception, order, and erasure arise organically through ink behavior and recorded observation. The realization “Time didn’t slow…” feels a touch declarative, reducing subtextual play in the peak beat. Still, the closing image reweights earlier motifs (ink’s vanishing → self-disappearance) with genuine resonance. Ambiguity remains around utility versus knowledge in a satisfying way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, textured, and confident, with lyric precision befitting a tracker-philosopher. Diction is elevated but coherent with the established tone; no head-hopping or stance slippage. Rhythm modulates well across beats. Minor risk of register height at the thesis line, but overall control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean, vivid, and efficient; most sentences do double duty for image and pressure. Figurative density is high but not muddled; motifs recur with intent. No noticeable scaffold or loops; cadence varies. A couple of grand abstractions flirt with purple but do not blur clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-collapse desert tech, disappearing ink as temporal probe, eclipse-triggered cognitive overproduction—is distinctive and grounded in character. The hummingbird drone and ink method feel fresh rather than gimmicky. The final conceptual turn is surprising yet earned. Small traces of familiar “mind creates time” phrasing keep it just shy of 9+.</comment>
