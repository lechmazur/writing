<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to thaw the frozen mistrust with Leo—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (stealing/keeping the lens, deciding to show the tickets silently) align with that drive. Interiority is specific and embodied through the lens and doodles rather than diagnostic labels. The cost is primarily emotional vulnerability, felt but modest. Leo’s presence provides relational pressure, though his interior remains off-page, keeping the crucible focused but narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images (rain, lens, tickets, hornet) accrue toward a quiet Charged Poise ending where the silence reconfigures the relationship. Orientation is clean early; causality is simple but coherent—realization → action → visible thaw. Closure lands on the page with a legible before/after and a nonverbal price (exposure of guilt and risk of rejection). The final “bridge” image earns its repricing without mechanical explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The plaza after rain and the crystal sculptures are vivid and filtered through Elara’s perception, mirroring her emotional state without blunt symbolism. The projector lens functions as a tool-object micro-setting that charges the final image and action. Weather and light shape tone and pace but do not overtly constrain moves; the object does that work. Specificity remains economical and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early and tightens when the lens reframes the doodles into the hornet pattern, converting uncertainty into a choice to risk showing Leo. The escalation is quiet but meaningful; the tactic shifts from rumination to a physical, silent offering. Cost is emotional exposure and the possibility of further rebuff, made legible in the hesitation and silence. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres internally and relationally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Seeing and being seen—clarity vs. blur—threads through lens, microfilm, and the hornet motif to render a thematic answer: honesty as a precise center amid peripheral distortion. Subtext carries the turn; nothing is moralized or summarized. The final bridge image repurposes the earlier wall of silence, reweighting prior material. Complexity is preserved; reconciliation begins without being declared complete.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with a distinct, quietly lyrical texture suited to Elara’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, staying within the character’s plausible lexicon. Dialogue is minimal and appropriately replaced by action and image. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean and purposeful; images do double duty for scene and theme without purple excess. A few elevated phrasings (“resonant hush,” “ambiguously clear”) fit the chosen register and pattern. Momentum is preserved despite reflection, and sentences vary in rhythm. No visible loops or muddled metaphors at the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The projector lens plus anxious hornet doodles as an “artifact of regret” is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The crystal forecourt after rain gives the piece an identifiable signature beyond a generic reconciliation. The risk is quiet but real: a nonverbal proof of contrition rather than a speech. The piece avoids template beats and resolves through image-driven intelligence.</comment>
