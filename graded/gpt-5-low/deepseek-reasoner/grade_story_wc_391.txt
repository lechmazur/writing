<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kaelen’s motive—wrestling impatience into patience—drives concrete choices, from anchoring himself against the viaduct’s pull to the final unyoking. Interiority stays embodied (boots tugged, breath pluming) rather than abstract. The contradiction between craving a “crack in the sky” and choosing slow calibration remains active through the end. Only minor soft-focus lines flirt with summary rather than pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: storm → magnetic activation → bent moon path data → proof → deliberate unyoking. Orientation is immediate and stable; the lens reads Causal through the final act. Closure lands on-page with cost via altering the viaduct’s foundation to change future mappings. The cost is conceptual and infrastructural rather than perilous, but it’s legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: basalt sanctuary, black-glass lake, and the magnetic viaduct actively shape options and the ending. The magnetic pull affects tools and movement; the frozen lake enables the journey and moon-trace observations. The final image (stone counterweights, wet iron, humming field) is charged by prior environmental rules. Detail selection is disciplined and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redefining the horizon through patience) tightens via the viaduct anomaly, forcing a reframe of obstacle into key. The decisive turn is the choice to alter the structure for future mappings, foreclosing immediate spectacle in favor of slow change. Costs are more philosophical than visceral but are tied to action. Pressure escalates coherently without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme of patient revolution is enacted through method and final restraint, not just stated. The reprise from “unyoke his spirit” to unyoking stone counterweights is a resonant, non-literal answer. One sentence edges toward thesis-stating (“His patient revolution was this...”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, the final image reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (calibrated instruments, azimuths) remains steady. Syntax modulates well between stillness and pressure (“compass spun wildly”). No head-hopping or stance slippage. Elevated diction matches the character’s vocation and mindset.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and strong image economy. Occasional abstract nouns (“recalibration,” “revolution”) risk coolness but are anchored by tactile detail. Figurative language is coherent and not overstacked. Rhythm supports movement from observation to act.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct bending moon paths is an inventive engine for both plot and metaphor. The lodestone sphere, counterweights, and “patient revolution” synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The gentle sabotage for legacy is a non-obvious resolution. Risks are integrated without gimmickry.</comment>
