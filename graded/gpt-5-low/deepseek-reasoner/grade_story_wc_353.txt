<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s drive is clear and embodied in tactile choices—reading fissures, stilling his breath, using himself as conduit. The tension between desperation and patience gives him dimension, though his flaw-set is gentle and largely idealized. Micro‑choices under pressure are credible and aligned to motive. The change at the end feels earned even if the personal cost remains understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from analysis to attempted activation to the grove’s reply. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the world shifts from silence to answering song—on the page. Causality is coherent (analysis → strum → response), though the cost at closure is more inferred (self‑giving) than explicit. Orientation is clean from the opening line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The grove is vividly rendered and integrated: the petrified cathedral, the sunless warmth, the root sculpture’s geography. The environment not only frames but participates in the ending as the alders chime. Details are filtered through a symphonic sensibility, avoiding generic scenic catalog. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it decisively charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is plain and present: to create music in a mute world. Escalation tightens from inert tool to embodied listening to the first note to orchestral swell. The reversal—insulator as inert object → insulator as strummed key—derives from Aris’s altered tactic. The price is mostly risk of failure and self‑expenditure rather than a concrete loss, keeping the ceiling modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around listening versus forcing and the salvational power of empathetic attention. Recurring images (cracks as score, porcelain as resonance vessel) culminate in a quiet crescendo that reweights the world. The explicit line “He had not forced the music... understanding” edges toward moralizing and reduces mystery. Still, the ending’s image carries genuine emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in close third, with a distinct perceptual signature (“tree‑song sculptor,” movements instead of notes). Diction suits the character’s symphonic mind and the hush of the world. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; modulation under pressure is smooth. The prose avoids over‑explaining and trusts image and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with measured rhythm; imagery is rich but largely coherent to the premise. Minimal scaffolding and few loops; line‑level momentum matches the quiet intensification. A couple of heightened phrases flirt with purple but don’t blur causality or closure. Final lines land cleanly through image rather than explanation, aside from one thematic tell.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—arboreal acoustics, a porcelain insulator as instrument, and empathy as the operative physics—is fresh and specific. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the setup (reading cracks as score → strum as solution). The risk is aesthetic rather than structural, but it pays off with a distinctive worldfeel. High originality without gimmickry.</comment>
