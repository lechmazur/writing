<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑specific, and her patient, methodical temperament credibly drives each micro‑choice (tracing threads, testing the golden filament). Interiority is implied through tactile focus rather than told feelings, keeping her distinct. The change at the end—accepting a resurrection role—reads earned but carries limited on‑page ambivalence or conflicting impulse. A touch more friction or visible cost in the acceptance would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. Beats progress cleanly—thread discovery therefore case unlocks therefore revelation—culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where cemetery shifts from memorial to seed vault. Orientation is anchored early and maintained. The closure lands on the page with a charged final image; cost is conceptual (burden of reactivation) rather than dramatized, but it’s legible in the redefinition of her tools and role.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, tapestry, and sovereign case are not décor; they constrain choices and supply the mechanism of the turn. Sensory selection (cool air, glow‑orb, frayed threads) is precise and POV‑filtered through a gardener’s patience. The environment charges the final image (“under the starlight… cobalt silo”), satisfying the 9‑band gate. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand the old intention) is signaled early, and escalation tightens through the golden thread to the unlocking and revelation. The deepening is knowledge‑driven rather than adversarial, appropriate to the lens, and protagonist agency drives each turn. The on‑page price is subtle, skewing more toward future burden than present sacrifice, which slightly softens the pressure’s bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, intention, and hope over memorialization emerge organically through objects and action; the cemetery’s revaluation is resonant. The final image reweights prior motifs (threads/roots, tools) without sermonizing, though the revelation edges toward explicit statement in one paragraph. Subtext hums in the gardener’s craft translating into resurrection work. The ambiguity that remains (scope and cost of “resurrection”) invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third‑person close maintains consistent distance and a distinct perceptual signature (tactile patience, attention to filaments and tools). Rhythm modulates well—measured sentences for intricate work, a quiet lift at revelation—without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful diction (“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”) feels voice‑true for this world. No withholding beyond what the scene earns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are lean yet lyrical, with strong noun‑verb choices and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; images recur purposefully (threads, roots, constellations) without purple excess. Momentum remains steady through discovery; no paraphrase loops or template cadences distract. Minor risk: one expository block stating the reinterpretation could be fractionally compressed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—a cemetery as genetic library, a tapestry border as operational key, a sovereign case housing a “perfect knot”—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in object logic and mythic texture pays off without obscuring clarity. The reweighting from memorial to seed vault is conceptually elegant and character‑tethered. Specificity (glow‑orb, mother‑of‑pearl constellations) elevates beyond trope.</comment>
