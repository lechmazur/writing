<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—hush the coded prophecy—and every action aligns with that vow. The internal conflict (anger as “loud” versus cultivated hush) surfaces under pressure when the prophecy weaponizes rage. Embodied choices—listening to willow, moss, brook; rejecting visions; channeling silence—reveal character. Slight idealization (near‑ascetic perfection) limits messier flaws but doesn’t undercut the earned renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: mapping silence → prophecy’s counter‑assault → recommitment → tranquil blaze. Closure lands decisively: the hum is “truly gone,” and the wing departs, reweighting the world with a felt cost (bone‑deep weariness, letting go). Orientation is clear early—who/where/when—and no causality seams show. The single tightening beat (visions trying to break his quiet) is clean and sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The brook, willow, and moss aren’t decor; their distinct “silences” are materials the protagonist braids into tactic and climax. The environment both supplies resources and sets the tonal pressure that enables his method. The final image of the wing rising against the night returns setting as charge. Specificity is selective and purpose‑driven rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—neutralize a world‑scale hum—tightens when the prophecy retaliates with inciting visions that nearly rupture his focus. The choice to refuse anger and recommit to mapped quiet forecloses the lure of cathartic noise. Cost is legible (exhaustion, release of the wing) and the cadence shift into the silent flash reads earned. Stakes remain internalized on the page but the pressure is coherent and escalating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—quiet as disciplined counterforce to catastrophic noise—emerges through action, not sermon. The crane wing’s partiality (incompleteness as focus) and the final letting‑go recast power as renunciation; no moral is stated. The tranquil blaze offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question. Ambiguity is purposeful without muddle, lingering as a healed silence that “dreamed.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature—attending to “contours” of silence—holds steady. Rhythm modulates well at the peak (from stillness to the soundless flash) without head‑hopping or register slips. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mind of this ascetic technician of quiet. No withheld facts or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffolding; images do more than one job (setting as method as theme). A few lush phrases flirt with purple, but metaphor vehicles stay coherent with the acoustic/void lexicon. No significant loops or cadence templates sap momentum. The final image is crisp and unblurred by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Mapping silence” as craft and the origami wing as partial, charged tool feel singular and necessary. The prophecy’s “coded hum” countered by an absorbing quiet reframes apocalypse through attention rather than spectacle. Risks in diction and concept cohere and pay off at closure. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight and fresh in approach.</comment>
