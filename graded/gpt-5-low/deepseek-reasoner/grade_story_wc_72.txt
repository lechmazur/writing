<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Statue’s certainty-versus-understanding conflict is cleanly dramatized and culminates in a credible, earned shift when it points to the fracture and reinterprets its vigil. The historian’s motive (“incisively kind”) tracks in her methodical, non-destructive actions. Interiority is distinct for a sentient stone observer and avoids stock emotion labels. The only slight limitation is the low resistance—change arrives without much internal pushback.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, each beat follows: arrival → revelation of history → identification of weakness → threading → ampoule release → city-wide repricing. Closure lands on the page with the ampoule’s crack and the Statue’s reconfigured purpose. Cost reads as the Statue relinquishing its foundational belief, with the ocean’s pressure reframed rather than lifted. Orientation is immediate and stable, and set-ups (fracture, clasp) pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underwater garden is specific and tactile (phosphorescent kelp, cracked pearls, coralline moss), and environmental constraints shape tactics (threading rather than smashing). Objects-as-setting (column, clasp, ampoule) charge the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. A hint of lushness nears purple but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the Statue’s paradigm shift and the ampoule’s deployment, with a meaningful tightening when brute force is rejected for threading the fracture. Stakes are mostly conceptual—guardianship versus mourning—yet the single deepening suffices at this length. The price is giving up certainty; the escalation is subtle rather than visceral. No contrivance resolves the conflict; agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: pearls reweighted from debris to constellation, water from burden to blanket. Subtext of preservation-by-surrender and “welcoming nuance into certainty” is dramatized rather than lectured, though one or two lines skirt thesis-statement territory. The final image offers a resonant answer—faithful guardianship—without moralizing. The aftereffect lingers as a patient, chosen stasis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The perceptual signature of a hyper-observant stone sentinel is consistent and distinct, with telepathic “voice” modulation at the end landing cleanly. Diction fits the mythic-lyric register without register spills, and the historian’s presence is felt through action and mind-voice. No head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Lyric control holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient, with images doing double duty (ampoule as storm, pearls as constellation). Occasional high-density metaphor clusters flirt with excess but don’t blur causality or closure. Sentence rhythm varies and propels. Minimal scaffolding and no meaningful loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A living stone sentinel in an underwater garden reinterpreting its charge via a chemical memory is fresh and cohesive. The gentle, method-driven breakthrough (threading a fracture) smartly subverts smash-to-win tropes. The conceptual reweighting is inevitable in hindsight once the clasp is revealed. It takes a bold, quiet risk without gimmickry.</comment>
