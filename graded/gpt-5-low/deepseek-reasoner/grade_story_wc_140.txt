<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>K’s motivation is clear and particular—seeking the “texture of memories” rather than their own name—and their decisive act (submitting the dossier) aligns with this evolving drive. The internal shift when the label reweights their priorities is credible and embodied (“a cold stone in K’s chest”). However, opposition remains largely atmospheric; we don’t see an on‑page test that forces a painful trade‑off beyond the ethical pivot. A touch more friction or risk would deepen the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the because/therefore chain holds: discovery → patterning of whispers → assembly → anonymous delivery. Closure lands with cost as K relinquishes self‑restoration to resurrect another’s erased history (Earned Stasis with conceptual price). The middle’s investigation is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening pressure. Orientation is firm early, and the final image reconfigures stakes without mechanical over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth and tides are vivid and purposeful, shaping K’s method and timing (“next tidal cycle,” “tide receded”). The environment charges the final image (“groaning containers…silent witnesses”) and colors K’s perception. Details stay character‑filtered rather than touristic. This is atmospheric and functionally tied to choices, not mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The poisoning label is a clean escalation that reframes the project from elegiac cataloging to dangerous truth‑work, narrowing K’s options to acting or colluding in silence. The agency at the end is clear and stakes are moral rather than physical. Still, external antagonism is implied rather than enacted on the page, so the cost is more conceptual than felt through resistance. One concrete on‑page threat would have sharpened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of erasure, bureaucratic death versus literal murder, and memory as justice emerge through action and recurring images (tides, palimpsest, label). The ending’s repricing—K remaining nameless while resurrecting another—lands without sermonizing. “Some stories…could never be drowned again” risks mild explicitness but earns its cadence via prior seawork. The piece invites reflection on institutional forgetting without flattening to a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with K’s perceptual bias (“phantom outlines,” “palimpsest”). Diction remains coherent and modulates with pressure around the label’s discovery. There’s confidence without head‑hopping or explanatory crutches. A touch more rhythmical variation at peak beats could add urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, theme, and motion—while avoiding scaffold and loops. Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked; the prose maintains clarity under lyricism. Minor abstraction appears in the investigative summary but doesn’t stall momentum. Opening and closing lines pay off earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a bureaucratic ghost curating dockside palimpsests with a literal poison label is fresh and cohesive. The tidal clock and container‑maze archive feel distinctive rather than ornamental. The anonymous tip to a paper is more familiar, tempering novelty at the close. Still, the piece commits to its premise with integrity and avoids safe median choices in voice and frame.</comment>
