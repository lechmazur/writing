<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and particular—his vow to witness without judgment governs every choice. The internal tension between “not interfering” and acting to preserve his function is present but soft; he resolves it by leaning into witnessing, so contradiction doesn’t bite. Emotion is largely conveyed via atmosphere rather than embodied stress, which keeps him a touch abstract. Still, the origami choice and the non‑mending stance at the fault reveal a coherent, disciplined character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a clear causal thread. The groan forces the retreat and origami method; the witnessing stance unravels the knot, and the ending returns to charged stillness—an Earned Stasis/RR. Cost is implied (psychic weight, shattered peace) but not deeply dramatized in the peak beat, which slightly blunts impact. Structure holds as a two‑shard passage and clean return.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: the catacomb library, obsidian refuge, and river shape tactics (retreat, traversal, return image). The origami swan as handled object functions like a micro‑setting tool that charges the final image. Sensory selection matches the solemn tone without tourist cataloguing. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve the library’s stability to preserve his duty) is present early and tightens with the subterranean groan. Escalation deepens via the vibration realm and the traumatic knot; the decisive tactic is endurance/attention rather than confrontation. The visible price is mostly internal and understated, so stakes read lofty but a bit frictionless. Still, agency drives the turn at the fault in a way consistent with the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of nonjudgmental witnessing and cyclical decay/regrowth arise from concrete acts (unfolding, entering vibration, choosing silence) rather than thesis statements. The ending’s new swan reframes the journey as preservation, not prevention, offering a resonant answer. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion. Slightly tidy restoration keeps it shy of the most haunting resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled third‑person with a strong perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the sacred archival mood. Psychic distance remains steady, with purposeful intensification in the realm sequence. No dialogue to test, but the narrative voice carries subtext effectively. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and mostly high‑density, with images doing multiple jobs (setting, theme, action). Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but doesn’t impede clarity or momentum. Minimal scaffold or loops; sentences vary in rhythm to match pressure. Final lines land cleanly on a charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Origami‑as‑cosmic‑map and “regenerative silence” feel fresh and integrated, not ornamental. The synthesis of fungal library, obsidian refuge, and non‑interventionist healing yields a distinct vision. The resolution through witnessing rather than fixing subverts familiar “savior” arcs. Risk‑taking is controlled and coherent.</comment>
