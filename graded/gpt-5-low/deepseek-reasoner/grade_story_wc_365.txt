<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation evolves credibly from professional curiosity to a desperate need, with embodied reactions (the shard’s heat, the frayed mind) grounding her interiority. Her micro‑choices—redirecting focus, persisting through voids—reveal values under pressure. The fleeting second character still applies pressure via regret and confession that reframes her quest. A minor convenience remains in her “instinctive” grasp of method, but it’s earned by the shard’s influence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: escalation accrues via cycles of silence and surge, then tightens with the final jump and on‑page confession. Closure lands with a conceptual repricing—truth as simple failure—and an earned stasis in her added sigil. Cost is legible: psychic toll and the burden of knowing. The convenience of the older man’s ready confession slightly softens causal rigor but does not break the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The spaceport bay is vividly rendered through rust, ozone, and “starship skeletons,” filtered by a sensory cartographer’s eye. The shard functions as a charged object that anchors atmosphere and the final image. While the environment mostly shapes tone rather than tactics, it consistently mirrors and frames the psychic investigation. World rules stay coherent and are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: uncover the withheld truth; pressure intensifies through repeated, warmer jumps and mental erosion. The meaningful tightening is the final desperate jump yielding the older man and confession. Agency primarily manifests in her tactic to redirect focus, with cost shown in exhaustion and risk of failure. Resolution edges toward convenience (confession), but it still feels earned by her persistence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The piece threads a resonant theme: the heavy gravity of avoidable human failure and the mapping of soul‑territory. The green shard reweights meaning from catalyst to memento; the final sigil reframes repair as internal rather than mechanical without sermonizing. Quiet ambiguity remains (multiverse echoes, the man’s decades of solitude) while offering a clear emotional answer. One line edges toward overt statement, but it grows from image and scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, sensory‑rich, and consistent with a cartographer of intangibles; diction and rhythm modulate well across surges and voids. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (“It never gets easier, does it? The knowing.”). Psychic distance remains stable, with purposeful elision taught by the shard’s mechanics. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is tight and evocative with high information density; sensory images do double duty for mood and action. Figurative language enhances rather than obscures, and sentence rhythm varies to match pressure. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing support momentum. A slight lyric flourish in the last line remains earned by prior images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—sensory cartography plus multiverse shard—feels fresh, and the “simple, stupid truth” subverts grandiose genre expectations. Recurring objects and occupational lens add specificity beyond template SF. The final reweighting is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. It’s not radical, but it is confidently singular.</comment>
