<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and particular (to hear what walls dream), and her competence in acoustics drives choices. Interiority is grounded in sensory attention rather than labels, and her shift from cartography to stewardship reads earned. The internal contradiction is mild—more devotion than conflict—so the felt cost is mostly conceptual. Still, reactions to the diaries and the final burden reveal character credibly under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: diaries → clue (“silent eye,” “sighing corner”) → acoustic test → secret panel → negative. Orientation is swift and stable, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where she accepts custodianship (“the burden… now hers”). The cost is subdued but legible in the legacy responsibility. Escalation is modest yet coherent under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: ivy‑veiled passages, green‑dappled light, the “sighing corner.” The environment and her acoustic tools directly constrain choices (listening to locate the hidden panel). The final image—the negative held to green light—charges place and time. Detail selection reflects her professional ear, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: recover the hidden negative and, by extension, the house’s soul. Pressure tightens through puzzle-solving and a single physical test (finding the hollow behind the panel). Opposition is mostly environmental and internalized; tangible jeopardy is minimal, so the price reads more as duty than risk. Still, the deepening from data-gathering to legacy‑keeping provides a meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus decay and the burden of legacy emerges through concrete particulars (burned diaries, acoustic “sigh,” spectral family on the negative). The final recognition—“This was what the walls dreamed of”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity remains productive: recovery as rescue and inheritance as cost. Resonance is earned rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice carries a distinct perceptual signature (sound‑led noticing) with controlled lyricism. POV is steady and plausible, with inference aligned to her expertise. Rhythm modulates well between stillness and discovery. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is tight, image‑rich, and purposeful; sentences often do double duty (atmosphere plus action). Minimal scaffolding and no figurative muddle at peak beats. Variations in cadence keep momentum through description-heavy passages. The final line resolves by image and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer is a fresh lens; acoustics as map and key feels inventive. The negative’s layered portrait (architecture plus ghosts) is an elegant, non‑obvious twist on “legacy.” Choices arise organically from the premise rather than gimmickry. The risk is quietness, but the synthesis is distinctive.</comment>
