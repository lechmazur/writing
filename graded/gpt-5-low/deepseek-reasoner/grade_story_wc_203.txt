<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Leo’s motive and competence are crisp—his observant habit and duty to “read” the unresolved drive every choice. Interiority is restrained but present in the “weightless burden” frame and the quiet “Show me.” The ghost works as a pressure presence, though Leo faces little internal contradiction or struggle, keeping the arc elegant but low‑friction. The final act feels earned, if emotionally cool.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: dust pattern → ghost cue → cracked medallion → hidden mainspring → empty cylinder → restoration → chime → release. Orientation is swift and clean; single‑scene focus fits length. Closure lands on‑page with the bell’s chime and the ghost’s smile; the cost is mostly conceptual (years of secrecy and Leo’s ongoing burden), which reads, if softly. The drive lens is Causal and holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Specific, tactile environment—the brass grille, powdered dust, misaligned medallion, and gutted orchestral cylinder—anchors and directs action. The space constrains choices (ledger as step; ceiling compartment; safe) and charges the final image (dust‑free handprint). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a technician’s eye. Tone and setting cohere to support the reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure deepens via discovery rather than direct opposition; the ghost’s urgency narrows options toward the ceiling and safe. The tightening is clear and singular, with each find reweighting choices. Stakes remain intimate (free this spirit; restore the mechanism), and resolution depends on Leo’s agency. Cost is subdued but present as a relinquishment of the ghost and the end of a long‑kept secret.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of hidden truths, restoration, and the ethics of stewardship emerge through objects and action, not declaration. “Ceilings hide” refracts into the medallion and the mainspring as a stilled heart; the bell’s single note revalues the past with quiet grace. Ambiguity lingers productively around culpability and duty. No moralizing; resonance comes from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third’s perceptual signature—industrial, precise, tactile—stays consistent and apt. Diction balances lyric touches (“weightless burden”) with clean, technical clarity. Dialogue is minimal but pointed; narrative distance remains stable. Rhythm modulates well from hush to chime without showy intrusions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is tight, image‑rich, and purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple but don’t blur sense. No loops or cadence templates dull momentum; choreography is clean. The final line/image resolves with elegant economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ghost‑solver as elevator tech plus the horological reveal is a fresh synthesis, grounded in concrete craft. The puzzle’s physicality avoids genre cliché. It isn’t wildly risky, but the orchestral cylinder and dust‑forensics inflect the trope with specificity. The quiet, single‑note release feels earned and distinctive.</comment>
