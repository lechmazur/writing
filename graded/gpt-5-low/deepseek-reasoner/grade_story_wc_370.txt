<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (answering a plea to unearth wisdom in error) is clear and consistent with her compassionate reclusiveness, and her contradiction—leaving solitude to protect and learn—feels earned. Her key micro‑choice (to “stay while leaving”) arises organically from her empathy. However, the internal struggle is relatively frictionless; she adapts quickly with little felt risk of failure. The cost of self‑dissolution is intriguing but lightly sketched.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal spine (invitation → plaza → arch → library → presence → tactic) supported by textural escalation lands cleanly. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she survives and reframes knowledge through error, altering her relationship to solitude. Time pressure (midnight) and the guardian’s sweep give a concrete hinge. The cost at closure is more implied than dramatized, keeping it shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the plaza’s arch, the hovering orbs, and the moon-window all inform mood and logic. The library’s rules and the guardian directly constrain Elara’s tactic, and the invitation functions as a spatial key filtered through her empathy. Sensory detail is balanced across smell, temperature, and sound, embedded in action. A strong, coherent atmosphere underwrites the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (evade the knowledge‑eating presence without breaking her purpose) is clear and tightens at the midnight chimes. The meaningful turn is her shift from physical hiding to ontological blending; options narrow credibly. The tension sustains, but the pass‑by of the guardian feels a touch easy, with minimal on‑page jeopardy or loss. Still, pressure remains coherent and resolves through her chosen stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of humility-through-error coheres with the tactic’s paradox and the final book of mistakes. The ending reweights solitude as an active library rather than retreat. Some thematic lines tilt toward explicit statement (“the library’s true purpose”), slightly dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the core insight feels earned by the enacted paradox.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close voice is steady, with controlled cadence and a distinct perceptual bias toward textures, temperature, and silence. Psychic distance tightens under pressure without slips or head‑hopping. Elevated diction fits the contemplative mode and does not overreach. No dialogue is needed; narration does the action work cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied rhythm; sensory images do double duty for mood and stakes. A few abstractions (“a wave of cognitive frost,” “enlarged tranquility”) flirt with purple but stay legible. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing support momentum. The final cadence lands without line‑level muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “becoming the library” tactic and “wisdom in error” codex give a fresh twist to the secret‑library trope. The arch “hidden in plain sight” and the cost‑as‑dissolution image feel specific and memorable. Some elements (mysterious invitation/test) are familiar, slightly tempering novelty. Overall, the synthesis is cohesive and distinct.</comment>
