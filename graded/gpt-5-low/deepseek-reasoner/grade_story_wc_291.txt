<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s prosopagnosia and ritualized method create a distinct interior life, and the stated desire to awaken empathy is paid off with a concrete emotional shift at the end. Contradictory impulses—clinical distance versus yearning to feel—operate concurrently in scene. Actions (drawing, deducing, deciding to go to police) align with motive. Minor weakness: the deduction speed compresses struggle on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid drive: causal deduction through the ribbon → mask → contradictions → twin, landing in an accumulative charged-poise ending. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes the case and herself, with an on‑page cost (newly awakened, painful empathy) and a concrete next action. Orientation is clear early and the structure holds. Slight neatness in the twin leap tempers the score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The quarry’s “furrowed hush,” mist, and final sun “verdict” infuse mood and mirror the internal awakening with purposeful specificity. The object-as-setting (artist’s case, ribbon) is integrated into action. While the environment doesn’t materially constrain choices, it charges the final image and keeps spatial/tonal coherence. Sensory detail stays selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reopen the case to awaken empathy) is legible and tightens via the method that yields the twin hypothesis. The meaningful turn occurs when opposites unify and reweight the suspect pool, prompting the decision to go to police. The cost is internal rather than tactical; external opposition is minimal, which softens escalation. Tension sustains but remains largely contemplative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Masks, twins, absence-as-seeing, and “unifying opposites” braid cleanly into a theme about perception and empathy. The final image (sun striking like a verdict; going with a theory, not a face) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the question of how one “sees” truth and grief. No moralizing; the insight arises from particulars. Small risk: the thematic phrasing “to lance the wound” is repeated a touch literally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third voice is consistent, textured, and modulates with pressure without head‑hopping. Diction (“bowl of furrowed hush,” “preternatural accuracy”) reads intentional and character‑specific rather than generic purple. Purposeful compression of thought around the drawing sequence is clear. No dialogue, but narrative rhythm does the work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, purposeful metaphors that cohere to quarry/mask motifs, and minimal scaffolding. Information density is high with little redundancy; images often carry multiple jobs (setting, theme, mood). A few elevated constructions verge on lush, but they remain legible and controlled. The final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prosopagnosic portraitist solving a cold case by “seeing” absence and unifying opposites feels fresh and organically tied to theme. The twin twist is familiar but reframed through this character’s flaw and method, giving it new life. The quarry as contemplative crime scene is atmospheric without genre cliché overload. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent.</comment>
