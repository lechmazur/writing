<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to restore belonging—drives every micro‑choice, from respectful handling of bones to crafting a gnomon. Her internal tension between fear of disturbing the peace and thrill at beauty gives her texture. The final reconfiguration (finding the genealogy) is earned by prior patience and reverence. Slightly soft on visible, immediate cost beyond labor and vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: map → orchard → slab → rebuild gnomon → entrance → scrolls → repriced meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the sundial’s shadow “like a bridge,” connecting her to lineage. Orientation is solid from the outset. Cost is felt but modest, keeping it just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and functional—environment provides the olive branch for the gnomon and the sundial charges the final image. Sensory detail (damp earth, orange blossom, herbs, parchment) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. Spatial logic (slab, steps, chamber) is coherent and guides action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging/faith) tightens through discovering the inert sundial and committing to rebuild it. Agency drives escalation: she fashions the gnomon and physically opens the tomb. The price reads more as risk/respect and effort than concrete sacrifice, which slightly softens the edge of pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys refracts through the broken sundial and the discovered genealogy; the final shadow‑bridge image resonates. A single line (“Here was the faith she thought was lost”) edges toward explicitness. Overall, meaning arises from action and image rather than sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical but controlled cadence that suits the meditative quest. Perceptual choices (what she notices, how she moves) feel character‑specific. No head‑hopping or register drift; modulation tightens at key beats (trowel on stone, shadow aligning).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is elegant, image‑rich, and largely free of loops or scaffolding; sentences do multifold work (atmosphere, action, theme). A few abstractions (motivation statements) verge on tell but do not stall momentum. Rhythm varies and supports the quiet build to discovery and repricing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of diaspora return, catacomb orchard, and reactivated sundial is fresh and coherent. The gnomon fix as the key that unlocks lineage offers a non‑obvious yet inevitable turn. Stakes remain intimate but feel singular to this world and voice.</comment>
