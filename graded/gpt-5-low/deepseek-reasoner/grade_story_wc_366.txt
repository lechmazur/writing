<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elvan’s reticence and observational bent are dramatized through concrete choices—reading the letters, parsing the cairns, and relighting the lamp. Internal contradiction is light but present (a man of solitude assuming a public charge). The assumption of duty lands as a credible renunciation with felt cost. Minor limitation: emotional texture stays steady rather than compounding under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clear: dark lamp → missing keeper/notes → ghost’s lament + ship due → Elvan rekindles and assumes the role. Closure is a decisive change with cost (taking the charge, the ghost fading), cleanly on the page. The letters function as a motivated reveal rather than an info dump, tightening options. Slightly modest price display keeps it shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly embodied—the cold lens, wind in brass, rain‑slick dock—and it constrains tactics via wicks, fuel, and sightlines to cairns. Environment charges the final image (sea glass and new cairn in the lantern room). Sensory selection aligns with a practical seaman’s priorities. Occasional lyric flourish stays integrated with the scene’s physical demands.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the light before the ship arrives—is signaled early and coherently escalates through discovery to action. The meaningful tightening comes when Elvan recognizes the warning cairns and moves from witness to actor. The cost is chiefly vocational/psychic, not bodily, but it’s legible. No reversal beyond that shift, yet sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship and the desire to “bottle safety” emerges organically through the ghost’s letters, the dead lens, and Elvan’s final act. The sea glass/cairn reprise reweights the premise without moralizing. The piece sustains ache and responsibility without sentimentality. Complexity is quiet but convincing, inviting reflection on inheritance of duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person close maintains consistent distance and diction suited to a laconic, practical man touched by the uncanny. Lyrical turns are measured and character‑plausible. No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty; inference reads as inference. Rhythm tightens at action, breathes at discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line work is clean, varied, and purposeful; images do more than one job (lens as “cold, dead eye” sets tone and stakes). Minimal scaffolding and no evident loops; momentum holds through the reflective letter section. A few heightened phrases (“luminescent ache”) verge on purple but remain apt to tone. Syntax control supports clarity at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse‑ghost premise is familiar, but the anonymous letter chain and cairn signaling yield a fresh, integrated angle. Emotional specificity (a ghost trying to preserve a feeling, not just a light) lifts it. The resolution is inevitable yet earned. The piece stops short of a radical reimagining, hence strong rather than singular.</comment>
