<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and competence are clear and character‑particular, with tactile micro‑choices (mapping acoustics, crafting parts) revealing her mind. However, internal contradiction and felt cost are light; she faces little pressure that exposes flaw or divided impulse. The endurance of solitude and patience is implied rather than dramatized. The closing satisfaction is earned but emotionally calibrated on the safe side.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the accumulative design coheres toward the harmonic activation. The closure lands on the page with a charged final image (the stored echo) and a clear before/after in function. Cost is subdued—more conceptual than visceral—which trims the ceiling. Causality holds through the sonic method to the backward whirr and release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The marble cavern’s acoustics aren’t backdrop; they dictate method and literally trigger the climax via sun, wind, and stone. Details are POV‑filtered and purposeful (veined marble, quartz lens), charging the final image. The environment constrains tactics and supplies resources, satisfying the 9‑band gate. Vivid without excess breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative lens, pressure tightens through patterned study → reassembly → rare convergence. The decisive intensification is the natural flute’s note aligning with her mapped angles. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (preserving wonder) and cost is modest, but agency guides the deepening cleanly. No coincidence resolves; the environment’s timing is earned by her preparation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reason as a vessel for wonder emerges organically through tools, method, and the harvested echo, avoiding moralizing. The final sound functions as a repricing of memory and care. Ambiguity lingers productively (why the world will “need it”), inviting reflection without blur. Thematic weave is strong, if emotionally gentler than maximal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The controlled, lyrical third‑person maintains a distinct perceptual signature—craft‑minded, acoustically attuned—without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from meditative process to the humming convergence. Diction is elevated but coherent with the contemplative locksmith. Elision is purposeful; no withheld facts feel manipulative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and largely efficient; most lines do double duty for mood and mechanics. Occasional purple touches (“wounded season,” “cellar of reason”) skirt ornamental but don’t blur sense. Syntax varies and the final line lands cleanly. No notable loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The echo‑harvest device keyed to harmonic reflections in a marble cavern feels fresh and integrated. The backward‑ticking activation and quartz lens from the setting sharpen originality. Emotional risk is quieter than conceptual risk, but the synthesis is memorable. The piece commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>
