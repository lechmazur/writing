<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is precise and consistent—decode the feedback to save the voyage—and her competence drives clear micro‑choices (water bowl, lamp angle, soldering the bypass). The tactile/sound‑based perception grounds her interiority without generic labels. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she remains serenely assured throughout, so we miss a sharper stress fracture under time pressure. The apprentice and client add light external pressure but don’t force a relational crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: the failing core → water/light refraction test → diagnosis of overload → gold‑filament patch → drone’s chimes and departure. Orientation is strong by the first paragraph (who/where/what/when), and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure is decisively on‑page as the drone lifts and the horn sounds, though the cost is soft—no material loss or visible sacrifice beyond risk and time squeeze. The lens reads Causal and holds to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The depot’s mist, cold iron, and the shop’s warmth merge with tools (bowl, lamp, micro‑iron) to shape tactics and outcome. The water‑and‑light micro‑setting explicitly constrains choice and charges the final image as the drone exits into mist. Sensory filtering through sound/pressure is purposeful to POV. World rules are learned through action, not exposition, and scale matches the stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (maiden voyage in three hours; without the core, no direction). Escalation tightens once: the corrupted hum reveals the real problem and narrows options to a precise, risky patch. The resolution arises from her agency, but the path is fairly smooth—no meaningful setback or cost beyond clock pressure. Tension operates more through procedure than jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of translation, perception, and guidance are embodied rather than stated: blindness as a “lens,” noise as map, repair as interpretation. The water refraction motif reframes “vision,” culminating in the drone’s chimes—data become direction. Resonance lingers without moralizing, though ambiguity around personal cost is slight. The final image reweights earlier particulars with quiet confidence rather than surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is assured, tactile, and consistent with Elara’s sensory hierarchy; rhythm modulates from hush to lift-off. Dialogue is minimal but functional and in register. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference stays within what she could plausibly know. Lyric touches are controlled and serve pressure rather than blur it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, action, and mood—without padding; syntax varies and momentum holds. Occasional elevated phrases (“cavernous, cold iron belly,” “magnetic calm”) lean lush but remain coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or template cadence sequences dull the peak beats. The final sentence lands cleanly by image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind foreman decoding a hummingbird drone via water‑light acoustics—feels fresh and organically derived from character. The gold‑filament bypass as “bridge over a flooded river” smartly marries theme and method. While not radical, the piece avoids template plotting through specific, plausible craft detail and a distinctive perceptual angle. Closure feels earned and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
