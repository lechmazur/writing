<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and competencies are distinct and drive action—she trusts her tapestry over sanctioned observation and chooses the Western Gate strategy. Interiority is present but mostly declarative; fear and resolve surface without much contradictory pull beyond a brief hesitation. The beggar’s-shawl disguise clarifies values and risk. The arc lands, though the cost to her personally remains lightly felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: discovery via embroidery → decoding the hidden warning → strategy (Western Gate) → persuading the guard → coup foiled. Closure is decisive and on-page; the assassins are stopped by an action traceable to her choices. The cost is modest, with a relatively easy persuasion turn that slightly softens the climax’s weight. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the Hybrid lens leans Causal at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory, the city, the Western Gate, and especially the eternal candle create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere that shapes choices (unguarded gate as tactic). Sensory and professional specificity filter through Elara’s craft. World rules (the candle’s cold light revealing phosphorescence) are consistent and meaningful. The recurring candle-object charges the final image even if it’s not the mechanical key to the gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early: prevent a cosmological-political false flag and the coup. Pressure tightens through the tapestry’s “wrongness” to a single viable route (Western Gate), and the public stakes converge with her private risk. The persuasion beat resolves quickly, muting perceived cost and narrowing of options at the peak. Still, escalation coheres and is driven by her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of art as epistemology, hidden truths in “decoration,” and wisdom masked as folly are organically dramatized. The candle and tapestry motifs accrue meaning and reweight the ending. The final sentence edges toward tidy moralizing (“they finally learned to listen”), slightly flattening ambiguity. Subtext otherwise hums through images and choices rather than thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in craft and pattern-seeing. POV remains clean and bounded; certainty never outstrips what Elara can plausibly infer. Rhythm modulates well between hush and urgency without head-hopping. A few grand abstractions appear, but they don’t disrupt the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful imagery, and good sentence variety maintain momentum. The diction earns its elevation and avoids muddled metaphors. Minor repetition (“echoed silence”) and occasional abstraction slightly thin density in late beats, but clarity and propulsion hold. No scaffolding or noticeable loops at crucial moments.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The embroiderer-as-astronomer with an eternal, cold flame is an arresting synthesis; “adjacent possibilities” as method feels fresh. The conspiracy turn is familiar but transformed by the craft lens and object logic. The guard’s quick conversion is trope-adjacent, slightly lowering distinctiveness at the climax. Overall, the piece risks lyric worldbuilding in service of plot and largely succeeds.</comment>
