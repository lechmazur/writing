<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (preserve ancient methods) is clear and embodied in how she studies and coaxes the knot, not merely stated. Interiority is specific and tactile (cold in boots, fog on hood), though true contradictory impulses are minimal. Her agency at the peak—choosing patience over force—aligns cleanly with her identity. The relationship with Amos adds quiet pressure but doesn’t significantly complicate her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Structure holds as a single, continuous scene with a clean accumulative drive: attention → decoding → transformation → reframe. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the knot becomes mandala and the fulgurite redefines “weaving.” Cost is subtle (self-redefinition and responsibility; endurance in cold/fog) but present. Orientation is crisp early; no causality gaps or teleports.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the snow‑dusted dock, fog, and rope are not postcard; they isolate, hush, and physically enable the decoding. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s craft‑gaze. The fulgurite/rope become micro‑settings that charge the final image. Weather and water shape tone and options without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock the method/knowledge) is clear and tightens when the knot resists, then unfurls into a charged pattern. Escalation comes through a deepening of pattern recognition rather than overt peril, consistent with an accumulative lens. The price is modest but legible: she spends trust, patience, and bodily comfort to achieve the shift. Resolution stems from her chosen tactic (gentle pressure) rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of patience, preservation, and potential emerge from concrete actions (coaxing the knot with fulgurite) rather than abstract sermonizing. The realization that the weavers “wove potential” lands in image and action, though one explanatory line edges toward explicit statement. The final image reweights prior details without tidy moralizing. Subtext in Amos’s quiet guardianship adds depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—salt, rope, light, and quiet—without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well: long sensory lines narrow into precise action at the knot’s turn. Dialogue is minimal but natural and subtextual. Lexicon matches Elara’s craft and temperament.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑rich, and mostly economical; lines often do double duty (atmosphere and action). A few phrases verge on lushness, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Sentence variety and paragraphing support the scene’s hush and intensification. No notable loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fulgurite as lightning‑rooted key, knot‑as‑map, and “weaving potential” synthesize into a fresh, coherent mythos. The seed collector lens grounds the magic with tactile craft. The risk is quiet but confident, avoiding genre template beats. Closure feels earned and particular to these objects and this place.</comment>
