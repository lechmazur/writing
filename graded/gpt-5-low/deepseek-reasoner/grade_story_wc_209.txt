<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (hours of study, prying up the stone) align with her motive. Interiority is textured through sensory noticing rather than labels. The internal contradiction is mild—more longing than conflicted compulsion—so the final shift reads earned but gentle. Stakes are primarily existential/intellectual, which keeps cost subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation, lens, and causality are clean: study → spectral beam → loose flagstone → journal → conceptual answer and new vow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (faith as unseen pact via moths), with a final decision to paint the pavilion ceiling. The cost is delicate (solitude, relinquishing the romance of “moon-only” mystery) rather than hard, which trims impact slightly. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cathedral window’s materials and light physics are specific, profession-filtered, and decisively constrain discovery (the violet beam pinpoints the stone). Atmosphere is rich without touristic clutter, and the environment charges the ending image. The amber pavilion reprises to frame the final choice. Detail selection feels purposeful and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently from patient watching to an on-page discovery and retrieval. The dominant stake—understanding—tightens via the rare beam and the tactile risk of lifting a stone in a silent cathedral. Consequence is primarily internal and artistic, limiting the felt price. Still, the deepening of knowledge is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, unseen labor, and faith in the hidden world arise organically from actions and images (moths, glass, pressed flowers). The grandmother’s journal reframes the nocturnal bloom as relational rather than solitary, answering the story’s question without sermonizing. The final choice to paint for moths extends the theme into future action. Subtext carries through silence and light rather than statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a visual artist’s perceptual bias. Diction and rhythm modulate around key beats (the beam, the kneeling, the journal) without head-hopping. No dialogue is needed; the intimacy and certainty remain plausible for close third. Occasional elevated phrasing fits the aesthetic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight, image-dense, and varied in rhythm, with minimal scaffold and no evident loops. Figurative choices (violet light, flawed bubble, lead cames) are precise and coherent. A slight tendency toward lushness never muddies clarity. The final image resolves cleanly and recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of stained glass optics, a hidden inheritance, and moth-guided blooms is fresh and particular. The discovery mechanism (spectral shift to a specific stone) feels inventive and inevitable in hindsight. The closing pivot to painting for moths via pavilion ceiling is a non-obvious, fitting turn. Risk-taking is quiet but confident.</comment>
