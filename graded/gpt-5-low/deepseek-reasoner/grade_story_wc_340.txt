<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—seeking joy beneath anguish—consistently drives his choices, from examining the goggles to orchestrating the penthouse reveal. Interiority is precise yet restrained, befitting a servant’s trained detachment. The relationship beat with the new resident lands without dialogue, showing status and empathy through action. The main limitation is low visible cost or internal contradiction; Kael rarely struggles.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: discovery of goggles → diary revealed via scattered light → decision to stage a silent handover → the resident’s reactivation. Orientation is crisp by the fifth-floor marker, and the elevator clock structures progression. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael reframes “service” as facilitation of joy across time. Cost is subtle (a quiet renunciation of mere task-following), but the before/after is legible in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire, brass elevator, and high-altitude sunbreak are vivid and purposeful. Environment and objects constrain tactic: only scattered light through the cloud gap makes the diary legible. The atmosphere mirrors and pressures the emotional frost thawing at the end. Details are selective and integrated into action rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Kael kindle joy in the new resident—tightens via the ticking floors and the diary’s partial opacity until the penthouse test. The decisive beat is the unfolding of the meal wrapper and silent offering of tools. Escalation is gentle but coherent under an accumulative/causal blend. The cost is modest, but the narrowing of options (speak vs. enact) is clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: joy not beneath but woven through anguish, embodied by the smiley wrapper and rigging-laughter memory. Subtext is carried through silence, objects, and a servant’s nonintrusive agency rather than moralizing. The final image reweights the premise without telling us what to feel. Slight neatness tempers complexity, but the resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled close-third with a subtle, precise diction matching Kael’s temperament. The voice modulates with pressure (floors, light-beam moment) without over-explaining. No head-hopping or withheld-knowledge tricks. Lyric touches stay within the POV’s plausible noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-forward; lines carry multiple jobs (world, action, emotion). Occasional flourishes (“Braille for the eyes,” “thread of gold in grey cloth”) are apt and not overstacked. No scaffold loops or cadence ruts; momentum holds. Minor purple edging in a couple phrases keeps this short of top-tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—antique goggles decoding a filigreed diary via scattered light inside a cloud-top spire—feels fresh and purposeful. The elevator-clock structure and the nonverbal service ethic give the piece an original stance. Turns arise from prior particulars; the smiley face reveal is simple yet earned. It’s not radical, but it’s distinctly its own.</comment>
