<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hideo’s motive—appreciating hidden effort—suffuses action and perception, and his key micro‑choices (lifting the whisk, withholding the whistle, the final, gentle defiance) align with a coherent, particular interiority. The “demure audacity” tension reads in scene rather than label. Status dynamics with the headman are legible and shift when the light‑net appears. The endurance choice at the end feels earned, though the personal cost remains modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual gathers density until the headman’s challenge forces a cadence shift; the coalescing fireflies function as on‑page closure (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis). Orientation is clear early, and the final image reconfigures the premise with a felt social cost. The cause‑and‑effect remains lyrical but coherent: ritual → interruption → demonstration → stance. The price is understated (social censure and neglected work), but present on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering parapet after rain, mossy steps, and mist aren’t decorative; they enable the fireflies and constrain movement and mood, charging the final image. Detail selection is POV‑true (a mender’s eye for nets transposed onto light). The bamboo whisk and wet stone recur as lived micro‑setting. Weather, elevation, and season directly shape events.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the headman’s demand versus Hideo’s ritual; the meaningful tightening is Hideo’s refusal to whistle and the subsequent formation of the light‑net. Stakes are scaled to quiet social legitimacy and purpose, not grand, but clear. The resolution grows from Hideo’s agency with a credible, if gentle, cost. A slightly sharper consequence would heighten the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—valuing hidden mending over visible holes—emerges organically through image and action, culminating in the living net. However, the explicit verbalization (“You see the hole… I see the mending…”) edges into thesis‑statement territory in the final movement, dulling subtext. The closing whistle recovers resonance by returning to image. Overall, it invites reflection without full sermonizing but flirts with it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Hideo’s perceptual signature; diction suits a contemplative craftsman. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and carries status and subtext efficiently. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well at the demonstration and at the quiet coda.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical for its mode, with strong sensory layering and purposeful metaphors (living net, moon paths). A few elevated choices (“scintillatingly somber”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and character‑inflected. Momentum holds; minimal redundancy. Syntax varies to match pressure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a net‑mender’s eye with firefly choreography and a tea whisk as ritual instrument feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The demonstration scene reinvents a familiar “skeptic witnesses wonder” beat through craft‑specific logic. Risks in tone and lyricism pay off without obscurity. It stops short of radical reinvention only in the familiarity of the moral friction.</comment>
