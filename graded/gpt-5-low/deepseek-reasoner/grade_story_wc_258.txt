<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity and inherited duty are clear and consistent, driving each choice from measuring to prying up the floorboard. Interiority is specific to her craft, filtered through tools and pattern-thinking. The change at the end (from analyst to keeper/activator) lands but the cost is largely conceptual, with limited on‑page ambivalence or contradiction. The Leo beat adds validation rather than pressure on her flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal leading to Conceptual Repricing at closure. Each discovery (“circuitry” on the tape → matched to The Circuit → building → floorboard → journal) flows because/therefore, culminating in a reweighted role. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the closure’s cost is responsibility rather than a concrete sacrifice, but it’s legible. The chain avoids coincidences resolving the core question.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The skylight loft, rain, and the tactile table/tools are vivid and integrated, not backdrop. The loft physically contains the secret (floorboard) and is thematically revalued as a nexus, charging the final image. The measuring tape as micro‑setting/tool meaningfully guides choices. Weather texture supports tone without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are intellectual-to-civic: decode patterns to reveal purpose. Escalation is a single, clean deepening when the patterns point to her own building and the hidden journal. The pressure is coherent but gentle; there’s no real resistance, so the price reads as assumed duty rather than a hard trade‑off. Still, the narrowing from many paths to one obligation provides a credible tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of resilience, analogue return, and designed community support emerge through objects and method, not just statement. The grandmother’s foresight reframes divination as infrastructure, which resonates with the closing constellation image. A touch of explanatory dialogue edges toward thesis‑telling, but the final image earns conceptual weight. Ambiguity remains productive rather than vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is steady and sensorially selective, with a distinctive professional lexicon (“alignment and proportion,” “scale”). The lyric narration modulates without drifting register; dialogue is brief and functional, with Leo’s awe supporting subtext more than exposition. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm supports discovery beats cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑rich, and mostly economical; rain/ink/light motifs carry multiple loads. Occasional abstracting phrases about cultural patterns and systems lightly slow momentum but do not obscure causality. Syntax varies and avoids scaffolding loops. The closing cadence is precise and recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Cartomancy as architectural blueprint via a measuring tape schematics is a fresh synthesis. The post‑crypto analogue pivot and “reverse engineering” of human nature feel original and internally coherent. Turns are earned from established particulars rather than late rule changes. The piece takes aesthetic risks without losing clarity.</comment>
