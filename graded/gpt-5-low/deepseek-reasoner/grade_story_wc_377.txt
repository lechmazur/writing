<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and embodied—she labors for days to restore “the color of wonder,” and her seasonal muteness pushes action over explanation. Micro‑choices (placing the fragment, adjusting counterweights, waking to push rings) reveal disciplined endurance. What’s missing is a sharper contradictory impulse under pressure; her serenity never fractures, so internal tension remains limited. The final Earned Stasis feels credible and paid for, though more friction would deepen it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the slow build from frozen silence to the “symphony of truth” is coherent and causal: storm → discovery → placement → sustained motion → melting → resonance → restoration. Closure lands on the page with cost—the rare fragment is consumed and Elara spends days of labor; silence returns charged. Orientation is clean and the world rule (meaning via resonance/light) holds. The inciting coincidence (iceberg fragment falling) complicates but does not resolve, which is sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bluff’s altitude, wind, sun, ice, and the kinetic sculpture’s physicality are not décor—they constrain pace, tactics, and deliver the final image (drops striking tuned brass, light flowing down to villages). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, especially the prismatic light and metallic groan. World rules are taught through use rather than exposition. The environment charges both the process and the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stake (revive wonder) is clear, and pressure tightens via a patient grind: long labor, fragile momentum, and the fragment’s finite melt. The decisive intensification is the first drop’s tone that reweights reality, with the price of the fragment’s loss. There’s no hard reversal or forced trade‑off beyond endurance, which keeps it from the highest band, but within the chosen lens the deepening is sufficient and earned. The coincidence does not do the solving; Elara’s sustained agency does.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: a post‑verbal world made legible through resonance, truth as embodied chord, wonder as perceivable color. The final image offers a non‑literal answer—truth needs no translation, only listening—and reweights prior material. A slightly declarative line (“Words were, and always had been, unnecessary.”) edges toward thesis, but the piece mostly lets image and action carry meaning. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative rather than sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and consistent, lyric without blur, with a clean single POV that notices through craft and sound. Rhythm modulates well from patient effort to luminous release. No dialogue is needed; the diction suits a world where resonance supersedes speech. No stance leakage or head‑hopping appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences are clear, well‑paced, and often do multiple jobs; images like “a harmony of facts” land cleanly. There’s minor lushness, but metaphor remains coherent and physical logic holds. Momentum through the long middle avoids loops by anchoring shifts (push, adjust, glisten, drop). The final cadence resolves with a precise, charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a seasonally mute bell tuner in a post‑verbal world orchestrating truth by melting a sky‑fallen verity through a kinetic sculpture to restore wonder’s color. The tactic follows from the world’s rules and character’s craft, not a gimmick. The final reconfiguration is inevitable in hindsight once the fragment is placed. It risks quietness and commits to it without hedging.</comment>
