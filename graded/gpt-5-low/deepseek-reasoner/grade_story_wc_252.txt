<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arden’s motive—yearning for freedom inside compulsory peace—is clear and escalates credibly to the renunciatory choice. Interiority is specific (dock grace, black sand, bone’s heat) and the cost is felt when he releases name and history. A slight convenience appears in his sudden “knowing” about the island’s rules, but the emotional logic holds. Contradictory impulses (safety vs. wild nature) are active through the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with a causal spine (find scrimshaw → sail → song → heart → surrender) supported by lyric accumulation. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: detachment and metamorphosis on the page. The island’s function and the scrimshaw-as-tumbler stitch earlier beats to the climax cleanly. The “he understood the core concept” line is a small tell, but it doesn’t break escalation or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Environment and object are tactically active: the whale song and cliffs’ parting tie setting directly to choice. Sensory specificity (black cliffs, whispering pines, vibrating hull, crystalline heart) charges the final image. The scrimshaw-as-tool functions as micro‑setting at the hinge. World rules are learned through action rather than exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging vs. imprisonment—tightens from discovery to the island’s plea, forcing the renunciation. The meaningful turn is the required detachment, which forecloses his former life with a felt cost. Pressure coheres via the whale’s call intensifying and the island trembling. Resolution is earned by Arden’s agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—freedom through surrender of self—emerges from concrete acts, not sermon. The “combative tenderness” frame is dramatized by the fierce renunciation that is also love. Final images (island fading; moonlight whale answered from the abyss) reweight everything with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; the insight is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is steady, with controlled elevation that matches the mythic register. Diction and rhythm modulate as pressure rises without head‑hopping or register breaks. No dialogue is needed; the perceptual signature (seafaring, tactile, whale‑song attunement) is coherent. Occasional declaratives (“He understood the core concept”) slightly flatten but don’t derail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum and density; images do multiple jobs (island-heart mirrors his heart and sets stakes). Figurative language is rich but largely clean and legible in peak beats. Minimal scaffold or repetition; syntax varies to fit cadence shifts. A few abstract phrases could be tightened, yet clarity at closure remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Scrimshaw as tumbler + vanishing island-heart + cetacean apotheosis synthesizes familiar motifs into a fresh, cohesive myth. The peace-as-cage premise adds an unusual social constraint that personalizes the quest. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the story’s logic. It risks lyric grandeur without gimmickry and sticks the landing.</comment>
