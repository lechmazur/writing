<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivations are clear and embodied: Kael teaches without words; Elian seeks a new language. Elian’s tremor and gradual competence give concrete interior progression, though contradictory impulses are lightly sketched. The relationship is the crucible and shifts credibly with visible cost (fatigue, risk of vulnerability). Depth is strong for length but not searingly complex.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirror lesson → shutter language → student’s own pattern. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt price (exertion, exposure, acceptance of a new voice). Orientation is crisp, and the final shared gaze reweights the world without didactic tying-off. Cost is modest but present on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, post‑rain gleam, and canal’s reflective surface directly enable the light‑weaving tactic and charge the ending image. Objects (mirror, shutters) and weather constrain choices and outcomes, not mere wallpaper. Sensory selection tracks purpose and mood. Setting is inseparable from the story’s logic and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a voice in silence—tightens from observation to action. The decisive deepening occurs when Elian takes the ropes and begins to speak via light; the price is effort and exposure. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A touch more jeopardy or foreclosed alternative would lift intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of “silent empathy” emerges through concrete acts and is answered non‑literally in the final constellation on water. Recurring images (star in mirror; shutters’ pattern) evolve meaning rather than repeating symbols. The piece avoids moralizing; it invites reflection on language, mentorship, and darkness as a canvas. Slight sentimentality softens the edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person is consistent, confident, and apt for the meditative pressure. Diction and rhythm feel intentional; silence and gestures are rendered with clarity. Elevated phrasing fits the fable‑like stance without head‑hopping or stance slips. A few heightened choices flirt with purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, image‑dense, and propulsive for a quiet piece. A few ornate phrases (“spiralingly calm,” “teach its darkness the value of stars”) edge toward over‑embellishment, but coherence holds. No significant loops or scaffold deadweight; sentences do multiple jobs. Rhythm supports escalation and lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a dental mirror capturing starlight, shutters weaving messages to the world, and silence as a communicative medium. The tactic is specific and drives the arc; the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic, not gimmicky, and they pay off. Minor familiarity in mentor‑student frame keeps it shy of the rarest tier.</comment>
