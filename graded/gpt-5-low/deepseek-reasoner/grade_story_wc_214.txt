<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is concrete and particular—his ritual with the shard, the broom dropped, the breathless recoil—anchoring motive and change. The stillness/motion contradiction is embodied in his empathic jolt and aftermath. The decision to return nightly reconfigures his purpose credibly. A touch of tidy articulation (“To find strength in vulnerability…”) trims some ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: the meteor shower intensifies attention → the glass‑mediated tracing → the empathic burn → a chosen new practice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he is shaken, his role redefined). Orientation is clean from the opening. Cost is felt, if modest, and the pattern holds to the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The station’s hush, the dead monitors, the dome, and dust motes are vivid and integrated, not postcard. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro‑setting and tool, constraining tactics and charging the final image. Sensory detail serves POV priorities (maintenance, silence, light). World rules stay consistent without exposition drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to meet the cosmos without betraying stillness—is signaled early and tightens through the empathic shock. The jolt is a meaningful deepening with felt price that alters tactics (he chooses ongoing vulnerable witnessing). No antagonist is needed; pressure remains coherent. Stakes skew internal but land clearly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action—the shard’s “tiny sun,” the sacrificial burn, stillness redefined as fullness—and culminates in a charged ritual. However, explicit thesising (“To find strength in vulnerability…”) blunts subtext, especially near the end. The final image still resonates beyond the stated moral. Complexity is present, but slightly over‑explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly limited to Aris’s way of noticing. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from meditative cleaning to breathless shock). No head‑hopping or stance slips. Elevated register matches the contemplative, cosmic frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum; images like “dust motes dancing in the beams of dead monitors” are precise and earned. Figurative density stays legible at peak beats; no muddled metaphors or scaffold loops. Minor lyric lushness never obscures causality. The last line recharges prior motifs without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “cosmic janitor” premise and the glass‑mediated empathy feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The decision to reject the grand machines in favor of a flawed shard is a strong, specific twist on familiar cosmic awe. Risks are controlled and coherent. A hair more asymmetry or unforeseen consequence could push it higher.</comment>
