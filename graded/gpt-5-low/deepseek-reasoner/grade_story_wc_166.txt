<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—defying a nostalgia ban by inscribing a forbidden cosmos into her skin—is clear, embodied, and consistent with her “elective exile.” The grief/defiance tension gives her an internal contradiction that resolves credibly in the final act. Micro-choices (timing, tool use, completion of the final star) align with her past as a tide dancer. Cost is mostly pain and risk implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening the peak test.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration with Earned Stasis. The scene coheres and tightens toward the ignition of the verse; the before/after is legible as she reconfigures exile into a portable eternity. Orientation is clean from the outset; the causal chain is simple but sufficient. The cost is implied (illegality, solitude, pain) rather than confronted on the page, keeping it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the twilight garden and moonlit tools shape timing and charge the final image. The moonstone pigment and the bench function as micro-setting objects that matter to action and closure. Sensory detail is lush yet filtered through Elara’s priorities (the hour she can bear, the sea she once danced). World rules (nostalgia ban) are consistent and learned through lived detail, not dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing a forbidden verse—is clear, and escalation is a density increase culminating in the seven-pointed star and ignition. The tightening is internal and craft-driven rather than oppositional; options narrow mainly by commitment to completion. Visible cost is modest on the page (pain, risk kept off-stage). The resolution is earned but not pressure-cooked.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory as rebellion and art as survival emerge through concrete acts (inking, resurrecting outlawed constellations). Subtext lives in absences (“observing gaps,” widows’ reaching hands) and the final reweighting of exile. One line tips toward thesis-stating (“She had not broken the ban; she had simply rewritten it”), slightly reducing subtlety. The final image re-situates the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person lyrical voice is consistent, controlled, and specific to Elara’s sensibility as dancer-cartographer. Rhythm modulates well from poised stillness to luminous crescendo. Elevated diction fits the fable-like register and remains internally coherent. No dialogue, but the narrative stance stays steady and credible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density and strong image economy (moonstone dust, seven-pointed star). The prose occasionally flirts with purple (“obsidian grace,” repeated), but coherence holds and rhythm is varied. Minimal redundancy; sentences carry multiple jobs. The closure image lands clearly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—nostalgia ban + tide-dancer turned flesh-cartographer using star-dust pigment—is fresh and coherent. The ignition of living constellations on skin reframes exile in a non-obvious way. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off. A touch more on-page resistance could have pushed into the exceptional band.</comment>
