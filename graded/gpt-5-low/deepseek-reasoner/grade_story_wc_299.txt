<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Leo’s interior is concrete and particular—hands that “wrangled speaker stacks” now tremble; he appraises weave counts to avoid emotion—yielding a credible contradiction. Micro‑choices (opening the box, appraising as insulation, digging out road cases, reading the inscription, choosing to search) trace a motivated turn. The renunciation of his protective detachment carries felt cost and is earned by prior beats. Slight neatness in the epiphany trims the top end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal drive is clean: package arrival → sensory/occupational appraisal → past resurfaces → inscription reframes purpose → decisive action to reengage with music. Orientation is immediate (quarry trailer, appraiser, package), and the closure is an on‑page decision that reconfigures options. The cost—abandoning the safety of “facts” and facing the silence after applause—is legible. Stakes are intimate and soft, but the chain holds without wobble.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The quarry trailer, cracked pleather, limestone dust, and stale coffee create a vivid, lived‑in atmosphere filtered through Leo’s sensibility. The speaker cloth functions as a charged micro‑setting/object, anchoring smell, touch, and history. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it decisively charges tone and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, not catalogued.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake: whether Leo remains insulated or risks purpose again. The photo inscription is a meaningful tightening that forces a stance and leads to a concrete choice (searching venues). Cost is interior but credible. Escalation is measured rather than sharp, keeping this shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—what remains “after the applause” is the act of creation—emerges from object, setting, and choice and resonates in the final hopeful lookup. However, lines like “His purpose wasn’t to appraise it… it had been the act of creation” veer toward on‑the‑nose moralizing. Subtext does operate in the cloth, the smell, and the quarry silence reframed as canvas. The ending’s image earns reflection, even if the thesis is partly stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, textured third‑person close flows with occupational lexicon and sensory precision, modulating from sardonic grit to charged poise. The perceptual signature—facts as insulation, sound metaphors—feels character‑bound. No head‑hopping or stance slippage occurs. Minor expository turns at the end are contained by voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with strong verbs and concrete nouns; images like “skin of a beast” and “veil… gods on stage” are vivid without excess. Rhythm varies and momentum holds. There is slight redundancy around “purpose” and a touch of declarative summary in the final third, but not enough to drag. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ex‑roadie‑turned‑appraiser frame and the speaker cloth as catalyst are fresh and authentically rendered. The “after the applause” angle is not novel in concept, but it’s made specific through tactile detail and professional gaze. The turn from valuation to creation feels earned rather than templated. Risk is modest but cohesive.</comment>
