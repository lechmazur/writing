<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—reclaiming utility from dereliction—and her choices (gantry mapping, pipe realignment, solar calibration) align with that drive. Interiority is specific and embodied through workmanlike focus rather than declarations. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she meets little psychological or relational resistance, limiting depth. The endurance over three days hints at cost but doesn’t expose a conflicted hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: discovery of sextant piece → vantage shift → plan → three‑day execution → solar activation/steam. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant final image (“a new heart”). Cost is present as solitude and labor, though modest. Orientation is solid early; the inferred lens is Causal and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The spaceport’s physicality—fractured dome, capillary pipes, gantry, floor grates—both constrains and enables tactics and charges the ending image. Details are selective and purpose‑driven, filtered through an engineer’s perception (utilities routing, solar arc). The recurring tool/object (sextant) and architecture shape action and final resonance. World rules stay consistent without expository drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repurposing the terminal—tightens once when the plan converts to activation and steam arrives. Escalation is largely procedural, with minimal pushback or reversal; success arrives without a significant obstacle besides toil. The cost is endurance and isolation, not a tough trade‑off under pressure. The final choice feels earned but light on consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of resurrecting hope through deliberate engineering emerges organically from action and image (navigation tool guiding a new “circulatory system”). The “maze of intentions” reframes into a functional flowchart, reweighting the place’s meaning without moralizing. The quiet victory in heat/light delivers a resonant non‑literal answer to the central question. Ambiguity remains in the social cost/scale, which suits the piece’s stoic register.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and voice‑coherent—lyrical but grounded in technical noticing. Diction modulates well between awe and precision. One brief artifact (“清晰的”) jars slightly but doesn’t break stance. No dialogue to test, and the interior texture stays consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, purposeful, and rhythmic, with strong noun‑verb choices and layered images (“graveyard of grandeur,” “new circulatory system”). Minor redundancy and a single tonal glitch (“清晰的”) nick polish. Figurative density mostly supports rather than muddles. Momentum holds through the build and the payoff image is crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Repurposing an abandoned spaceport into a passive “light refinery” via a sextant‑guided solar/capillary system feels fresh and coherent. The explorer’s instrument as key to future utility is an elegant synthesis. While opposition is light, the conceptual leap and image chain feel distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking is present without gimmickry.</comment>
