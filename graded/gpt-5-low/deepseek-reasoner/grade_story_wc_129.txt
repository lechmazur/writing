<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s desire “to graft herself onto community” clearly motivates each step, and her refusal to expose the artist in favor of pledging her hands is an earned, character‑specific choice. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft and environment rather than labels. The internal tension between loyalty to the community’s curiosity and protection of the artist is credible but could register a sharper felt cost. Still, the final pledge and collaborative making show a meaningful, motivated shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: tag appears → communal search → Elara tracks clues → encounter → concealment → public dedication and build. Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration: she chooses welcome over exposure and begins weaving a literal bridge. The cost is implied (risking community trust) rather than dramatized, softening impact. Orientation is crisp early and the single transition is controlled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, crater lake, obsidian arbor, and luminescent moss are vivid and specific, filtered through Elara’s artisan eye. Setting resources (reeds, moss, the arbor) directly feed the action and charge the final glowing image. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain options, it meaningfully frames community and outcome. The world’s rules feel consistent and are learned through observation and use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—belonging and ethical welcome—but pressure escalates gently rather than decisively. The strongest tightening beat is Elara facing the community’s palpable expectation and choosing to promise instead of reveal. The price of that choice is mostly conceptual and soft on the page; no immediate backlash or sacrificed resource registers beyond trust risk. The lyric accumulation sustains tension without a sharp turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of art as language and community as chosen “weave” emerges organically through actions and images rather than thesis. The final glowing lattice reweights prior motifs (tag, reeds, light) into a resonant answer about belonging without moralizing. Ambiguity persists—welcome vs. secrecy—enriching the afterimage. A few explicit phrases repeat the premise, but they don’t overwhelm subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is steady, controlled, and sensorially biased by a craftworker’s perception. Diction (“luminescent ache,” “geodesic fruit”) is elevated yet coherent for this world. POV discipline holds, with purposeful modulation at the public vow. Minimal dialogue is effective and not over‑explained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with strong image economy; verbs and nouns do most of the work. The prose occasionally tilts toward purple (stacked glow/shimmer lexicon) but remains legible and rhythmic. Repetition of luminous descriptors creates slight sameness but not drag. Syntax variety supports momentum into the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of marsh‑craft, luminescent moss graffiti, and a community defined by post‑linguistic quiet feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The turn from detection to sanctuary via collaborative tagging is non‑obvious and thematically apt. Risks in worldbuilding and tone pay off without obscuring clarity. The final act avoids a conventional reveal, opting for a crafted welcome that reframes pursuit.</comment>
