<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—seeking release from a former self—drives clear, credible choices, and her embodied perceptions (cloud‑moss, chill, brittle plastic) keep emotion grounded. The internal contradiction (wanting to let go vs. needing that blueprint to endure) plays in-scene and culminates in a believable renunciation/reconfiguration. Dialogue with the ghost sharpens status and stakes. Minor ding for slightly thesis-like lines (“I am not your regret. I am your blueprint.”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence → apparition → reframe → charged final image. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing; the cost is accepting regret as a “useful tool,” not purging it. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence maintained. The because/therefore chain is subtle but intact (her collected stories → token choice → ghost’s reframe → her new stance).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, cloud‑moss, and halted carousel are vivid and POV-filtered, setting tone and reinforcing the “potential vs. stillness” motif. The carousel’s halt and the camera wheel function as micro‑settings/objects that charge the final image. World rules feel consistent without heavy exposition. Not a hard physical constraint, but the environment meaningfully frames the negotiation and charges the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: severing vs. partnering with the past self. The tightening turn is the ghost’s reframe that forecloses the “let me go” path and forces acceptance with cost. The final choice (to keep the blueprint and act) is earned and internal-external beats interweave via the token. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (untaken pictures, halted carousel, eroded ambitions as foundation) and lands in a resonant, non‑literal answer: ambition reshaped rather than discarded. Subtext operates in the object’s “empty potential” and the tonal shift from fractured stillness to stillness. A touch of explicitness in the ghost’s lines trims subtlety, but the final image restores it. Emotional aftereffect is quiet and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled third‑person with a distinct, lyrical texture; perception is selective and character‑bound. Dialogue reads stylized but purposeful and subtextual, fitting the fable‑like register. Rhythm modulates cleanly at the turn and closing cadence. No POV leakage or unmotivated register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density, clean syntax, and purposeful imagery; most lines do more than one job. Figurative language is consistent (mechanical/lagoon/photographic) and avoids mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffold or loops; the reprise of “stillness” is functional, not redundant. A few faintly purple edges remain contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blend of cloud‑lagoon carousel, a ghost as blueprint, and a disposable camera wheel of untaken photos feels fresh and integrated. The turn recontextualizes regret without cliché and the final object-charge is memorable. Risks in diction and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
