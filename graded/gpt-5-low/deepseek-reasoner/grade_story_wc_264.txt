<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s conflict between conditioning/protocol and the rekindled “spark” is clear and dramatized through micro‑choices (stopping, disembarking, touching the box). Interiority is particular (the “migraine made cosmos,” eyes watering at impossible geometries) and ties to action. The final renunciation—remaining as custodian—reads as earned, though the felt cost is framed more as exaltation than loss. A touch more embodied ambivalence at the end would deepen the price paid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly → contact with the archive → overwhelming perception → guided curation → chosen stasis. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the closure lands on the page with cost (“She would remain here… forever”). The frozen clock and gardener stance reconfigure the premise into a charged poise. No causality breaks or late rule patches mar the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful: ash wastes vs. bioluminescent dune, the brass box, the frozen chess clock. The environment and objects constrain/charge choices (she must disembark; the clock anchors timelines and the final image). Sensory selection is filtered by her role and state, and the world rules emerge through action. The dune’s petals returning as windows to stabilized worlds elegantly charge the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens: anomaly compels a stop, contact forces a torrent she must manage, and the choice to remain narrows her future. Stakes are legible (save/leak of potential realities) and the price—enduring custodianship—is clear. While not antagonist‑driven, internal and external conflicts interlock effectively. The escalation is a single strong deepening rather than multiple reversals, apt for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of attention as creation and neutrality repurposed as stewardship arises from concrete acts (guiding threads, selecting timelines of “love over war”). The final image reweights the premise without a stated moral, though “love prevailed over war” edges toward the generic. Subtext of protocol vs. compassion and gardener vs. guard is coherent. Resonance lingers via the midnight clock and lullaby motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the POV’s training and altered state. Elevated diction fits the speculative register and intensifies appropriately under pressure without head‑hopping. Purposeful compression at the wave‑function beat is legible and paid off. No dialogue needed; interior cadence carries the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are generally tight with strong image density and propulsion. A few stacked metaphors verge on purple (“silent, screaming voids,” “migraine made cosmos”), but they remain coherent and on theme. Minimal scaffold or repetition; syntax varies well. Copy is clean and the final line recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Divergent archive” plus a chess‑clock anchor and a dreamless custodian offers a fresh synthesis. Familiar SF edges (multiverse, quantum perception) are transformed by precise, character‑tied stakes and a gardener ethos. Risks in lyric mode pay off without obscuring clarity. The vision feels specific and memorable rather than templated.</comment>
