<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, urgent motivation (“to find the quiet in the storm”) drives precise, tactile choices (whispering into ice, positioning the stone). Embodied anxiety (“hammered repose,” teeth-vibrating hum) grounds her interiority. Contradictory impulses are present but light—control versus desperation—without a sharp internal clash. The transformation to “keeper of equilibrium” is earned but its cost (obsolete maps, depletion) is more conceptual than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: hum vs. hush builds toward a reweighted rule—silence as active force. The on‑page closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the caves integrate the energy beings; the price is the relinquished old maps and the sustained effort to coax sound from ice. Escalation is clean (dark stone → flicker → single note → expanding hush) without causality breaks. Cost is present but subtle, leaning more spiritual than materially constraining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The caves, ice pool, and echo stone are not decor; they constrain tactics and produce the solution (ice crack resonance as amplifier). Sensory specificity (static hum in teeth, cold solidity, silver constellation in ice) is integrated with action. World rules stay consistent and are learned through use, not exposition. The final image is decisively charged by the environment itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake—overcoming the hum—and tightens via a purposeful method culminating in the “single, perfect note.” The opposition (pervasive hum) is credible but passive; no reversal tests commitment beyond persistence. The felt price is modest; success comes on the first tactic without a failed beat. Still, the deepening from whisper to ice‑amplified hush is effective under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Harmony vs. domination and the reframing of silence as generative arise organically from image and method. However, the final moral articulation (“They had not come to bring noise, but to be harmonized”) states theme directly, dulling subtext. Earlier images—the stone weaving absence, the bloom of hush—carry the idea more powerfully without exposition. Resonance lingers, but the explicit statement trims its edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is consistent, textured, and sensorially biased to the Mapkeeper’s craft. Diction (“hammered repose,” “ripple‑marked,” “weaving absence”) builds a distinct cadence that modulates cleanly into tranquility at the end. No head‑hopping or stance drift, and inference remains within what she can perceive. Lyric compression is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and economical; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, pressure, theme). Occasional purple edges (“flower of pure stillness”) risk excess but remain internally coherent. Minimal redundancy, clean rhythm, and clear sequence. The closing image lands without syntactic clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Bloom of hush” as an active, absorbing silence feels fresh, with the ice‑fracture method as a novel tactic. The energy beings’ harmonization reframes the conflict in a non‑obvious yet earned way. Risks in lyrical abstraction mostly pay off, anchored by concrete craft detail. Slight conventionality in the spelled‑out realization keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
