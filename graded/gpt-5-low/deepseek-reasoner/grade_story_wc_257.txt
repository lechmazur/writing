<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s grief and paralysis are concretely embodied (dust motes, still hands), and her motive—to reengage with making—emerges credibly through the cranes and Lyra’s challenge. The internal shift is swift and a touch tidy, with limited on‑page contradiction or hesitation once she reaches the observatory. Micro‑choices (following coordinates, choosing to etch) align with character and reveal values. The cost—relinquishing her prior preservation‑of‑death stance—is felt but lightly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive: a causal trail (cranes → observatory → etching) culminates in an accumulative conceptual repricing of death and art. Orientation is clean, single POV, with a clear before/after anchored by the final return to the workshop. Closure lands: she adopts a new practice and mandate with implied cost. The didactic mentor beat edges toward convenience but does not break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The workshop’s dust and the “timeless observatory” are vivid and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment meaningfully enables and directs action (telescope view reframing decay; projection beam guiding the etching). Details serve tone and theme without tourist listing. The setting charges the final image, though it stops short of overtly constraining a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes—whether she will stay inert or transform—are clear, and the origami trail provides a tightening vector. However, pressure is gentle; resistance is minimal once Lyra appears, and obstacles are largely conceptual. The decisive act (etching, choosing a new collection) closes the question but with modest on‑page cost. Escalation reads as a deepening insight more than a trial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of transformation over preservation and reframing decay are woven through cranes, telescope, and the locket. Resonance is strong in the final return, but Lyra’s direct statements (“Your art is not about preserving death…,” “curtains of intention”) risk overt moralizing. The last image reweights prior material without a sermon, sustaining an earned afterglow. Complexity is present, if a bit guided.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elara with consistent diction and rhythm. Lyra’s lines are stylized but coherent with the fable‑like atmosphere. Psychic distance stays steady; no head‑hopping or withheld basics. The voice modulates from numbness to quiet ignition without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and purposeful; most lines carry more than one job. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple, but clarity and momentum hold. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter; the final line resolves by image and cadence. Figurative language remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mourning jewelry + cosmic observatory + tattoo stencil projection is a fresh synthesis. The mentor‑on‑mountain pattern is familiar, and the epiphany arrives neatly. Emotional truth feels specific to Elara’s craft, avoiding generic grief templates. Risks are tasteful rather than daring, yet the integration reads organic.</comment>
