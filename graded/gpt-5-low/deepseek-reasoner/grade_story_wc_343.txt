<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (prove herself, make a discovery) cleanly drives her choices and aligns with her “diligently curious” nature. Interiority is specific in the way she reads the world’s “languages,” but internal contradiction is light and she meets little resistance. The solution arrives on her first attempt, minimizing struggle and visible cost. The “sociable isolation” note adds texture but doesn’t pressure a choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkage is crisp—from noticing hopscotch geometry to translating it into notes to reawakening the crystal—delivering on‑page Decisive Change and a small Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is immediate and stable. The cost at closure is mild (no sacrifice beyond risk and social exposure), keeping it shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The antique airship, the dark luminance, and the hopscotch-scarred deck are vivid, selectively rendered, and filtered through Elara’s cartographic sensibility. Setting constrains tactics (stranding, crystal chamber) and objects recur to charge the final image (phrasebook, hopscotch, starlings). World rules (aetheric resonance) are taught via action, not dump. Strong atmosphere without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restart the airship) is clear, and pressure coheres under the causal lens. The meaningful tightening is Elara converting pattern into a playable sequence under time‑social pressure. However, there’s little opposition or cost and the solution works without setback, muting escalation. The violinist’s success lacks a test that would foreclose an option or force a trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>“Language of the world” finds concrete embodiment in hopscotch, birds, and light, culminating in a reframing of what Elara will map next. The thematic statement edges close to explicitness (“She had discovered a new language of power”) but is supported by enacted images rather than mere assertion. The child’s play → energy resonance motif feels earned. Ambiguity is limited but present in her chosen isolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a clear perceptual signature—Elara reads patterns, not people—and a measured lyric cadence. Diction suits the world and character without register slips. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Rhythmic modulation supports key beats (observation → realization → activation).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, purposeful, and often do double duty (worldbuilding via action). Figurative language is controlled and coherent; no muddled or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minimal scaffold or repetition; momentum remains intact through the reveal and activation. The final image lands without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Airship + hopscotch cipher + murmurations as resonance key is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The phrasebook dog‑ear as a craft talisman that becomes a newly folded page is elegant. Slightly low cost and a smooth solve keep it from the 9‑band. Still, the conceptual blend is distinctive and confidently executed.</comment>
