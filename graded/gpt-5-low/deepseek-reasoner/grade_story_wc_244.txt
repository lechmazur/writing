<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—desperate jocularity masking loneliness—are dramatized in her banter and the crack when the moon rock appears. Her choice to repurpose the rock and halt her itinerancy reads motivated by that loneliness. The interiority is specific (“two asteroids passing”), though embodied cost remains soft and mostly conceptual. More concrete friction or loss at the pivot would deepen credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal beats (rumor → astronomer → rock → new rumor → communal ritual) accumulating to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (ivy‑choked station, relief depot, Elara’s role). Closure lands via the transformed operation and her stance shift, with a conceptual cost (misuse of resources, stopping movement) implied if not stressed. One clean tightening; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ivy‑strangled station, rusted trains, and damp‑metal air are vivid and POV‑filtered, and the depot space frames the line of story‑seekers. Setting charges the final tableau (pallets and ivy as backdrop to “distributing grace”), even if it doesn’t strongly constrain tactics. Detail is economical and purposeful, avoiding postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curing loneliness) is clear; pressure coherently rises with the astronomer’s arrival and Elara’s decision to launch the rumor. The escalation is internal and situational rather than combative, but the deepening (from supplies logistics to grace logistics) narrows her path. Cost is suggested rather than dramatized, keeping tension solid but shy of bracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocity as antidote to loneliness emerges through acts, not sermon: the moon rock becomes a conduit for communal awe. “Polite anarchy” refracts into ethical misuse for humane ends; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the mask of humor giving way to quiet service lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lightly lyrical, and consistent with a close third tethered to Elara; dialogue is spare, natural, and purposeful (“Not things—solutions.”). Rhythm modulates well from brisk banter to contemplative cadence as pressure shifts. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images like “two asteroids passing in a dark sky” are apt and not overstacked. Sentence variety and pacing suit the accumulative build. Minor abstraction appears, but momentum and clarity hold through the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: disaster‑relief logistics repurposed into a rumor‑powered grace machine via a moon rock. The “polite anarchy” tone and reciprocity engine feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are coherent and pay off in the resonant final image.</comment>
