<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyra’s motives (bridge between founders’ vision and OmniCorp’s demands) are clear and embodied in concrete micro‑choices: encoded graffiti, the negotiated relocation of Hem, and accepting the foundation chip. Her contradictory impulses—orderly planning versus preserving chaos—operate simultaneously in scene. The Hem exchange shows status dynamics and trust that raise the emotional cost. The final stance (accepting the “anchor” burden) reads earned, with credible price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational, with a live clock (inspector arrival) and coherent pressure forcing a stance crystallization. Orientation is swift and clean; single POV and scope hold. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Lyra chooses to bear ongoing cost and keep the city’s heart central, concretized by the chip and mural. The mid‑story “days” montage compresses process efficiently without breaking causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The raft‑city carnival is vividly, selectively rendered (canals, generators, stalls, sunny nooks) and filters through Lyra’s priorities. Environment and objects shape tactics (repositioning for sun, inspectors’ route) and charge the final image via the foundation chip/mural. Sensory detail stays purposeful and consistent with world rules. Atmosphere supports theme without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (protect community integrity under privatization), and the clock to inspection tightens pressure. The meaningful trade‑off—ceding prime spots (Hem’s move) to preserve communal agency—reads as a visible price. Escalation is modest but coherent: official reorg paired with clandestine reclamation culminates in a defiant, reweighted carnival. Slight softness in on‑page resistance keeps this below elite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (community adaptation vs. corporate sanitization; art as governance; stewardship over ownership) emerges through concrete acts and images. The chip and mural reweight the premise at the end, binding continuity and resistance. The mural’s explicit “Remember. Adapt. Persist.” edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, trimming subtlety. Still, the non‑literal answer—a charged poise to endure—resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and assured; diction balances lyric texture with clarity. Dialogue with Hem is lean, subtextual, and advances stakes. Rhythmic control modulates from tense negotiation to resolved poise without voice drift. No head‑hopping or over‑helpful exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean sentences with good information density; descriptions do more than one job and stay tethered to action. Figurative language is controlled (“anchor” motif is earned by object and choice). Minimal scaffolding or loops; cadence varies. No muddled metaphors or register slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a “Culture Shock Absorber” navigating gentrification on a raft‑carnival via coded graffiti feels fresh and lived‑in. The foundation chip motif deepens originality without gimmickry. Turns arise from character‑specific tactics, not template beats. The piece risks a quiet, conceptual closure that holds.</comment>
