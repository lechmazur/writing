<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to “harvest lessons from loss” by carving—is clear and enacted through tactile, character‑specific choices. Embodied memory (“a callus that had once been his”) gives her grief texture beyond labels. Internal contradiction is quieter than ideal—she’s largely steady rather than actively torn—yet the Earned Stasis at the kettle’s whistle feels credible. The choice to complete the carving and accept the hollow “as a foundation” lands with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the kettle’s rising hiss to whistle provides a temporal spine that tightens the window. Closure is on‑page with cost: she finishes, sets down the gouge, and reconfigures absence into a usable form (RR/Earned Stasis). Orientation is clean from the opening and there’s no causality break. If anything, the progression is gentle; one more concrete impediment could have intensified the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rain‑beaded skylight, hiss/whistle of the kettle, and ash wood workshop are vividly selective and filtered through her craft. The environment and tools charge the final image (steam meeting rain; carving as vessel) and the kettle clock constrains action. Sensory balance is strong (scent of wood, sound of rain), and details evolve with pressure (rumble → whistle). It stops short of world‑shaping constraint beyond the clock, but the micro‑setting work is exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—contain volatile grief within a form “while the kettle boils”—is signaled early and tightens as the kettle escalates. The whistle forces a trade‑off between suspended reflection and present action, creating a clean beat shift. The price is the acceptance of a new stasis (hollow as foundation) rather than an external loss. Stakes stay internal; one sharper on‑page compromise could raise tension further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonance is earned through recurring images (wood ribbons, rain, steam) that resolve into a revaluation: love transmutes; containment as care. However, a few direct statements (“This was the lesson she harvested… love does not vanish; it transmutes”) edge toward thematic telling. The final image reweights prior material without overexplaining, sustaining emotional honesty. Subtext largely works through craft and weather interplay.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft and grief. Rhythm modulates well: long, sinuous sentences during carving, clipped decisiveness at the whistle. Diction stays within a plausible artisan‑poetic register for Elara, with no head‑hopping or stance slips. The voice avoids purple excess while maintaining lushness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level is controlled, with high information density and purposeful imagery (e.g., “a language of pressure and trust”). Minor risk of overornamentation is kept in check by clean sequencing and varied syntax. Minimal redundancy; transitions hinge on sensory turns (rumble → whistle). One or two abstract phrases could be trimmed, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The widow‑of‑a‑lion‑tamer carving an abstract “tool” of grief is a fresh inflection on mourning. The kettle clock and crystallized‑time method synthesize into a non‑obvious closure image (steam meeting rain). Themes of alliance over domination subtly refract the marriage and the craft. Not revolutionary, but confidently singular and coherent.</comment>
