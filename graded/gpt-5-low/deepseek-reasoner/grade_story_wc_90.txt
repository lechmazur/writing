<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifist-mender identity cleanly motivates every choice, and her shift from paralysis to stitching reads earned. Interiority is specific (gravity as felt sorrow), though contradictions are gentle rather than searing. The visible cost is emotional labor and endurance rather than sacrifice of an external good, scaled credibly to this length. A richer clash between refusal and need would nudge this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Drive lens: Hybrid with a causal spine; each move (“find photos” → “weight” → “stitching” → “compassion talisman” → “doorway”) tightens options and knowledge. Orientation is clear early, and the closure is on-page: the doorway appears after the circuit is completed. Cost is legible as the protagonist processes collective grief to unlock the way. No teleports or rule breaks; ship-as-lock constraint holds through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The recycled ship is tactile and operative: thin air, groaning plates, artificial gravity that literally increases pressure. Environment constrains and enables choices (haunted bulkheads as memory-reservoir; workroom tools; the ship itself as the lock), and charges the final image when the bulkheads “sigh.” Detail selection stays POV-driven and purposeful. The setting’s rules stay consistent and integral to outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the “dimension” by resolving stored grief—intensifies from oppressive gravity to alchemical repair to the catalytic placement of Kwan Yin’s tear. Escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven, with a clear tightening pivot when she realizes happiness lightens gravity. The price is borne in her choice to absorb and transmute collective pain rather than avoid it. Stakes remain internal but map to concrete ship responses, keeping pressure legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Compassion over force, mending as alchemy, and trauma-transmutation emerge from action and image (stitching light along crystallized tears). A single explicit thesis line (“This was the key.”) edges toward didactic, slightly thinning subtext. Still, the final pearlescent doorway offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The theme lingers with credible ambiguity about cost and endurance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent; diction suits Elara’s contemplative craftsperson lens. Rhythm modulates well between pressure and release, and inference remains within what she could know. Elevated language is controlled and voice-motivated, avoiding head-hopping or register slips. No dialogue needed; the prose carries subtext through image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences are purposeful and varied, with images doing double duty (gravity as sorrow; stitching as repair and ritual). A few high-register phrases (“frequency of pure, massless peace”) brush purple but don’t blur sense. No scaffold loops or template cadences slow momentum. The final line recharges prior motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: tracing dried tear-salt with light stitches, compassion as literal mass relief, a ship as trauma lock. Kwan Yin’s tear as non-weapon catalyst is inspired and coherent with the pacifist ethic. The turn to doorway via emotional transmutation is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
