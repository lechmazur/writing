<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clear goal and steady desire, but interior contradiction and felt cost are thin; “cautious exuberance” repeats without deepening. The veiled dreamer acts (latch, vowel) but remains largely emblematic. Micro-choices exist (documenting, anticipating reversals) yet they’re rarely pressured. The ending vow lands without a meaningful personal trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries build from watch→delays→glyphs→crystal→garden. Closure reads as conceptual repricing (the library is itself a living cipher), but cost is soft. Orientation is stable from the opening. Turns are gentle and sequential rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: mist, halos, floating glyphs, and the crystal integrate with action (projection, alignments). The watch functions as a micro-setting object, shaping attention. World rules (reversals, delays) stay consistent through observation rather than dump. Slight risk of decorative lushness, but most images serve the task.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (find the library), yet obstacles are minimal and doors largely open upon noticing patterns. The key tightening—anticipating reversals via delays—doesn’t force a hard trade-off. The dreamer’s touches trigger progress without setback. Resolution feels earned but low-pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of language, time, and the ethics of voice surface organically via cipher mechanics and unspoken words. The explicit statement “the library itself was a cipher” edges toward telling. The garden of luminous petals offers a resonant image, though the emotional cost is muted. Subtext (silence needing readers) lingers without heavy sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent first-person lyric voice with a coherent perceptual signature; diction fits the mythic-technical blend. Refrains (“propagation delays,” “cyclically reversed”) are patterned and legible. No head-hopping and distance control is steady. Some phrasing repeats, but cadence remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean and image-rich with good momentum; minimal scaffolding. Repetition risks mild purple flourish and synonym loops (multiple iterations of “cautious exuberance,” “glow,” “whispers”). Information density is decent; sentences mostly do two jobs. Final images land clearly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The watch-as-cipher with propagation delay acoustics feels fresh within the “mystic library” trope. The living map that reverses on gear turns is inventive and coherent. Not wholly groundbreaking, as discovery flows without counterpressure, but the synthesis reads singular. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off.</comment>
