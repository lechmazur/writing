<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lian’s motive is clear and consistent, and his choices (cranking, listening, prying up the floor) align with it. Interiority is sensorial and character‑filtered, though internal conflict is minimal and his path feels largely unopposed. The “dynasty ender” label promises sharper contradiction than the scene delivers. The conceptual cost lands, but emotional struggle is light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the causal chain is clean: crank → sound → map‑like vibrations → panel → floorboard → scroll → revaluation. Closure is present via a discovery and conceptual repricing of the dynasty’s fall. The lens reads Hybrid, dominated by causal linkage with a lyric cadence at the end. Cost is mostly conceptual, not materially felt, keeping it short of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sepia reading room, gramophone, wood grain, and lantern form a tactile micro‑setting that drives the method and charges the final image. The room’s physical features (shutters, carved panel, floorboard) directly constrain actions and deliver payoff. Sensory detail is lush and purposeful across senses (sound, scent of jasmine, visual warmth). The symbolism occasionally edges toward overt, but it remains in service of action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (uncover the hidden truth), and there’s one meaningful tightening as vibrations guide Lian to the compartment. However, resistance is minimal; discovery proceeds smoothly without credible risk or trade‑off on the page. The cost is introspective rather than pressured, which softens escalation. Tension operates more as wonder than as conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Curiosity vs. ignorance and “listening as practice” emerge organically through the gramophone method and the confession. The ending reweights silence as eloquence, offering a resonant conceptual answer. Some lines lapse into explicit thematic statement (“teach them to listen eloquently silent”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, the final image coheres with earlier motifs in a satisfying way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is steady, with controlled diction and rhythm; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Recurring phrases (“eloquently silent,” “golden shadows”) are patterned and intentional, if a touch insistent. The voice modulates with the scene’s hush and discovery without over‑explaining. Absence of dialogue suits the solitary, inward drive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences are musical and image‑dense, often doing multiple jobs; momentum generally holds. Repetition and stacked modifiers flirt with purple (“first yawn of evening” recurs; “eloquently silent” repeats), risking slight drag. The syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and action remains clear. A touch of pruning could heighten propulsion and sharpen the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gramophone/standing‑waves cognition is a fresh, engaging mechanism, and the conceptual reframing of dynasty’s end is thoughtful. The atmosphere feels distinctive, with a coherent synthesis of object, method, and theme. Some imagery leans familiar (golden shadows, jasmine), but the core premise stands apart. Risks are lyrical rather than structural, and they mostly pay off.</comment>
