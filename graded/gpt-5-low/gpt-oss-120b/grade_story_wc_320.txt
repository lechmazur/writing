<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Selin’s competence and intention are clear, and her actions track her worldview, but internal conflict is minimal and largely untested. The “scholars insist” pressure stays abstract, so contradictions in her motives never bite on the page. Her micro‑choices (climb, insert shard, calibrate, broadcast) are purposeful yet emotionally frictionless. The ending’s acceptance costs her little beyond effort, softening character change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: a pattern of tuning → chord → dawn activation → broadcast resolves into a city/village reawakening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (rebirth) rather than a decisive sacrifice; cost is light but the cadence shift to dawn and communal response reads. Orientation is crisp early (tower over gorge, lunar perigee, single POV). Minor deduction for the absence of a concrete price at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hanging, rusted radio city is vivid and tactile (“broken harp,” spiral stair, humming cables), and it materially shapes action (climb, crystal slot, quantum coil). Lunar perigee and the tower’s architecture constrain and enable tactics. The environment charges the final image (cables singing, light across the gorge). Detail selection is purposeful and filtered through a technical, lyrical lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes (revival vs decay) are signaled and the pressure deepens from private tuning to public broadcast, but opposition remains soft and largely conceptual. The most meaningful tightening is the shift from interpreting to broadcasting, which broadens consequences but doesn’t foreclose an option or exact a cost. The perigee clock adds urgency without testing resolve. Satisfying, not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The beginning/ending dialectic is woven through image (chord echoing first vibration) and action (re‑tuning ruins), offering a quiet, resonant answer. However, the theme is stated outright late (“endings are merely signals awaiting reinterpretation,” “Genesis in Echo”), which blunts subtext. The shard’s reweighting from relic to key is effective and organic. Emotional aftertaste leans contemplative rather than complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinctive technical‑lyric texture; diction (“quantum coil,” “perigee”) fits the POV’s competence. Rhythm modulates well from nocturne hush to dawn practicality. No head‑hopping, and certainty tracks what Selin could infer. Repeated epithet choices verge on motif‑heavy but stay controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry image and function concurrently, with clean sequencing and few hedges. A touch of purple and repetition (“serenely electric” recurs) nudges at excess, but momentum holds. Figurative language is coherent and grounded in the world’s physics. The final lines land with clear imagery and without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Shard of hush” from a Hollywood star as signal‑key in a rusted sky‑city feels fresh, and the engineering‑meets‑numinous blend is memorable. Turns grow from the premise rather than rule changes, and the perigee cadence is a smart constraint. Emotional complexity is modest, keeping this just shy of exceptional. Still, the synthesis shows confident, singular vision.</comment>
