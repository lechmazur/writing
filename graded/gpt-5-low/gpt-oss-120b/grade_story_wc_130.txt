<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (to parse the “mathematics of emotion”) is clear and drives concrete choices—placing, aligning, recording, then incanting. Interiority is sensorially embodied but remains largely serene; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal, making the epiphany feel slightly tidy. The character’s “gently inventive” trait is shown through method, not just label. Change lands as a reframing rather than a costed renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions build to a conceptual repricing where loss becomes transformation, sealed by the petal‑rain and dawn. Orientation is strong from the first lines; single scene coherence is clean. Closure is present but soft on cost—the price is acceptance rather than a felt loss. The progression (eyes → numbers → equation → petals) tracks and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cavern orchard, stalactite drips, and mosaic function as charged environment and tools, not backdrop; the drips “translate” and the stone’s cracks act upon stakes. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the conjurer’s aim. World rules are legibly consistent in their lyric logic. The setting meaningfully charges the final image (petals, dawn, eyelids of stone).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure rises via density and cadence rather than opposition: alignment → vibration → numeric revelation → bridge insight → incantation. Stakes remain internal and gentle; no genuine foreclosure or painful tradeoff is forced. The tightening is sufficient for this mode, though consequences feel comfort‑skewed. The final act arises from protagonist agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres—ambiguous loss reweighted as transformation—with strong image chains (eyes, cracks, numbers, petals). However, explicit thesis lines (“grief plus hope equals…”) edge into saying the moral rather than letting the images carry it. The closing image still resonates, aided by the dawn and petal‑return. Subtext exists, but some overt statement reduces mystery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV and distance are stable; the lyric voice is controlled and consistently sensorial. Diction is unified to the conjurer’s sensibility, with patterned phrasing that supports the accumulative mode. Occasional abstraction (“equation of grief and joy”) risks generic uplift but is anchored by concrete acts. No dialogue; the voice itself bears the pressure cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush and mostly clear, with strong image economy across recurring motifs. Some metaphor density and near‑repetitions create mild purple drift and lessen propulsion in the middle. Syntax varies, and transitions are clean. The final paragraphs deliver a crisp cadence without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High originality in the synthesis: a conjurer using taxidermist’s eyes to read a mosaic via stalactite vibrations to quantify grief. Risks are purposeful and coherent to closure. Emotional truth leans gentle rather than jagged, but the specific tool‑set and logic feel singular. The final reweighting reads inevitable given the established pattern.</comment>
