<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (“to find where the rivers begin”) is clear and her composed, dry wit under pressure reads consistently through concrete micro‑choices (the glass, the transmitter, the phrasebook). The contradictory calm/dread is specific to her and earns texture without melodrama. However, internal conflict remains subtle; she rarely faces a value trade‑off with visible cost. The final stance is credible but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate, and the sequence tightens from deciphering condensation → aligning the transmitter → sending the signal → first trickle of thaw. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the vein of water and tolling bell reweight the stakes with an implied cost (unleashing forces she can’t control). The price is more conceptual than visceral, which keeps it shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The outpost, frozen lake, transmitter, and glass are tactile, place‑bound, and used as tools that constrain actions (heat to reveal script; antenna aligned to a falcon’s path). Weather and metal textures shape choice and tone; the environment charges the final image (ice singing, water vein, bell). Sensory detail is vivid without turning museum‑tour. Only mild symbolism edges near overt at “ice is born from silence.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and coherently tightened by a single meaningful deepening: decoding → broadcasting → oncoming thaw. Agency drives the turns; coincidence (falcon timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The cost remains atmospheric—dread, risk of unleashing subterranean streams—rather than a concrete loss or trade‑off. Tension works at sentence and beat scales but never bites hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of origins/singular convergence accrues through repeated, active particulars (condensation veins, phrasebook, rivers merging) and culminates in the “charged poise” of the first trickle. The “Kaltwasser” reveal risks over‑articulation with the explicit aphorism (“every river is born from ice, and ice is born from silence”). Still, imagery carries the resonance more than statement. The ending invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a cool, precise lyric texture that modulates under pressure (from calm wit to humming urgency). Diction feels character‑filtered and steady; no head‑hopping or stance drift. The patterned prose supports the accumulative lens and closure. A few flourishes flirt with purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong line‑level control with purposeful syntax variety; images do multiple jobs (map/veins/condensation). Minimal scaffolding and few redundancies; rhythm suits the scene’s slow tightening. Some metaphor stacking edges toward ornament in mid‑story (“cracked spine cracking like a tiny gun,” “world tilt”), but clarity holds. The final line resolves cleanly by image and cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The condensation‑as‑cipher, atlas editor at a rusted station, and falcon‑guided transmission synthesize into a distinctive, memorable frame. Risks (lyric science‑myth blend; quiet closure) feel intentional and pay off. Turns arise from established tools and pattern rather than late rule changes. Freshness is anchored in specific, lived textures instead of quirk.</comment>
