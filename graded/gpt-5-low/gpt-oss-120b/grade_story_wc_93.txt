<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Selene’s drive to understand “sacred patterns” is clear and credible, and her precognitive fear versus compulsion to act produces a genuine, character‑specific tension. Embodied perceptions (kelp sheen, basalt spray) root her interiority in the moment. The decisive micro‑choice—placing the final red stone—aligns action with motive. The cost is more conceptual than visceral (“mantle” of responsibility), keeping this shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens through the rock‑placement pattern culminating in ignition and repricing of the curse. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when), and beats progress coherently toward the cadence shift when the tide “pauses” to listen. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her curse becomes a compass and the map remains. The cost is felt as burden and obligation more than loss, but it is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The basalt bluff, aurora, tide, and dust are vivid and integrated into action; the environment is not wallpaper but the medium of her method. The painted rocks and pools function as charged objects that shape tactics and the final image (glowing ratios, living map). Sensory selection feels filtered through her vocation and aim. Rich atmosphere supports theme without slipping into pure postcarding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can she harness the dust to reweight fate—arrives early and coheres. Escalation is a density increase (stones → spiral knots → ignition) rather than sharp reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The tightening turn is the placement of the final red stone that triggers the hum and flame. However, the price paid remains mostly obligation, with minimal on‑page resistance or risk to narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: intentional design can coax rather than defy cosmic patterns; fate reframed as navigable rhythm. The curse‑to‑compass shift reweights prior images (borrowed dawn, promise) without moralizing. The final charged image—the rocks singing, a map for others—offers a resonant answer. A touch more ambiguity or consequence could deepen the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close maintains consistent distance and diction, with a perceptual signature keyed to pattern, tide, and ratio. Rhythm modulates effectively at the ignition and closing cadence. No head‑hopping or register slips occur. A few repeated phrases risk sameness but largely serve motif.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, purposeful figurative language, and high information density. A few motifs recur (“borrowed dawn,” “lingering promise”), flirting with over‑insistence but staying controlled. Clarity holds in peak beats (the hum, ignition, tide pause). Occasional purple edges don’t impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>An eel herder under aurora using Fibonacci‑painted stones to coax collapsed star dust is strikingly original, and the curse‑as‑compass turn feels inevitable in hindsight. The synthesis of cosmology, math, tidecraft, and vocation reads singular rather than stitched. Risks in language and premise heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The world logic remains coherent within its lyrical frame.</comment>
