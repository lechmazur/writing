<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (trace honest origins, preserve knowledge) are consistent and drive action, with concrete, character-specific perceptions (ink hue shifting, gear alignment). Interiority is present but low-conflict; she remains highly competent with few contradictory impulses under pressure. The closure choice—revealing and advocating for protection—feels earned but lightly priced. Relationship pressure is offstage (council), so crucible dynamics are minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A clear causal line runs: hypothesis → council support → buoy illumination → cipher discovery → vault confirmation → civic shift. Closure lands on-page with a decisive reconfiguration (the charter’s confirmation, public protection), though cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a mild accumulative lyric weave and holds through the ending. No orientation debt; stakes remain coherent but rarely corner the protagonist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is richly tactile (water-worn marble, seeping cracks, tidal-powered buoys) and shapes choices (lantern use during blackout, flooded corridors, descent via shaft). The antique stamp functions as micro-setting/tool that charges the final image (slab activation). Environmental logic remains consistent and integrated with action. A slight cap below 9.0 as constraint rarely forces a hard trade-off on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes—preserving knowledge and validating origins—are clear, but pressure escalates gently rather than decisively; obstacles yield without resistance. The hypothesis and cipher deepen options, yet there’s little felt cost or foreclosed path during the descent or vault scene. The council’s agreement arrives without friction, reducing tension at a potential pressure point. The ending is earned but the journey lacks a palpable squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of truth versus myth, preservation, and illumination are woven through recurrent images (lantern → buoys; stamp as seal and key). “Reclaimed stillness” evolves from mood to civic stance, offering a resonant answer without explicit moralizing. Some phrasing verges on stated thesis, but the final image largely earns its weight. Thematic complexity is present, if not dangerously ambivalent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, with controlled lyricism and a precise perceptual signature befitting a meticulous indexer. Diction and rhythm support atmosphere without head-hopping or register slips. Refrains (“dappled resolve,” “reclaimed stillness”) are patterned and purposeful rather than rote. Modulation under peak moments (vault, slab glow) is measured and effective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean, with varied syntax, sensory economy, and purposeful imagery. Occasional repetition skirts purple (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve”), but functions as motif rather than clutter. Momentum holds despite lyric density; no scaffold or logical muddle in peak beats. Minor lushness dampens urgency but not clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of a sunken archive, an indexer-protagonist, and a ritualized stamp-cipher feels fresh and coherent. Turns (council-funded buoys, stamp as key) arise from established particulars rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth is cool and meticulous rather than melodramatic, fitting the premise. The piece risks quietness and wins on specificity and conceptual ingenuity.</comment>
