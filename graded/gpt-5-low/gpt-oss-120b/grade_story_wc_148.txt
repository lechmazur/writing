<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motive (redemption via the hush and the bodies) and steady micro‑choices (ledge → corridor → chest → reef) carry the piece. Interiority is lyric and particular, though contradiction is light—the path feels preordained rather than wrestled for. The maternal lattice adds texture but doesn’t force morally costly trade‑offs. The final peace reads earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterns (copperlight, hush, lattice) accrete toward a resonant reconfiguration where the boy reframes warning into guidance. Causality is legible (lattice prompts → map → reef), and the single scene coheres. Cost at closure is soft (cold salt, risk implied, reputational shift) rather than biting. The final image lands, though the “beacon of truth” flourish edges toward tell.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are vivid and tactile, with the beam, slick rocks, and narrow door shaping movement and image. Setting integrates with action rather than pausing it; the beam and copperlight charge the last tableau. World rules (lattice bending light, sealing the chest) remain consistent within a mythic register. Strong specificity without tour‑guide excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is present (redeem the cry‑wolf legacy by guiding others/bodies), but pressure escalates with minimal resistance; success arrives without a testing reversal. The lattice repeatedly solves problems, narrowing felt risk. “Before they find the bodies” gestures at a clock that never tightens tactics. The ending is satisfying but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonances align (warning as thread vs. wall; hush as redemption), and the mother/son motif grounds theme in particulars. However, the explicit thesis line (“every warning is a thread, not a wall”) and “beacon of truth” proximity flatten subtext at the end. The images themselves carry weight; the statements dilute it. Still, the final hush image reweights the legend meaningfully.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, sensuous, and patterned; the diction’s copper‑salt palette holds steady without head‑hopping. Refrains (“copperlight repose,” the door phrase) teach and sustain the lyric pattern. Slight risk of tonal sameness under pressure, but rhythm varies enough to keep momentum. No dialogue to test, but focalization stays tight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lush lines often do double duty, yet purple density and a paraphrase loop undercut precision (“through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades” repeats awkwardly). Occasional mixed logic images (“boots slipping through the scuffs”) blur action. Redundant intensifiers appear in the final third, dulling edge. Still, many sentences carry clean sensory charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a confessional lattice that bends light, a hush as quest, and a lighthouse‑prison frame reimagining the cry‑wolf legacy. The 3D map unfolding from prayers feels distinctive and grounded in the story’s logic. The risk lies in committing to lyric myth over plot machinery, and it pays off thematically. Minor familiar notes in the redemptive coda keep it shy of exceptional.</comment>
