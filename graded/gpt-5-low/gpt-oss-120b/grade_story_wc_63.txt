<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—“incremental absolution” through repair—is clear and consistently enacted, with tactile choices (timing the pause, aligning inscriptions). However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or suffers visible doubt. The endurance cost is stated (“the work would never end”) but lightly felt in-scene. Strong embodiment via the tool and setting partly compensates.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats accrete toward the pendulum’s reawakening and a pact-like closure. The decisive change is the resumed swing charged by the inscriptions, with a conceptual cost (lifelong, repetitive devotion). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). While the cost is more conceptual than visceral, the closure lands on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, black tide, bronze tower, and the pendulum’s mechanics are vividly integrated and recur to charge the final image. The pause window and vertical climb subtly constrain action. Details are POV-filtered by her professional attentiveness. A hair short of 9+ only because constraints are felt more ritually than as hard limits.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring balance) is coherent and signaled early; the meaningful tightening is acting precisely in the pendulum’s pause. Escalation is mostly a deepening of ritual rather than a narrowing of options; cost remains abstract. The resumption of swing is earned by agency, but tension never bites hard. Still, the cadence shift at the hum → tremble → resume is effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of patient, ethical repair emerges through recurring images (inscriptions, tide, pendulum) and reweights at the end. Occasional moralizing edges in (“chorus of countless souls…”), slightly flattening subtext. The final pact image offers resonance without a neat moral. The idea of shared rhythm between human craft and sea carries real afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization and confident diction. Rhythm modulates well across the hum/tremble/swing sequence. Some diction tilts toward purple and repeats key phrases, but legibility and stance stay steady. No dialogue; the internal texture remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lines are largely clean and musical, with purposeful imagery. However, density of figurative language and repeated abstract terms (“ethically diligent,” “incremental absolution,” “searing reverie”) veer toward overwriting. Minor paraphrase echoes appear without adding pressure. Momentum holds, but trimming could sharpen force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of maritime geology, horology, and devotional craft feels fresh; the broken rake handle inscriptions are a memorable device. The ritual-technical interface (aligning prayers to a bob) is inventive and coherent. Risk lies in the solemn, high-lyric register, mostly sustained. The conceptual synthesis is distinctive and integrated.</comment>
