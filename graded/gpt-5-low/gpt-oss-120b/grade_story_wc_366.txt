<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marek’s motive—to bottle and protect a feeling of safety—drives concrete micro-choices (carving “home,” nesting the glass, forming the spiral). Interiority is particular and sensorial rather than summarized. However, internal contradiction is minimal; there’s little cost or competing impulse on the page beyond quiet dread. Strong specificity without a true crucible limits the ceiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (skipper at a crumbling lighthouse at night), and the scene holds to one continuous window. Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands when the lamp dies and the stone spiral pulses, reconfiguring the beacon’s meaning (from oil to memory), with Marek choosing to carry the talisman. The cost is soft—practical peril of a dark lighthouse is implied rather than confronted. Still, the cadence shift is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse’s iron ribs, broken panes, and the lantern room’s cold silence are vivid and consistently filtered through a mariner’s gaze. The sea glass and stones function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Environmental pressure exists (wind, darkness) but seldom constrains tactics beyond mood and timing. Texture and specificity are high even if constraint is moderate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving a chain of hope/safety) is clear and the lamp’s failure offers a single tightening. Escalation is largely internal and atmospheric, with little forced trade-off or irreversible loss beyond the lamp dying. The pulse is a lovely intensification but risk remains abstract. The resolution arises from a chosen stance rather than tested sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory, sanctuary, and portable safety emerge organically through the ritual and the sea glass’s evolving charge. The final repricing—lighthouse as a heart of letters rather than light—is resonant. Occasional explicit statements (“he would protect this fragile chain”) slightly over-announce the thesis. Subtext mostly carries the weight through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and close, with a distinct perceptual signature (attentiveness to wind, glass, and stone texture). Diction and rhythm suit a reticent, observant mariner; lyricism is controlled. No head-hopping or stance leakage. Minor repetition feels intentional rather than scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean sentences, strong image work, and purposeful repetition maintain momentum. A few phrases edge toward purple or redundancy (“luminescent ache,” reiterated vows), softening impact. Information density is good, with objects doing multiple jobs. Rhythm varies well, though the prose sometimes states what the images already imply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ritualized stone-spiral as a message chain, the sea glass as bottled safety, and the lantern room’s memory-pulse feel fresh and integrated. The piece synthesizes familiar maritime tropes into a singular, gentle myth. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural, but it pays off in tone and image. Not wholly unprecedented, yet memorable and coherent.</comment>
