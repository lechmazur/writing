<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motive is clear and consistent—engineering compassion—and his key choice (kneeling, reading the chips, renaming) aligns with it. Interiority surfaces via tactile engagement with the stone and the “retrocognitively trapped” state, but contradictory impulses are faint and mostly abstract. The dissolution of his past at the end offers a credible cost but is thematically smooth rather than hard‑won. Strong presence, modest internal friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern recognition → naming → communal reweighting culminates in a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on the page with the public adoption of “Hearthsteel” and the sky’s stitched dawn, with the cost of the narrator’s past dissolving. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. Escalation is one meaningful tightening rather than multiple causal turns, appropriate for the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and instrumental: the cracked plaza, singular tessera, and chipped stepping stone are not backdrop but the exact means of change. The environment charges the final image (light stitching the sky; plaza as pilgrimage site) and constrains choice through the stone’s pattern. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist’s aim. World rules stay consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can empathy be forged to endure—tightens at the renaming and communal uptake. Pressure is coherent but gentle; opposition is atmospheric rather than antagonistic, so the felt cost remains conceptual. The key turn is protagonist‑driven (naming via the chips) and earns the outcome. A sharper price or lost option would have deepened the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring particulars (chips, steel/warmth, aberrant mercy) that shift meaning at the end toward communal stewardship. The piece resists sermonizing, though lines like “compassion could be engineered” brush the edge of statement. The final image reweights prior motifs without a tidy moral. Resonance lingers via the paradox of “warm coldness.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks a singular perception; diction and rhythm are consistent and confident. No head‑hopping or stance slips, and the voice modulates at peaks (naming, sky stitching) without losing clarity. Elision is purposeful and taught early; no dialogue is needed for effect. Occasional elevated coinages fit the established register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs and the motif‑driven repetitions feel intentional rather than looped. Imagery is rich but generally coherent; a few abstractions stack (“aberrant mercy,” “engineered compassion”) without muddying action. Momentum holds from approach to renaming to communal coda. Minor purple flourishes keep it just shy of peak sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of naming ritual, shattered‑sky aftermath, and “Hearthsteel” as ethic feels fresh and particular. Risks in diction and concept pay off with a distinctive final tableau. Emotional truth leans conceptual but remains grounded in tactile acts. Not wholly unprecedented, but clearly an original stance rather than a template.</comment>
