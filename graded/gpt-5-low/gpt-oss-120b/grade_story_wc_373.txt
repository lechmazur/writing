<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lila’s motives (protect the truce; haunted by “the sound of trust breaking”) are specific and consistent, and her micro‑choices under pressure (decoy vapor; rope‑and‑toss of the lanterns; reporting to elders) align with them. The internal contradiction—comforting unease vs. steadfast action—surfaces without therapy‑speak. Cost is legible in her choice to cast the lanterns into darkness, trading safety for time. Relationship pressure is mostly off‑stage (Marrow, father), limiting crucible intensity on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain (anticipating false starts → decoy → confusion → sprint to storage → lantern toss → elders and ticking watch) supports a Hybrid drive with a Situational end stance (truce holds until sunrise). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she keeps the hush through a costly tactic. Stakes and options are coherent, though the scout encounter resolves quickly, softening climax pressure. Orientation is clean from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pirate market under the rotting pier is vivid across senses (salt, ferment, iron, seaweed), and the tunnels/lantern economy shape choices. The environment constrains tactics: lantern theft would expose tunnels; Lila weaponizes space and light by hurling lanterns into the gloom. The watch fob/time as micro‑setting charges the last image. Minor: spatial choreography during the scout scuffle is brisk but legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the truce—tightens when the lock cracks and the scout appears; the decisive trade‑off is the lantern toss that buys hush at the price of darkness and brief rule breach. Escalation is mostly linear and protagonist‑driven, with a single meaningful turn. The scout beat ends swiftly, limiting felt jeopardy and aftershock. Still, the cost carries into the charged closing cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Trust, time, and hush interweave through recurring objects and sound (lock crack, ticking fob), reweighted at the end. The wish “may the sound of trust never shatter again” edges toward statement, but the piece mostly earns its resonance through concrete actions and images. The final hush at sunrise and the warm fob pulse deliver a quiet, reflective answer without moralizing. Ambiguity about tomorrow’s “false starts” leaves a lingering, active question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close POV is consistent, sensory, and character‑filtered; diction suits Lila’s world. Rhythm varies with pressure and lands cleanly on images. Minor repetition (“curiously steadfast,” “comforting unease”) reads intentional but risks slight echo. Dialogue is minimal, appropriately so, keeping voice coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines carry weight with purposeful imagery and few fillers; verbs do work. Occasional redundancy (“curiously steadfast” twice; “comforting unease” motif) nudges toward echo but doesn’t stall momentum. Figurative density stays mostly controlled, and action order is clear. The closing image is sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “truce of hush,” the target of stealing lanterns, and the quest to “capture the sound of trust breaking” feel fresh within a smuggler/pirate frame. The watch‑fob/time motif and sound‑driven stakes create an original texture. The on‑page confrontation is conventional in shape, slightly moderating novelty. Overall synthesis reads specific and memorable.</comment>
