<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Selene’s motive—to seek “half-lit epiphanies” in service of ethical storytelling—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (arranging dishes, lifting the stick, letting the fire die) align with it. Interiority is specific to her craft and sensibility, though largely contemplative with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The final renunciation/commitment (reversing the hierarchy in future shows) reads earned but carries a subtle cost. Emotional embodiment leans lyric over visceral, sacrificing some friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds image by image toward a conceptual repricing—strings as lifelines and a renewed ethical method. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the dome-to-exit progression is coherent. Closure lands as Charged Poise/CR with the decision to “reverse the old hierarchy,” though the on-page cost is muted. No causality breaks, but pressure remains intentionally low.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radar dome and parabolic dishes are vivid and particular; the concentric arrangement that reflects the ember integrates setting with action. Sensory detail (wind through cracks, pine scent, concrete acoustics) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image and facilitates the epiphany, even if it only lightly constrains choices. Object-as-setting (story stick) deepens atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internal—can she reframe her practice ethically—and escalation is a gentle tightening (arrangement, ember flare, insight). The pressure reads coherent under the accumulative lens but lacks a sharp cost or foreclosed option on the page. The “meteor hush” buffers conflict rather than sharpening it, making the turn feel contemplative more than tested. The result is satisfying but low-tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of agency, consent, and ethical storytelling arise organically from concrete images (strings, reversed dishes) and culminate in a resonant reweighting. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis (“less about dictating truth...”) rather than letting subtext alone carry it. The final carry-out image is strong and consistent with prior motifs. Complexity is present but sometimes leans declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person focalization with a distinct perceptual signature (ink, dishes, ember, hush). Diction and rhythm are consistent and apt; no head-hopping or stance wobbles. Repetition (e.g., “half-lit epiphany”) reads intentional motif rather than crutch, though it edges on overuse. Modulation from interior hush to charged resolve is smooth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-rich with good sentence variety and momentum for a lyric piece. Occasional purple leaning and concept reiteration create minor density drag (“half-lit epiphany” and “ethical storytelling” recur with similar phrasing). No mechanical errors or muddled metaphors; action is legible. The final image lands cleanly without line-level artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an urbane calligrapher in a decommissioned radar dome using a “campfire story stick” to reconsider puppet strings as autonomy. The “meteor hush” and reversed dishes reframe myth-telling with specificity, not gimmickry. The risk is quiet but distinct, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Slightly safer pressure keeps it shy of the highest tier.</comment>
