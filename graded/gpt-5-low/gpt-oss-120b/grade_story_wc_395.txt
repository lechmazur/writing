<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lia’s motivation is clear and sustained—an archivist compelled by absence—but her internal conflict is light; the ethical cost of “lying” is noted but not deeply felt. Her micro-choices (fabricating the post, following the sublayer, recognizing the checksum) align with her competence and personality. Emotional embodiment is mostly atmospheric rather than contradictory under pressure. The closing vow reads earned, though the price paid remains largely conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: the resurfaced patch → metadata numbers → deliberate lie → algorithmic scattering → hidden server → checksum → vault opening → public post that resurfaces files. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: absence becomes stored presence, with a quiet ethical cost in weaponizing the archive’s fabric. Orientation is crisp from the opening; single-POV continuity is clean. The turns resolve a bit easily (paths vanish but decode quickly), slightly softening the felt cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archive is vivid and functional—the “hidden sublayer,” obsolete emojis, backup drives—both textures the world and enables choices. The environment constrains access (concealed server farm; vanishing file paths) and charges the final image of a networked afterlife. Detail selection is POV-shaped and purposeful, with recurring sonic imagery (“echo of forgotten songs”) cohering tone. World rules feel consistent within the story’s speculative register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (resurrecting the lost crew/logs; decoding deletion) and tighten once through the deliberate lie and discovery of the checksum. However, obstacles fall quickly after each attempt, with limited visible sacrifice or foreclosed options on the page. The ethical risk to her position or the network’s pushback is implied rather than dramatized. Tension functions but never bites hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and presence-in-absence accrue organically through the numbers, patch, and sonic motif, culminating in “We are still here.” The lie as conduit for truth adds a worthwhile moral complexity. A few lines verge on tidy affirmation (“absence transformed into a quiet presence”), reducing ambiguity. Still, the final conceptual reframing resonates and reweights the earlier imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person closely tracks Lia’s perceptual bias—data as choir, emojis as a wall—without POV leakage. Rhythm modulates well between hushed atmosphere and procedural moves. No dialogue needed; the narrative certainty matches what Lia can plausibly infer. Diction is consistent and character-apt, with measured flourish rather than excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean, with effective cadence and minimal scaffolding; imagery generally pulls double duty. Some motif repetition (“echo,” “glow”) skirts redundancy but stays purposeful. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and syntax varies enough to maintain flow. Minor lushness occasionally softens urgency, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blending social-network mechanics with a cosmic missing expedition and checksum-as-ghost code feels fresh and integrated. The algorithmic scattering as séance is a smart turn grounded in character agency. The resolution avoids gimmickry, though risk and cost could be sharper for exceptional distinction. The vision coheres as a singular stance on memory and digital afterlife.</comment>
