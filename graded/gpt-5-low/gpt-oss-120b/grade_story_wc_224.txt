<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s desire to find the “shape of home” is vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (using the feather, pressing deeper, returning the stone) align with that drive. The internal friction—painful memory versus compulsion to continue—registers, though it stays mostly lyric rather than dramatically contested. Her realization reads earned through tactile engagement (vibration, scent) rather than bald assertion. The cost of letting go of a fixed idea of home is felt, if gently.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring motifs (feather, hum, thunder, scent) intensify to a corridor and book reveal, culminating in a conceptual repricing—home as resonance. Orientation is clean early (mountain bookstore, seer, stone), and the scene coheres within one continuous window. Closure lands when she returns the stone and reframes her quest, with cost in confronting fractured remembering and relinquishing a fixed endpoint. The cost is somewhat soft but present in the “shattered” image and the earned stasis of choosing resonance over pursuit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore is richly embodied (shelves, ribs, thunder, vellum), and it actively shapes options: the hum opens a new corridor; the space breathes, its heartbeat slowing when the stone is returned. Sensory specificity (pine resin, old ink, mercury glass) is selective and charged through Lira’s POV, not a tourist catalog. The environment charges the final image (mountain breathing with her), satisfying object‑as‑setting stakes. A few lush descriptors flirt with excess, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the internal stake: endure pain to access home’s map; escalation arrives when she “presses the feather deeper,” triggering the new corridor and the book. Agency drives each turn, and the return of the stone is a meaningful renunciation. The price is primarily emotional and conceptual rather than concrete, keeping the intensity refined rather than gripping. Still, the single tightening is clear and earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—home as resonance rather than locale—is developed through concrete motifs (feather texture, scent of pine/rain, hidden thunder) and reweighted at the end. Insights feel earned by contact with object and place rather than authorial statement, even though a few lines tread close to telling. The final cadence reconfigures prior images without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively in the cost of letting go of the fixed courtyard image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is consistent, textured, and filtered through Lira’s sensoria; no head‑hopping or stance leakage appears. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (soft drift to firmer cadence at the corridor/book beats). No dialogue is needed, and the narrative confidence matches what Lira can infer. A slight tendency toward elevated phrasing is voice‑motivated and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are musical with good information density; images perform double duty (stone ribs as both architecture and heartbeat). Occasional lushness risks purple but avoids mixed metaphors and maintains momentum. Sentence variety and paragraphing support breath and surge; little to no scaffold or synonym churn. The final image is clean and recharged by earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—a mountain‑bookstore, a mercury‑glass seer, feather‑based translation of a feeling‑map—feels distinctive and thematically integral. Turns arise from the story’s invented logic rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth (the pain of memory vs. the lure of resonance) complicates the conceit, keeping it from mere ornament. It’s fresh without showy gimmicks, if not wholly radical.</comment>
