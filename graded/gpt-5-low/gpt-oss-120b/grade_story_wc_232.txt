<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elian’s motive (honoring a deathbed promise) is clear and drives concrete choices: he follows ants, seats the chip, and chooses not to step through. Interiority is vivid but mostly lyric-assertive; we rarely see contradictory impulses collide on the page beyond the brief “rope around his chest” urging a choice. The renunciation (turning back) carries some felt cost but is cushioned by certainty, muting struggle. Still, actions align with motives and yield a credible earned stasis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—the creek’s rise, the chip’s hum, and the ants’ pattern intensify toward a threshold image. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the doorway appears, he refuses passage, and reprices mapping as choosing, with the cost of forgoing the unknown. Orientation is strong from the outset; causal threads are clean even in a lyric frame. The cost is present but subtle rather than acute, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is sensorially rich and purposeful: creek, cavern, ants, and pedestal all guide tactics and enable access. Environmental rules (midsummer opening, water‑tuned chip) are consistent and learned through action. The recurring micro‑setting (chip + water + ants) charges the final image of glimmering maps back in the shop. Selectivity and integration are high without postcard clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the promise and confront the doorway—tightens through the rising creek and the corridor’s emergence. The decisive turn is the refusal to step through, which forecloses one path; however, pressure remains more numinous than coercive, with low palpable risk. Escalation is coherent and grows, but the price remains conceptual, not materially testing him. Effective, not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres: promises as compass; maps as choices; small patterns (ants) guiding monumental doors. The final repricing (“the true map was… the act of choosing”) grows from specific experience, and the shop’s transformed practice concretizes the idea. A brief explanatory note to villagers edges toward telling, but the images have already earned the resonance. Ambiguity remains purposeful rather than vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person limited maintains a consistent perceptual signature—ink, water, brass, insect tremors—without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from hush to threshold, then settles into a calmer aftermath. Diction is elevated but apt for a contemplative dealer; minimal dialogue avoids register clashes. Voice is distinctive without becoming opaque.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry layered work—image, action, and theme—while keeping momentum; sensory choices are precise. Occasional abstractions (“empirically intuitive,” “doorway of decisions”) risk pallor but are grounded by concrete beats (chip teeth clicking, drip‑clock water). No significant scaffold or loops; cadence varies. Slight purple lean in places, yet clarity holds, including at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a brass type matrix attuned to water and insects, ant‑guided navigation, and a doorway that revalues mapping as choosing. Risks are coherent and not gimmicky; the return to the shop as the decisive act is quietly surprising and earned. A sharper on‑page cost would push it higher, but the conceptual integration is memorable. The piece commits to its peculiar logic and follows through.</comment>
