<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and steady—she seeks to salvage purity—but interior contradiction is minimal, leaving little friction under pressure. Micro‑choices (mapping dreams, whispering into the globe, embedding a cameo) align with motive but don’t reveal competing impulses. Emotions are embodied via tactile images (cold melting into her skin), yet the character remains archetypal. The final stance shift feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dream‑mapping → lattice recognition → window formation → final invitation → set‑out across the ice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the globe brightens, shards begin returning, she departs charged with starlight. Cost is soft (endurance, surrender to the dream‑tide) but legible in the relinquishing control to a collective process. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: candles, glacier ice, fissured starlight, and the shrine frame the ritual and charge the final image. The melted snow globe functions as micro‑setting/object, evolving from relic to beacon to bridge. Environmental detail is integrated through action (hand on liquid surface, vapor window across the ceiling). While constraint is more tonal than tactical, it consistently shapes meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage purity) is signaled early and tightens when the dream lattice coheres into a window and the tactic shifts to embedding a final cameo. Escalation remains gentle and conceptual; the price is implied endurance and surrender to a communal repair rather than a hard trade‑off. The amber pulse and her departure suggest momentum but not sharpened peril. Coherence holds under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of grief transmuted into collective hope and truth as careful weaving emerge organically through image chains (pine/salt scent, gull’s glass shard, compass spin). The ending reweights earlier motifs without stating a moral, offering a quiet answer: purity is reconstructed via shared fragments. Slight sentimentality (“illuminate countless other shattered dreams”) nudges toward neatness but doesn’t collapse complexity. Subtext runs through objects rather than declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a stable, coherent distance and a distinct perceptual signature (“borrowed starlight,” “loom of memory”). The voice modulates with pressure—hushed in the shrine, brightening at the end—without head‑hopping. Information is filtered through ritual action; no over‑explaining. Elevated diction suits the mythic register the piece teaches early.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images carry multiple jobs and sentences propel rather than stall. Some density risks purple accumulation, but metaphors remain coherent and patterned to the premise. Minimal scaffold or loops; rhythm varies credibly. The final image cleanly reprises earlier motifs without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck‑diver ghost whisperer, melted snow globe as beacon/window, dream cameos mapped by scent—is fresh and committed. Turns arise from established pattern (dream analysis → retrieval plan) rather than late rule changes. The imaginative risk pays off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is quieter than dramatic, but lands.</comment>
