<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motive (preserve hope) and consistent temperament; micro-choices (lifting, aligning, whispering to, and returning the stone; recording new footage) reveal character. Internal tension—luminous regret vs. duty—exists but stays gentle rather than oppositional. The change (from regret to earned gratitude) lands, though it’s not driven by sharply contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → alignment → warming stone → recharged footage → recording a new video. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he reweights loss into legacy and enacts a preserving ritual; cost appears as the acknowledged loss of unrecorded moments. Orientation is clean early, and the stepwise method gives coherence without and-then drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, specific environment (blooming library above clouds, crystal pedestal, ethereal screens) integrated with action. The setting supplies tools and ritual space that shape tactics and the final image (stone on pedestal, balcony exit). Strong sensory weave, especially visual and tactile; symbolism is present but not overbearing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capturing/understanding the “shadow unbound” to preserve hope) is clear. Escalation is a deepening, not a squeeze: the method reveals patterns; the stone’s response tightens meaning rather than options. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional, not a hard trade-off, but it does charge the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming loss into legacy emerges through particulars (stone, footage, mirrored children, shareable dreams). Subtext rides images (warming stone, brightening footage) rather than thesis statements, though a few lines tread near explicit moral (“his mission complete”). The final act (recording his own ritual) offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent lyric close-third with a distinct perceptual signature (twilight, glass, clouds). Rhythm and diction are controlled and suited to the character’s noticing. No head-hopping; modulation from dusk-attentive to dawn-assured reads intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elegant sentences with strong image economy; a few abstractions and repeats (“softly deliberate,” “shape of hope”) flirt with purple but don’t blur sense. Momentum holds, and most lines do multiple jobs. Minor redundancy could be tightened, but the closure image remains crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cloud-library, shareable dreams, a river stone that “holds the shape of hope,” and archival video comparison. Turns feel earned by the ritual logic; no gimmickry. Emotional truth under the lyric surface keeps it from mere ornament.</comment>
