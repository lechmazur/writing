<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, but her interior conflict is minimal; she reads assured rather than pressured. Kovan’s shift is dramatized bodily (jaw unclenching), yet secondary characters mostly function as receivers. The “scheming pacifist” angle is compelling but under‑tested by resistance. The gratitude of the wanderer coda lands, though it avoids showing competing impulses in him before the release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp, the two‑shard structure (monks → wanderer) holds, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is soft but coherent: night’s porous walls → tactile activation → emotional rewiring. The cost is conceptual (surrendering resentment) rather than dramatized as a hard trade‑off. The reprise with the wanderer solidifies the rule‑set without overcomplicating scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sanctuary and music box are vividly specific and integrated; the soundless chamber and nightly “porous” phase shape tactics and tone. Details like obsidian and muted echoes feel purposeful and charged, especially as the final image recasts the place as a beacon. World rules stay consistent through action (touch → pin reappears → pulse). The environment meaningfully times the attempt and charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible (release resentment), but pressure scarcely tightens; once Kovan softens, the rest proceed smoothly. The night window provides a gentle clock, not a squeeze. The resolution is essentially uncontested persuasion aided by a benevolent artifact. Emotional cost is implied rather than sharpened on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of non‑violent change and memory‑borne compassion emerge through concrete beats (vibration aligning nervous pathways) and a charged final image. Some lines verge on thesis statements (“let it rewrite the bitterness”), flattening subtext. The ending resonates as a quiet moral repricing rather than a neat lecture. It lingers, if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent and controlled, with rhythmic variety and a steady perceptual signature. Elevated diction fits the mystical setting; dialogue is spare but purposeful. Occasional purple tilts (“shifting grace,” repeated) risk sameness. POV remains stable and confident without unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry atmosphere well, and most lines do double duty, but there’s mild redundancy in motif phrases and a few abstracted claims (cellular rewiring) without fresh imagery each time. The rhythm breathes; no major scaffold or loop artifacts. Figurative choices mostly cohere, though the pseudo‑scientific register sometimes jars against the mystic tone. Momentum holds through the coda.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pacifist‑as‑schemer using a self‑repairing music box in a soundless, phase‑shifting sanctuary is a distinctive synthesis. The tactile “cellular memory” mechanic, while speculative, yields fresh images and a nonviolent turn. The arc’s tidiness and lack of counterpressure temper surprise. Still, the final reprise with the wanderer feels earned and singular to this world.</comment>
