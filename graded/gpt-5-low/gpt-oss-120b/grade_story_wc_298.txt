<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maelia’s drive to mend an inner void is clear and embodied through tactile choices (sigils, soot line, placing the card). The “fiercely gentle”/reckless tension is stated and lightly felt, but her recklessness never exacts an on‑page consequence. Interiority is consistent and image‑led, though insights like “She understood then…” tilt toward telling. The final stance shift (burden lightens; resolve deepens) lands, albeit with low felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single scene, clean anchors, and a held Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens through ritual acts culminating in the card’s dissolution into amber. Closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the relic is transmuted, the orchard breathes easier, and her resolve is reweighted. Cost is implied by the earlier pact and “sacrifice” but is not materially tested at the end, softening impact. No causality breaks or teleporting props; the pattern it teaches is paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid, specific, and integrated with action—the bones, roots, and hollow shape each move and charge the final image. The burned card and amber thread function as object‑as‑setting that reconfigures the space. Sensory selection is purposeful, skewing to tactile and dim light consistent with the frame. World rules (orchard responds to sigils) are stable and learned by observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal the self via pact‑charged ritual) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as acts intensify from carving to the card’s placement. The meaningful turn is the root’s shiver/luminescence leading to the hollow and final insertion. However, no clear narrowing or trade‑off is forced; the path feels unopposed and largely assured. The price is more conceptual than felt, muting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of exchange, repair, and mutual binding accrue through repeated images (roots stitching, sigils as promises, amber thread) and reweight at the end. The realization that bartered destinies “stitch” both sides is resonant but somewhat explained rather than purely enacted. Ambiguity remains about the moral cost, which keeps it alive past the page. Largely avoids sermonizing despite a few declarative lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third with controlled diction and rhythm; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. The voice carries imagery without losing legibility, and psychic distance holds steady. Occasional elevated abstractions (“inlaying meaning everywhere,” “dusky resolve”) border on purple but remain coherent. Compression is purposeful and taught by the opening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line work is polished and image‑dense, with strong verbs and minimal scaffold. Some repetition (“inlaying meaning everywhere,” “dusky resolve,” “half‑lit corridors”) risks echo without new pressure. Figurative load stays legible, though costs could be sharpened with more concrete friction. Rhythm varies well and lands a clean final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” plus tarot‑pact economy feels fresh, and the amber thread through marrow is a striking, idiosyncratic turn. The synthesis of ritual ecology and destiny‑barter is coherent and character‑driven. Mechanics remain tastefully oblique rather than codified, preserving mystery without confusion. Risk sits in the lyric mode rather than structural gambits and largely pays off.</comment>
