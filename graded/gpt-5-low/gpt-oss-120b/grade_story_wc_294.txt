<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Arlen’s motives (boundary‑setting over reckless looping) are consistent and enacted through concrete choices (proposing the markers, gently dissuading Maya, returning to the train, pocketing the last note). Interiority is particular—filtered through his father’s legacy and the tactile currency—but internal contradiction is muted; his “polished calm” rarely strains against an opposing impulse. The final renunciation/reframing feels earned by prior beats. Slight safety in his perfection (rare visible flaw) limits ceiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the crash + return to the train reweight “loops” as tests rather than failures, with cost legible in the failed startup and his measured pivot. Orientation is clear early; the two‑shard structure (rise/fall → train return) coheres. Some transitions are summarized, but the final image cleanly seals the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The circus train and foreign notes are vivid, tactile, and recur to charge the ending image; the office’s cracked panes and dusky light calibrate tone. The train acts as a physical analogue that shapes tactic (territorial markers) and then anchors the closure. Sensory detail is selective and perspective‑driven, with objects doing thematic work without feeling ornamental.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to code for loops as boundaries versus creative wandering—is present, with one meaningful tightening when Arlen overrules Maya via persuasion and installs markers. Escalation remains mostly tonal and situational; the rise/fall montage lessens on‑page pressure and cost visibility in the middle. The ending’s stance crystallization lands, but the path there is low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Recurring images (loops, markers, currency) integrate with legacy and choice to deliver a resonant stance on boundaries as guides, not cages. The final realization is evocative but edges toward explicit statement (“circles are not failures”), slightly reducing subtext. Still, the charged reprise of the notes and dawn walk provides an earned, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV and register are steady, with a supple, controlled cadence that fits Arlen’s temperament. Diction is coherent; brief dialogue is purposeful and subtextual (the Maya exchange). No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty; the reflective mode remains anchored in concrete cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lucid, image‑dense, and largely economical; recurring lexicon (“dusky,” “polished calm”) risks minor echo but maintains cohesion. Sentences often do double duty, and rhythm varies to suit the contemplative texture. Slight purple accumulation in places, but clarity and propulsion hold through the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—startup cartography of human journeys + abandoned circus train + foreign notes as territorial markers—is fresh and memorable. The revaluation of loops through legacy feels non‑obvious yet inevitable by the end. Risk is taken in the lyric, accumulative structure without losing legibility.</comment>
