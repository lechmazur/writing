<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and a handful of embodied beats (“trembling fingers,” quiet pride) ground the titan, but internal contradiction is minimal. He rarely falters or reveals blind spots; choices read competent and clean rather than pressured. Still, actions align with motive and the modesty/power contrast gives him texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: oracle clue → pellet → map → crown → sunder → exposure → exit, with on‑page cost (temple’s collapse, spent pellet). Orientation is immediate and the closure lands decisively. Minor ease—finding the pellet and decoding occur with limited resistance—but within scope the sequence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail carries pressure: shelves melting into walls, papyrus scent, architecture collapsing as truth asserts itself. The library and its tools constrain choices and charge the final image (ink sealing truth into stone, guardian spirits through falling arches). World rules feel internally consistent and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear, and escalation is anchored by the crown touch triggering the sunder and the specter’s exposure. Agency drives the turns, and costs register (temple’s demise; exhausted ink). The pressure could sharpen with a harder trade‑off or near‑failure, but the single decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Truth dissolving deceit and the idea that legitimacy endures while imposture collapses recur through image and action; the “graceful collapse” motif lands. The explicit lineage pronouncement edges toward thesis, slightly flattening ambiguity. Yet the final hymn of renewal earns a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Controlled, mythic third‑person with consistent distance and textured diction; the voice fits the fable‑like frame. The single line of dialogue functions as ritual action rather than exposition. Rhythm modulates well from hushed to cataclysmic without head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; figurative language is lush but largely coherent and scene‑advancing. Minimal scaffolding, clean syntax, and strong verb choices maintain momentum. A few lyric clusters approach purple but do not blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The diminutive titan, iron‑gall truth‑ink, and the rune of drift feel freshly combined; the “graceful collapse” aesthetic is distinctive. The rightful‑blood claim is conventional, slightly tempering novelty. Overall, the synthesis reads confident and specific rather than templated.</comment>
