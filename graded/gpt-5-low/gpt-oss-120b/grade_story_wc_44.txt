<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation and a consistent “quietly deliberate” temperament, but little internal contradiction or felt struggle under pressure. Lira executes a plan competently with minimal doubt or micro‑costs beyond patience. Interiority is largely procedural and descriptive, not decision‑charged. The resolution feels earned but emotionally low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Coherent causal chain: glyph work → key chime → doorway → realization → key in arch → map. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration (the noon‑shadows’ destination) with a tidy loop‑closing image. Cost is light, mostly conceptual (foreclosing dormant potentials as the awakenings “rest”), keeping it below the highest tier. Orientation is solid from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective worldbuilding—floating isle, nocturnal observatory, copper plates, telescope—as tools embedded in action. The clockwork key and telescope placement physically constrain choices (doorway above the lens; key into the arch). Sensory detail supports tone without devolving into a catalog. World rules (loops, runes, awakened energy) feel consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is conceptual discovery, and escalation is gentle: ritual intensifies to doorway, then chamber. Opposition is minimal and mostly procedural; no strong trade‑off or live option foreclosed on the page. The tightening exists but the felt price is muted. The key beats still cumulate to a clear turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Loops, observation vs. revelation, and shadows as travelers cohere into a resonant answer image. Some explicit telling (“She realized…were not merely absence of light”) blunts subtext. The final cadence reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though complexity is modest. The theme lands, if a bit tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close third with lyrical texture and controlled diction; no head‑hopping, no register drift. Rhythm suits the meditative, methodical action. Voice carries consistent perceptual bias (runes, gears, clocks). Absence of dialogue avoids pitfalls but limits tonal modulation opportunities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean, well‑paced lines with good information density; images do more than one job. Mild repetition and occasional explanatory clauses slightly thin the charge but do not slow momentum. Figurative language stays coherent to the world’s mechanics (gears, loops, light). The final image is lucid and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: spoons bending reality, a clockwork key, and loop‑magic mapping noon‑shadows feels fresh and integrated. Turns arise from established logic rather than late rule drops. The risk is tonal restraint—conflict remains gentle—but the conceptual frame is memorable. The closing “map of shadows” image recontextualizes the whole elegantly.</comment>
