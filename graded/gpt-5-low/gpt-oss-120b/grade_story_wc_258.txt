<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (map patterns after the crash), rendered through tactile actions with tape, cards, and journal. Interiority is specific but shows limited contradiction; she rarely wavers or pays a visible price. Micro-choices (aligning tape with tunnels, kneeling, promising the unseen architects) reveal values but under soft pressure. The final acceptance of “compass over burden” reads earned but lightly contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers image-signal (glow, hum, snap, droplet) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the pattern of ritual actions coheres. Closure lands as a stance crystallization (purpose found) with conceptual cost (renouncing profit-centric frames), though the price is understated. The beats sequence sensibly without causal leaps or resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is richly integrated: rain, skylight, tunnels, and brass tables filter through her cartomancer bias. The measuring tape functions as micro-setting and tool, constraining action and charging the final droplet image. Environmental sounds (wind chorus, hum) modulate pressure and mirror internal search. Specificity is high without tourist cataloging; details consistently affect perception and choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on extracting a pattern to guide rebuilding, but escalation remains gentle. The tightening moments (cards flaring when tape crosses glyphs, the hum at corridor intersection, the tape’s snap) deepen pattern recognition without forcing a hard trade-off. Agency is present yet largely contemplative; the cost of her choice is conceptual and mild. The resolution is earned by ritual persistence rather than pressure that forecloses options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of inherited mystery, pattern-mapping, and community hope rise organically from the ritual actions. Some lines verge on thesis statements (“not merely profit, but a blueprint of hope”) which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final droplet-on-tape reprise reweights prior motifs with a resonant, forward-looking answer. The piece invites reflection on belief systems and markets without pedantry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and lyrically precise, with a distinct perceptual signature (ink, ledgers, routes, hums). Rhythm varies well, sustaining atmosphere without head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful and legible under the accumulative mode. No dialogue needed; the internal cadence carries action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and musical with strong image economy, though metaphor density is high across multiple sentences. Occasional near-redundancies (multiple restatements of inherited mystery/hope) modestly slow momentum. Syntax and punctuation are clean; images are coherent. The final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Cartomancy fused with post-crypto collapse and a measuring-tape ritual is a fresh, specific synthesis. The humming walls and rune‑ink ledgers add singular texture without gimmickry. The closure image feels inevitable given the established pattern. Risk is taken in favoring lyric accumulative pressure over plot—successful at this length.</comment>
