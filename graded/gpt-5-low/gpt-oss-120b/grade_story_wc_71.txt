<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—sanctifying a restless mind and understanding why houses feel alive—and actions align (buying, placing, and carrying the shard). Interiority is textured but low-conflict; contradictory impulses are faint and pressure is gentle. The elderly woman adds a light relational pressure but doesn’t force a choice. The final acceptance of the role as “catalyst” feels earned though the felt cost remains soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the hush spreads, pattern density rises, and the final realization reweights the premise (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the object’s rules remain consistent. Closure lands with the narrator’s role redefined and the town’s rhythm altered. Cost is present but subtle (the “weight of silence” and ongoing responsibility), limiting the ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bay at dawn, streetlights “daydreaming,” and the perfumer’s shop create a vivid, integrated atmosphere. The shard functions as a charged micro‑setting object that shapes action and the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful, especially olfactory and visual motifs aligning with the perfumer frame. While the environment gently guides rather than constrains choices, it decisively charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and coherent, but pressure remains low; escalation appears as a widening field of hush rather than narrowing options. The key tightening—placing the shard and witnessing its spread—deepens meaning without forcing a trade‑off. No major reversal or cost that forecloses a path. The resolution is fitting yet comfortable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of attention, communal listening, and sanctification emerge organically through image and action. The “hush” reframes agency as careful noticing, culminating in a resonant final cadence. Occasional overt framing (“I realized… my role… was not simply to observe”) edges toward telling but doesn’t flatten the subtext. The emotional aftereffect is delicate and credible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first‑person voice with a strong perceptual signature (streetlights, brine, hush) remains consistent. Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate with the piece’s quiet pressure. Brief dialogue blends naturally into the tone. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high image density and clean syntax. Some phrase repetition and lushness flirt with purple (“hushed blaze,” “streetlights daydream,” “sanctify”) and could be trimmed for propulsion. Still, momentum holds and images generally do multiple jobs. The final beat reads clearly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “shard of hush” via perfumer’s orris root is original and thoughtfully extended through displaced objects. The accumulative transformation of the town’s breath feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken in tone and concept without losing clarity. Slight safety in conflict keeps it just below exceptional.</comment>
