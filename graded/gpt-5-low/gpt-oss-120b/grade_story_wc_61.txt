<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—she vows to “share light without using fire” and makes concrete choices (aligns the gear, releases pulses, plants it). Interiority is lyric but thin on contradictory impulses; she “presses on” after seeing war‑shadows, yet the struggle remains largely conceptual. Embodied emotion comes through image rather than felt bodily stress. The renunciation of fire carries cost, but it is elegiac rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses broaden, echoes return memories, and the final planting yields a filament rising—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear early (who/where/what) and remains stable. Cost registers as a mourned refusal of fire and acceptance of a less visceral glow. The causal chain is lyric but coherent within the taught pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and specific (crystalline walls, pulsar alignment, slow tides of petals) and integrates with action via mapping echoes and alignment to a pulsar. The recurring object (gear) and environment mutually charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful, with non‑visual elements (sonar, hum). World rules remain consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (light without fire), and escalation occurs as sonar reveals war‑shadows, testing her vow. The tightening is a commitment choice—she continues despite troubling revelations. The cost is felt but largely conceptual; no option is foreclosed beyond the renunciation already stated. Tension stays coherent but never bites deeply enough to feel perilous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, non‑destructive illumination, and memory/math as love cohere through recurring images. The final act (planting the gear; a new horizon rising) reweights the premise elegantly. However, the line “she understood that light could travel without fire” states the thesis outright, dulling subtext. The piece otherwise lets images carry meaning without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, confident lyric third‑person with a distinct sensory lexicon (sonar, filaments, petals) and controlled cadence. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elision is pattern‑taught and paid off. Diction suits the otherworldly sensibility without jarring register shifts. Minor risk of purple flourish, but rhythm holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with strong image economy; sentences often do more than one job. Some metaphor density and motif looping (petals, glow, sonar) verge on redundancy, softening propulsion. No major clarity issues or syntactic artifacts. The final image lands cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—sonar as light, a gear that “approximates infinity,” and a nebula garden—feels fresh and coherently executed. The generational vow and non‑fire illumination provide a non‑obvious moral calculus. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off in a memorable closing tableau. Slight conventionality creeps in via explicit thematic statement.</comment>
