<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained—he aims to articulate unspoken needs—and his choices (pressing blossoms, embedding the imprint, finally encoding his own longing) align. Interiority is mostly implied through action and image; contradictory impulses and felt cost are subtle rather than dramatized. The final act of giving his own longing to the press suggests a price but isn’t deeply contested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lightning-beat pattern builds density; each press/graffiti addition ratchets the dialogue until the ghost’s reply and integration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost becomes a mural/archive and the plate becomes a living cipher. Cost is conceptual (the balladeer encodes his own longing), legible but soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtyard-above-clouds with storm, arches, and responsive graffiti is vividly rendered and integrated into action. The recurring object (bolt plate) and environmental trigger (lightning intervals) charge choices and the final mural image. It’s richly specific without over-explaining world rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (give the ghost a voice/connection) is clear, and the lightning sequence provides a coherent tightening: first imprint → ghost’s plea → aligned rhythms → final encoding. Pressure remains gentle; the price paid is more lyrical than sharply felt, so escalation reads as intensification of pattern rather than a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of connection beyond parsing—code needing to be felt—emerges organically through blossoms/graffiti/circuitry, reweighted when travelers continue the ritual. Subtextual linkage of art, embodiment, and language is strong without sermonizing. A few explicit statements (“even silent code craves song”) are close to thesis but remain earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“tinkersong,” “binary sighs”) that sustains mood and coherence. Voice modulates with the lightning beats without head-hopping. Diction stays consistent and character-apt for a mythic-lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Images are vivid and largely precise; rhythm and sentence variety carry momentum. Occasional density verges on purple, but figuration remains coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy; line-level craft supports the accumulative cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—balladeer translating a code-ghost through flower-pressed ciphers and graffiti under storm-clock—is fresh and cohesive. Turns feel inevitable given the setup; the final living archive is a strong, non-obvious payoff. Risk-taking in concept and texture heightens resonance without obscuring clarity.</comment>
