<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clear motive (to “certify wonder as essential”) and a few micro‑choices (unwrap, sing, re‑stow, depart) ground her, but internal contradiction and felt cost are minimal. Interiority is largely lyrical description rather than pressured decision. The bell ringer’s competence is assured; struggle or trade‑off never meaningfully tests her values. Earned change reads more as affirmed identity than altered stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reads as an accumulative/textural build: sound-light density crests, the cavern “answers,” and a charged quiet returns with memory—an RR in the final image. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene scope holds. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the closure lands, but the price is light. The two‑shard feel (inside → outside) supports cadence shift without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ice cavern and aurora are vividly rendered and integral—the acoustics and reflective ice mediate the action and charge the ending image (sheet pulsing in sync with the aurora). Sensory selection aligns with a synesthetic POV. World rules remain consistent and learned through action. Strong atmosphere without tourist catalog drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pressure is gentle: the dominant stake (imprinting wonder) faces little opposition, so escalation is mostly intensity of image, not narrowing options. One meaningful tightening occurs as the cavern “answers,” but no trade‑off is forced. The cost of leaving or of singing is barely felt. Tension stays aesthetic rather than consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of awe-as-essential emerges through recurring images (amber sheet, aurora, hush) and the reweighted silence at the end. However, explicit thesis lines (“certify wonder as essential”) edge into sermonizing and lessen subtext. The final image resonates conceptually but skirts sentimentality by telling the meaning rather than fully embodying it. Still, the motif braid broadly coheres.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent, confident lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (color-sound interweave). Rhythm varies well across pulses and hush. No head‑hopping and stance remains plausible to the POV. Occasional elevated abstractions are supported by the chosen register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lush diction largely serves the moment, with strong image economy. Some redundancy and phrase recurrence (e.g., “through the colors of the aurora,” “oscillating repose”) risks purple echo and minor momentum drag. Figurative logic stays coherent; sentence rhythm is modulated. Could tighten a few near‑duplicate beats to improve propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Synesthetic bell‑ringing that paints ice with sound via an amber score is a fresh, cohesive synthesis. The “sculpted hush” and chisel motif smartly frame a conceptual clock. Innovation is more atmospheric than structural, but it feels singular rather than templated. A bolder on‑page price or reversal would elevate it further.</comment>
