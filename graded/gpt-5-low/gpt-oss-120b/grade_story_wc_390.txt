<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s “logically emotional” mind is embodied in concrete choices—spectrometer readings alongside heartbeat matching—giving her competence texture. The internal contradiction (math vs. music) is present but lightly tested; she succeeds without much degradation or error under pressure. Her motive to protect and calibrate for healing reads consistent and active. The felt cost is mostly a tear and acceptance of stewardship, credible but modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: tuning the key → ice chorus → hidden panel → descent → rune-harmony → retrieval → calibrated cradle → final absolution. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when clear), and the single-scene window holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she secures the Heart’s mode of action toward healing, with on-page consequence. Cost is subtle but present in her renunciatory calibration and self-binding duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina and lighthouse aren’t backdrop; the sea’s hum and ice chorus are the medium enabling the unlock, and the final beam/ice glow charges the last image. Tool and environment—the copper drum, coils, dock ice—shape tactics and outcome. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered through an engineer with a musical ear. World rules are taught by action (432 Hz, harmonics) and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (protect the Heart from weaponization) and pressure coheres through the tuning and descent. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than reversal; options narrow at the vault and again with the calibration choice. The cost is more ethical than perilous; no strong antagonistic force or tangible loss presses her beyond competence. Still, the calibration to “heal, not harm” forecloses a path with clear implications.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Science and spirit reconcile in action, not commentary: numbers and heartbeat align to remake grief as sound, culminating in a quiet absolution. Thematic throughline—protection vs. power, adaptation for mercy—emerges from particulars (copper threads transmitting only to ready listeners). A few phrases flirt with sentimentality (“last chance at redemption”), but the final image earns its lift. Ambiguity remains about wider consequences, in a good way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical without losing spatial or causal clarity, and the perceptual signature (engineer-musician) colors diction. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Occasional heightened phrasing risks purple but stays legible and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well across setup, descent, and cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is controlled: strong verbs, integrated imagery, and multi-tasking sentences carry momentum. Some metaphor density (“fleshly ethereal glow,” “amber shards”) edges toward excess but doesn’t muddle action. No evident loops or scaffold; information density is high with clear sequencing. The final lines reprise motifs cleanly without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse engineer + vibrational unlocking + grief-dissolving crystal is a distinctive synthesis executed through specific tactics (432 Hz, copper drum, coil rig). The ice chorus and keyed resonance feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is lyrical rather than structural; it pays off without obscuring clarity. The core beats avoid template plotting even as the arc remains classical.</comment>
