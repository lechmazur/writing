<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (to navigate without moving) and embodied attention to tools and environment anchor her interiority. The reverent, ritualistic stance feels particular, though internal contradiction is minimal and she meets little genuine resistance. The small renunciation—choosing understanding over motion—reads as an earned stasis. A touch more friction or self‑doubt under pressure would deepen the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and pressures (pulse, birds, arrowhead, bone towers) thicken toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Orientation is clean and the final acceptance of still navigation provides closure. Cost is present but soft, framed as a quiet renunciation rather than a felt loss. A sharper hinge—where a nontrivial option is foreclosed—would elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon of echoes and bone towers is vivid and governs tactics: wind, acoustics, and hollow chambers materially shape her method and the final resonance. Details are POV‑filtered and purposeful, avoiding tourist cataloging. The arrowhead functions as a charged micro‑setting in her hand at the end. Strong environmental integration without rule breaks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear, but pressure is gentle; the birds’ surge and the resonance alignment serve as the single deepening. There’s little risk or counterforce to test commitment, so the felt price remains abstract. The outcome arrives without a meaningful trade‑off beyond renunciation. One concrete impediment or live alternative would tighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stillness versus motion, listening to history, and continuity through reverence emerge organically from action and image. The final quiet image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the flock’s “living compass” and the bone towers’ approval lands cleanly. Slightly contained ambiguity keeps it resonant without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (sound/pressure bias) and controlled rhythm. Diction and syntax modulate with the scene’s hush without drifting registers. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Voice supports the accumulative lens and the charged final poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; repetitions (“pulse,” “weathered resolve”) serve motif rather than pad. Figurative language stays coherent to sound, wind, and bone; no mixed metaphors that blur sense. Minor lushness never stalls momentum. Clean mechanics and sequencing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Bird‑pattern navigation, bone‑tower acoustics, and a “stone skimmer” mapping by pulse synthesize into a fresh, cohesive vision. Risks are aesthetic, not gimmicky, and the world logic holds. The closure image feels inevitable within this invented logic. Slightly low overt cost keeps it just shy of the top tier.</comment>
