<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation (“mentor resilience quietly”) is clear and drives concrete choices (annotation, tea‑geometry decoding, protection of texts). Contradictory impulses—nervous backward walking vs. “combative tenderness”—surface in scene and modulate behavior. The steadying of her steps as confidence replaces retreat reads as an earned micro‑change. Slight limitation: internal conflict is gently tested, not truly cornered.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural with causal threads: decoding → timed sun strike → shattering → map → altar healing. Closure lands on‑page via the shadow’s dissolution and the library’s “breathing”/walls healing (RR with a light CR tint). The double crest (shards, then altar) is coherent but slightly diffuses peak concentration; cost is implied rather than explicit. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library’s dust, cracked cups, swing’s hymn, sun angle, and altar aren’t decorative; they constrain tactics (noon strike) and charge the final image. Recurring objects (shadow glass, tea, journals) function as micro‑settings that shape action. Sensory selection feels voiced and purposeful. Minor lyric flourish risks excess, but spatial logic remains intact.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the library’s reversible exile—is established early and pursued through a tightening pattern (tea → time → altar). Escalation is present but gentle; there’s little counter‑pressure beyond timing and fragility. The artifact’s shattering supplies a small, felt price, yet consequences carry minimal risk to the protagonist. The arc remains satisfying but not punishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through tender stewardship emerges from particulars (annotation practice, tea‑geometry, vow to guard stories) and reweights at closure when the library “breathes.” Subtext rides the image system (shadow imprisoned, then released) rather than thesis. One on‑the‑nose declaration (“You will not be exiled again…”) slightly flattens ambiguity. Overall resonance lingers without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third close with a distinct perceptual signature (object‑focused, ritualistic, tactile). Rhythm varies and tightens toward the timed sun beat; no POV leakage. Purposeful diction supports mood without register drift. Minimal dialogue is apt and charged when it appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with strong images; propulsion holds through the decoding and altar beats. Occasional purple stacking and repeat phrasing (“combative tenderness” echoed) create slight excess. Clarity remains strong at peak beats, and syntax varies to suit pressure. No material scaffold or loop artifacts that dull closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tea‑leaf geometry as temporal cipher, an afternoon shadow imprisoned in glass, and “combative tenderness” as stance feel genuinely fresh and integrated. The mosaic of rituals culminating in architectural healing reads inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking elevates without obscuring clarity. Minor familiar notes (sacralized altar) don’t blunt the originality.</comment>
