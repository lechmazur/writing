<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—claustrophobia versus the codex’s pull—are embodied (shallow breath, tactile fear) and carried to a quiet renunciation at the end. Motivation is consistent and clean: to stand by the unremembered, dramatized by aligning the codex and later burying it. The internal struggle could tighten under peak pressure (the phase jump succeeds without a stutter), slightly softening cost. Still, actions align with motives and reveal character under strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: causality is clear (tide → arrays hum → alignment → phase transit → return), while pattern and cadence do the charging. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she returns and buries the codex, foreclosing access in favor of stewardship. The cost is conceptual rather than felt as pain, which tempers impact. Orientation is clean early and the single transition is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: tides, rusted doors, and cable farms constrain timing and enable the method. Sensory specificity (“crashing hush,” brine, old circuitry) is filtered through Mara’s body and craft. The arrays and undersea cables are used tactically, not as wallpaper. The final image on the sand recharges earlier atmosphere without redundancy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (risk of being stranded; moral duty to the forgotten) and signaled early, with one meaningful tightening at tide apex. However, pressure never bites back—no setback or forced trade beyond the quiet choice to bury the codex. The danger reads more declared than tested, reducing felt cost. Resolution is earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship/remembering the invisible accrues through repeated images (gold flecks, cables as language) and culminates in burial. The final act reweights power as custody, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. A hint of tidiness and triumphal tone smooths complexity that might have deepened the aftertaste. Still, the piece invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person is steady, textured, and plausibly bound to Mara’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the diction is coherent and confident without head‑hopping. A touch of lushness edges toward purple in places but remains legible. No dialogue is needed; the voice carries the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are dense and often do multiple jobs (world rule, mood, and action in one). Occasional metaphor stacking (“jellyfish bellies,” “crashing hush”) risks saturation but does not blur causality. Minimal scaffold, clean syntax, and good propulsion through the transition and return. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—undersea cable shrines, a phosphorescent codex, and phase transition arrays timed to tides—feels fresh and integrated. Turns arise from established elements rather than late rule drops. Emotional truth (stewardship over conquest) elevates the concept. Risk sits in the quiet, conceptual cost rather than spectacle, and it lands.</comment>
