<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and consistent, with a credible tension between carnival freedom and loyalty to dock workers. However, interiority is largely told rather than dramatized; we’re told her “dual allegiance tugged her heart” without embodied micro-choices under pressure. Her competence skews the piece toward smooth success, limiting felt cost. The phoenix decision nods at balance but doesn’t force a painful on‑page trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats connect cleanly: task → discovery of chip → graffiti network → reorganization → investors arrive → council postpones privatization. Closure lands on the page (postponement and living map) with a modest cost (ongoing fight, secrecy, divided loyalty). The sequence is legible and purposeful, but key turns happen in summary rather than a pressure scene, muting impact. No orientation or rule breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The raft‑carnival is vivid and selective: lights, creaking hulls, mist, and riverbank tourism that dictates spatial rearrangement. Setting functions in tactics (moving games toward the river, artisans by water) and charges the final image with the chip in a glass case by the river. World rules remain consistent and learned through action. Slightly more embodied navigation of tight spaces under urgency could have pushed it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (privatization vs. communal autonomy) and escalate coherently as the network quietly restructures the city before investors arrive. The tightening is present but low-friction; obstacles never materially threaten the plan, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed on the page. The council’s postponement reads earned but easy. Cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Art as covert civic infrastructure, communal resistance, and the ethics of dual allegiance resonate through the chip, graffiti, and phoenix image. The ending reweights prior images (chip → living map; phoenix as promise) without sermonizing. Some lines edge toward thematic declaration (“the fight had only begun”), softening subtext. Still, the integration is coherent and leaves a reflective aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third‑person voice is steady, confident, and gently lyrical with a consistent perceptual bias toward pattern and flow. No head‑hopping or stance slips; compression is controlled. Occasional repetition (“hopeful desperation”) and summary tilt reduce dynamism. Lack of dialogue limits textural range under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly economical, with strong images (“kaleidoscope of music,” “living map”). Some summarizing passages flatten momentum, and a few phrases recur, creating mild echo. Figurative density stays coherent; no muddled metaphors. Line rhythm is varied enough to carry the piece.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A raft city carnival as a civic organism, a “culture shock absorber” protagonist, and resistance via encoded graffiti feel fresh and well‑synthesized. The foundation chip as micro‑object guiding a communal redesign is an inventive engine. The plan’s near‑frictionless success dampens surprise, but the premise and image system remain distinctive. The phoenix closure is earned by prior motifs.</comment>
