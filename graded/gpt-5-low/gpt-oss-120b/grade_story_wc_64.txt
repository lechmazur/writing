<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—he seeks the “shape of intentions”—and his choices (opening the case, decoding the tapestry, pocketing the map) align. Interiority is sensorially embodied, but internal conflict is minimal; he faces little resistance or contradiction. The blitheness paired with ritual gravity is interesting, yet the cost of carrying remembrance is only lightly felt. The ending registers an earned stance, but with modest pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual builds to a conceptual repricing where intention becomes a circle/seed. Orientation is clean early (gardener, cemetery, silo at night), and the ritual proceeds coherently. Closure lands on the page through the final image of tending with the humming case; the cost is the chosen burden of remembrance, though it’s gentle. Structure stays within one continuous scene with a single dominant drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and coherent—“velveteen gloom,” cobalt silo, sovereign case, tapestry—and integrated into action. Object-as-setting (the case) meaningfully charges the ending image and shapes handling of the map. The silo influences tone and cadence (wind, pulsing skin) but doesn’t truly constrain choices. Sensory selection remains purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and consistent but pressure is soft; the work unfolds without friction or meaningful risk. The key deepening is the revelation of Marlowe’s map and the circle insight, which reweights meaning rather than tightening options. No adversarial force tests commitment beyond attention and care. The result feels serene rather than contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: intention as shape, remembrance over punishment, seed over weapon. Recurring images (circle, case, tapestry threads) converge to reweight the premise at the end. However, several thesis-like declarations (“the shape of intentions was a circle... not a weapon but a seed”) tilt toward on-the-nose. Still, resonance lingers via the final tending image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with a distinct perceptual signature. POV distance holds steady without leakage; compression is purposeful. Some diction leans ornate, but rhythm is controlled and legible. The cadence modulates at the close to a calm, convincing hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and musical, with strong image economy in places. At times the prose edges into purple with stacked modifiers and repeated constructions, slightly slowing momentum. Minimal scaffolding; most lines do double duty. The final images are clear and not muddled by figurative overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blend of a cemetery ritual, a cobalt silo, and decoding a tapestry to find a healing map feels fresh and specific. The sovereign case’s tactile mechanics and the circle/seed repricing show integrity of vision. Risks are taken in lyric accumulation rather than plotted reversals, and they largely pay off. Some conceptual moves are familiar, but the execution keeps them singular.</comment>
