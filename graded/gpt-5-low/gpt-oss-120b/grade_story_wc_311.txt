<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular: Lira seeks to name nameless fears and relieve ancestral grief. Interiority is embodied through tactile interactions with the page, crystals, and light, though resistance is minimal and the process feels relatively frictionless. The ache over a half‑remembered sailor adds specificity. The final release reads earned but not hard‑won, keeping this short of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: naming each crystal deepens the pattern and culminates in the remembered name in the stars. Orientation is immediate (observatory at dusk, reaper, page), and causality is clean: atlas page → crystallization → chants → naming → aurora → personal memory. Closure lands on page with a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief’s rule is reweighted. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of “endless mourning.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly rendered and functionally integrated: cracked dome, scattered light, and stone pillars become conduits and enable the crystallization. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, aligning with Lira’s focus. World rules (light crystallizing ink, chanting crystals) are learned through action. The setting charges the final image as a sanctuary of names.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through the accumulative ritual of naming; the chant grows, the aurora forms, and the emotional cost mounts. Escalation is tonal and imagistic rather than adversarial, but it narrows toward the decisive act of speaking the lover’s name. Visible price is internal—letting the burden become a bridge—credible at this length. Slight softness arises from the absence of real hindrance or failed attempt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice, naming, and grief‑to‑gratitude emerges from concrete acts rather than authorial summary. Recurring images (light, crystals, breath of stones) are reweighted by the final constellation‑name. One line edges toward declarative (“transformed from a burden into a bridge”) but is earned by prior particulars. Subtext of ancestral debt and honesty under fear resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with Lira’s perception—ceremonial, precise, and image‑driven. Psychic distance holds; no head‑hopping or register drift. Cadence modulates effectively from hushed ritual to lifting closure. A touch of lushness verges on purple but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied syntax and strong verbs; imagery generally coheres. Minor repetition (“echo of sacrifice”) and stacked modifiers flirt with overwriting but do not cloud causality. Rhythm supports momentum through the naming sequence. Final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Reaper‑as‑namer, crystallizing atlas ink via scattered light, and an observatory that sings—this synthesis feels fresh and organic. The ritualized escalation toward a personal name is inventive and thematically integral. Risks in diction and concept pay off without confusion. Slight familiarity in grief‑release arcs keeps it shy of the rarest tier.</comment>
