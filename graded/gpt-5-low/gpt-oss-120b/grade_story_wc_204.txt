<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mara’s goal—to compress eternity into a moment—is clear and drives action, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or pays an emotional price beyond abstract risk. Interiority leans declarative over embodied, though the tactile frost/ink choices reveal a consistent temperament. The peak choice (spiral, press slam) aligns with her craft, but we don’t feel a deep personal cost or fear. Character reads distinct but remains more emblem of theme than fully conflicted person.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, imagery layers coherently from bottle to press to rupture to lattice, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration rather than a causal twist. Closure lands: the library is reconfigured and her printed page seals the aim, with a conceptual cost—the shattering of the “perfect system.” Orientation is clear early, pattern is taught and kept. The cost registers more conceptually than viscerally, holding back a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass orchard, frost, bottle, press, and cloud‑sea are vivid and materially used; environment and objects directly shape tactics (frost spiral, press placement) and charge the final lattice image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with evolving environmental effects (shards to conduits to portals). World rules are consistent within the lyric mode. Slight over‑reliance on visual shine prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—risking rupture to capture eternity—and escalation arrives via density shifts: whisper → ink → crack → cascade → lattice. Agency drives the turn (her method and the press slam), but the danger mostly resolves into wonder, dulling felt price. One meaningful tightening occurs (choosing to trigger destabilization), yet tension is more atmospheric than pressurized. Consequences are reconfigurative rather than harming, limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The theme—breaking “perfect” systems to access living wonder and temporality’s compression—is integrated through recurring objects and the final reweighting of order into lattice. The closing image offers a non‑literal answer without a spelled‑out moral, though occasional lines edge toward thesis statement. Subtext operates in material metaphors (frost maps, bottled whisper as catalyst) more than dialogue. Resonance is strong but not piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A consistent, lyric third‑person closely shadowing Mara; diction and rhythm are controlled and patterned without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision and repetition are taught early and maintained. No dialogue needed; the narrative’s perceptual signature (ink/frost/press) stays coherent. Slight uniformity in cadence in peak beats keeps it shy of the very top tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and imagistic with high information density; most lines carry more than one job. Some repetition (“rustling awakenings,” “compress eternity”) and stacked metaphors flirt with purple, but clarity holds. Minimal scaffold and clean syntax preserve momentum. The lyric register risks sameness in stretches, lightly dulling propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress craft, frost‑geometry, a bottled whisper, and a glass orchard above cloud‑sea feels fresh and committed. Turns arise from prior particulars (pressing the bottle; spiral method) rather than late rule drops. Emotional specificity stays somewhat abstract, but the vision is distinctive and coherent. Boldness is high without gimmickry.</comment>
