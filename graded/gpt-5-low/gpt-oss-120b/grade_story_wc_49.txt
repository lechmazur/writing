<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to restore sacred rites—is clear and her actions (choosing the lyre, adjusting to the moon’s rhythm, accepting the vow) align. Interiority is sensorial and specific, though largely singular in direction with little contradiction or genuine doubt. The cost lands as a chosen burden rather than a contested sacrifice. Strong presence, limited struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual acts accrete toward the moonlit release and vow, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (remedy as reenacted memory). Orientation is clean early, and the final image reweights prior beats with the charged pollen and promise. Cost is implied in the binding vow and guardianship, though on‑page resistance is minimal. Causality is consistent within the ritual logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The forest, altar, lyre, vine, and harvest moon are vividly rendered and act as charged objects shaping tactics and the final image. Sensory selection (dew, pine, light) serves the ritual’s mood and function. The environment constrains choice (site, timing, tool) without digression. Lush but purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake (restore rites) and tightens as the moon rises and the melody is calibrated, culminating in the pollen cascade and vow. Escalation is primarily rhythmic and imagistic rather than adversarial; there’s no counterforce beyond timing. The cost reads as ongoing duty rather than a tradeoff on the page. Earned, if gentle, deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-remedy and communal continuity emerges through ritual particulars and the reanimation of songs. The closing sections risk mild moralizing (“the remedy for loss lay not in steel or fire...”), which blunts subtext. Even so, the final vow and charged hush provide a resonant answer without overexplaining. Strong coherence, slightly didactic edges.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person close distance with consistent diction and controlled cadence. Imagery and rhythm modulate with the ritual’s rise without head-hopping or register slips. No dialogue needed; the voice carries action and mood. Minor flourishiness remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished and musical with strong sensory density; lines often do double-duty for mood and action. Occasional purple tint and repetition (golden, hush) risk overrichness but do not obscure sense. Momentum is maintained without scaffolding loops. Final images are clear and well-cut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tinkerer-meets-rite concept, vine as conduit, and “remedy as reenacted memory” offer a fresh inflection on familiar lunar ritual imagery. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; the piece avoids gimmickry and commits to its lyric mode. Emotional truth is present if comfortable. Inventive, not revelatory.</comment>
