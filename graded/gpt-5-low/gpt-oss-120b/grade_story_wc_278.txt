<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive—hushing old guilt—is clear and drives her concrete actions (stitching amber to the recorder, promising the lab will soothe). Interiority is lyrical and specific, though contradictions are modest; she rarely wavers or pays a visible price beyond effort. The final renunciation/pledge reads earned by the work she undertakes. Slight absence of live resistance or missteps keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence (“letters → stitching → firmware untangles → lab reconfigured”) coheres and pays off in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is strong from the outset and props track cleanly. Closure lands on the page with a reweighted world and self, though the cost is more implied than felt. The two‑shard sense (private act → public sanctuary) is clean and continuous.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The laboratory, amber, antique desk, and backward‑ticking clocks are vivid and purposeful, integrated with action rather than posed. The environment and tools constrain choices (she must use the haunted recorder, letters, and amber within this space). The final image is charged by place (“sanctuary” that now exhales calm). Occasional symbolic heaviness skirts overtness but doesn’t blunt specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quieting guilt by healing the device) is clear and tightens when she discovers and executes the letter‑instructions. Escalation is gentle; the haunted firmware offers pressure but little pushback, so consequence feels soft. Agency drives the turn, but the visible price is minimal, reducing bite. Still, the cadence shift from static dissonance to communal lull is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Compassion rewriting code and “tethering a cry to honor a memory” recur through concrete images (amber, letters, firmware) and culminate in a community‑soothing sanctuary. However, the thematic line “haunted firmware could be healed when compassion rewrote the code” borders on stated moral. Resonance is genuine yet slightly tidy, with less friction or counter‑current. The ending lingers but edges toward explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Lyra’s sensibility; POV distance and certainty remain stable. Patterned diction (constellations, sound, amber) is purposeful and taught early. No dialogue is needed; the narrative functions as action. Minor purple tendencies appear but do not undermine focal control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines carry rich imagery with mostly clean rhythm and momentum; information density is high. Some metaphor stacking and near‑repetition (“meteor hush,” “lull,” “soothe”) approach saturation without fresh turn, slightly dulling impact. Syntax varies and transitions are clear. The final image lands cleanly despite the lushness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, amber beetle translating infant cries—feels singular and lived‑in rather than assembled. The letter‑mechanic and lab ecology ground the magic with tactile specificity. Risks are coherent and pay off in a charged reconfiguration. Slightly soft conflict is the only limiter.</comment>
