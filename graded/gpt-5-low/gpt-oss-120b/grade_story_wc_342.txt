<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (to “mirror the sky”) drives concrete choices under a ticking clock. Interiority is sensorial and idiosyncratic (face blindness reframed as “rhythm of light”), with craft acting as character. The defiance of silence at the end feels earned by the preceding ritual. Minor softening from a slightly declarative insight (“the true craft…”), but it’s supported by action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritualized craft under time pressure builds to the coin-press and the demolition. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). Closure lands as a charged poise: the building falls while the “cathedral of sky” remains, making cost and before/after legible. The coin’s groove‑timed intervals and final press stitch cause and cadence into the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hollowed tree library is vividly specific and functionally constraining: bark walls, leaf‑filtered light, and the floorboard hide inform tactics. Setting charges the final image as the interior sky outlasts the demolition. Tools and objects (safe, coin, pigments) are integrated as environment. Sensory selection stays purposeful and filtered through Lira’s craft‑bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish the mural before demolition) is signaled early and coherently tightens via the hush/noon deadline. The meaningful turn is the final coin press into wet pigment just before the fall, narrowing options to one last act. Cost is explicit: the building collapses; risk is borne in the choice to keep painting. Stakes remain intimate but felt, with internal resolve braided to external pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of limits as thresholds emerges organically through ritual timing, coin grooves, and face‑blindness reframed as another way of seeing. The final image conceptually reprices “silence” and “sky,” making defiance the true craft. A few statements verge on the didactic but are earned by pattern and cost. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held to Lira’s perceptions; diction and rhythm match the heightened stillness. The voice modulates at the end as demolition breaks the hush without losing control. No head‑hopping or register drift. The perceptual signature (light, pattern, texture) feels character‑specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet largely clean, with images doing multiple jobs (craft, time, theme). Occasional near‑purple flourishes are contained by consistent metaphor systems (sky/light/wood). Minimal repetition and good momentum for a lyric piece. Line rhythms vary to suit pressure, and the final line lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a face‑blind portraitist painting sky inside a tree‑library via a constellation coin and secret safe under demolition pressure. The coin’s mechanics and pigment lore feel non‑obvious and integrated. The closing survival of interior sky reweights the premise memorably. Bold, coherent risks without gimmickry.</comment>
