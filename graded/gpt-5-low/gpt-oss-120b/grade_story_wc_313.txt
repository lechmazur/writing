<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (expunge a harmful myth) and steady competence carry the piece, but internal contradiction and visible struggle are minimal, keeping her arc relatively frictionless. The “precisely humane” trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a costly choice. Micro‑choices (following photographs, placing the label) reveal values but rarely force trade‑offs. The communal address hints at emotional cost, yet Caitlyn never risks much beyond poise.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the photographs accrue into a reconfiguration where the town accepts a new narrative. Orientation is clean early, and closure lands with a charged reprise (label by the chime; wind resounding). Cost is mostly conceptual/communal rather than personal, which softens impact yet remains legible. The pattern holds without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting and objects are vivid and specific (ridgeway, reservoir, lantern, chime, label) and the final images are charged. The environment shapes tone and meaning more than it constrains tactics. Sensory details feel curated through Caitlyn’s observing eye, avoiding generic description. Lacks a concrete physical constraint that would push this into the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is articulated, and escalation occurs via the sequence of photographs culminating in the public reading. However, pressure remains low: no counterforce or credible loss tests commitment, and options are rarely narrowed. The resolution doesn’t require a difficult trade‑off; it’s acceptance rather than a contested turn. The cost is largely reputational/communal and implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (water, lantern, chime, label) braid into a theme of truth built through collective memory. A direct thesis line (“the true power…lay not in destruction…”) edges into telling, reducing subtext. Still, the final reconfiguration (reservoir as an “ancient eye”) offers a non‑literal answer that lingers. The story resists cynicism without flattening complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third‑person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and perceptually coherent to Caitlyn’s vocation and sensibility. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with patterned imagery that pays off in the close. No head‑hopping or stance wobble, and elisions are purposeful. Slight elevation risks purple but mostly serves mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished and musical, with recurring images doing double duty. At times, figurative density and stacked modifiers flirt with overwriting, softening propulsion. Clarity holds and sentences generally advance atmosphere and arc without loops. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drowned town’s myth, documentary fragments, and a warden’s quiet method feels distinctive. The photographs‑as‑trail conceit and the sapphire label’s reprise are fresh inflections. Risk is tonal rather than structural; absence of counterpressure limits surprise. Still, the vision is coherent and memorable.</comment>
