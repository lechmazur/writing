<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (seeking orientation amid collapse) is enacted through concrete micro-choices: sketching, stepping into the temporal field, aligning the compass, and later convening family. Interiority is image-led and character-specific (the applique as a personal relic), with a credible emotional progression from trepidation to resolve. Internal contradiction is mild—there’s yearning and caution but little on-page friction between opposing impulses. Still, the final renunciation of passivity into “pilgrimage” reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and held: ritual + object + deck build density to a charged glimpse that reweights “true north.” Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the commitment to navigate a blank map with a reoriented compass, with loss as the ongoing price. Causality is coherent within the lyric mode (sketch → alignment → glimpse → resolve → family reprise). The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observation deck’s temporal field isn’t just scenery; it enables the glimpse, narrows options to this locus, and charges the final glow. Sensory specificity is strong (“smear of violet and ash,” “river of light,” “residual quantum echo”) and filtered through the narrator’s need for bearings. The compass-as-micro-setting recurs as a tool that constrains choices. World rules stay consistent and are learned via action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a navigational principle after shutdown—is clear and tightens when the sketch aligns with the compass and unlocks the glimpse. Pressure is gentle but coherent; the deck’s field and the anniversary ritual create a single meaningful deepening that shifts options (from confusion to a map of possibilities). Cost is understated; the piece prioritizes stance crystallization over jeopardy. The final choice (to continue navigating by an “invisible true north”) reads earned but not harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: grief metabolized into orientation; “true north” transforms from external bearing to inward compass. Recurring images (applique, sketches, deck) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the close. There’s minimal moralizing; the promise and “pilgrimage” land as image-led answers. A touch of declarative phrasing (“turn confusion into exploration”) slightly reduces ambiguity but doesn’t flatten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric first-person voice is controlled, with consistent diction and a distinct perceptual signature (mechanics of time felt as texture). Rhythm modulates well: long, tensile lines during observation, clipped certitude at decision points. No head-hopping or stance leakage; elision is purposeful. Elevated lexicon matches the narrator’s contemplative mode and world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images often do double-duty (world + psychology). Figurative language is lush but largely disciplined; metaphors align with the established physics. Minor abstraction clusters (“possibilities,” “blessed pilgrimage”) skirt purple but maintain clarity and momentum. Final images resolve with precision (needle alignment, deck’s glow) rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cosmic-tech lyricism with a familial ritual and an object that recodes “true north.” The time-dilation deck as micro-temple and the applique as living instrument feel memorable. Turns are earned by prior particulars rather than late rule drops. Not radical in form, but the vision is singular and confident.</comment>
