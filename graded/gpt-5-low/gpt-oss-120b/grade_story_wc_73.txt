<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aric’s motive—to coax perpetual motion and, later, to honor the persistence of a missed chance—is clear and consistent, and his actions (building, programming, rolling) align. The interior shift from “capture” to “honor” reads earned. However, embodied pressure is light; we don’t feel much bodily stress or contradictory impulses in-scene. The struggle feels smoothed by summary rather than tested through a concrete, costly choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds patterned pressure (rolls, equations, staircase responses) toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands with cost: he renounces the desire to reclaim a single missed chance and accepts a stabilizing flaw. Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early, and the pattern holds through the final image. The causal mechanics are suggestive rather than literal, but they cohere for the mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The infinite staircase, bronze frame, and rotating glass disc are vivid and integrated with action; the environment responds and charges the final image. The dice-as-tool and staircase-as-system provide consistent atmosphere and logic. While the setting rarely restricts a discrete choice, it meaningfully shapes tactics and meaning. Sensory detail remains selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (transcending confinement via a logic-driven machine) is signaled early and deepens as the staircase “quivers” and reconfigures. Escalation is more density/response than dilemma; there’s little forced trade-off on the page. The cost is primarily conceptual—accepting imperfection—rather than a tangible loss. Still, the tightening from repeated rolls to the rupture and final landing reads as a legitimate intensification in this mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: imperfection as stabilizer, missed chances as texture, confinement as catalyst. The chipped die’s arc reweights prior material without a stated moral, and the final image resonates beyond plot. A few lines verge on abstraction, but the images do the heavy lifting. The reframing from capture to honoring is earned and specific to the particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a “mathematician-poet” sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate well, with a distinct perceptual signature (equations as whispers, proof as motion). No head-hopping or stance slips occur. Occasional elevated phrasing borders on abstraction but remains legible and pattern-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lines carry high information density and momentum for a lyric mode; images multitask (dice as tool and symbol). Minor repetition and a tendency toward lushness don’t blur meaning. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly. There’s little scaffold or synonym churn; ornament rarely outruns sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dice used as “proofs” to drive a responsive staircase, with a chipped face as stabilizing flaw, is a striking, specific synthesis. The mathematician-poet stance feels singular rather than templated. The final reweighting is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
