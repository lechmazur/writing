<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s interior contradiction—terror braided with professional bravado—drives concrete choices (decoding via stunt moves, stepping on the lever, accepting the vial’s price). Emotions are embodied through tactile setting and bodily awareness rather than labels. A few declarations (“promising that I would transform betrayal into a weapon”) skate toward told theme, but motivation remains consistent. The final renunciation/confession feels earned by earlier pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seashell → cipher → lever threat → panel → vial with price → acceptance and reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why tonight), and each step narrows options or raises stakes. Closure lands with a decisive choice carrying conceptual cost (betraying the hidden self), reinforced by the constellations re-spelling her name. Slight convenience in the swift appearance of the mythic vial, but it pays off the established chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is sensory-rich and functionally constraining (the booby-trapped aisle lever). Objects-as-setting (seashell, shelves, dome, lever) shape tactics and charge the final image. Details filter through a stunt performer’s priorities (mapping moves to script), aligning world texture with character. The environment evolves with action (shiver, dust cascade, lights flicker) rather than staying static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—earn honest courage—tightens through decoding, the lever’s collapse risk, and the vial’s demand for a self-betrayal. Escalation results from Mara’s agency at each turn rather than coincidence. The visible price is more conceptual than material; the external hazard resolves without injury, keeping the cost somewhat soft. Nonetheless the choice forecloses the mask and redirects future action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of identity, betrayal-as-transformation, and vulnerability-as-power emerge organically through the shell, lever, and the name spelled backward. The seashell’s voice and the vial concretize abstract ideas. However, explicit moralizing lines (“a promise that my next stunt would be performed not for applause but for honesty”) slightly flatten subtext. The final image still resonates by reweighting prior motifs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person lyric voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (stunt lexicon shaping interpretation). Rhythm modulates under stress without head-hopping; diction remains coherent. Elevated phrasing occasionally edges into thesis-speak, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility. No dialogue to test, but narrative stance stays steady and character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and purposeful imagery; sentence variety supports momentum. Minor overwriting and repeated intensifiers (“firmly adaptive,” thesis restatements) modestly blunt peak pressure. Metaphors stay coherent, and choreography is clear in the lever sequence. No significant scaffolding or loops impede closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a stunt performer decrypting a child’s cast via physical moves inside a booby-trapped, star-lit library, with a seashell housing a leviathan’s heart. The betrayal-to-power pivot feels specific to this protagonist’s vocation and psyche. Risks in mythic elements are grounded by tactile process, not gimmick. Freshness holds through the ending’s reconfigured identity image.</comment>
