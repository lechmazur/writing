<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (“to prove that listening heals”) is clear and steady, and her choices—curating, placing the locket on the bench, assembling an exhibit, guiding the child—align. Interiority is present but largely serene; there’s little contradictory impulse or felt risk. The lack of real friction or ethically costly trade-offs limits depth. Still, actions reveal a coherent, empathetic character under a gentle kind of pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reads as accumulative/textural: the locket’s whisper → letters cascade → public exhibit → communal response → the child’s coda. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration (listening transforms the shop into a communal healing site), though the on‑page cost is light. Orientation and continuity are sound, with one continuous window. The ending’s sea-echo image pays the established pattern without a decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory anchors (wet stone, incense, amber walls, dawn courtyard) are filtered through Mara’s curatorial sensibility. The mailbox and bench function as charged micro-settings that host key moves. World rules around the locket’s whispers are consistent and learned through action. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choice, it meaningfully charges the final images.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—solving the mystery by listening and channeling it for community—remains gentle, with little counterforce. Escalation is primarily a deepening of pattern (sound → letters → exhibit → visitors → child) rather than narrowing options. The cost and pressure never quite bite, so tension stays low. The final beat is tender but not risked.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of attention, community memory, and healing emerge through the locket/mailbox ritual and the public exhibit. However, explicit statements (“listening truly healed”) veer toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The ending’s sea-echo is resonant, offering a non-literal answer, but complexity remains modest. More ambiguity or friction would deepen the aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical, sensory-forward cadence that suits the premise. Recurrent phrases (“sandstorm calm,” “locked mailbox mystery,” “led through following”) create a motif but occasionally feel templated. No head-hopping; stance is stable and confident. Rhythm mostly supports the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clean sentences with lush imagery, but repetition and near-synonym loops soften momentum (“sandstorm calm” and prompt-like refrains recur). Figurative load is steady and sometimes redundant, edging toward overwrought in places. Information density is decent, yet some lines paraphrase what the prior sentence already implied. The final image remains clear despite these artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The thrift-shop curator curating a living exhibit of listening in a dawn courtyard is a fresh angle on a magical-object trope. The object’s auditory unlocking and communal letters feel specific and coherent. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece stays safe emotionally by avoiding sharper conflict. Still, the synthesis is memorable enough to rise above template.</comment>
