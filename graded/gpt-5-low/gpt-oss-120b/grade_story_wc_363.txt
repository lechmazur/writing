<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (to send a message with cost) is clear, and her actions (assembling edges, placing the bead) align. The interiority is lyrical but somewhat generalized; “latent sacrifice” lands conceptually rather than through embodied contradiction. We get hints of acceptance vs. attachment, but few micro-choices under live pressure. Still, the renunciation at the end reads earned for this scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puzzle-to-pedestal-to-filament is a coherent intensification. Closure lands on the page with the bead dimming and the silence dissolving; the cost is felt though largely conceptual. Orientation is clean from the outset. A slightly clearer on‑page price beyond “leave something of herself” could have lifted it further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard/bamboo environment is vivid and tactically used: the map winds through trees to a pedestal, and the canopy channels the filament. The amber bead functions as a charged micro‑setting object. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mara’s loom‑mind imagery. World rules feel consistent within the fable logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: get the message across at a personal cost. Escalation is gentle but coherent—each puzzle click knits sound back, culminating in the pedestal decision. The cost is more atmospheric than sharply dramatized, yet it reweights the final image. No antagonistic force, but coherent pressure under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Recurring images (loom, silence, bead) accrue into a clear meditation on sacrifice, craft, and connection. The ending reweights these without a didactic thesis, though “sacrifice… the loom of tomorrow” edges toward statement. Emotional aftereffect is tender and melancholic rather than sentimental. The theme emerges from action rather than meta‑commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third‑person close with a distinct textile‑inflected diction. Rhythm modulates well through discovery and climax. Minor repetition (“stoically sparkling”) and density flirt with overwriting but remain legible. No POV leakage or unjustified elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line work is lush and often strong, with images doing multiple jobs. Figurative density occasionally stacks (loom metaphors, “unraveling tapestry,” “loom of absence”) and risks purple, slightly slowing momentum. Clarity survives and cadence varies. Minimal redundancy beyond motif reiteration.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—loomcraft as cosmology, jigsaw-edges map, raveling silence repaired by an amber filament—is fresh and committed. Key turns arise from established elements rather than late rule changes. The piece takes a stylistic risk in sustained lyricism and largely earns it. Emotional truth accompanies novelty.</comment>
