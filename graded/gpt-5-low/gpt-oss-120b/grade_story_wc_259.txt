<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent: he seeks forbidden knowledge and accepts cost by renouncing pattern and certainty. Interiority is embodied through irregular steps, tactile contact with light, and sensory detail, avoiding therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears (anguished joy, heavy yet uplifted), though conflict could deepen with one sharper on‑page hesitation. The final endurance—choosing randomness as a discipline—reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via pattern avoidance, the pagoda’s hum, and the light’s cascade reweighting the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: purification becomes transformation; he exits with cost (abandoning certainty) and recharged agency. Orientation is clean from the outset; beats progress coherently to the final departure. Cost is legible in the choice to live erratically and carry sorrow with joy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive and bronze pagoda are vividly realized with sensory specificity and integrated into action. The encoded patterns in stone directly constrain movement, charging both tactic and final image. Selective details (prismatic shards, liquid memory, fluttering sealed pages) serve pressure rather than touristic catalog. Slight recurrence of generalized abstractions prevents a full 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access/transform through forbidden knowledge) escalates as he commits to irregularity and the pagoda responds. The meaningful tightening is the light cascade that forces a revaluation of “purify” and accepts cost. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens, though one more concrete hazard or near-failure could sharpen the tradeoff. Resolution derives from his agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres—purification through embracing fragmentation—and the final image reweights prior motifs. However, the line “true purification comes not from erasing the past...” reads as explicit moralizing, dulling subtext at the end. Earlier images (irregular steps, liquid memory) do strong thematic work without telling. Emotional aftereffect is earned but slightly over‑explained in the last movement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm match the character’s obsession and the scene’s pressure; no head‑hopping or stance wobble. Some phrase repetition (“anguished joy,” “atoms of nostalgia”) risks monotony but remains mostly purposeful. Modulation at the end is clean and tonally apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines carry good information density with vivid verbs and concrete images, propelling momentum. Occasional redundancies and motif repetition edge toward purple but stop short of obscuring clarity. Sentence rhythms vary; paragraphing supports escalation. A touch more pruning of repeated formulations could lift sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—ritualized unpredictability as access to memory/purification inside a prismatic archive—is fresh and cohesive. The redefinition of purification and the tactic of anti‑pattern walking feel non‑obvious and character‑driven. Risks in diction and concept largely pay off without confusion. A single harder cost or counter‑pressure would have elevated ingenuity further.</comment>
