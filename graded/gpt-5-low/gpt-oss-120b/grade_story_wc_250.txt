<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The guardian’s motive is clear and consistent (to teach darkness the value of stars), but interior contradiction and cost are minimal. Agency exists (raising/aligning/lowering the mirror; weaving ripples), yet choices rarely carry visible trade‑offs. The figure reads more emblem than person, limiting embodied emotion. Still, micro‑choices under pressure are present in the patient pacing and deliberate calibration of light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the pattern of shutters intensifies toward a lattice of light, then resolves as the mirror lowers—clean RR/CR closure. The before/after is legible: darkness learns its own light; the dock glows. Cost is mostly conceptual (patience/endurance) rather than dramatized loss, keeping the ceiling below the highest band. Orientation is clear early (cobalt dock after rain, guardian at canal) and held without breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wet, reflective dock and canal materially enable the tactic (water as loom; reflections as thread), and the dental mirror charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with weather and surface properties affecting action. The environment evolves with the act (ripples, mirrored constellations), not just postcard description. The final shimmer at dawn derives directly from setting logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but coherent: can the guardian teach darkness to hold its stars. Escalation reads through density and cadence (ripples to lattice; shutters slowing), with a clear intensification when the mirror aligns with the moon. Consequence/cost remains gentle and abstract, so pressure never quite tightens into a hard trade‑off. Resolution feels earned through attention rather than conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—silent empathy as a pedagogy that reveals inherent light—emerges through the act of weaving constellations. Subtext operates in images (shutters, cathedral flashes, stitched stars) that reweight darkness, though purpose is occasionally stated outright. The ending image rephrases the central question without moralizing. A bit more resistance or counter‑pressure would deepen the thematic charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person holds throughout with disciplined diction and rhythm; no head‑hopping. Repetition patterns (“spiralingly calm,” “shutters”) feel intentional and teach the texture. Narrative certainty stays within this mythic lens. Modulation is subtle but effective at key beats (lattice unfurling; shutters slowing).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are polished, with strong image economy and purposeful recurrence; momentum mostly holds. There is some purple saturation and minor paraphrase/echo (“spiralingly calm” repeats; several sentences restate the method), which softens propulsion. Figurative logic remains coherent and grounded in water/light mechanics. Syntax and paragraph rhythm vary enough to keep the ear engaged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of a “canal guardian” using a dental mirror to weave constellations via water shutters is memorably strange and unified. Risk is taken in sustained lyricism and a conceptual pedagogy of darkness; it lands without obscuring clarity. The world’s small logic (wet dock as loom, mirror as tool) makes the conceit feel inevitable in hindsight. Only the low-conflict arc prevents it from cresting higher.</comment>
