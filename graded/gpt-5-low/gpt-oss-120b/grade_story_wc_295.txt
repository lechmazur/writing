<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s aim and temperament are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (whispering the telegram, aligning the telescope, placing the telegram) align with her belief in words and witnessing. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely struggles or hesitates—so the shift reads as smooth rather than hard-won. Embodied emotion appears (“weight settle in her chest,” scents and hums) but trends toward lyric generality over specificity under pressure. The resolution forecloses little beyond secrecy, with limited felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the telegram cues sharing, which leads to sky-reading, projection, and the temple opening; the cadence tightens toward dawn. Closure lands on the page with an on‑scene reconfiguration (temple door opens; crystal-telegram duet), though the price is primarily conceptual/emotional. Orientation is clean from the outset (observatory at night, Mara at her desk/journal/telescope). The sequence remains coherent without contrived leaps, but the cost signal is soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory, dome, telescope, and variable stars are vivid and purpose‑driven; tools and environment directly govern tactics (aligning the “great eye,” projection of script). Sensory specificity (daylily scent, ozone, hum through lenses) deepens atmosphere without losing spatial clarity. Setting charges the final image (altar, crystal, dawn light) and functions as constraint and resource. The world’s rules—dreams mapping to variable stars—are consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding/entry) is signaled early, and there is one meaningful tightening when she chooses to share the burden and commit to the star‑method. Pressure remains gentle; there is no credible resistance or risk beyond relinquishing secrecy, so escalation feels low‑temperature. The opening of the temple resolves cleanly without a trade‑off beyond interior relief. Tension operates more as cadence than conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of “shared burdens/words heal” is coherent and threaded through telegram, witnessing, and the final ritual, with the last image reweighting earlier motifs. However, explicit thesis statements (“heal with words,” “healed the world with words”) veer toward moralizing and dampen subtext. The piece invites reflection through recurring images (stars, perfume, hum) but rarely courts complicating countercurrents. Resonance is real but risks sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close POV is steady, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm that suits the premise; diction stays consistent with Mara’s sensibility. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; psychic distance modulates slightly as pressure grows. Refrains (“midnight solace,” “shared burdens”) are purposeful if a bit over‑insistent. The voice remains distinct without tipping into opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences are clean and musical, with varied rhythm and strong image economy around the observatory and sky. There is some purple drift and repetition (e.g., “midnight solace,” “shared burdens,” stacked luminous metaphors) that softens momentum in the middle. Figurative density occasionally crowds precision but does not obscure causality. Minor paraphrase echoes could be tightened for sharper propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Combining lucid dream chronicle with variable-star decryption and a daylily telegram feels fresh and organically interlaced. The final reconfiguration (telegram as key, shared burden unlocking temple) is earned by prior images. Some tropes (mystic observatory, stars as script) are familiar, but the floral/ozone sensory braid and witnessing ethos elevate them. The piece risks big lyricism without gimmickry.</comment>
