<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arlen’s goal—“to graft herself onto community”—is clear and her actions align (inviting the villagers, touching the glyph, vowing dedication). Interiority is lyric and sensorial but shows limited contradiction or cost under pressure. The “boldly sympathetic” trait is dramatized through her responsiveness to the orchard’s ache, yet she encounters little resistance. The late arrival of Lira offers a gentle uptick rather than a crucible that forces a hard choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation and coherence hold cleanly; the piece builds pattern density (orchard ache, glyph, weaving) toward a conceptual repricing that the tag is “a living symbol.” Closure lands through the vow and the community’s ongoing lattice, though the cost is soft and largely conceptual (duty to sustain connection). The two‑shard feel (trek to glyph → communal weaving/epilogue) is smooth and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and recur with purpose, charging the final image (tapestry of reeds glowing, steadying the ache). Environmental specifics (phosphorescent moss, crater rim, reflective bark) infuse tone and guide the communal ritual. While they seldom constrain tactics, they continually shape perception and meaning. World rules remain consistent and discovered through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on forging communal belonging, but pressure remains low and largely unopposed. The principal tightening is the trek to the glyph and Arlen’s vow, which converts intention into a public commitment. There’s little felt price or foreclosed option on the page beyond the implied ongoing duty. The escalation is beautiful but gentle, more ceremonial than testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres around belonging as an enacted practice—search together, vow, weave reeds, accept ongoing care. The “living symbol” reveal reweights earlier images (interlocking circles → expanding lattice) without overt moralizing. Some lines skate near sentimentality, but the recurring images do most of the thematic work. The final “steady glow” modulates the ache into sustained responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a close third that privileges sensation and communal resonance. Diction and rhythm support the mythic register without head‑hopping or stance drift. Absence of dialogue is appropriate to the liturgical tone. Psychic distance stays steady and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is lush and largely effective, with strong image density (“black glass bark,” “ribbons of violet,” “luminescent ache”). At times it edges toward purple or repetition, risking softness in momentum. Still, clarity holds and sentences often carry dual duties of worldbuilding and thematic charge. Minor pruning could heighten propulsion without losing music.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—marsh‑reed sculptor, obsidian arbor, a glyph visible only to resonant hearts—feels fresh and deliberate. The living‑tag turn is conceptually elegant and earned by the communal process. Risk lies in embracing a ceremonial, low‑conflict arc; it mostly pays off through image and cadence. The vision reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
