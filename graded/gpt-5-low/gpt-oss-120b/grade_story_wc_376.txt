<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (“candor in small moments”) drives tangible choices from refusing the council to assembling the map and speaking truth. Interiority is lyrically filtered through work and objects rather than deeply conflicted thought; contradiction is minimal. Agency is steady and credible, but the emotional cost of defiance is sensed more conceptually than felt in‑body. The earned shift at the end reads as commitment affirmed rather than a fraught transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with an accumulative build (motifs/objects) feeding a causal endpoint: rereading → doorway → bottles → conduit → vent responding to truth. Orientation is crisp and the two‑shard flow is legible. Closure lands on the page with an environmental Decisive Change (sky clears) tied to the established rule. Cost is present (refusal of loyalty, risk) but light on immediate repercussion, keeping it short of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, bioluminescent ferns, and zinc plate are vivid and functional; the environment literally constrains and enables choices (doorway hidden by vines; vent mechanics). World rules are learned through action rather than exposition. The recurring objects (map, postal plate, vent) charge the final image. Sensory texture supports tone without feeling like a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honesty as a force against a poisoned world) escalates coherently, but opposition is soft and solutions arrive with minimal resistance. The refusal of the council and the puzzle assembly are pressure points, yet neither extracts a concrete on‑page price during the climb. The final activation of the vent is earned but relatively frictionless. Tension functions more as wonder‑driven discovery than hard conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme is strongly woven through repeating particulars (plate’s glow, unheard bottles, vent tied to truth), culminating in a resonant conceptual answer. However, several lines state the moral outright (“candor in small moments could restore whole worlds”), reducing subtext. The best moments let image carry meaning (bottles of unheard speech vibrating). The closing insight is apt but edges toward sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature tied to craft and materials. Diction and rhythm modulate cleanly through discovery to activation; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. Elision patterns are taught by the opening’s texture and paid off by the final image. Absence of dialogue suits the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level work is vivid and economical for the mode, with strong nouns and purposeful metaphor (“ink shimmered like sunrise on metal”; “greenhouse walls close like lungs”). Occasional near‑purple stacking and thematic reiteration create minor redundancy, but momentum holds. Syntax varies, and images do more than one job. The final lines land cleanly without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a zinc honesty‑sensor, bottled unheard conversations, and truth‑powered ventilation in a greenhouse city. The imaginative leap from rereading fragments to environmental remediation is surprising yet grounded by earlier rules. Risks in worldbuilding cohere without hand‑waving. Only the low on‑page resistance keeps it from the top band.</comment>
