<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation (to surface erased histories) and a credible final stance (accepting the role of “unnamed keeper”). Interiority is specific and sensorial, but internal contradiction is light—fear or doubt under pressure is muted. Micro-choices exist (taking and using the label, following the glow), yet they rarely exact a visible cost beyond fatigue and isolation. The character’s namelessness informs perspective well, though it’s more theme than crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered fragments → label → numbers → murals → conceptual repricing of the narrator’s role. Orientation is anchored early (port, containers, tides) and the rule-set (label as filter) emerges cleanly through action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator commits to archiving, with a conceptual cost (remaining erased to serve the erased). The cost remains soft and internal, limiting the ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional—the tipping tides and container corridors materially trigger the revelation (numbers glow, murals project). The environment evolves with pressure and is filtered through a particular sensibility. The poison-label as micro-setting object charges the final image. A superb sense of place without over-touristing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent (making the erased visible); escalation deepens via the label’s unfolding functions and the tide’s activation. The turn (murals manifesting) reweights options and knowledge. However, tangible price and foreclosed paths are understated; the commitment reads as purpose found more than a sacrifice exacted. Tension is contemplative rather than fraught.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of erasure, identity, and memory’s texture emerge organically through objects and action. The final image (keeper of layered stories, label pocketed) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext around bureaucracy’s violence and the self as conduit is persuasive and understated. Slight risk of over-articulation in repeated “layers/filters,” but the resonance remains strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, coherent lyric voice with controlled imagery and rhythm, consistently single-POV. Diction matches the narrator’s sensibility; patterning (“layers,” “filters”) is taught and sustained. No dialogue, but the internal cadence carries pressure. Minor risk of tonal uniformity, yet it modulates with the tide’s shift effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful images (“museum of vanished moments,” “ghostly murals”). A touch of repetition (“collect fragments of overheard stories”) and motif reiteration edges toward redundancy, but rarely stalls momentum. Figurative language remains coherent and scene-tethered. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The poison label as optical key to erased histories in a tidal container maze feels fresh and integrated. The synthesis of bureaucratic death with living archive is non-obvious and thematically tight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off. Slight familiarity in “palimpsest/layers” lexicon prevents a higher tier.</comment>
