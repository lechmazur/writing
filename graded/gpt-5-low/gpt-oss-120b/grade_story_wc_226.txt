<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—pay the canyon’s debt through art—drives concrete choices (urging Lio to speak, painting the mural, writing across the sky). Interiority is present but not deeply contradictory; her “defiant spirit softened” hints at conflict without a hard trade‑off dramatized. The personal cost skews conceptual (“acceptance of loss”) rather than a specific, felt forfeiture. Still, actions align with motives and culminate in a credible stance shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of echoes/poetry/light intensifies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where forgiveness is earned and the spire glows. Orientation is clear early (Mara, canyon, pre‑ritual), and the closure’s cost is on the page (“the price: acceptance of loss,” “piece of herself”). The ritual’s imminence tightens cadence without needing causal reversals. The end image reweights the premise and reads earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers and the pale spire are vivid and functional: echoes and refracted light/words actively shape tactics and outcome. Environmental rules stay consistent and charge the final image (the spire’s beacon, the canyon’s sigh). Sensory specificity is strong without tourist cataloging. Setting constrains and empowers the method, satisfying the 9‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—securing forgiveness by paying a price—is clear, and pressure coheres via the ticking ritual and the deepening hush. Escalation is primarily density (more voices, glowing mural, spire flicker) rather than opposition, so the felt risk stays modest. The visible cost is conceptual and communal, which lands but lacks a sharp foreclosed option. Still, Mara’s agency drives the tightening beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as communal, memory‑bound work emerges through refracted art and shared voice, not just assertion. Some lines verge on thesis (“Let the price be known…,” “the price: acceptance of loss”), but the closing charged image (“We are the echo”) reweights prior motifs. Subtext in the forged hush and bone‑kept memory adds depth. It resists neat moralizing while offering a resonant answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is consistent, with distinctive diction (refract, forged hush, bone towers) that fits POV and world. Dialogue is minimal but effective (Lio’s line functions as action). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and no head‑hopping occurs. Elevated register reads intentional and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are lush and image‑dense, mostly doing double duty (world + theme). A mild tendency toward repetition of the refract/echo lexicon flirts with overwriting, but the pattern is taught and purposeful. Momentum holds; syntax varies; closure image is clear. No significant scaffold or figurative muddle dulls the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bone‑tower canyon, a spire that refracts verse into light, and forgiveness paid in communal art feel fresh and fully committed. The conceptual mechanism (refracting truth via art) integrates with plot and closure rather than posing as ornament. Risk‑taking in tone and imagery heightens coherence. Small deductions for relatively safe conflict dynamics.</comment>
