<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lysander’s motive—to guard his “spark of defiance”—is vivid and consistent, and his tactic (planting encoded seedlings) aligns with it. Interiority is more declarative than conflicted; we rarely see contradictory impulses in real time. Dr. Mirabel’s late protective decision adds relational pressure and a credible pivot. Emotional cost is implied rather than embodied on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as pressure and pattern density build toward a reconfiguration: Mirabel chooses to protect, and the network extends citywide, with the final image promising ongoing resistance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR, though the cost is mostly conceptual (risk under a thought‑tax regime) rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is sensorially rich and integrated: insect silence, vent‑carried chant, and flickering lights all serve the pressure. The gourd seed functions as micro‑setting/object driving atmosphere and the final image. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it charges tactics and the climax. World rules of the Loom are learned via action rather than exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect untaxed thought—stays coherent. Escalation manifests as increased density (seed’s whispers → chant → Loom emergence → Mirabel’s choice), consistent with the accumulative lens. The decisive tightening is Mirabel’s shift to protector and the citywide planting, but the on‑page price remains soft. Tension sits more in mood than in sharpened trade‑offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of dissent, language as resistance, and community encoded through nature resonate across recurring images (seed, spiral patterns, chant). Some lines state the thesis too directly (“after thoughts become taxable… mind’s free verse is auctioned”), slightly blunting subtext. The final promise of “the next warp” offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Complexity is present without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person with a consistent perceptual signature; diction suits the mythic‑political mode. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure shifts (from hum to chant to dawn promise). Occasional grand declarations skirt overstatement but remain voice‑coherent. POV stays stable with limited external observations on Mirabel.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered jobs—image, mood, and incremental pressure—with few redundancies. Some metaphor stacking risks purple hues, but clarity holds and cadence varies. Key motifs reprise without looped scaffolding. The final line cleanly recharges the opening object.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Loom’s seedling‑spiral language, thought taxation, and the gourd rattle seed as metronome of revolt feel original and integrated. Risks in concept and lyric approach pay off without obscuring closure. Turns grow from established patterns rather than late rule drops. Emotional specificity could deepen further to reach top band.</comment>
