<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Mira’s goal is clear and her actions align, with a small but credible cost when she relinquishes the artifact. Interiority is present yet thin—she encounters little friction or contradictory impulse, which flattens pressure. Competence dominates over struggle, reducing the sense of earned change. The closing renunciation is sound but lightly felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: navigate → detect resonance → discover tip → growth surge → return and relinquish. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: resilience reframed from object to practice, with the price of giving up a powerful tool. The inversion hour provides a mild ticking clock that coheres the scene. Escalation is modest but coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Worldbuilding is vivid and functional: upward rivers, floating arches, and inverted gravity shape choices and the final image. Tools and environment (probe, basins, upward flow) constrain tactics, not just paint the backdrop. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered. The setting charges the ending as the basin glows and dissolves the tip.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and the time window adds gentle pressure, but obstacles are minimal and discovery comes smoothly. The key tightening is the decision to release the tip, trading immediate utility for planetary stewardship. Emotional and tactical costs register but lightly. Tension is steady rather than climbing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, listening, and resilience emerge through particulars (echo resonance, the renunciation). The closing reweights the premise from artifact to practice effectively, though one sentence edges into explicit statement. Subtext mostly lives in image and rhythm (whirling silence, upward water). Resonance lingers but avoids deeper moral complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held voice with controlled cadence fits the mythic‑SF mood. Diction stays coherent to the piece’s register, with confident sensory selection. Elision is minimal and never confuses stance or knowledge. No dialogue, but the narrative texture carries momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clear, image‑rich, and purposeful with good propulsion; minimal scaffold. Some metaphor density risks purple drift but remains coherent and in service of mood. Sentence variety and paragraphing support movement through beats. No notable loops or cadence templates dulling the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—orchard planet, inversion hour, echo‑guided navigation, star‑metal catalyst—feels fresh and integrated. The final reweighting from artifact to cultural practice avoids a simple gadget fix. Risk‑taking in concept and imagery pays off without obscuring clarity. Emotional complexity could deepen, but the vision is distinctive.</comment>
