<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (listening for unheard stories to preempt a coup) drives consistent choices, and competence is shown through methodical, embodied craft. Contradictory impulses are hinted (wisdom masked as foolishness) but not dramatized under pressure on the page. Emotional texture stays serene rather than conflicted even as stakes rise. The decisive act—finishing and sending the chart—fits her values but carries limited felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues via pattern synchronization, leading to the charged completion and dispatch of the chart. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; single POV and one scene hold. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the map exits, the ember fades, the city’s options shift. Cost is mostly conceptual (spent ember, risk assumed), not dramatized as immediate peril.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: cobalt observatory, brass domes, and the dormant telescope shape mood and method. The eternal flame functions as a micro‑setting tool that literally inflects choice and charges the final image. Weather and “echoed silence” modulate perception and code‑reading. Minor deduction: the environment rarely constrains options beyond atmosphere and instrumentality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose conspiracy before the coup) is clear, and one meaningful tightening occurs as the flame’s patterns translate into concrete discoveries, culminating in sending the chart. Escalation is more density than jeopardy; no sharp reversal or on‑page consequence tests her commitment. The courier departure offers a small risk pivot but remains offstage. The price paid is largely opportunity/time, not a felt loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of truth in silence and wisdom disguised as folly emerge through the loom, the flame, and the courier ruse, with a strong final repricing (“History would remember the fire’s glow, not the blade”). Recurring images reweight meaning at the end without needing expository explanation. Slight overstatement in the final third edges toward moralizing. Still, the closing image reframes power and story with genuine resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in craft and cosmic diction. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elisions are purposeful and legible. Rhythm varies well between quiet accumulation and decisive cadence at closure. Rare moments verge on purple, but the voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with evocative, mostly clean images; sentences do more than one job without scaffold. A few repeated abstractions (“adjacent possibilities,” “echoed silence”) risk mild redundancy but serve patterning. Figurative language stays coherent and supports clarity. Momentum holds through the finish without loops or mechanical cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of embroidery, astronomy, and an eternal flame as forensic method feels fresh and specific. The decoding-by-rhythm tactic is a striking, organic invention rather than a gimmick. Stakes are intimate yet consequential; the final reweighting is non‑obvious and earned. Slight conventionality in coup mechanics prevents a higher mark.</comment>
