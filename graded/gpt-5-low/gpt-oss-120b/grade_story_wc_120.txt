<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lian’s desire “to become the conductor of those unseen melodies” is clear and her actions align (aligning the nautilus, sketching the score, issuing “Conduct”). Interiority is particular and embodied through tactile images (sand between toes, frost‑etched glass). However, internal contradiction is light; the “chronologically homesick” tension reframes rather than really pressurizes a choice. The change to “burden as compass” lands but carries modest, not visceral, cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: sensory density and ritualized actions build to a charged poise/CR where the lake sings and her role reconfigures. Orientation is clean early (glass spire, dawn, frozen lake, single POV), and the beats escalate from alignment to activation. Closure is on‑page, but cost is conceptual rather than sharply felt, keeping it just below the top band. The pattern taught (object + horizon + sound) pays off coherently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purpose‑driven: the glass spire resonates, the frozen lake becomes a vibrating membrane, and the mirrored horizon amplifies and then fractures into batons. The nautilus and architectural glass constrain tactics (alignment on the ledge, sketching on frost). World rules stay internally consistent, learned through action. Minor cap from global gates prevents higher despite near‑exemplary integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will she summon/conduct the unheard symphony) is clear and tightens as she moves from preparation to command. The meaningful turn is her spoken “Conduct,” which triggers the horizon’s fracture and the lake’s song. Pressure is largely lyric rather than oppositional; there’s little foreclosed option or price beyond effort and reorientation. Still, the cadence deepens and options reweight under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonance builds through motifs (mirrored horizon, nautilus, hush) toward self‑becoming via memory. Yet the explicit final fortune (“Your heart is the baton; the world is your score”) reads as a thematic statement, edging into moralizing and dulling subtext. The revaluation of homesickness as compass is strong but tidy. The piece invites reflection but could trust its images more at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, sensuous, and controlled in a close third, with a distinct perceptual signature (sound as touch, memory as cartography). Syntax modulates well with the scene’s hush and swell. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but remain legible and voice‑motivated. No POV slippage or unearned certainty appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are musical and image‑dense, with good momentum for a lyric mode. However, figurative saturation is near‑constant (horizon whispering, chords in cracks, batons of luminous sound), risking overrichness; some pruning would sharpen peaks. Clarity holds and scaffolding is minimal. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fortune cookies as instruments, a mirrored horizon as amplifier, and a nautilus‑mapped memory method feel fresh and coherently synthesized. The lake’s transformation into a sounding membrane and the baton‑shards are striking. Risks are taken without obscuring closure. Emotional truth is present though the cost side remains gentle.</comment>
