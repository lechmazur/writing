<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear desire and a culminating sacrifice (releasing the pendant) give Mira definition, but her interiority leans generalized lyricism over contradictory impulses under pressure. The illustrator detail colors perception but rarely constrains choices beyond one sketching moment. The final renunciation reads earned, though her path feels relatively unopposed and emotionally steady. Strong, but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (“interrupted cadence,” pendant pulses) accrete into a on‑page closure with cost (sacrifice of the pendant, rhythm restored). Orientation is strong from the outset; the turn to the light‑bridge and descent to the cavern escalates within the pattern. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis, legible and thematically linked. Minor softness in causal pressure, but no breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid and specific: rooftop canals, mirrored ribbons, the cavern’s singing walls; rules are learned in action (water becoming staircase). The pendant as tool and the canal body as medium constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection tracks POV and urgency well. Occasional symbol-forward lines skirt overtness but remain integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates via density: pendant glow → bridge → descent → vortex → renunciation. The cost is concrete (losing the pendant), but opposition is largely atmospheric; tension is more wonder than threat. The single decisive tightening works at this length under the accumulative lens. Slight abstraction of risk keeps it below top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: time as sculptable cadence, becoming the echo, and sacrifice to restore communal rhythm. Recurring images (infinity loops, borrowed time) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final image reconfigures the premise with felt conceptual cost. Depth over breadth, with a clean aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a confident lyric texture; perception stays within Mira’s plausible knowing. Rhythm modulates at turns (the light‑bridge and final release). No head‑hopping or stance drift; patterned diction is taught early and sustained. A touch of grand register occasionally flattens individuality but not clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lush prose mostly earns its keep; images often do double duty (world + concept). Some repetition (“interrupted cadence,” “borrow time,” “uncage”) risks echoing, but reads as purposeful motif. Minimal scaffold and strong sentence variety keep momentum. A few near‑purple flourishes slightly blur pressure but not the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rooftop canals + time‑sculpting pendant + “giant’s nap” ecology feels fresh and integrated. The sacrifice turn is thematically inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual worldbuilding) land cleanly. Not revolutionary, but distinctly imagined and coherent.</comment>
