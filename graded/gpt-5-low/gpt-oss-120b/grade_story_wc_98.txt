<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to awaken the seed before the monsoon to safeguard collective memory—is crisp and drives each micro‑choice (mapping symbols, voicing the incantation). Interiority is particular and embodied (“air tasted of citrus and rain,” “luminous doubt”), with credible ambivalence between fear of failure and resolve. The “reality checker” identity coheres with her empirically whimsical method, avoiding stock heroism. The visible cost is mostly emotional risk rather than material sacrifice, but it reads earned at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: the translations intensify until the cadence shift at the incantation and sprout. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed wakes, the ridge exhales, and the monsoon’s approach leaves a felt cost/risk. Orientation is clean from the outset; stakes and method are taught early and paid off. The cost is conceptual/emotional more than enacted, but it’s legible in the final image and doubt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: jade vines, orchids, the ridge as the archive, and phosphorescent lanterns that “flicker like questions” all filter through Mara’s lens. The ridge’s status as “last echo of the island’s collective memory” and the approaching monsoon constrain choices and charge the ending image. Sensory range is balanced (scent, taste, light), and world rules stay consistent through action. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics (dream‑mapping at the ridge) and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres around time (pre‑monsoon) and process (translation under doubt). Tightening occurs as her luminous doubt crystallizes into resolve, culminating in the incantation; the sprout is a meaningful turn. The cost is prospective—the storm may still test and perhaps drown the shoots—charging the final pose. A sharper on‑page obstacle could have intensified the squeeze, but the scale fits the design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of testing myth against fact and the communal/individual braid are realized through the concrete act of translating dream symbols to “factual anchors.” The final image reweights prior material: luminous doubt becomes the engine of stewardship, not its negation. Occasional articulation (“She understood that…”) edges toward telling but doesn’t flatten resonance. The ending invites reflection without moral summation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close carries a distinctive perceptual signature (“lanterns…like questions in a bright hall of doubt”). Diction suits Mara’s empirically whimsical mind and the island’s ethos; stance and distance stay steady. Rhythm modulates well into the incantation and sprout. No head‑hopping or elision debt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and image‑rich, with high information density and few redundancies. A handful of metaphor stacks flirt with purple, but vehicles stay coherent and purposeful (“silvered pages turning in a wind of thought”). Momentum is preserved through action‑tied description; syntax varies naturally. No noticeable scaffold loops or line‑level artifacts dulling the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “reality checkers,” knowledge fruit, and dream‑to‑fact cartography feel fresh in combination, with a lived internal logic. The waking via interpreted dreams grounded in communal memory is a non‑obvious synthesis. The final charged poise under the monsoon avoids safe closure. Not radical in structure, but confidently singular in vision.</comment>
