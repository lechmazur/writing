<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—bringing light to dark corners—is coherent and embodied through tactile choices (the latch, the planting). Interiority is specific (“protected vulnerability,” ritual with the rosebush) but her contradictions never tighten into a hard trade‑off. She reads competent and tender yet faces little internal friction beyond tone. The ending’s endurance choice (to keep tending) is credible but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around a ritualized act that deepens from hush to steadied breath, closing on a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis image (glowing vines into dawn, commitment to return). Orientation is clear and the recurring objects pay off, but the on‑page cost is soft, keeping the closure resonant rather than decisive. Causality holds without unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The harbor, fire escape, and moonlight are sensorially vivid and functionally used (moonbeams as resource; alleys receiving light). The bitting gauge tooth and vines act as micro‑setting that charges the final image. Balance across senses (silver light, wet planks, gulls, mist) sustains atmosphere without museum‑tour listing. Environment guides action, though it rarely constrains options under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes stay gentle: whether Mara can usher light into shadowed alleys. Escalation appears as a tonal tightening (the hush settling, darkness “recoiling”) rather than as constrained options or losses. The latch click is the closest to a micro turn; no beat threatens failure or exacts a clear price. The resolution is earned but low‑pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of care as illumination and pragmatic hope accrue through recurring images (oars’ rhythm, hush, moon ribbons) and reweight at the end. Occasional explicitness (“truest form of care”) edges toward stating the thesis. Subtext of tending as resistance lands via the glowing vines and seasonal vow. The resonance lingers, if gently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanics of gardening meet harbor music). Diction stays coherent and modulates slightly at closure without head‑hopping or register drift. Refrains (“rhythm of oars,” “quivering hush”) are patterned, not lazy. No dialogue to test, but narrative stance remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is musical and largely precise, with strong verb choices (“unfurled,” “sputtered,” “recoiled”). There is mild redundancy in motif repetition and a few near‑synonymous restatements that slow momentum without adding pressure. Figurative language largely coheres to water/light mechanics, avoiding mixed metaphors. Rhythm is varied enough to carry a quiet scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The “fire escape gardener” planting luminous vines via a locksmith heirloom is a fresh synthesis. The harbor’s hush as ambient pressure and the oar‑rhythm method feel singular rather than ornamental. Innovation is tempered by low conflict, but the vision holds together authentically. The final reconfiguration reads earned and specific to this premise.</comment>
