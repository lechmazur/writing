<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara’s care and ritualized intent are clear, but her interiority is largely unwavering and free of contradiction, leaving little sense of struggle under pressure. Micro‑choices (placing the vinyl shard, choosing a cadence) align with motive yet reveal no competing impulse or doubt. Mr. Harlan remains a receptive presence rather than an active crucible. The result is moving but emotionally smoothed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the music, vinyl, and “scent of hope” build toward a Charged Poise ending with Mr. Harlan’s last breath and the staff taking keepsakes. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single scene tightens in cadence to a legible closure with cost. The final image reweights earlier motifs without mechanical wrap‑up. Lack of friction prevents a higher ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hospice “above the clouds,” the harp, and the vinyl shard create a vivid, coherent atmosphere and recur to charge the final image. Sensory detailing across sound and scent is purposeful and POV‑filtered by a music therapist. While the setting rarely constrains options, the object‑as‑setting (vinyl) functions effectively as the micro‑environment for the ritual. Strong, if not tactically determinative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (a flawless goodbye) is clear and the pressure coheres through the ritual’s build and the approach of death. Escalation is a density increase (cadence tightening) rather than a turn, culminating in the last breath and keepsake division. Cost is present (letting go) but the path is unresisted, with no meaningful trade‑off or reversal testing Mara’s commitment. The tension remains gentle, not sharpened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of transformation and wholeness‑from‑brokenness arise organically through the vinyl motif and the ritual’s cadence. However, explicit assertions like “endings are not loss but transformation” tip into stated moralizing, blunting subtext. The final image (shared fragments) resonates and reweights prior material. Emotional aftereffect is earned but slightly sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close carries a consistent, musical cadence suited to the protagonist’s vocation. Occasional anthropomorphizing (“the room itself seemed to listen”) fits the chosen register. No dialogue to test, but focalization remains stable without head‑hopping. A few flourishes court purple, yet cadence control mostly holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush and largely clear, with strong sensory layering, but leans purple through repeated intensifiers and motifs (“radiant haven,” “scent of hope,” “pulsing stillness”). Some paraphrase echoes and modifier stacking could be tightened for momentum. Rhythm is musical but risks sameness in sentence structure. Clarity survives; precision could elevate it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hospice music therapy framed by a broken vinyl shard and a literalized “scent of hope” provides a fresh inflection on familiar deathbed rituals. The keepsake division is a memorable turn. Yet the clouds/threshold imagery and overall arc tread well‑worn ground, with low risk in conflict design. Originality rests in texture more than in structural invention.</comment>
