<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (rekindling empathy to surface erased victims) is clear and consistently enacted through tactile, methodical practice. The face‑blindness informs her perception and choices rather than reading as a label. Internal contradiction (refusing faces yet painting them) is present but lightly tested; the quarry’s swift “response” eases struggle and reduces felt cost. The ending registers a meaningful shift, though the price paid skews conceptual rather than dramatically earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure deepens from mist and silence to the ribbon’s child’s name, then to the fissure and carved names, landing in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, and the single‑scene focus holds. Closure arrives on‑page via a charged final image (stone tear, ribbon glint) that reweights the premise with some conceptual cost. The path is more incantatory than causal, but the pattern is taught and sustained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist, acoustics, and limestone materially shape perception and the ritual of painting, and the fissure with carved names charges the final image. Details are tactile and filtered through Mara’s nonvisual sensing, giving specificity. The ribbon catching a beam and the stone’s “tear” tie environment to theme without pure decoration. Occasional symbolic heaviness peeks through but doesn’t blunt place‑effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (recovering the erased) are signaled early and intensify as the child’s name surfaces and the quarry “speaks.” The main tightening is the fissure/revelation, which reweights options rather than forcing a hard trade‑off. Agency is expressed as endurance and attention more than decision, with limited visible loss beyond emotional reopening. Still, the cadence shift is clear and earns the quiet resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motifs of absence/presence and unifying opposites thread coherently to propose that feeling, not seeing, restores the forgotten. The ribbon’s evolution (talisman → named edge → tear‑catcher) offers a strong thematic throughline. However, overt thesis statements (“method of unifying opposites,” “awaken dormant empathy”) recur, tipping toward didactic. The resonance is real but slightly over‑explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person sticks closely to Mara’s tactile perceptual signature, and diction aligns with her methodical, nonvisual focus. Rhythm modulates effectively from hush to intensification at the fissure. No head‑hopping or stance leaks occur. A touch of purple imagery appears but stays legible within the chosen voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose often carries multiple jobs per sentence and maintains momentum, but figurative stacks (“lance the void,” “furrowed hush,” repeated “unifying opposites”) flirt with excess. Some conceptual repetition could be tightened without loss. Syntax and paragraphing are clean and purposeful. The final image is clear, though a slight overwriting sheen dampens impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—face‑blind portraitist coaxing a quarry to “speak” cold cases through tactile ritual—is fresh and memorable. The ribbon as talismanic proof that identity returns through touch rather than sight is an elegant turn. Risks in tone and metaphoric literalization pay off in a distinctive vision. Minor conventional phrasings prevent it from feeling utterly singular.</comment>
