<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her cautious temperament informs her tactics. However, interior conflict is limited; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price. The competence-forward execution (algorithm, transmitter, clean success) minimizes struggle. Still, micro-choices about modulation and interference reveal a professional mindset under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the broadcast layers a subsonic pattern, counters a false alarm, and culminates in a charged community shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the station becomes a forum/lighthouse) rather than a decisive change. The because/therefore chain is intact, but the cost at the end reads thin. Structure is coherent with one continuous arc and clean anchors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The university radio station, charts, and low-frequency tech are integrated and tactile, shaping tactics and the final image. Sound and atmosphere (hum, static, subsonic pulse) are specific and purposeful. World rules stay consistent and are learned via action (interference, morphing static). The setting constrains and enables choices without turning into a tour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent manipulation/unify campus) is clear, but escalation is modest: the false alarm is neutralized swiftly with little pushback. Mara’s agency drives the action, yet few options close or force trade-offs. The community’s transformation feels earned conceptually but light on concrete consequence or sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of balancing power plays through delicate, communal interference is coherent and seeded early. Recurring sonic imagery accrues meaning and pays off in the dawn shimmer and “lighthouse” reprise. Some lines verge on sermonizing (“tuned their own inner frequency,” “not as a weapon but as a conduit of balance”). The resonance lingers, but the moral clarity feels a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinctive, controlled lyric texture that suits the radio/cosmic frame. Rhythm and diction are confident, with sensory bias toward sound. Occasional abstraction and elevated register slightly dilute pressure at peaks. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences are clean and mostly propulsive, with purposeful sonic and celestial imagery. There’s mild purple saturation and some conceptual redundancy in late paragraphs. Information density stays decent, though a few phrases echo theme rather than advance action. Mechanics and clarity remain solid throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of campus radio praxis with cosmic tricksters and subsonic social cohesion is fresh and memorable. The method-as-metaphor is integrated rather than ornamental. Risk-taking is present but buffered by low on-page cost, which keeps it shy of exceptional. The final reweighting feels inevitable within the premise.</comment>
