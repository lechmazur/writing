<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Selene’s motive—to encode vulnerability into strength—is clear, but interior contradiction and embodied cost are lightly sketched. She moves with mastery and little struggle; choices rarely reveal competing impulses. The crystal’s rescue and departure land emotionally yet without a felt sacrifice. Overall, vivid persona, limited pressure on her psyche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dance → dice resonance → crystal retrieval → lab’s rise → departure creates a coherent pattern. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the lab transformed and pages left behind. Cost is mostly conceptual (privacy surrendered, secrets reconfigured) rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of the top band. Orientation is clean early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken lab, pressure‑sealed door, algae ink, kelp leather, and dice integrate tightly with action and final image. Environment directly constrains and enables tactics (tide pressure, musical unlocking) and charges the ending. Sensory specificity is vivid without becoming a museum tour. World rules remain consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming vulnerability/liberating the lab) is clear, but pressure rarely tightens against her; obstacles soften into ritual. The key turn (singing to the dice revealing the crystal) feels assured, with minimal resistance or trade‑off. The emotional price is implied rather than pressed. Tension is atmospheric more than escalatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of “vulnerability as encoded strength” accrues through recurring objects (dice, crystal, journal) and culminates in a quiet, resonant repricing. Occasional direct restatements (“The act of liberate was not a loud explosion...”) risk over‑telling. Still, the ocean‑as‑web solidarity image gives a lingering, non‑didactic answer. Strong but bounded by modest on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are confident and consistent. Patterned elision is taught early and sustained through closure. No head‑hopping or register drift. Modulation suits pressure, with musicality aligning to action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, clean syntax, and purposeful imagery. A few repetitions (“calm defiance,” spider/web time) flirt with purple but don’t obscure sense. Momentum generally advances without scaffolding or loops. Final images are sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of cryptography, dance, and an underwater reliquary with hangman’s dice and algae ink feels fresh and cohesive. Turns grow from established motifs rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth is present within the stylized frame. Bold yet legible, with distinctive object ecology charging the end.</comment>
