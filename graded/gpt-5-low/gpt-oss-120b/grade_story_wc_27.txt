<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (seeking meaning) and a distinct trait (“awkwardly confident”) guide concrete actions—listening, whispering, tracing the glyph. Interiority is present but leans abstract; contradictions are mild and cost is soft. The agency is credible, and the final vow feels earned by prior attentiveness. However, we don’t see a palpable sacrifice or an on‑page flaw exacting a price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through hums, patterning, and resonance until a cadence shift reconfigures the bay and the protagonist’s stance. Orientation is clean early; single scene coheres. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (engines revived; vow; sanctuary), though the cost is more felt than explicit. The because/therefore chain is secondary to the patterned intensification, which the ending honors.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The repair bay’s rust, engines, glyph, and buried stone circle are vivid and functional, not merely scenic. Environment and tool (opera glasses) actively shape tactics and charge the closing image. World rules (hum resonance) stay consistent and learned through action. Strong sensory economy supports tone without museum‑tour listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reigniting a stalled rebellion/meaning) is signaled early and deepens as the hum spreads from glyph to engines to workers. The escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven (listening, tracing patterns), but the visible price is light and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. Tension operates more as swell than contest, which suits the lens but limits bite. The final vow crystallizes stance rather than forcing a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (hum, lenses, rhythm) earn a thematic answer: meaning as alignment and attentive action. The closing image has resonance, but explicit statements (“meaning was not a fixed destination”) edge toward moralizing. Subtext largely rides image and sound rather than argument, which works; complexity is present but gentle. A touch less declaration would heighten afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—mechanical and cosmic fused. Rhythm modulates well through swell and release; no head‑hopping. Diction is controlled, though occasionally lush enough to flirt with purple. The voice remains coherent under pressure and earns its cadences.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line work is musical with strong image density and purposeful repetition. Some paraphrase/lexical loops (“thunderous serenity,” “hum”) and stacked modifiers risk saturation, slightly dulling momentum in the middle. Clarity remains intact and final images are clean. Minor tightening could lift propulsion without losing texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: opera glasses as conduit, a stone circle under a spaceport, “thunderous serenity” as operative physics. Turns grow from established patterns rather than late gimmicks. The vision feels specific and integrated, not a stitched prompt. Emotional truth lands, even if the cost is modest.</comment>
