<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—transmuting sterile despair into a shared dream—reads clean and drives tangible actions (the progressive drumming, perching higher). Interiority is mostly implied through sensory coupling rather than embodied contradiction, leaving little friction or flaw on the page. The rebellion trait coheres but seldom exacts visible cost. Still, her micro-choices align with the final reconfiguration credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a primarily Accumulative/Textural lens, the density of rhythms and images builds toward a concrete on‑page shift: the lab’s protocol changes because Lira’s music permeates their dreams. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene escalates without breaking rules. The cost is conceptual/social (abandoning the experimental treatment) rather than personally paid on-page, but it lands. The closure reads as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a decisive institutional turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid, integrated, and functional: blossoms become bells; the lagoon mirrors and lifts memories; the environment amplifies and exports the song. Sensory specificity is strong and character‑filtered through Lira’s tactile music‑making. The setting meaningfully charges the final image (orbs, steady glow) and channels the change beyond the dome. Minor restraint could elevate clarity, but the place feels indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres as the garden’s response intensifies, culminating in institutional change, though external resistance remains largely off‑stage. The dominant stake—transforming cold observation into communal care—tightens via Lira’s agency (escalating drumming, climbing higher). Costs are implicit rather than felt by Lira; the lab’s sacrifice is declared rather than dramatized. Still, the cadence shift (aurora, orbs) reads as a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of collective healing and rebellion-as-care are woven through recurring images (aurora, lagoon, orbs) that reweight sorrow into hope. Subtext largely rides image rather than statement; however, lines like “sorrow can birth light” verge on explicit moralizing. The final image reaffirms an earned communal chord rather than closing with a thesis. Resonance lingers, though a hair less told summation would strengthen it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person maintains consistent distance and diction, with rhythmic control that fits the fable‑like sensibility. Occasional omniscient leaps (staff dreams) remain coherent and support the outcome. No dialogue is needed; the voice serves the mode. A few high-register phrases flirt with abstraction but do not break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is lush and mostly precise, with strong image-to-action density. It occasionally edges into purple (reiterations of “auric/auroral,” stacked modifiers), risking blur and slight momentum drag. Syntax varies enough to keep flow, and core images remain legible at closure. Trimming a handful of ornamental phrases would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A quietly rebellious guinea pig orchestrating a sonic garden to alter human protocols feels fresh and integrated. The mechanism (drumming animating the garden to transmit memory and longing) is inventive rather than gimmicky. The final reweighting is inevitable in hindsight given the setup. High originality without sacrificing coherence.</comment>
