<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (undo the bureaucratic death and prevent the ghost from overwriting her mind) is clear and her actions track, but internal contradiction and visible cost are limited. She operates with calm competence; anxiety and doubt rarely trouble her choices. The shard‑as‑memento at the end suggests a modest renunciation of fear rather than a pressured trade. Strong specificity, light struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ritual with ink and porcelain teaches a pattern that tightens into the shard’s chime and the ghost’s confession. Closure lands with a reconfiguration (ghost halts; single pulse; ghost reframed as mirror). Causal beats connect (ink keys → latch → confession → halt), though the cost is conceptual more than felt. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal observatory, midnight snow, ink, and porcelain are vivid, tactile, and filtered through Mara’s technical/spiritual lens. The environment lightly constrains tactics (opal walls resonate; lab consoles take ink; rooftop ending reframes the space). Sensory selection supports the hush and precision of the task. Strong economy with a charged reprise of the shard and roof.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (halt the loop before it overwrites her mind; reclaim her life), and escalation occurs through the ritual’s deepening to the shard’s chime and the ghost’s error. However, pressure rarely bites: no setback or trade‑off tests her commitment and the solution unfolds smoothly. The price paid is mostly conceptual (admitting miscounted beats) rather than a constrained loss. Effective but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Failure as teacher and “broken piece holds meaning” emerge through action (shard conduit, ghost’s confession) and the final image reweights the premise. A couple of explicit theme lines nudge toward moral (“ensuring no death certificate would ever again be signed by a glitch”), trimming subtlety. Still, the mirror‑ghost and warmed shard create genuine resonance. The ending’s quiet repricing lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, crystalline lyric. Diction fits a precise scientist with ritualistic sensibility; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythms modulate from incantatory to still at closure. Elision is minimal and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax; images carry multiple jobs (ink as algorithm, shard as conduit and keepsake). Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains coherent and purposeful. Minimal repetition and no scaffold drags the momentum. Final lines land by image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Digital ghost + porcelain/ink ritual in an opal observatory under snow feels fresh and integrated. The heartbeat counter as liturgy and the bureaucratic death error synthesize into a distinctive premise. The turn—ghost as mirror—reads earned. Risk‑taking is aesthetic rather than structural, but it heightens coherence.</comment>
