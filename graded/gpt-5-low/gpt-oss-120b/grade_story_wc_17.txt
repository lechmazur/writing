<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s drive is clear and particular, and her tactile choices (lighting the fire, tracing the negative, pressing it to the wall) align with her vocation. Interiority is sensorially grounded rather than labeled. However, contradictory impulses or a meaningful internal struggle are muted; the journey feels assured more than tested. The acceptance of the legacy’s burden lands but with little visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is consistent: diaries → negative → wall hum → seasonal returns, culminating in a conceptual repricing of what “mapping” means. Orientation is clean from the outset and the ending image provides on‑page closure. The epilogue‑like months‑later montage sustains rather than resets the arc. The cost at closure is conceptual, not sharply felt, keeping it short of top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: mist, ivy, hearth, and stone are filtered through an echo‑cartographer’s sensoria and used in action. The film negative as a tool-object charges the final image and mediates the environment’s “voice.” Weather and the corridor’s physicality shape tone and method, though they rarely constrain options decisively. World rules remain coherent and learned by doing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are singular (hear the walls’ dreams) and escalate gently via discovery to a low, resonant hum that reweights understanding. The pressing of the negative to the wall is the clearest tightening beat. Costs and foreclosed options are implied rather than dramatized, so tension stays lyrical more than pressurized. Resolution arises from endurance and attention rather than a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, stewardship, and communal imagination emerge organically from particulars and the recurring object. The final repricing (“the true map… collective imagination”) coheres, but the line flirts with moral summary, dulling subtext. Earlier images (palms, rain‑scent, stone lullaby) carry stronger implicit resonance. The piece invites reflection yet edges toward explicitness at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is assured, consistent, and sensorially biased toward sound and texture, befitting the profession. Distance is steady, with confident lyricism that modulates at key beats (the corridor’s exhale, the dreamscape). No head‑hopping or register slips; diction feels chosen, not generic. A slight tendency toward uniform rapture keeps it shy of the rarest control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are musical with strong image economy; most sentences do multiple jobs and advance mood and action. Occasional lushness risks purple drift, but clarity holds and cadence varies. Minimal redundancy and clean choreography keep momentum intact. Proofing and syntax are tight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of echo cartography, light‑sensitive film translating sound to shadow, and climate‑altered academia feels fresh and coherent. The negative‑as‑bridge is an inventive, specific fulcrum. The closure’s communal reframing is elegant if slightly stated. Overall, a distinctive, high‑concept piece with lived‑in details rather than ornament.</comment>
