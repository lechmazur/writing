<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear desire (“to catch the echo of a goddess”) drives concrete actions (planting, then lifting the rail spike, chanting). Interiority is particular and image-led, though internal contradiction is slight; the “cool-headed” steadiness limits visible struggle. Micro-choices (step left/right/forward by pulses) show embodied pursuit but not much cost or ambivalence. The closing acceptance—setting the echo free rather than trapping it—reads earned but emotionally low-friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and cadence rise from listening to planting the spike to the chant and merging with constellations. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he carries the echo and reframes “catching” as releasing. Cost is mostly conceptual (self-boundaries soften; he foregoes possession for stewardship), not explicit, keeping this just shy of top tier. Orientation is clean from the outset (fisher, garden at twilight), and there are no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “sound wave garden” and rail spike integrate deeply into action; environment and tool literally guide steps and enable the ritual. Sensory specificity (vibration, hush that “voices silence,” reeds’ chorus) is purposeful and filtered through the fisher’s acoustic bias. World rules are consistent in their lyric logic and are learned through action. The rail spike returns charged at the end, anchoring the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates via pattern intensification: pulses → hush → chant → constellation entanglement. The tightening beat is the tangle/tilt and the spike’s skyward aim, which narrows options to a single attempt. Price is implied rather than dramatized—more surrender of control than sacrifice—so tension never fully bites. Still, agency drives the turn, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: longing translated into sound, creation as listening and release rather than capture. The final repricing—“to catch… is not to trap, but to set it free”—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Recurring images (lullaby, patterns breaking, threads/lines) accrue meaning and shift at the end. Ambiguity lingers productively around the cost of carrying the echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a strong, musical diction that matches the premise. Rhythm modulates well around the peak chant without head-hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision is taught early (lyric logic) and paid off at closure. No dialogue is needed; the voice carries subtext and intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lush lines mostly sustain clarity; syntax varies and images multitask. Occasional repetition and high figurative density skirt purple (“patterns break themselves” appears twice), but coherence holds. Minimal scaffold and no obvious synonym churn; information density stays high. The peak beat remains legible and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sound-based garden, rail spike as veil-piercing tool, and “voicing silence” method feel fresh and integrated. The constellation “sleepwalking” conceit and feral lullaby tone create a distinctive synthesis. The turn from capture to release is non-obvious yet earned. Slightly safer conflict cost keeps it below the rare range.</comment>
