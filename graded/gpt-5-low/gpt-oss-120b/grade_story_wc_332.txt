<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (recover the runaway dream) and consistent actions (dawn climbs, camera work, whispering the cipher) ground Mara. However, interior contradiction is light; she rarely faces competing impulses under pressure. The brief Lio shard adds an external echo rather than a crucible. The closing acceptance (“not a puzzle to be solved but a bridge”) feels earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn rituals → charged photograph → filament caught by Lio → conceptual closure as shared longing becomes bridge. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (reframing the quest as communal transmission), though the on‑page price is subtle. Orientation is early and clean; mosaic shift to Lio is legible. Escalation is more deepening than turning, but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: lighthouse library, archipelago winds, reef dawns, jasmine scent—all filtered through Mara’s praxis. The environment and tools (cliff, camera, palette at sunrise) meaningfully shape choices and the final image. World rules (light‑painting, wind carrying ciphers) stay consistent as mythic realism. Strong atmosphere without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled (retrieve/translate the runaway dream), with one tightening via the sunrise window and the decision to release the cipher to the wind. Pressure remains gentle; conflict is largely internal and unopposed, with limited cost or narrowed options. Lio’s netting of light is a pretty beat but offers minimal resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of longing as communal bridge and art as translation emerge organically through image systems (light, wind, jasmine, pearl). The realization that the cipher is a bridge offers a resonant answer. One slightly declarative line (“not a puzzle to be solved but a bridge”) edges toward telling, but prior particulars earn it. The final fragrant hush reweights the opening’s absence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct sensory lexicon; the brief POV switch to Lio is clean and segmented. Diction is cohesive, modulating at the climax (filament/jasmine) without register slips. Voice feels singular and confident, with pattern-taught phrasing that supports the mythic tone. No head‑hopping or stance confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet generally precise, with strong noun-verb choices and sensory layering across sight/scent/sound. A few repeated motifs (“luminous absence,” “vitalize”) flirt with redundancy but serve pattern rather than padding. Figurative density is high yet coherent; minimal scaffold. Rhythm varies and carries momentum to the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse library + light‑painting palette + wind-borne ciphers feels fresh and integrated. The net catching light and dissolving to jasmine is a memorable turn that fits the invented logic. Risks are taken in a lyric, quasi‑mythic register without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is specific to this world rather than templated.</comment>
