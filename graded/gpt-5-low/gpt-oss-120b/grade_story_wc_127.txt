<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motives and methods are clear and character‑specific, and her “affectionate detachment” reads credibly through tactile choices (rubbing the petal, sealing the vial). However, she faces little counter‑pressure; contradictory impulses surface but never truly force a trade‑off on the page. The courier tease hints at future conflict rather than testing her stance now. Strong presence, modest on‑scene struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual intensifies to a completion chime, then reweights with the courier’s crate, yielding a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean from the first line. The cost is conceptual—empathy commodified—rather than concretely felt, which softens impact. Still, the cadence shift from ritual completion to new demand lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amber grotto’s materials and acoustics enable the method (static from stone, chime marking completion) and charge the final image (amber glow sealed in the vial). Sensory detail is vivid and POV‑filtered through Mara’s craft. The environment’s properties tangibly shape tactics, not just mood. Strong integration without overexplanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing a saleable feeling—remains coherent, but pressure is low and mostly atmospheric. The escalation is a smooth intensification rather than a turn that forecloses options or exacts visible price. No real risk tests her thoroughness or ethics in‑scene. The courier arrives as setup for later stakes, not a complication that forces immediate recalibration.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of empathy as commodity and “half truths” as transactional bridges accrue naturally through image and action. Final beats (amber glow sealed; promise to transform grief) resonate without moralizing. Subtextual tension—care as technique versus care as feeling—lingers. Depth is strong despite the absence of a hard dilemma.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, sensuous, and consistent with Mara’s professional lens; diction and rhythm feel intentional. POV remains stable with no leakage, and the lyric register suits the concept. A few lush turns flirt with purple but stay legible. The modulation from ritual focus to quiet commerce at the end is smooth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: varied syntax, concrete verbs, and layered images that carry multiple jobs. Repetitions (“half truths,” “static”) read pattern‑driven rather than looped. Minor density spikes verge on ornate but do not blur sense or momentum. The opening and closing images are cleanly cut and memorable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The counterfeit‑emotion economy, static‑sensing method, and amber grotto ritual synthesize into a fresh, memorable premise. The final reweighting with the courier’s crate extends the world without gimmickry. Emotional commerce framed through scent chemistry feels uniquely realized. Ingenuity is high even if on‑page stakes stay contained.</comment>
