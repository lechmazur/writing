<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marlowe’s motive—to decode the stranger’s gesture—drives clear micro‑choices (watching the tide, aligning the flower, lighting the lamp). Interiority feels particular (opal dock reflection, boutonnière against his heart) and not generic. The internal conflict is gentle (isolation vs. duty/hope) and could bear a sharper contradictory pull under pressure. The final renunciation/acceptance (keeping vigil, becoming witness) reads earned, if low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate; the accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern density (tide gaps/flower) builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands when he aligns the Edelweiss with the longest lull and lights the lamp—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise that reweights his solitude. Cost is quiet but legible: a commitment to keep another’s memory and to continue keeping watch. The causal throughline is coherent without over‑explaining the uncanny logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and tide are vividly rendered and filtered through Marlowe’s sensibility. Setting actively charges tactics: he reads sea pauses as text, aligns the flower on the dock, and uses the lighthouse beam to trace “ribbons of gold.” Environmental specificity evolves with the night and directly shapes the ending image. Detail is selective yet rich, supporting tone and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate—whether he can decode and honor a stranger’s final gesture—and the pressure coheres as pattern recognition deepens. Escalation is a measured cadence shift (the realization that pauses equal memory) rather than a hard narrowing of options. The price paid is modest but present: he commits to witnesshood over isolation’s safety. A single meaningful tightening occurs, but a bolder on‑page cost would lift intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Memory, witness, and transformed solitude emerge through recurring images (Edelweiss, tide gaps, lamp) rather than stated morals. The final image reweights the theme: isolation becomes service, the dock a promise against oblivion. Subtext is steady and avoids preachiness, though a few lines approach lyrical reiteration. The resonance lingers credibly beyond the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensorially biased to sea‑craft and watchfulness. Diction maintains a unified register; the whisper to the wind reads as in‑character rather than authorial. Rhythm varies with pressure and the patterning (pauses, sighs) is taught and paid off. A slight drift toward lushness risks monotony but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is mostly clean, with strong verbs and concrete images doing double duty. A few repetitions (“softly persistent”) and stacked modifiers flirt with purple but stop short of muddle. Momentum holds; sentences modulate length to mirror tide and breath. Minor paraphrase echoes could be trimmed for greater snap.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tactic of “reading” tide gaps as borrowed memory is an original, specific move that reframes familiar lighthouse lore. The Edelweiss importation of alpine memory into a maritime scene feels fresh and earnestly integrated. The quiet reconfiguration at the end avoids cliché; risk‑taking is measured and coherent. Only the low‑stakes pressure keeps it short of exceptional.</comment>
