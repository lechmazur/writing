<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The translator’s motive—to transmute trauma into meaning—drives tactile micro‑choices (placing the vial, tracing letters, whispering). The “shrewdly innocent” paradox reads character‑particular and avoids sainthood through the felt ache at the end. Pressure is gentle and largely internal, but it coheres. The visible cost is modest yet present in the lotus‑hearted ache.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: mist, coral, and the cast build toward a Charged Poise closure when the droplet seals the graft. Orientation is clean from the opening and the motif pattern is taught early and paid off. The cost lands conceptually (endurance, ache) without false neatness. The scene stays single‑window and honors its scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mist‑clad atrium and medical lull shape tone and tempo, while the bench, vial, and cast serve as micro‑setting objects. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered (translator’s tactile focus, breathing rhythms). The environment doesn’t strictly constrain options, keeping it just shy of 9‑band. Still, the closing image is charged by object‑as‑setting choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes (can she reconfigure a child’s fear into shareable strength) are signaled and deepen as the anesthetic window narrows. Escalation is mostly density/tempo rather than a hard turn: notes “glow,” confessions surface, then the sealing droplet. The visible price is internal and quiet, not a foreclosed path. Effective but soft in pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resilience and communal transmutation (“shared anxieties”) arise through concrete acts (matching phrases to coral strands) rather than abstract sermon. The final image reweights prior motifs without bow‑tying the trauma. Occasionally the piece edges toward explanatory phrasing (“promising that the graft…”), slightly thinning subtext. Overall, resonance outlasts the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a contemplative professional under pressure. Diction and rhythm modulate with the anesthetic’s hush and the mist’s thickening. No head‑hopping or register slips, and the whispers feel earned within the texture. A touch of elevated phrasing brushes purple but remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant with high information density, but figurative layering is frequent (“lotus‑hearted ache,” “sky is a cracked mirror of bombs,” coral as graft) and risks saturation. Clarity holds, and sentences vary well. Minimal scaffolding; momentum generally flows with the breath cadence. Slight overwriting keeps it below top tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coral‑as‑neural‑graft conceit married to a translator’s ethical labor is fresh and specific. The anesthetic window and object ritual give the lyric premise spine. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off. It feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
