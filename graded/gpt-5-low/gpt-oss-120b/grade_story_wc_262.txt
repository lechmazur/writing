<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and steady—she seeks where unused love is stored—and her actions (psychometry, humming, retrieving the tin) align. Interiority is sensorial and particular, though inner contradiction is light and she rarely faces a counter‑impulse beyond awe. Embodied emotion lands in lines like “feeling the weight of unsent affection,” but the cost of taking that love in is more implied than dramatized. The final renunciation—whispering goodbye and leaving—reads earned but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: patterning of hum/thunder, film/letters, and tune/lyrics intensifies to a cadence shift when the chord resolves and the film melts. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she absorbs unused love and departs with a reweighted purpose, with a felt cost in the farewell and the self‑alteration. Orientation is clean from the outset (projection booth, film strip), and beats follow a logical inner ritual. The cost is subtle but present on the page in the goodbye and the relinquishing of emptiness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly tactile (velvet seats, sputtering projector) and functionally shapes action via the hidden compartment and the final projection. Objects as setting—the film strip, projector, tin—charge the ending image and tactics. The environment’s acoustics (“thunderous hush”) modulate pressure and tone. Specificity is high without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating unused love—tightens through concrete turns: hidden compartment → letters/map → reading a goodbye triggers transformation → liquid film and absorption. Escalation is largely textural, yet each deepening constrains options toward acceptance and release. The visible price is modest but discernible in her self‑flooding and final goodbye. Agency drives the key moves, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of release, curation of sorrow, and the alchemy of art into love emerge organically through the particulars (letters as birds, film as river of memory). The final image reweights the premise: liberation comes by gathering and transforming, not locating a single vault. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in what “carrying the stored unused love” will cost her. Symbolic threads recur without shouting, especially the hush/thunder motif resolving in the audience of shadows.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lush lyric voice with controlled distance suits the occult task and maintains legibility. Diction (“thunderous hush,” “liquid light”) is patterned but purposeful, and the perceptual signature feels distinct. No dialogue to test, but rhythm varies and tightens at turns. Minor risk of purple excess is largely managed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is musical and image‑dense with good momentum; most sentences do more than one job. A few accumulations verge on overload (“spatially imaginative labyrinth,” “river of memory”), but clarity holds and images cohere. Minimal scaffolding and no obvious loops; syntax varies with pressure. The density could breathe a touch more at peak beats, but it doesn’t blunt closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of psychometry, projection‑booth archaeology, and unsent goodbyes feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring elements transform (film → map → river → projected light) in a non‑obvious yet grounded way. The risk is a fully lyric design without external antagonist, but the imaginative synthesis and clean closure justify it. Emotional truth underwrites the novelty.</comment>
