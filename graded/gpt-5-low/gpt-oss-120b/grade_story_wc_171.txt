<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—to convert ritual into binding peace—is clear and consistent, with embodied moments (placing the clipboard, writing clauses, steadying her voice). Interiority is mostly convincing if somewhat idealized; contradictory impulses (awe vs. resolve, fear vs. duty) surface but don’t bite hard. Secondary pressure from chieftains is light, limiting crucible intensity. The final endurance/renunciation (leaders laying down swords) reads earned by her steady tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single, lucid scene builds accumulative pressure through ritual and culminates in a visible decisive act (swords on the altar). Orientation is immediate (terrace, midsummer, altar, clipboard), and the logic from writing terms to public commitment holds. Cost is legible as renunciation of grudges and arms; the closure image reweights the prior ritual. The lens stays textural/ritualistic without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terrace, altar, firelight, and stars are vivid and integrated into action; the altar constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory detail feels curated (jasmine, armor clang, moonlight softening edges) and POV-filtered through a negotiator’s purpose. The ebony clipboard as micro-setting tool anchors stakes and returns at the end. Occasional overt symbolism skirts obviousness but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: win peace now or perpetuate the “forever war.” Escalation is modest—a chieftain’s approach and the public reading of clauses—before the group lays down swords; resistance feels a bit too smooth. The visible price is renunciation and public vulnerability. A slightly sharper test or near-failure beat would raise pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Redemption through listening and shared ritual emerges coherently, with the clipboard and swords reframed by the final light. However, a few lines state the moral outright (“She understood that redemption’s price…”) edging toward sermonizing. Subtext exists in the choreography of stars vs. fire and armor softening, but it’s sometimes explained rather than let to resonate. The ending image lands but is slightly overexplicated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close-third voice with controlled cadence; image systems (celestial dance, marble, firelight) are confidently handled. No head-hopping and no dialogue to challenge idiom consistency. Register occasionally veers toward purple but stays legible and purposeful. Psychic distance modulates well around peak beats (altar reading, swords placed).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line craft is musical and clear, with selective sensory density. Some repetition and ornamental phrasing (“slow dance of celestial bodies,” “operatively gentle”) skews purple and risks redundancy. Momentum mostly holds; minimal scaffold. Sharpening a few abstractions into concrete frictions would strengthen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The peace-negotiation-as-ritual with an ebony clipboard at an ancient terrace feels distinctive and coherent. The marriage of bureaucratic instrument and sacred setting is fresh. The arc lacks a surprising reversal, but the synthesis reads authentic rather than gimmicky. Emotional truth is solid if not daringly complex.</comment>
