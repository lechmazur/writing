<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to prove whispers outreach shouts—guides concrete choices (placing and cracking the cork) and her embodied emotion (“screaming tenderness”) feels specific. Internal contradiction is gentler than pressured: uncertainty/tremor versus fierce love, but not a jagged clash under duress. Secondary relationship pressure is off‑stage (fisherman), limiting crucible tensions. Still, the final renunciation of the vial’s contents reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density crescendos to the cork’s cracking and the lighthouse-heart image (RR/Charged Poise) with cost signaled by the emptied, cracked cork. Orientation is clear from the start (who/where/when). The fisherman’s turn toward the lighthouse and arrival function as proof without coincidental “solve.” Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, balcony, brass lantern, and sea air are tactile and consistently filtered through Mara’s aim. Setting charges the final image (beam syncing with intent; tower as beating heart) and provides the stage for scent and light to work. Weather/time (“dawn,” post–heat wave) tint mood without derailing plausibility. Minor constraint rather than hard limitation keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate: will her softened intent truly reach farther and guide a life? Escalation is a single meaningful tightening—placing the cork, then cracking it—to an on‑page payoff (boat arrives, sea sighs). The price is felt but modest; no option is sharply foreclosed beyond expending the cork’s charge. Coherent pressure for this scope, though comparatively low-risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres (gentleness outperforms force; bridges of whisper) through images of scent, vibration, and light. The reprise in the final paragraph reweights the premise, but explicit statements (“proof that whispers truly travel farther than shouts”) tilt toward telling. Subtext lives in the fisherman’s inexplicable pull and the lighthouse “heart,” which work well. A touch less overt thesising would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches the story’s ritualized act. Rhythm modulates as intensity rises; no head‑hopping or stance wobble. Occasional purple flare is contained by consistent texture. Dialogue absence is appropriate to the contemplative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is musical and image-rich, often doing multiple jobs at once. However, motif stacking (“vibrations,” “whispers,” “hum”) verges on redundancy in places, softening propulsion. No significant clarity lapses, but density occasionally edges toward overwriting. Final images remain clean and strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse ritual fused with “vibrations of intent” and garden perfume as method feels fresh and integrated. The fisherman’s compass tug as a soft, nonmagnetic pull is a crisp, original beat. Emotional truth is present; risk is aesthetic rather than structural. Slight over-explication keeps it just below the highest tier.</comment>
