<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s drive (“to thresh meaning from experience”) is clear and enacted through concrete choices: following the rain trail, accepting the exchange, placing the brooch. Interiority is textured and embodied (“boots slipping on algae,” “haggard awe”). Internal contradiction is modest—her sacrifice of the canvases is felt but not heavily contested on the page. Still, the cost registers credibly as a meaningful renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning causal: rain trail → brooch → exchange → convergence/aftermath. Orientation is strong and the closure lands with a visible cost (surrendered canvases) and reconfigured options (renewal, preservation on cliffs). The brooch’s sudden “voice” is a slight convenience but doesn’t break the chain. The final cadence returns to studio with a charged object, completing the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tidal island, basalt cliffs, mist gutters, algae slick—specifics are vivid and consistently filtered through Mara’s need. Environment constrains action (slippery footing, altar on cliffs, tidal rhythms) and charges the ending image (mist as varnish). The brooch functions as object‑as‑setting, focusing space and ritual. World rules (post–water wars scarcity) stay coherent and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trading art/meaning for the island’s renewal—is clear and tightens at the exchange. The ritual is a decisive narrowing of options with a felt price, and the convergence’s hum/mist offers a concrete consequence. Pressure is more devotional than adversarial but grows appropriately under the chosen lens. A slightly tidier acceptance of terms keeps it from higher tension bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Art as sacrifice and renewal is integrated through action rather than lecture; the rain trails reweight as memory conduits at the climax. The final image (brooch above the easel, mist preserving colors) resonates. A few lines edge toward theme-telling (“the island had given her meaning”), trimming complexity. Nonetheless, the emergent meaning feels earned and durable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical without losing clarity, and carries a distinct perceptual bias. Rhythm and diction modulate effectively at the convergence (“thin column of water,” “low hum”). No head‑hopping or stance slippage; inference stays within what Mara can know. Minor elevated phrasing remains within character plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and mostly economical; many sentences carry multiple jobs. Occasional purple accents (“perpetually bruised sky,” “single, trembling note of hope”) verge on lush but don’t blur sense. Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops; momentum holds. The prose supports pressure without over‑ornamenting the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑scarcity island, rain trails as memory, art-for-convergence exchange—feels fresh and specific. The brooch-as-compass that reframes the “true compass” as her pursuit of meaning is a smart turn. Tropes (water wars, sacred artifact) are transformed by the tactile ritual and painter’s POV. Not radically risky, but confidently singular.</comment>
