<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation and vocation are clear and particular, and his micro‑choices (blowing the valve, pausing for echoes, inviting the town, then departing) align with his purpose. Internal contradiction is light—he “lets gaps breathe” but faces little on‑page cost or competing impulse. The exile frames him but doesn’t pressure a live dilemma in scene. Strong specificity, modest conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a pattern of calling, collecting, and communal response culminates in the charged pivot to depart for a deeper legend. Orientation is clean early; the valve anchors structure and returns at closure. The cost is mostly conceptual—leaving the harbor, taking on the trench—which keeps the closure resonant but soft. One meaningful tightening arrives with the night gathering → sunrise chord → summons → embark.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: rain‑slick harbor, stone arches, lanterns, and docks all shape acoustics and tactics (echoes, staggered intervals). The valve functions as a micro‑setting/tool charging the final image. Sensory selection feels occupationally filtered. Atmosphere sustains tone without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming fragments into communal meaning; pressure grows gently via density (more fragments, community convening) and then the summons to a trench. Escalation is real but low‑intensity; prices and foreclosed options are mostly implied. The final decision to leave is agentive but not hard‑won in scene. Tension is lyrical rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as tidal, silence as part of meaning, solitary work turning communal—emerges organically through repeated images (echoes, pauses, gaps) and reweights at the end with collective mapping and a new quest. No moralizing; the “absence” motif matures into an ethic of listening. Resonance lingers. Slight softness in cost keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third‑person lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (acoustics, intervals, archival metaphors). Diction and rhythm modulate smoothly from solitary to communal to questing. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Elevated register feels voice‑justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images carry multiple jobs, cadence varies, and figurative language remains coherent. A few near‑reiterations (e.g., fragment/echo motifs) risk mild redundancy but mostly build pattern. Momentum holds despite lyric density. No artifacts that blur closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The brass valve as repository and the acoustics‑based archivism feel fresh, with “staggered intervals” and communal cartography giving the piece a memorable angle. Risks are purposeful and integrated with theme. The turn to an active retrieval quest caps the synthesis. Not groundbreaking, but decidedly original and cohesive.</comment>
