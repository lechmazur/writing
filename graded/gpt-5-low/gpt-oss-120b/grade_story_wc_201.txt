<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s drive—to extract a “mathematics of mercy” from her own trauma—is clear and consistent, and her embodied engagement with the strap, bark, and light grounds emotion. Internal conflict (enduring pain vs. seeking insight) operates in scene via the violet flashes as price. A touch of diagnostic abstraction (“proprioceptively enhanced,” the neat formula) slightly tidies the messiness of her psyche. Still, her final renunciation/repricing (lifting the strap as promise) feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues through repeated flashes and culminates in the clearing and final surge. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing plus Earned Stasis—the world reweights when mercy is redefined and the strap’s meaning flips with visible cost. Orientation is clean early (post‑anesthesia in the ultraviolet forest). The causal rhythm (price per revelation) remains coherent with no soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest’s rules (revelations require searing flashes) shape choices and cost, and the pewter strap functions as charged micro‑setting in the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered (humming bark, crystal roots mapping digits). Environment constrains tactics (bracing; waiting for the final surge). The last image is decisively place‑charged (ordinary sun re‑codes the strap).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and clear (find the equation/mercy), with a meaningful tightening at the clearing and the “final surge.” The cost is felt (skin‑searing flashes; endurance as agency), and options narrow to a ritualized acceptance of pain to earn insight. Mostly internal conflict, but pressure coheres and escalates under the chosen lens. A slightly tidy epiphany softens the edge but does not undercut stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of transmuting harm into mercy and reweighting symbols (the strap) arise from concrete ordeal and recurrence. Some explicitness (“mercy equals…”; “mercy could be taught”) drifts toward thesis, trimming ambiguity. Subtext still breathes in the light’s penance and the strap’s transformation. The final image reconfigures meaning without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature (mathematical/physiological lexicon braided with sensory strangeness). POV distance is stable and apt; no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated diction edges into abstraction but remains character‑coherent for a survivor mapping pattern from pain. Rhythm modulates well toward the cadence shift at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful images; lines typically do more than one job. A few concept‑heavy phrases and minor purple glints (“mathematics of mercy” as explicit formula) risk neatness but don’t stall momentum. Repetition of “brace” is motif‑functional rather than loop. Syntax varies and the final line lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a survivor uses trauma responses to navigate an ultraviolet forest to derive a “mathematics of mercy,” with a charged object’s meaning flipping at closure. Risks lyric/conceptual territory without losing pressure. The premise feels singular and internally coherent. Minor didactic notes prevent it from pushing into the rarefied 9+ tier.</comment>
