<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and coherent—he’s a ritual gardener translating birds to re‑seed a scarred place—but internal contradiction is light. The weight of ancestors versus the serenity of his task registers, yet he faces little on‑page resistance. His micro‑choices (which pod to release, when to scatter) are specific and aligned with his role. The final relief (“the weight of his ancestors lift”) lands but with modest cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → decoding → releasing → sprouting builds toward a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the outset (coachman on a jetty after reef death). Closure arrives in the sealing whisper and the reweighted image of the jetty as a “thin ribbon of hope.” Cost is present conceptually—the reef’s irrevocable loss—though it remains soft rather than biting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The jetty, surf, phosphorescence, birds, and wind are vivid and purpose‑tied; the environment constrains tactics (bird calls, wind‑scatter) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is lush and filtered through the ritual task. World rules are learned through action (calls map to pods). It’s immersive without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—rekindling life with accuracy and reverence—but escalation is gentle. The warbler’s C‑sharp and the gull’s answering trill are the closest to turns; sprouts appearing provide the beat of payoff. The cost lens is contemplative, not hard‑edged; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond the acceptance that the reef won’t return. Effective for a lyric mode, but tension never tightens past serenity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Renewal through translation and concord emerges organically from concrete acts rather than thesis statements. Recurring images (reef/battlefield → garden; language/birdsong → seed) reweight by the ending, which resists pat moralizing by acknowledging an unhealed wound. The “narrow vastness” motif meaningfully refracts the paradox of scope and intimacy. A hint of sentiment creeps in, but it’s largely earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely held voice is consistent and assured; diction fits the mythic‑ritual frame. Rhythmic control supports the accumulative build, with well‑placed cadences at key beats. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. A few elevated phrasings edge toward purple, but not enough to break the spell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are musical and image‑rich with good information density; most sentences carry more than one job. Some repetition (“narrow vastness,” “garden,” “whispered/whispering”) and stacked modifiers flirt with overwriting. Momentum holds, but a trim could heighten pressure. Final image is clear and not dulled by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—dead languages decoded via birds to unlock ancestral seed pods on a post‑war jetty after reef death—is striking and memorable. Tactics flow from the premise rather than generic magic; the method feels fresh. The piece takes a stylistic risk in quiet, ritual cadence and largely pulls it off. It stops short of a transformative shock, but the vision is singular.</comment>
