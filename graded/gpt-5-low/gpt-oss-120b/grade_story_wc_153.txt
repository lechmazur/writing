<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent desire (to find the moment before deciding) and embodied ritual choices give her agency, but internal contradiction is muted; the conflict leans contemplative more than pressured. “Fierce tenderness” recurs and partially individualizes her, yet micro-choices under stress are limited. The surrender—letting the unsent letters speak—lands, though its felt cost is soft. Overall, credible interiority with modest ambiguity, not fully crucible‑tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: pane → lagoon/veil escalates coherently to a charged reconfiguration. Closure is on‑page as the apology migrates from condensation to soil and the weight dissolves; the price is the relinquishment of withheld speech. Setups (shard, spirits, condensation) pay off without causality breaks. Orientation is clean and the single dominant stake stays legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful environment: mangrove labyrinth, spirits, glass, and lagoon shape options and tactics (guidance, chorus-weaving, condensation surfaces). The shard functions as micro‑setting/tool, charging the final image (golden at dawn). Sensory texture is balanced and filtered through aim. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Internal stakes escalate via density and ritual amplification (spirits’ volume, larger window, water‑veil), culminating in her allowing the letters to speak. The breeze scattering the apology provides a useful complication re‑woven by spirits. The price is largely emotional and conceptual; no hard trade‑off is confronted beyond release. The tightening is sufficient but not bracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of apology, release, and truth-through-gesture accrue through recurring images and resolve in a resonant reweighting (the apology lives beyond words). The explicit line “she understood the apology had never needed words” edges into telling, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the spirits-root weave and fireflies offer strong, earned images. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with coherent distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Refrains (“fierce tenderness,” “condensation”) create pattern without major opacity. Minor repetition risks monotony but cadence generally fits the accumulative mode. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line work is largely clean and musical, with images doing multiple jobs. Some paraphrase and motif repetition (“ready to receive messages...,” “fierce tenderness”) nudge toward redundancy and mild purple density. Momentum holds and syntax varies; closures are clear. No figurative muddle at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a gargoyle rainspout shard, condensation‑script, and mangrove spirits feel distinctive and integrated. Turns grow from established pattern rather than a late rule. Emotional truth (release over articulation) reads organic. Not radically risky, but the imagery and method are memorable and coherent.</comment>
