<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single‑POV interiority is coherent and specific—his patience, tactile decoding, and ritual use of the fulgurite reveal character through action. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or real internal friction; he’s serene and competent from start to finish. Micro‑choices (kneeling to decode, using the glass, promising a vigil) align with motive but rarely test him. The enduring stance at the end reads earned, if low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: knot‑reading → fulgurite activation → vow/vigil is a clear progression toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean early, and the fulgurite’s warming and vapor act as an on‑page pivot. Cost is present conceptually (accepting the weight of centuries and a future of listening), though not sharply dramatized. The final sign of the master weaver reweights stakes without breaking the quiet form.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vividly embodied (frosted rope, golden dock under snow, thickening fog), filtered through the collector’s attentional bias. Environment and objects constrain choices: cold, wet fibers, and fog shape pace and method, while rope and fulgurite charge the final images. The kelp‑lined chest and harbor hush feel specific rather than generic mood paint. The final veil/fog reprise meaningfully charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain intimate—preserving methods through attentional endurance—and the main tightening is the fulgurite activating and the vow to keep vigil. Pressure builds texturally rather than via reversal, consistent with the lens, but there’s limited sense of risk or foreclosed alternatives. The “weight of centuries” lands as cost, yet it’s gentle and mostly conceptual. Still, the choice to become a daily custodian marks an earned trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation through patience and listening arises organically from knots/rope/fulgurite rituals and the quiet vow. A line like “He understood that preserving the ancient methods required not only memory but the willingness to listen eternally” edges toward telling, but it is supported by concrete acts. The fishermen’s offerings deepen communal resonance without sermonizing. The final readiness sign (master weaver’s spiral) reweights the earlier images with renewal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is steady, tactile, and plausibly bound to the focalizer’s sensibility; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm varies with soft cadences that suit the hush; diction is elevated but consistent. No dialogue is needed here, and compression is controlled. Occasional lushness skirts purple but stays legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and largely economical; lines often do multiple jobs. There’s mild repetition (fog/hush/snow) and a few stacked metaphors, but they support pattern rather than muddle it. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the central decoding beat and activation. Final images are clear and unencumbered by scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of seed lore, knot‑work coding, and fulgurite breath feels fresh and specific. The dock‑fog ritualism and fishermen’s silent offerings avoid tropey beats and build a distinctive micro‑myth. Risks are taken in committing to a quiet, accumulative closure that privileges attentional cost over event. The synthesis reads memorable and coherent.</comment>
