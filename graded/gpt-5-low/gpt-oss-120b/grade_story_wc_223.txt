<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—to unbind silence and chronicle erased small acts—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (the walking patterns, retrieving and placing the scroll). The paradox of ex–crisis actor turned survivor gives her texture without over-explaining. Interiority is mediated through the narrator, so her contradictions are felt but not deeply contested on the page. The cost is present as a “weight on her shoulders,” though it remains understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern walking → mechanism click → scroll → second pattern (“heal”) → charged exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts the charge and exports memory beyond the gallery, with a conceptual cost stated and felt. Orientation is clean early (gallery, chessboard, interregnum), and causal micro-links are legible. The price is quiet rather than acute, but present in her acceptance of duty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery, dusted stone, and mirrored chessboard are vivid and functional: the environment enables the lettered footsteps and hides the scroll. Recurring objects (board, scroll, shadow) charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and in-voice, with echoes and light working thematically. Minor cap from not quite constraining a hard choice beyond enabling the method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on rescuing small gestures from oblivion; escalation is a density increase (ritual leads to discovery, then to healing intent). The click/compartment is the meaningful turn; the second pattern deepens rather than reverses. Cost is primarily conceptual and vocational rather than peril-based. Pressure coheres but never pinches painfully, keeping intensity in the strong-but-quiet band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Memory vs. oblivion and the ethics of attention are embodied in missing pawns and the nomadic penumbra. The ending reweights the motif of absence into a guiding principle without overt moralizing. A few sentences edge toward expository theme (“she realized that by chronicling…”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the closing image resonates and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric, confident voice with controlled rhythms and a consistent focal stance; the first-person observer frames Mira without head-hopping. Diction is cohesive and avoids register drift. The prose modulates with intent through ritual cadence. No dialogue, but the narrative’s music carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elegant lines with purposeful imagery (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”) and good sentence variety. A couple of repeated phrases (“benevolently ruthless”) flirt with self-consciousness yet remain thematically consistent. No major loops or figurative muddle; density serves momentum. The lyricism is lush but mostly precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—missing pawns as erased gestures, a ritual of walking, and a sentient-feeling penumbra—feels fresh and coherent. Risks in concept and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. The mechanical reveal via the chessboard is a familiar device but innovated by the method and tone. Emotional truth anchors the novelty.</comment>
