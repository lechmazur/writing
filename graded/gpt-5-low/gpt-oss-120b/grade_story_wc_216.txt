<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to “understand the texture of time”—is clear and consistent, and her actions (scouring the ledger, unearthing the hourglass, fitting the urn) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; she encounters little resistance and registers few contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied perception is strong (“minutes stretching like thin silk”), but the arc edges toward serene competency rather than hard-won change. The villagers’ presence doesn’t add interpersonal pressure, so the crucible stays internal and relatively gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the reunited capsule/urn reweights time so clocks count “the weight of decisions,” with the valley in charged poise. Setups (garage-sale ciphers, damaged capsule) pay off cleanly through Mara’s choices; causality is coherent and pattern-taught. Cost is primarily conceptual/social rather than personal, limiting peak impact but still legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The emerald silo and time-thread map are vivid and integrated; the silo’s function as an “antenna” charges the final image and shapes outcome. Details are purposeful and filtered through Mara’s aims, with tactile actions (dust-brushing, fitting the fragment) anchoring the lyricism. World rules (numbers changing meaning) stay consistent and are learned through action. The atmosphere supports the theme without sliding into decorative postcards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled (rediscover before “the last grain of sand”), and escalation proceeds via density: ledger → cipher → hourglass → reassembly → activation. Tension tightens once (the urn clicks and the system lights), but the path offers little resistance or price beyond conceptual reweighting. Agency is present and resolves the problem, though the lack of a visible loss or trade-off keeps pressure moderate. The result feels earned yet soft-edged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Time as memory and communal repair emerges organically through the garage-sale lattice and the reconfigured clocks. The final images (silver sand constellations; notes forming a story lattice) resonate without overt moralizing, though one line (“time… could be mended by shared recollection”) edges toward thesis statement. The insight is earned via specific actions and objects rather than abstract commentary. Ambiguity lingers productively about cost and future consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“numbers changed meaning,” “liquid glass”) that stays consistent. POV remains tight to Mara without head-hopping, and elisions serve pattern and mood. Diction suits the conceit and modulates with discovery; no dialogue is needed for propulsion here. Narrative certainty matches what she can infer in the moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong image economy; most lines do more than one job. Figurative density is high but largely coherent and pattern-consistent; a few lush phrases flirt with purple yet don’t obscure causality. Rhythm varies and momentum holds through the key beats without scaffold or loops. Final images land clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—garage-sale ciphers, an emerald silo as temporal antenna, numbers redefined—feels fresh and purposeful rather than quirky for its own sake. Turns grow from established particulars and reconfigure meaning at the end. The piece takes stylistic risks in a controlled lyric mode that heightens stakes without confusion. Emotional truth skews conceptual but distinctive enough to be memorable.</comment>
