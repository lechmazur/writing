<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marin’s desire to thaw her numbness is concrete and embodied through touch and vibration, and her choices (reversing, then forcing the songs forward) align with that motive. Interiority is present and image‑driven, though contradictory impulses are muted—she rarely hesitates, so struggle reads more lyrical than pressured. The change at the end feels earned by the tactile engagement with silence. The personal cost is felt but soft, more thaw than wound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: a taught pattern of reversed songs → mirrored hush → forward play yields a clear reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the closure occurs on the page as the filament brightens with her revived heartbeat. Cost is subtle but legible in the pressure of confronting silence and stretching the filament. The final seasonal return pays off the pattern without breaking scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern’s damp, sound‑swallowing air and petrified drum‑skin turntable are specific and rule‑setting, forcing tactile/mirrored strategies instead of hearing. The “filament of hush” functions as a micro‑setting object that charges choices and the last image. Details are purposeful and filtered through Marin’s sensing body. The environment constrains and then amplifies the final transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are singular (defeat numbness) and pressure coheres as the mirrored hush becomes a counterforce Marin must face, culminating when she switches from backward to forward play. Escalation is a density/cadence shift rather than a hard reversal, appropriate to the lens. The on‑page price—inducing pressure that “stretches” the filament—lands, though it’s more inward than risky. A slightly sharper tactical trade‑off would raise urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Symbols (needle, filament, mirrored hush) evolve meaningfully, and the ending reweights the premise through a charged image. However, a couple of declarative moral lines (“proved that… the heart can still compose a symphony of feeling”) edge toward stated theme and soften subtext. Most resonance arises from particulars rather than sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on silence as medium rather than void.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric voice is cohesive, tactile, and modulates with pressure; diction feels consistent with a sensory‑driven focalizer. Patterned phrasing (hush, mirrored, filament) is taught and purposeful. No dialogue to test, but the narrative stance remains steady and confident. Rhythm mostly avoids monotony despite density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid and largely coherent; sentences carry multiple jobs (world rule + emotion). There is some overrichness and light redundancy in the closing moralizing and recurring metaphors, but clarity holds and momentum continues. Syntax varies and line rhythm supports the accumulative swell. Minor trims could heighten pressure further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a deaf music teacher, a drum maker’s cavern that eats sound, backward/forward wax songs, and a “filament of hush” feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The object ecology meaningfully shapes tactics and closure. Risk‑taking in conceit and diction pays off without obscuring sense. The emotional truth reads specific rather than templated.</comment>
