<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tutor’s motive—repair the eclipsed covenant by translating cosmic silence into chess—reads clear and character‑particular. Interiority is embodied through tactile beats (the warming, humming stone) and the chess‑sky mapping. Contradictory impulses (shame of exile vs. hope for renewal) are present but lightly contested rather than forcefully in conflict. The final stance shift feels earned, though the on‑page cost remains primarily emotional and subdued.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pulses → listening → phrase spoken → sky’s sliver → rook placed, reweighting the covenant as “paused conversation.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (accepting exile and sorrow as compass) more than a concrete one. Orientation is solid from the outset; pattern teaching is consistent. The cost signal at the end is felt but not sharply escalated, keeping the ceiling below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus and basalt stone are vivid and integral; their properties (pulses, hum, glow) guide perception and tactics. Spatial and atmospheric cues stay coherent and purpose‑driven, culminating in the sliver of light and the stone’s glow charging the final image. Sensory selection aligns with the tutor’s professional bias (board/sky correlations) without tourist cataloging. The environment actively participates in the outcome rather than serving as postcard backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled (“before the next phase,” repair the covenant), and the pressure coheres as density rather than direct confrontation. The key tightening is the tutor’s decision to speak the phrase and align pieces with stars, which deepens options rather than foreclosing them. Prices paid are conceptual (acceptance of sorrow, exile’s weight) rather than visibly narrowing choices. Escalation is graceful but gentle, limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of finding beauty in difficulty and reframing eclipse as pause emerge organically from recurring actions and images (silence→moves, sacrifice motifs, rook at the edge). The final redefinition of “covenant” reweights prior material without sermonizing. A few lines flirt with overt thesis, but the concrete chess‑cosmos choreography carries the meaning. The emotional aftertaste—hopeful melancholy—lingers credibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady, lyrical, and coherent with the tutor’s mind and craft; diction and rhythm are controlled. The single spoken phrase functions as action, not exposition. No head‑hopping or stance leakage occurs, and the compressive lyric mode is taught early and paid off. Minor grandeur in register occasionally brushes purple but remains voice‑justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are polished and image‑dense, often doing multiple jobs (world‑rule, emotion, theme). Some repetition and intensifier echoes (“hopeful melancholy,” “basalt worry stone dent”) create small loops that could tighten. Figurative threads stay consistent (chess/sky/eclipse) with minimal muddle. Rhythm is varied and propulsive enough for the mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Chess pedagogy fused with a magnetic nexus and a cosmological covenant feels fresh and internally coherent. The rook‑edge placement and “paused conversation” reframing are distinctive turns earned by prior particulars. Risks in tone and structure serve the concept without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template resolutions and sustains a singular vision.</comment>
