<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The Keeper’s motive—preserving the echo of wisdom—drives discernible choices (consecration, listening, explaining, departing). Interiority is present but remains stylized rather than deeply conflicted, with little on‑page contradiction under pressure. The prophet and villagers apply only soft pressure, so relational dynamics never truly test him. The ending renunciation/devotion reads credible, if low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: prophet’s arrival → consecration → conjured clearing → teaching → explanation → departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts an ongoing role to carry the echo across the dunes. The cost is implied (endless service, solitude), not sharply dramatized, limiting impact. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and sand‑sea are vivid and sensorially specific, integrated into action (conjuring, settling). Environment shapes options: the parapet enables the clearing and then withdraws it, charging the final image of itinerancy. Details are purpose‑driven and filtered through the Keeper’s attentional style. World rules feel consistent within the fable‑lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely conceptual (preserving wisdom’s echo), with minimal counterforce or risk; pressure deepens once at the prophet’s arrival but never tightens into a trade‑off. The conjuring is smooth and uncontested, and the villagers’ inquiry resolves without friction. The final choice to depart is earned but not costly on the page. As a result, escalation feels gentle rather than gripping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of attention, consecration, and listening as sanctuary are coherent and seeded through concrete images (peripheral awareness, the clearing). However, explicit statements (“the true sanctuary lived not in stone or sand”) slide toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The final star‑pattern image resonates but does not fully reweight prior material with a new tension. Ambiguity exists, but complexity is cushioned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to “peripheral awareness” and hush. Rhythmic control is strong, with measured cadences matching the “whisperfield calm.” Distance remains consistent; no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated diction skirts purple but stays coherent with the mythic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and musical, with high information density and purposeful imagery (pillars humming, parapet shimmering). There is some repetition and lushness that edges toward over‑ornament (“echo of wisdom,” “whisperfield calm”), slightly slowing momentum. Syntax varies and clarity holds; no major loops or scaffold. The final image lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fusion of desert mysticism with a kinetic parapet and “peripheral awareness” as operative method feels fresh. The spiritual‑ritual frame risks abstraction but is grounded by tactile mechanics (boots on shifting sand, dome of shade). The turn from conjured oasis to itinerant duty gives a modest but novel reconfiguration. Not radical, yet confidently singular.</comment>
