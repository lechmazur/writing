<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear and consistent—decoding the ghost’s secret—and her actions align (tracing patterns, choosing to play a sustained note). Interiority feels embodied through tactile attention to water, wood, and vellum rather than labels. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she meets little inner resistance beyond reverent awe, so the final stance costs her less than it could. The character changes via understanding rather than a tough trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration shifting from “notes” to “silences” as the code, with a cadence shift when the lanterns steady and the program dries. Orientation is clean early (flooded opera house, violinist in pit, antique program) and the throughline stays coherent. The causal chain is lyrical but legible: patterns → alignment → sustained note → revelation → final chord. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional—risk to calm and instrument—credible but not heavy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and flickering lanterns are vivid and integral; water damage becomes functional “staff lines” that guide choice. The violin, swollen from humidity, constrains action and stakes. Environmental details evolve with events (ripples respond; lanterns steady), recharging the ending image. Strong POV-filtered specificity without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking the ghost’s code—tightens when watery lines align with marginalia and demand a single sustained note, a decisive deepening. The escalation is quiet but coherent: observation → test note → image shift → final chord. The price remains soft (risking the fragile instrument and disturbing the hush), so tension doesn’t crest at a sharply felt loss. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of “in‑between spaces” and silence as meaning arises organically through water, gaps in marginalia, and the sustained note reweighting sound vs. quiet. The ending answers the thematic question without moralizing: the house “breathing again,” lanterns steady, and pages dry. Subtext holds—wordless exchange with the ghost—avoiding platitudes. Slight tidiness in the ghost’s satisfaction softens complexity but not fatally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyrical close third maintains a stable, tactile perceptual signature keyed to sound and moisture. Rhythmic control suits the accumulative design, with modulated sentences at peak beats (the sustained note, the final chord). No head‑hopping or stance slips. Some diction repetition (“trembling,” “whispered”) edges toward sameness but doesn’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is sensuous and mostly efficient; images carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, plot cues). Minor redundancy and adjective echo (“trembling” lanterns, reiterated water/light textures) create slight purple creep. Momentum holds; sentences vary and closure image is clear. A bit less overlay would sharpen pressure without losing music.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The conceit—water damage forming staff lines that unlock a silence‑based aria—is fresh and integrated. The ghostly collaboration through “in‑between” spaces elevates the premise beyond a standard haunted theater. Risks are lyrical and conceptual rather than structural, but they pay off in a memorable final reconfiguration. A slightly sharper cost or unexpected counter‑pressure could push it higher.</comment>
