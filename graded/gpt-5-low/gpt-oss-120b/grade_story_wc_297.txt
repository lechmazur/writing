<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear desire and agency (she seeks and activates the covenant), with embodied affect (“anxious elation”) and tactile choices (palm to hedge, taking the clipping). Internal contradiction and felt cost are light; she meets little resistance and rarely wrestles with competing impulses. The “binding to every forgotten covenant” hints at burden but isn’t dramatized as a price. Competent, coherent, but low on struggle-driven revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens fits: ritual steps (heed stones → touch scars → vision → key → chant → portal → beacon) cohere and culminate in an on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration—the beacon ignites; she becomes “the bridge.” Cost is mostly conceptual (inheritance of covenants) and could read softer than ideal, but sequence and stakes remain intelligible. Orientation (who/where/when) is early and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective setting work (“cobalt glade,” “rain‑kissed pine,” “moon metal”) integrates with action and the final image (glade painted in hopeful cobalt). The maze and hedges function as environment-as-tool: they part, reveal the alcove, and heal at the end. World rules are learned through ritualized action rather than exposition. Strong atmosphere supports theme without becoming postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (unlock and fuse dreams to guide her people) and escalates via ritual milestones. Pressure is coherent but soft—no credible resistance or trade‑off beyond a conceptual burden, so options never feel narrowed by cost. The tightening occurs when the portal opens and she chooses to step through, but the path is relatively frictionless. Earned, but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—binding dream to duty; healing historical “scars”—emerges through repeated images and the closing reconfiguration. A few lines state the thesis outright (“not a contract of power, but a promise...”), muting subtext. Still, the hedge scars fading and the beacon tied to heartbeat offer resonant images. The ending invites reflection without moralizing, though ambiguity is modest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close-third voice with controlled cadence and image palette; no head-hopping or stance slips. Diction matches the visionary’s sensibility and maintains coherence under crescendo moments (chant, portal, beacon). A touch of purple overuse is present but largely serves the mode. No dialogue to test, but internal texture remains steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>High image density with generally clean syntax and momentum; most lines do multiple jobs (world, mood, action). Occasional overwriting and near-synonym echoes (“anxious elation,” “hopeful cobalt”) risk saturation but do not obscure causality. Figurative coherence holds, and the final image is clear. Some redundancy could be tightened for sharper propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—“eclipsed covenant,” hedge scars as memory map, moon‑metal clipping as key/beacon—feels fresh and unified. The ritual quest arc is familiar, but the execution and imagery distinguish it. The final reweighting (she becomes the bridge) lands as a clear, specific stance. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural and largely pays off.</comment>
