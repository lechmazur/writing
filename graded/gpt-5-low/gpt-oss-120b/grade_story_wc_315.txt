<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation—preserve trust despite the “watcher’s burden”—is enacted through concrete micro-choices (climbing higher, revising the harness, descending). Embodied detail (knot‑work, the buckle’s bite) grounds emotion. Internal contradiction is light; he’s highly competent with little visible falter, so struggle costs read muted. The grief echo via the fallen skyfarer adds depth but stops short of a sharper, in‑scene conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via storm, lost transmission, ascent, repair, and the “Hold fast” reply that reweights the work. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—renewed purpose under cost rather than a decisive external change. Orientation is solid early, and the single scene coheres. Cost is present but subtle (ongoing burden rather than a priced tradeoff).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canopy “above the clouds,” wind, vines, and buckle integrate with action; environment constrains tactics (climbing, harvesting vines) and charges the final image. Sensory texture is rich and consistently filtered through the seeker’s craft‑mind. The world’s rules stay coherent within the lyrical mode. A strong object‑as‑setting interplay (buckle) deepens the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: keep trust intact under storm pressure. Tightening arrives when he chooses to climb higher to revise the harness after transmission failure; the radio’s late “Hold fast” reweights the effort. The felt price is mainly ongoing duty and exposure rather than a specific sacrifice on the page. Escalation is modest but coherent for the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Recurrences (buckle, silence/static, revision) braid into a theme of trust maintained through careful, iterative labor under pressure. The final stance—a quiet recommitment—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. “Silence as dialogue” and the fallen skyfarer infuse subtext. Slight neatness in the closing gratitude softens complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A stable, lyrical third‑person closely held to the seeker sustains a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm suit the contemplative, craft‑focused mind. No head‑hopping; elisions are purposeful. Occasional repetition (“soundless echo”) borders on self‑echo but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with strong imagery and clean syntax; momentum generally holds. Some figurative density and repeated motifs verge on purple, slightly bloating a few lines. Information density is good and transitions are clear. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “nocturnal arbor above the clouds” with a craft‑minded watcher and a parachute buckle as reliquary is a fresh synthesis. Turns feel inevitable within the piece’s logic; revision as salvation is non‑obvious yet apt. Risk lies in the quiet, accumulative form, which the story sustains. Minor familiarity in a few abstractions (“burden,” “hope”) tempers the edge.</comment>
