<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation (drawn to “regenerative silence”) and a credible renunciation at the end (reaffirming witness over change) give him a spine. The tactile micro‑choices—unfolding the swan, entering the refuge, writing one line—align with his role. Internal contradiction (yearning for renewal vs. vow to witness) is present but remains largely thematic rather than embodied in moment‑by‑moment duress. Emotional texture is evocative but sometimes abstract, softening the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through the descent, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration as he accepts his function. Orientation is strong from the outset (catacombs, keeper, library). Closure lands on the page: he enters the refuge, dissolves, writes the line, and returns with a changed stance. The cost is felt conceptually (eroded thought, fleeting peace) rather than dramatized as a concrete loss, but it is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is lush and purposeful: the library’s vines, tunnels, and river guide and constrain movement; the origami’s glow interacts with space. The obsidian refuge and the catacomb geography charge the final image. Sensory detail is varied (scent of damp parchment, phosphorescent thread) and filtered through the keeper’s vocation. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around whether he will seek transformation or hold to witnessing; pressure tightens as the silence grows “louder” and the fissures narrow. His agency drives the deepening: choosing to burrow, to enter, and to record only a single line. The price—thought dissolution and a fragile, “crumbling peace”—reads, though the threat never becomes perilous beyond the lyric register. One meaningful tightening is achieved at the refuge threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Images—river hymn, origami compass, obsidian refuge—carry the theme of renewal through silence with a strong final reweighting (acceptance of witness). However, the explicit thesis “silence births renewal” states what the images already earned, flattening resonance. Subtext otherwise operates well through tactile ritual and return. The piece invites reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and suitably close to the keeper’s sensibility; diction and rhythm hold under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance drift; purposeful elision is taught and sustained. Occasional repeated formulations (“regenerative silence”) risk mantra more than texture but do not break control. The perceptual signature—book‑pulse, fold‑as‑syllable—feels character‑particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: images do double duty, sentences vary, and transitions are fluid. There is mild purple tilt and a few reiterated phrases, but momentum remains intact. Figurative logic holds (folds as map, silence as hum) without mixed metaphors. The final cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Origami as chant‑map, a refuge that feeds on silence, and a librarian‑witness create a distinctive synthesis. Risks are coherent and not gimmicky; the implications of the premise are followed through the descent and return. Emotional truth (renewal through renunciation) feels earned. Slight familiarity in the “library of forgotten knowledge” trope is offset by fresh execution.</comment>
