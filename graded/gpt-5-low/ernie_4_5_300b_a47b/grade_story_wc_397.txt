<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s motives and contradictions are vivid: an euthanasia tourist seeking numbness who nevertheless lunges into a rescue. The parasol tip choice under pressure reveals character without speechifying. Embodied details (cold seeping, grip tightening) ground her detachment. The final “flicker of peace” feels earned, though the cost remains mostly internal and modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean orientation and a tight causal line: keening → fissure → parasol hook → rescue → quiet reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant repricing (her idea of patience shifts to timely action) with a felt, if quiet, cost. Stakes are coherent and scaled to length; no stray threads. Cost is subtle rather than hard, keeping it shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is tactile and constraining—the fissure, blue glow, cold, and tools shape tactics and risk. The heirloom tip functions as micro-setting-tool, charging the final image. Sensory balance and concrete geography avoid postcard description. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant pressure crystallizes with the keening and the decision not to wait for ropes; that choice narrows options and risks harm. Internal and external stakes braid (death-seeking vs. life-saving). The cost reads more as inner reorientation than a concrete sacrifice, which tempers peak intensity. Still, escalation is coherent under a situational lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Endings, patience, and fragile attachments accrue through particulars (the marina, keening, heirloom tip) rather than thesis. The line redefining “the fold in patience” edges toward explicit but is earned by the rescue. The final wind-and-ice image delivers quiet resonance without moralizing. Subtext (clinging to delicate relics while seeking oblivion) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, coolly lyric third-person close follows Lila’s perceptual signature (listening for endings, framing numbness as “changed”). Diction fits her sensibility without register slips; dialogue is sparse and natural. Rhythm modulates well at the discovery and rescue beats. No head-hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lean, controlled lines with strong verbs and purposeful images; minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops. Figurative language (“wind through a cracked bell”) is apt and not overstacked. Syntax varies and supports momentum through the rescue. Closing cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blend of euthanasia tourism, drift-ice relief work, and an heirloom parasol tip as rescue tool feels fresh and specific. The keening-as-ending motif is distinctive and reweighted at the close. Risks are quiet but confident; nothing reads like template plotting. Only the soft cost keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
