<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael’s drive is clear and consistent—ex‑revolutionary turned archaeologist whose “poetic logic” dictates risky choices (covering mirrors, planting fungi). Interiority is specific (burnished sorrow, slow‑fuse motive) and aligns with tactile action around the shard. Internal contradiction exists but is muted; he rarely wavers or pays an intimate relational cost on the page. Secondary pressures (the Council) mostly act offstage, limiting crucible dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: plan → storm → vision/fungal proof → heresy → public doubt and reweighting of the shard. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (heretic status, institutional backlash) and a concrete final image. The “weeks” summary compresses conflict but maintains continuity and stakes. Drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal, held through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vespera Minor’s baroque architecture, cobalt time‑haze, and bioluminescent fungi are vivid and purpose‑driven. Environment and object constrain tactics (temporal storms; mirrors as conduits), and the shard charges the final image. Rule‑set is taught through action rather than dumped. Sensory selection feels character‑filtered and integrated with pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (expose the Luminari’s fraud) and tightens through the storm and Council retaliation. Kael’s agency drives the key turns; the heresy charge and mirror teardown escalate cost. The price is present and ongoing, though the mid‑piece montage softens immediate jeopardy. Still, one meaningful deepening and a visible narrowing of options land.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and the danger of reflection are embedded in images (mirrors, fungi as archive, palimpsest). The shard’s reweighting and the public’s awakening produce earned resonance. A few lines verge on thesis statement (“They buried it”; “what mirrors hide”), trimming subtlety slightly. Overall, the thematic arc feels organic to the actions and stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled and coherent with Kael’s sensibility; diction and rhythm support the speculative texture without drifting into abstraction. Limited dialogue is purposeful and charged. Psychic distance stays stable in a close third, with clear focalization. Elevated register matches the world’s baroque atmosphere and the protagonist’s poetic tilt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly disciplined; key metaphors recur with intent (cobalt haze, mirrors, fungi, shard). Minor purple edges appear but do not blur sense or momentum. Information density stays high without scaffold or loops. Cadence varies well between scene and compressed summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Time made visible, mirror‑occlusion during temporal storms, and fungal DNA archives feel freshly synthesized. The Council of Echoes vs. bioluminescent pre‑culture reframes genre tropes with specificity. The shard as micro‑archive and the fungus‑bloom proof are elegant, character‑driven turns. Risks cohere without gimmickry, culminating in a distinctive final stance.</comment>
