<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are clear and embodied—her “mild obsession” and tactile mapping of silence drive every action. Internal contradiction is light; doubt or competing impulse barely surfaces beyond fatigue and environmental pressure. Micro‑choices (pausing to listen after the gust, choosing “a final flourish”) reveal values but with limited cost. The earned stance at the end (embracing the void) feels credible if emotionally low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hushes and image patterning tighten toward the last star’s extinction. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she draws by absence; fear yields to charged poise as darkness falls and the map glows. Orientation is clean from the opening. The cost is primarily conceptual and physical strain rather than a hard sacrifice, but it’s legible in the final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ridge fort and sea are vividly, selectively rendered and integrated into action (the lee of the archway, the walls groaning, pebbles skittering). The environment actively charges the final image as the map’s glow seeps into the fort’s cracks. Weather and architecture shape tactics and solitude, not just mood. A slight constraint (shelter, sentinels’ retreat) complements the lyric atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through a live clock (one star), deepening hush, and bodily cost (aching fingers), culminating as the star winks out. The tightening arises from her chosen method—each captured silence advances the spiral toward a poised end. Stakes are internal, so the price feels subtle rather than drastic. Still, the cadence shift at the end reweights options convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of absence/presence and mapping voids emerge organically via concrete silences (before a wave, after a thunderclap) and the glowing map. The final image provides a non‑literal answer: mastery arrives by embracing darkness rather than resisting it. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“silence could be both absence and presence”), but the piece mostly trusts image over thesis. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, single‑POV voice is controlled, with a distinct sensory bias and maritime lexicon that stays consistent. Rhythm modulates well, from hushed attentiveness to the glowing close. Minimal dialogue fits the mode and doesn’t intrude on tone. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush and precise; metaphors track and the syntax carries momentum. Occasional repetition of “hush”/“silence” and ornate epithets risk density creep but mostly serve pattern. No mixed vehicles or scaffold loops blunt the closure image. The line “ambered/marbled hush” variation flirts with purple yet remains legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Summarizing silences to map an “endless night” feels fresh and integrated with setting and action. The gold‑leaf booklet shedding as the map accrues is an original, charged detail. The ending’s reweighting (light via absence) is surprising yet inevitable. Risks in diction and concept pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
