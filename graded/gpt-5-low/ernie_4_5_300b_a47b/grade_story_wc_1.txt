<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single‑POV interiority is vivid and craft‑specific; her glassworker lens grounds feelings in tactile choices (frost, shard, crawl). Motivation is clear (purpose after survival) and actions align. The final renunciation reframes her practice with a modest, credible cost, though the insight skirts declaration. Contradictory impulses (hollowed survival vs. compelled seeing) play through, if quietly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: frost→crevice→shard→realization accrues into a Conceptual Repricing on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening; objects and environment link beats coherently. Closure lands via the choice to shift artistic purpose and teach, with a felt cost (abandoning prior mode). The causal chain of discoveries holds without convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is lush and functional: frost becomes both map and aesthetic logic; the crevice physically constrains tactics. The canyon’s cold, smoke, and light are filtered through a glass artist’s priorities, charging the final image. Details evolve with action (dawn, frost melting) rather than postcarding. The shard and frost reliably reappear to shape choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure is quiet but coherent: deciphering an ephemeral map before it vanishes, crawling a narrowing crevice, and confronting an identity pivot. The meaningful tightening is the chamber discovery that narrows her options to a values choice. Cost is present but subtle, more vocational than existential. No antagonist on page, but internal/external threads interweave effectively at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motifs (frost, fire, glass, “pauses”) mature into a resonant answer: meaning lives in the intervals and ephemeral traces. The Elias line mirrors her ache without overexplaining, though the sentence “Her purpose wasn’t to create objects…” edges toward thesis. Subtext rides imagery and craft rather than sermonizing, leaving a tangible afterglow. Complexity is maintained with a humane, non‑tidy acceptance of cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyric, and sensorially biased toward light, heat, and surface—credible for a glass artist. Psychic distance stays stable; no head‑hopping or artificial elision. Rhythm modulates with pressure (crawl tightness vs. open canyon). Elevated diction matches the aesthetic without drifting into alien register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense but purposeful; images carry more than one job (world, theme, plot). Minimal scaffold or loops; sentence variety keeps momentum. A few near‑purple moments flirt with overstatement but don’t blur sense. The final cadence resolves cleanly with charged objects.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Frost‑mapping as vanishing cartography filtered through a glass artist’s ethos is fresh and coherent. The smuggler‑as‑cartographer of hidden things reweights a familiar survival setup into an art/philosophy pivot. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off. The synthesis feels particular and memorable.</comment>
