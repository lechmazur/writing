<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (protect the key; uphold family legacy) are clear and drive concrete micro-choices under pressure. His contradiction—engineer of equations yet moved by the key’s “song”—is embodied in tactile beats (gloved hands on dials, knees buckling). The cost registers physically and ethically in the harmonizing choice rather than domination. Slight safety lies in how smoothly he calibrates to “sonic absolution” without more visible doubt or risk of error.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: key falters → Elias responds with resonator → ghost opposes → harmonization reframes power → stabilization and vigil. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the key as bridge) with a felt price (strain, renunciation of force, ongoing vigil). Orientation is crisp early, and the sunset clock and ice hum keep pressure present. The ghost’s turn is brisk but earned by the tactical pitch-match and redefinition of the key’s function.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, cold air, and lighthouse beam are vivid and functional; weather, light, and ice-borne vibration directly shape tactics and tone. The resonator and the key operate as charged objects that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection tracks a professional’s eye and a body under stress. No static postcarding; environment evolves with the conflict.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates coherently with the ghost’s assault and the deadline of fading light. The meaningful tightening is the pitch duel—he must risk matching, not repelling—which narrows options and exacts physical cost. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve it. The only slight softness is how quickly the ghost relents once the harmonization begins.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of harmony over force and “bridge” vs “weapon” emerge organically through action and reprise in the final vigil. Subtext lives in the sonic metaphor and family legacy without heavy exposition. However, the line “some battles were won not with force, but with harmony” states the moral overtly in the final paragraph, dulling the otherwise earned resonance. Without that explicitness, the ending’s image would carry more lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical yet disciplined register suited to a meticulous engineer moved by the numinous. Dialogue is spare, functional, and status-aware, with the ghost’s diction distinct and pressurized. Rhythm modulates well across action and calm, maintaining clarity. A few elevated turns (“logically emotional”) skim the edge of label, but the overall texture remains character-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong line control with purposeful images (“edges flickering like a broken film reel,” “horizon bled tangerine and lavender”). Minor familiar notes (“the marina seemed to hold its breath,” a brief thematic restatement) and light redundancy do appear, but they do not stall momentum. Syntax varies and propulsion is steady, with verbs doing work. Figurative language stays mostly coherent to the sonic/ice motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis—industrial acoustics as spiritual mediation at a polar marina—feels lived-in and specific. The “sonic absolution” concept refits a genre confrontation into a harmonization duel with credible stakes. Final reweighting (“bridge, not weapon”) grows from particulars rather than a grafted twist. Minor familiarity in the moral phrasing aside, the vision is distinct and confident.</comment>
