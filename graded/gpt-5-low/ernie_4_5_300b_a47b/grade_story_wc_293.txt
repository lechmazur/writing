<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (decode Marisol’s riddle, test the bridge‑song) are clear and consistent, and his skepticism tilting into belief reads earned. Interiority is particular (scent of resin/oil, noticing wind/shadows) and actions align with his musician’s identity. Internal contradiction exists but is light—curiosity vs. disbelief—so the final poised choice carries some charge but limited friction. The brief Marisol exchange hints at relationship stakes but arrives late and stays surface.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: find flake → infer code → play bridge‑song → activation → transition → charged poise ending. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the two‑shard structure is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise; the “choice” is on the page, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than concretely priced. That softness keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting and objects are vivid and purposeful: the pullout’s resin/oil atmosphere, the van, the mountains, and especially the fiddle and glass flake, which function as tools that alter reality. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true, and world rules are taught through action. The environment charges the mood more than it constrains tactics, but the object‑as‑setting (flake/fiddle) carries real weight into the final image. A slight cap because the landscape itself doesn’t force the decision.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent (will he use this to rewrite “never”), and escalation is protagonist‑driven through the performance. The vortex transport is a clear tightening beat; the final stance crystallizes pressure. However, concrete costs and foreclosed alternatives are mostly implied, keeping tension more lyrical than biting. No antagonist or counterforce tests his commitment beyond his own resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resonance emerges from particulars: music as agency over fate; memory/time as editable through art. The “pixelated amnesty” reframes choice at the end without moralizing, and the last poised raise of the fiddle offers a non‑literal answer. Some jargon‑tinged abstraction (“scaffold wrap flutters,” “amnesty”) skews conceptual over human cost, slightly blunting the ache. Still, the pattern of images coheres and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held voice with a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm fit the character and modulate under pressure (from noticing textures to whirlwind cadence). No head‑hopping, and the brief dialogue reads clean. Occasional coined phrases flirt with register drift but remain anchored by the POV’s sensory logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete nouns, and purposeful sentence variety keep momentum. Figurative language generally lands and doubles duty; few redundancies. A couple of metaphoric clusters (“pixelated pattern pulsed,” “kaleidoscope of colors”) risk mild purple, but they don’t obscure action or closure. Clean mechanics and clear sequencing throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: folk ritual (bridge‑song), analog photography (collodion flake), and a techno‑mythic concept (“pixelated amnesty”) feel organically fused. The transport beat and the final “choice” reweight earlier images in a non‑obvious way. The risk is aesthetic—leaning into lyric mysticism without over‑explaining—largely successful. Slight deduction for abstracted cost and a few familiar lyric notes.</comment>
