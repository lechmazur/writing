<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lirael’s motive (restore a fractured faith) is clear and rooted in her temperament: warmly curious yet cautious, skeptical yet devoted. Her micro‑choices—entering the tomb, placing the base, continuing the patient rebuild—reveal character. Internal tension (belief vs. wariness) is present but lightly pressured; she rarely faces a hard counterforce that tests her limits. The final choice to “follow” is earned, though the felt cost is modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → placement → patient rebuild → activation → stance crystallization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she embraces faith as choice), with on‑page image (glow, villagers arriving). Causality is coherent, though the cost is more implied (time, surrender) than dramatized. Orientation is clear early, and the single arc remains tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard‑catacomb with bones and listening roots is vivid and tactically relevant, shaping access, discovery, and the final image. The sundial chamber’s noon aperture and root behavior constrain choices and charge the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lirael’s bias. World rules emerge through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are legible (can she re‑ignite communal faith and her own) and tighten with the tomb find and the sundial’s activation. Escalation is primarily atmospheric and spiritual; there’s little pushback beyond eerie roots and patience. The harmonic tone and pulsing walls provide a decisive intensification that forces a stance. The price is present but underplayed, keeping tension strong but not peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of diaspora, memory, and faith as voluntary practice emerge through concrete rites and labor, not sermonizing. The line reframing faith “as a choice, a thread” risks explicitness but is supported by earned image work. The ending’s “It’s not finished, but it’s enough” offers a resonant, provisional ethic that reweights the rebuild. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent close third with lyrical restraint; diction and rhythm fit Lirael’s sensibility. Perceptual signature favors earth, roots, bones, and sky‑logic, deepening mood without head‑hopping. Modulation at activation is controlled and apt. No withheld‑knowledge gimmicks or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and purposeful, with minimal scaffolding and no figurative muddle. Sentences vary in cadence, sustaining momentum through descriptive passages. Minor lyric familiarity appears but does not loop or blur sense. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and “listening roots” give a fresh inflection to a shrine‑restoration premise. The diasporic return framed through patient ritual and object‑alignment feels specific. The shape is not radical, but synthesis is thoughtful and coherent. A bolder on‑page cost or counterforce could elevate distinctiveness.</comment>
