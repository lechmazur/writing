<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to quell a fear‑storm by reconstituting empathy—is coherent and tracked through embodied choices (ascending to the attic, walking the mirrors, deploying the shard). Her competence is compelling, but internal contradiction is light; doubt or misgiving barely surfaces, so cost feels muted. The “shadow‑laced peacekeeper” texture reads specific, not a stock label. Peak‑moment emotions are earned but not deeply torn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—images via mirrors build to a cadence shift where the shard’s glow calms the ice. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands on the page with a legible before/after. The cost is primarily empathetic burden, implied rather than dramatized, which softens the punch. Still, the sequence coheres and pays off the set‑ups (mirror method → orchard deployment).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and aurora are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environment bears on action (storm pressure, attic mirrors, return to orchard) and charges the final image (ice stilled, aurora brightened). While it doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, it meaningfully frames and energizes them. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet the fear‑storm) is signaled early and escalates through a clear deepening (mirror sequence to “weighted breath before reply”). Resolution stems from her agency, but there’s little visible price or foreclosed option beyond carrying others’ pain. The conflict resolves smoothly once the ritual is complete, limiting felt jeopardy. Tension lives in cadence more than consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of empathy as counterforce to collective fear emerge through specific images (sailor, mother, lover) and the reweighted shard. However, the final sentence explicitly states the moral (“courage wasn’t in the absence of fear…”) which flattens resonance. Subtext exists in the mirrors’ lived fragments but is partially overwritten by explication. The piece invites reflection but leans tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elara sustains mood and perception without leakage. Diction matches the world’s slightly numinous register; rhythm modulates well. A few familiar turns of phrase surface, but the voice generally feels particular and assured. No dialogue is needed for this mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sensory, and momentum‑aware; images often carry double duty (mirrors as device and theme). Mild purple notes and occasional familiar constructions (“silence felt like a language,” “weave calm into chaos”) reduce freshness. No significant loops or cadence templates dull the peak beat. The final image is clear and unfussy on the line level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse orchard, auroral patina, empathy reconstitution via salvaged mirrors—feels distinctive. The ritual’s logic is coherent and not a genre retread. The closing “heart to the storm” concept, while elegant, lands near a familiar aphorism. Overall, the world‑premise blend shows fresh imagination without gimmickry.</comment>
