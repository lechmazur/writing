<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor’s control impulse versus curiosity is legible and embodied in the withheld hand at the hellebore. Motivation (to study plant behavior) coheres with a believable blind spot (over‑controlling). Mara provides light, credible pressure without stealing agency. A touch of tidy self‑explanation (“They’re not trying to survive…”) trims complexity at the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: the hellebore’s retraction precipitates Eleanor’s choice to not intervene, culminating in an on‑page stance shift the next morning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with an earned renunciation—she commits to helping “by releasing control.” Cost is present but primarily conceptual/procedural rather than dramatized loss. Orientation is clean; shard transitions are smooth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is tactile and purpose‑driven: mossy trellis, steam, wet soil, and storm season calibrate tone and bias perception. The trellis and storm‑borne vines return to charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain options, it meaningfully reweights the outcome. Details feel filtered through a plant‑minded POV, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—intervention vs. release—tightens at the hellebore beat when she pulls back, foreclosing her standard tactic. Pressure is primarily internal, coherently escalated by Mara’s check and the plant’s live metamorphosis. The price is modest (ceding control, not a material loss), but it’s legible and alters her future approach. No extraneous subplots dilute the throughline.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thematic spine (transformation sustained by letting go) arises from concrete events and recurring images (linden leaf, vines). However, key lines state thesis outright, softening subtext in the final third. Resonance persists via the closing image, which reweights earlier material. A slightly less declarative end would heighten complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a precise botanical lexicon; rhythm modulates well between lyric description and scene action. Dialogue feels natural and advances stakes, with subtle status dynamics in Mara’s restraint. A few slogan‑like repeats (“releasing control”) skim toward motif overuse but remain within control. No POV slippage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean, vivid lines with varied syntax and minimal scaffolding; images often do double duty (atmosphere and theme). Figurative language remains coherent and apt to the botanical frame. Minor repetition of thematic phrasing prevents a higher score. Momentum and clarity are maintained through transitions and at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Plants studying her back” and the hellebore’s metamorphosis provide a fresh angle on familiar control‑vs‑surrender terrain. The linden leaf and trellis/vines motif integrate elegantly. The insight risks familiarity due to explicit statement, but the concrete plant‑behavior framing keeps it specific. Quiet originality without flashy gimmicks.</comment>
