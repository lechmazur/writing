<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s myth‑buster identity and “gloomy cheerfulness” create a tangible contradiction that drives her to risk belief. Her agency (placing the shell, bowing through doubt) earns the final renunciation of tidy explanation. The emotional cost—surrendering her impulse to debunk—registers but remains understated. A touch more resistance or self‑sabotage in the peak could sharpen the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound density builds (shell hum → merged tone → rattling glass) to a cadence break at silence and the 12:00 stasis. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—the riddle becomes harmony felt rather than solved—tied to on‑page phenomena (spinning dials, glowing note). Orientation is clear early; single scene coherence is strong. The cost is legible but modest, limiting the ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory and its instruments aren’t mere backdrop—they shape tactic and outcome (control panel at 11:59, shell on bridge, dome opening). Sensory specificity is crisp without excess, filtered through Lira’s logic‑meets‑awe perception. The final image is charged by place (dome opening to stars). Slightly more constraint from the cliff or failing machinery could elevate further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: prove the riddle’s sanity through action. Escalation is clean and textural—the hum intensifies, dials react, then a hard stop forces reappraisal—earning the shift. The price is an internal relinquishment rather than a concrete loss, which reads true but somewhat gentle. A sharper trade‑off under pressure (risk of breaking the cello, letting go of a key proof) would deepen impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motifs (out‑of‑tune stars, hum, 11:59→12:00) converge toward a resonant stance. However, the explicit thesis line—“The universal riddle… wasn’t meant to be decoded. It was meant to be felt.”—tips into stated moral and slightly blunts subtext. The piece otherwise earns its insight through concrete sound‑and‑object work. Letting the glowing note and humming exit carry the idea would strengthen it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice blends precise, curious observation with lyric reach, staying inside Lira’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates well at pressure points (from brittle pluck to rattling glass to sudden silence). Quoted memories are clean and purposeful. No leakage or stance drift appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty (image and implication) with minimal scaffold; diction is vivid yet controlled. Figurative moves (“fossilized question,” “whisper of closing pages”) are mostly apt and not overstacked. Momentum is steady; no loops or muddled metaphors blunt the climax. A few terms (“universal riddle”) recur abstractly, but scene work offsets them.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The seashell‑as‑ephemeral‑compass and half‑finished cello as cosmic decoder feel fresh and integrated. The observatory mystery is familiar, but the music/harmony reframing and tonal “gloomy cheerfulness” give it distinctiveness. The closing image (glowing note in dust; dome opening) is memorable. Slightly riskier consequence or rule‑set implication could push it higher.</comment>
