<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear from the first paragraph and holds: she climbs to end the dreams and “unravel the mystery.” Interiority is embodied (iron taste, slick stone, ache of loneliness) and her bristling against the figure shows live contradiction. The final renunciation (turning to descend) feels earned by the encounter, though the insight lands a bit declaratively. The cost is mainly internal and could be sharpened with a more concrete forfeit.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Situational lens: a sustained pressure (warning → climb → encounter) forces a stance crystallization. Closure arrives as a charged poise/CR: she understands the bleeding and chooses to leave, foreclosing denial. Orientation is clean and the scene holds together without teleports or resets. Cost is present but modest, more conceptual than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, sensorial, and filtered: condensation on stone, ozone scent, “bruise” of the clouds, gravel that sparks. The ridge and slickness shape action; the grotto’s light literally pools in her hands and charges the final image. World rules are conveyed through observation and interaction, not exposition. The environment consistently mirrors and pressures her internal state without feeling schematic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (face the dreams/what they mean) is signaled early and escalates through the physical climb to a metaphysical interrogation. The tightening beat is the figure reframing the grotto as wound and self, narrowing her options to acceptance or evasion. Her agency drives the end (she turns to descend), but the price remains largely inward, with minimal external consequence on the page. A sharper trade-off or sacrificed option would elevate the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres (fear vs. disenchantment; self as wound) and recurs via the bleeding starlight image, reweighted at the end. However, the figure states the thesis too explicitly (“You are not disenchanted. You are afraid.”), reducing subtext. The final choice still resonates without overt moralizing; the imagery carries much of the weight. More implication and fewer declarations would deepen aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and selective, with a lyric cadence that modulates as pressure rises. Dialogue is mostly functional and carries subtext in status (the figure’s calm authority vs. the queen’s defensiveness), though some lines veer into thesis. Diction belongs to this world and remains consistent. Rhythm varies cleanly, and sensory noticing reads character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: concrete verbs and tactile images propel the scene. A few metaphors trend familiar (“stars sharp as pins,” “wind chimes in a storm”) but do not blur sense. No obvious loops or scaffold, and sentences do multi-duty without padding. The prose remains clear under peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fantasy tropes (queen, seer, cave of light) are refreshed by specific textures (bleeding starlight as warm, viscous, pooling). The mirror-wound revelation is apt but familiar; ingenuity lives more in execution than premise. The firefly “shared exhale” touch is a fresh inflection. A bolder or less didactic turn in the encounter could push originality higher.</comment>
