<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—honoring her mother by crafting and then returning light—drives clear micro‑choices (selection, polishing, weighing, release). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific; the “loan vs gift” frame creates a credible renunciation. Internal contradiction is subtle (crafting to keep vs releasing to share) but present. The cost—letting the pearl go—reads as an earned endurance rather than a tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: actions accrue (polish → weigh → release) to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (grotto, task, tools), and closure lands on the page with cost in the surrender of the pearl. The weighing beat tightens the structure and justifies the final act. No causality gaps or late rule changes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto, mist, runed anvil, and meteorite tool are vivid and functional, supplying the resource (celestial residue) and charging the final image. Sensory economy is strong (jasmine/ozone “zephyr bloom,” prismatic moisture). The environment constrains what’s possible (capture/polish vs fire), shaping tactics. World rules are learned through action, not told.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure is quiet but coherent: the drive to “share light without fire” narrows to a single choice—keep/use vs release/return. The weighing scene functions as a meaningful deepening that clarifies stakes (balance of light/dark) and points to renunciation. Cost is felt in forfeiture; escalation remains modest but apt for the lens. No external antagonist, yet internal/external aims interweave cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (“light is a loan,” stillness as charged space) emerges organically from action and image rather than lecture. Recurring objects (sea glass, jar, scale) reweight meaning at the end; the release reframes possession and sharing. A couple of maternal aphorisms come close to overt statement but are grounded by concrete beats. The final dissolution into the sky offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with a distinct lyrical texture that fits the character’s vocation. Diction, rhythm, and sensory bias feel controlled and coherent through pressure. No head‑hopping or gratuitous elision; compression supports mood. The voice modulates from hushed grotto craft to open‑air release with finesse.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean syntax and varied rhythm; sensory figures are precise (never muddled). Lushness risks purple but stays purposeful and legible. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; momentum sustains through the accumulative build. The closing images are sharp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—polishing sea glass into a “pearl of stillness” to share light without fire—feels fresh and integrated with character and world logic. The meteorite tool, runed anvil, and scale deepen originality beyond ornament. The renunciation ending is inevitable in hindsight under the “loan” ethic. Risk is confident, not gimmicky.</comment>
