<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Alaric’s guilt, competence, and ritualized habits (ring‑twisting, pedagogy metaphors) read specific and embodied, and his choices drive the action. The internal shift from culpability to acceptance lands, though the self‑forgiveness resolves a touch neatly given the scale of his failure. Interiority connects tightly to objects (threads, labyrinth), revealing character under pressure. A bit more friction or contradiction at the pedestal beat would deepen the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: decoding the tapestry → memory confrontation → revealed path → pedestal activation → village unfreezes. Closure is on the page with a Decisive Change (time resumes) and a conceptual repricing of guilt; the drive lens reads Causal throughout. The magic’s mechanics are legible and seeded, though success arrives without a hard setback. Stakes remain coherent and focused in a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The time‑frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and storm‑hushed square are vivid and functionally constraining; environment and recurring objects shape tactics and the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (thunder’s lull, gleam of platinum, pulsing threads). World rules stay consistent and are learned via Alaric’s actions. The setting meaningfully charges both the midpoint (thread‑winnowing) and the ending (village reborn).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break the curse/forgive himself) is clear, and escalation tightens through the tapestry to the pedestal. The key deepening beat—the black thread triggering embodied memory—raises internal pressure credibly. However, resistance is minimal and there’s no real reversal; cost is mainly internal and stated rather than stressed through consequence. The resolution feels earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The weaving motif binds fate, guilt, and forgiveness, culminating in the “woven hush” that reweights the premise. Thematic clarity is strong, with images doing much of the work; a couple of explicit sentences verge on telling (“The prince’s death wasn’t his fault alone”). The final image reframes mistakes as moves, not endings, without sermonizing. Resonance lingers via object‑driven subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and closely held, with a distinct perceptual signature (tutor’s lens, chess idiom, tactile noticing). Diction is lyrical but controlled; brief quoted memory reads natural. Rhythm modulates well between hush and urgency. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean, economical, and image‑dense without purple overload; verbs carry weight, and repetition is purposeful (“winnow,” “woven,” “hush”). Sentence variety supports momentum from tactile decoding to release. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops. The occasional abstract line is anchored quickly in concrete action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of chess tutelage, a platinum labyrinth, and tapestry‑decoding feels fresh, with the “woven hush” providing a distinctive conceptual turn. The arc is not groundbreaking, but the synthesis is coherent and specific to this character. Stakes and method avoid template convenience through tactile, idiosyncratic steps. The piece takes a modest formal risk (lyric causality) that pays off.</comment>
