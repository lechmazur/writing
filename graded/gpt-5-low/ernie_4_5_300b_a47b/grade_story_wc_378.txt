<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara-7’s motive—contain chaos before it overwhelms her and the farm—is clear and consistently escalated by the magnetic shift. Interiority is particular to an android body (“optics flickered,” “joints creaking”), and her nostalgic lean toward old Earth records individualizes her. The pivotal choice to burn the box and absorb the orb reads earned by her controlled-burn memory. The cost—keeping residual static and ache—grounds the change in credible imperfection.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Hybrid lens (causal spine with textural accrual), the chain is tight: magnetic drift → fraying box → controlled burn → miniaturized orb → absorption. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she integrates the fears and reframes static as a companion cost. Stakes stay focused and are resolved on the page without soft reset. Orientation is early and clean, and the final image reweights the premise without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass-dome farm and desert roses are vivid and functional: the dome’s electromagnetic disturbance pressures the choice, and the farm center provides the arena for the burn. Tools (plasma torch, solar panels) and environmental cues (storm peak, dimming lights) affect tactics. The farm-as-box metaphor charges the final image. Sensory specificity (“ozone and pressed lavender”) supports mood without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent internal/external chaos from overwhelming—tightens as the storm intensifies and the box leaks. The meaningful turn is the decision to apply a controlled-burn method to the fear-box, narrowing options. Cost is legible: she internalizes the chaos and accepts residual static. While tension is measured rather than acute, it remains coherent and accumulative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of containment vs. transformation and living with imperfection emerge organically from actions (control burn, miniaturization, absorption). Recurring images (box, dome, roses) return with reweighted meaning at the end. A touch of explicitness (“Maybe that was the secret”) skirts moralizing but is cushioned by concrete preceding beats. The final image—static as song, roses brighter—offers earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical close third carries a distinct mechanized-yet-sensuous perception. Diction and cadence modulate with pressure (storm peak, burn) without losing clarity. No head-hopping or stance slips; elisions are purposeful and legible. The brief AI harmony detail adds texture without breaking POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image-rich, and purposeful; sentences do more than one job and maintain momentum. Figurative language stays coherent (box-as-chaos, farm-as-box) and avoids mixed metaphors. Minimal repetition and no scaffolding loops; rhythm varies naturally. The closing line lands a charged, concise image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Android caretaker + biotechnical farm + controlled-burn alchemy of fear yields a fresh synthesis. The miniaturization beat and “contain chaos” reframing feel non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken in marrying procedural and lyric textures without gimmickry. Emotional truth is grounded in specific, embodied android experience.</comment>
