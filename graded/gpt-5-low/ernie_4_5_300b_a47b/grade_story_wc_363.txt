<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to mend silence and honor a generational charge—drives every choice, culminating in a real forfeiture of her grandmother’s bead. Interiority is sensory and particular (calloused fingers, the loom’s creak), with credible persistence and loneliness. The internal contradiction (keeping her inheritance vs. letting it go) sharpens at the end and lands. Minor reliance on summary (“years ago,” “for weeks”) slightly dilutes in‑scene pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning accumulative: pattern and pressure build via puzzle beats until the charged renunciation; closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with on‑page cost. Orientation is clear early; causality holds (edges align → hum → twin bead → message → sacrifice). The creek‑delivered rummage box is a convenience but becomes integrated through sustained effort, not a single fix. The before/after is legible and paid for.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard, bamboo, creek, loom, and beads are vividly rendered and recur to charge the final image (“bamboo whispers back”). The environment meaningfully participates: the creek delivers the box, the crow chase uses terrain, and the orchard’s silence/singing externalizes stakes. Sensory detail remains POV‑filtered and purposeful. Not quite a hard constraint setting, but a continual pressure and chorus.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking/bridging silence) is signaled early, and escalation tightens through the puzzle’s hums, vanishing pieces, and the crow theft toward the renunciation. The decisive cost—releasing the grandmother’s bead—forecloses a path and redefines tactics (weaving silence). Agency drives the turn rather than luck resolving it. Stakes remain coherent, if largely interior and mythic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme blooms through particulars: mending the world by aligning broken edges; inheritance transmuted into communal gift; sacrifice as communication. The final act (weaving silence) reprices earlier images without moralizing and leaves a resonant aftereffect. Subtext in the loom’s creak and the orchard’s transformation avoids didacticism. A touch more ambiguity about personal cost beyond the bead might have deepened the ache further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close holds steady with a distinct perceptual signature (textile and sound lexicon). Rhythm modulates well from hushed observation to luminous climax; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Brief dialogue lines are character‑true and functional. Elevated diction stays consistent with the tale’s fable‑like register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely controlled, with strong image economy (“sunlight dripped…like liquid gold,” “symbols rearranging like liquid”). Minimal scaffolding and good sentence variety keep momentum. A few ornate phrases (“stoically sparkling hues”) flirt with purple but do not blur sense. The closure image is clean and earned without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—loomcraft + amber glyphs + a puzzle map + silence as fiber—is fresh and coherent. The jigsaw‑edges method and the final weaving of silence feel non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in mythic tone and accumulative structure heighten resonance without confusing stakes. Only the serendipitous box arrival tempers the ingenuity slightly.</comment>
