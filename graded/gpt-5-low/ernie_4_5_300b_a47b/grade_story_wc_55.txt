<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s contradiction—order-bound craftswoman drawn to wildness—reads clearly in embodied moments (ink-stained fingers, careful pendulum work versus stepping into the forecourt). Micro‑choices (touching the quartz, not fleeing the bear, nodding at the archway) credibly reveal a shifting hierarchy of values. The change (choosing an “and/and”: stay but listen differently) is earned if somewhat low-cost. Occasional abstract claims (“silence could be a kind of violence”) skim the surface of interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds from forecourt pull → bear’s arrival → quartz song → reweighted stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she refuses flight or departure now, redefines her relation to the keep with a felt opportunity cost. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is strong. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the turn quiet rather than decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the quartz forecourt after rain literally “sings” and the keep’s mechanisms and petrichor scent bias perception and choice. Environment actively shapes action (touching quartz changes the bear’s response) and charges the ending’s listening vow. Sensory selection feels character‑filtered (clockwork focus, resonance bias). A hair more constraint from the physical layout could push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self versus chosen silence—tightens via the unexpected bear and the forecourt’s resonance, prompting a stance crystallization. The key tightening is the bear’s non‑attack and the song, forcing attention and altering fear into curiosity. The price paid is subtle (deferred wandering; acceptance of a liminal path), which keeps tension quiet rather than acute. No luck‑based resolution; the reconfiguration is internally driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonances—silence as pressure, listening as agency, keep as compass—emerge through image chains (gears, quartz, bear). The final image reweights prior material, though a couple of thematic sentences edge toward explicit moral (“The keep was not a prison. It was a compass.”). The piece avoids tidy binaries by choosing an uneasy middle. Depth is felt but not profound enough to transcend the stated insights.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical close third with consistent diction and rhythm; perceptual biases (mechanisms, resonance) anchor POV. Minimal dialogue is apt and underplays the revelation. The cadence flexes well at pressure peaks without head‑hopping. A few heightened lines flirt with purple but remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong line‑level images and clean syntax carry momentum; most sentences do more than one job. Some metaphor stacking and repeated abstract nouns (“silence,” “hush”) risk saturation but don’t obscure clarity. Little scaffold or synonym loop; verbs are generally active. Slight sentimental sheen in the last lines trims the edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—clock scribe, singing quartz, rain‑slick bear in a hush—feels fresh and specific. The turn from fear to attuned listening is non‑obvious yet earned. While the “stay but listen differently” resolution is familiar in lyric fiction, the execution distinguishes it. Risks are tasteful rather than radical.</comment>
