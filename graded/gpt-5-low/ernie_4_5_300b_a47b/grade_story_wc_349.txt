<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—seeking where stories begin—is clear and embodied in her trade; giving up her prized jar is a credible, value-revealing choice. Interiority registers in tactile, character‑specific ways (fingertips on glass, fixation on the knife). Internal contradiction is light: unease vs. principle shows, but she isn’t truly tested beyond parting with the moonlight. The man exerts immediate but brief pressure; the relationship dynamic is intriguing yet underused.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images accrue until the note’s return prompts a conceptual repricing about beginnings. Orientation is clean and the throughline is coherent (gift of absence → unsettled wait → residue’s arrival → reweighting). Closure lands via cost accepted (loss of prized jar) and a reframed stance. Minor softness: the cost is more conceptual than felt, so the turn reads quiet rather than incisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is vivid and integrated: panes, mist, cloud‑sea, and prismatic light inflect mood and perception. Details consistently pass through Elara’s professional gaze (jars of specific absences). Environment doesn’t much constrain choices, but it charges the final image (stars twinkling on glass; note drifting). Sensory balance and rule consistency are strong without becoming touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making room for beginnings—tightens when the shadowed man demands a story yet-to-be and she parts with her apex jar. The visible price is the loss of the Bottled Moonlight and the risk of mis‑shaping absence. Pressure is elegant but muted; the knife and hood suggest danger that never quite escalates beyond a poised exchange. The late note deepens rather than reverses, maintaining a quiet arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres around absence as prerequisite for creation, recurred through jars, warning, and the note’s return. The final realization resonates and reweights prior images. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“She understood: stories didn’t begin…”), slightly reducing subtextual charge. Still, the piece invites reflection without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV remains steady and close; diction is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue carries subtext (commerce in beginnings, risk of form) and advances the scene. Rhythm modulates from hush to small lift at the chime. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, with strong noun‑verb choices and efficient images (“gravel stirred in water,” “coat of woven shadow”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and not muddled. Minimal scaffolding; momentum sustains despite lyric density. A single explicit thesis sentence slightly dulls the otherwise image‑led closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—selling quantified absences—is striking and followed through with specific, non‑obvious touches (widow’s laughter, emptiness after a rhyme). The shadowed buyer with frosted‑glass knife is a fresh pressure vector. Closure via a returning note as glimmering parole is an elegant twist. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural, but it pays off.</comment>
