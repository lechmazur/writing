<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (restore sacred order/answer her mother’s promise) is clear and sharpened by her precognitive burden. Micro‑choices under pressure—Fibonacci to Pascal’s triangle to Möbius—reveal a control impulse that she must renounce. Emotions are embodied (trembling hands, breath catching, “Not yet”). The closing acceptance reads earned, though one thesis‑like line skews toward told insight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via successive pattern‑attempts and increasingly dangerous star‑dust responses. Closure lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she shifts from control to witnessing, with on‑page cost (risk of erasure; accepting the star dust dimming). Orientation is clean from the opening. Cause‑pressure is coherent even without strict “therefore” plotting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The aurora and frictionless tide aren’t ornamental—auroral alignment and the absence of friction directly shape tactics and stakes. Recurring objects (rocks, star dust) are integrated into the environment, charging the final image of the living sigil. Sensory specificity is vivid and POV‑filtered. The setting constrains and enables choices, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens as each configuration raises potential catastrophe. The decisive turn is the renunciation of control in favor of witnessing, after the Möbius attempt nearly tips into annihilation. Prices are legible: risk of engulfment and the acceptance of a dimmer, steadier power. Pressure escalates coherently through her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—honoring patterns vs. imposing order—emerges through action and image (eels as language, space between objects). The final realization resonates, but the explicit phrasing “weren’t a puzzle to solve, but a language to honor” edges into thematic echo. Still, the obsidian‑centered cadence reweights prior beats with a quiet afterglow. Ambiguity remains purposeful rather than muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to math and ritual. POV remains stable, inference feels earned, and rhythm modulates well at peak pressure (“Not yet” lands cleanly). Diction fits the character and world; no head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Lyrical compression is taught and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry weight and momentum; images tend to do double duty without obvious scaffolding. Occasional intensifiers risk purple, but clarity survives and the closure image is crisp. Sentence rhythm varies well, and redundancy is minimal. Figurative logic holds even under stress beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Precognitive eel herder” + frictionless tide + mathematical stone‑liturgy + star dust is a striking synthesis. Turns feel inevitable from seeded particulars rather than imported twists. The final repricing is fresh and thematically integrated. Risk‑taking in concept and method heightens stakes without sacrificing legibility.</comment>
