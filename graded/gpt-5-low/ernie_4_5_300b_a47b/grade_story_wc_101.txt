<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s goal—to replace anonymous aid with named trust—is clear and her choice to ring the bell arises credibly from it. Interiority reads mostly through action and concrete images rather than deep interior conflict; she faces skepticism but little on‑page opposition. The cost of her stance (donations cease) lands, demonstrating earned consequence. More textured contradiction within Mira would raise the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: sanctions → anonymous donations → Mira’s decision/public declaration → donations stop → community reconfigures via notes. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost, and the bell action marks the decisive turn. Orientation is strong from the opening and the two‑shard structure (solstice scene → aftermath) is coherent. A slightly sharper on‑page beat of resistance at the solstice would elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The terra‑cotta arbor, sanctioned moon, and “amplified quiet” create a lived, atmospheric locus that shapes behavior (curfew, gatherings, posting notes). The antique bell functions as a charged object returning in the final image. Sensory details (“wet clay,” red tiles) are selective and purpose‑driven. Setting could constrain tactics one notch more explicitly to reach the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival vs fear/anonymity) is clear and escalates through Mira’s risky public naming. The visible price—loss of donations—forces a tactical shift to reciprocal notes. Pressure is coherent under a causal/situational lens, though on‑page pushback at the bell scene is muted, reducing friction. Still, the turn is protagonist‑driven and consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of solidarity, naming, and intergenerational reciprocity emerge through concrete acts (ringing, notes, bread exchange) and recur in the bell’s reweighted meaning. The ending (“It’s not the sound… And who listens.”) reframes value from object to community attention without didacticism. A few declarative lines risk thesis‑statement neatness but remain in‑character. The resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Steady close third with a controlled, slightly lyric cadence; “amplified quiet” and terra‑cotta imagery develop a distinct perceptual texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in‑world. No head‑hopping or register slips; elisions serve compression. Minor moments verge on slogan but the voice holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, economical, and image‑rich; most lines carry more than one job. Rhythm varies, and key objects are precisely handled. A couple of lines tread close to aphorism, but momentum and clarity never stall. No loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sanctions‑era community with a ritualized bell and the shift from anonymity to named reciprocity feels fresh and grounded. The bell’s reconfiguration and the “note mosaic” provide a non‑obvious turn. While not radical, the synthesis is coherent and specific. A bolder complication at the solstice might have pushed ingenuity higher.</comment>
