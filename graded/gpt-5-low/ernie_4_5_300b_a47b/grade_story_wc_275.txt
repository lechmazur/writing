<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lira’s motives—tending the farm, translating her father’s credo into presence—are consistent and embodied in small, credible choices (embedding the scrap, repurposing the knife). The inheritance of violence versus pacifist practice gives her texture without grandstanding. Pressure is gentle; internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized, so the cost feels modest. Still, the final renunciation/acceptance reads earned for this scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and acts (sand, knife, dome, scrap) accrue toward a Charged Poise ending. Closure lands when she plants the engraved scrap and whispers “Quiet,” conceptually repricing weight and silence. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (solitude, renunciation), not materially tested. Orientation is clear and the single-scene frame is clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses are vivid and functionally integrated—containment versus storm frames her stance and charges the last palm-on-glass image. Environmental constraints (heat amplification, storm outside/stillness inside) matter. Object-as-setting (knife, scrap) meshes with place without feeling ornamental. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on carrying forward a pacifist legacy by transforming tools and remnants. The storm outside provides exterior pressure, but escalation is largely tonal; the main tightening is the choice to bury the scrap and redefine the knife’s purpose. Price is felt but soft, with no reversal forcing a difficult trade. Coherence is strong; intensity remains low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ballast/quiet paradox and the retooling of violence into cultivation converge into a resonant answer. However, lines like “The farm was more than a sanctuary; it was a manifesto” and “even in ruin, life persists” edge into stated thesis, dulling subtext. The strongest thematic work is in the reweighted objects and final whisper. The piece invites reflection without confusion, but avoids the hardest ambiguities.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely tracks Lira’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are consistent and confident. Metaphor is purposeful and mostly clean; no head-hopping or stance drift. Modulation across beats supports the accumulative design. Occasional abstraction nudges toward sermon at the end but doesn’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is polished with high information density and varied rhythm. A few stacked metaphors (“symphony of containment and release,” “tranquil blaze”) risk purple, but coherence holds. Minimal redundancy; sentences do more than one job. The final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Airship ballast engraved “quiet,” domed desert farm, and repurposed knife synthesize into a fresh, non-obvious frame on pacifist legacy. The piece takes a quiet risk with a manifesto-by-image rather than plot twist. Specifics feel singular rather than templated. Only the slight thesis-forward lines temper the ingenuity.</comment>
