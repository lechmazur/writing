<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, individualized motivation (to reach the moment before deciding) drives concrete choices: finding moonlight, invoking, tracing, and leaving lighter. Interiority is specific and embodied (peat, bone‑felt songs), with a credible contradiction (needs healing but won’t admit it). The change is an earned renunciation/acceptance that forecloses self‑silencing, with a felt cost (some wounds never fully close). Minor softness remains around on‑page struggle, but it’s coherent at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density rises from entry to invocation to condensation‑letters, then resolves in a cadence shift at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she accepts carrying the unsent letters forward; the shard’s edges smoothing marks cost and after/before. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when clear), no causality breaks. Stakes are modest but tightly executed for a single‑scene lyric.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lush, precise sensory world: mangrove roots, condensation on leaves, bell‑like songs, moonlit clearing. Environment constrains tactics (she must find moonlight; the labyrinth guides; the shard warms only then) and charges the final image (smoothed shard). Details are POV‑filtered, purposeful, and consistent with the rules taught on the page. Strong integration without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover the unspoken to heal) is signaled early and tightened by the apparition of letters and the choice to accept fragments. Pressure escalates through intensifying songs and the moonlight ritual, culminating in an endurance choice (stay till dawn, accept imperfection). The cost is emotional and legible but quiet, with no sharp reversal beyond the pattern break of letters appearing. Effective for the lens, if a touch gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of resilience, unfinished grief, and the beauty of brokenness emerge through concrete acts (condensation letters that dissolve yet warm her chest). The shard’s transformation reweights meaning without expository summary. The spirits’ final message “Go. Live. Speak.” edges toward direct moralizing in the last paragraph, slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is strong but not wholly free of explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (stone, water, moon, song). Rhythm modulates to match pressure, and inference stays within Lirael’s knowledge. No head‑hopping, and the elisions feel purpose‑driven. A few elevated turns verge on purple but remain in character and clear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, motive) with clean sequence and minimal scaffolding. Vivid imagery avoids muddle, and repetition is purposeful (“fierce tenderness”) without looping. Modifiers are occasionally lush but not obfuscating; momentum holds through the ritual to dawn. Line‑level craft supports closure without artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The condensation‑letters on mangrove leaves and the gargoyle rainspout shard are fresh, integrated spins on communing with the unsaid. The labyrinth’s moonlit healing and tonal paradox (“fierce tenderness”) feel distinctive rather than ornamental. Risks are cohesive and paid off in the final reweighting. Not radical, but notably original and well‑fused to character.</comment>
