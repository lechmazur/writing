<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motive and method are clear and embodied (the headset bite, the searing shard), and his agency drives each turn. However, internal contradiction is light—he “knows better” early, so doubt and competing impulses are minimal. The mantra “Discard assumptions” helps, but the epiphany skirts the edge of pre‑decided. Still, his micro‑choices (dismantling, retuning, lifting the shard) align with a credible arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: tuning the shard → system resistance → dismantling the cage → surge/activation. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (tower reborn; shard goes inert) and a conceptual price (letting go of legacy design and burning his palm). Orientation is clean by ~120 words and never wobbles. The cost is modest but legible and tied to the method.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The tower, gorge, and moonlight are richly rendered and functionally integrated; the obsolete design literally constrains choices until he strips it back. Sensory detail (ozone, humming girders, mist) is purposeful, not touristy. The setting charges the final image (river of light, pulsing spire) and feels indispensable. Scale and choreography remain coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around unlocking the hush; a single meaningful tightening occurs when the system “resists,” forcing him to dismantle and risk damage. Stakes remain focused, and the climax is protagonist-driven. The felt cost is there but mild; a further visible sacrifice would deepen the charge. Still, the escalation reads because/therefore rather than and‑then.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silence as potential and “beginning in every ending” recur through action (stripping the cage) and image (shard → inert; city reborn). Yet the text sometimes states its thesis outright (“The hush wasn’t absence—it was potential,” “silence was the key”), thinning subtext. The final image earns resonance, but the moral is slightly over-articulated. Thematic integration is strong but could trust implication more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person closely tracks Kael’s perceptions; technical and mystical lexicons blend without head-hopping. Rhythm varies and modulates cleanly under pressure. The single spoken line works as voice and method cue. Occasional high-register declarations graze abstraction, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly efficient; images often do double duty (the shard mapping possibility). Minor purple tendencies and repeated constructions (“serenely electric,” “hush” definitions) flirt with redundancy but don’t stall momentum. Clarity remains high at peak beats, and the final images land cleanly. No significant artifacts or loops impair propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—radio ruin, lunar perigee, “hush” as actionable frequency—feels distinctive and purposeful. Turns flow from established premises rather than late rule changes. A few familiar mythic notes (rebirth via letting go) read conventional, but the execution elevates them. The vision is coherent and confident.</comment>
