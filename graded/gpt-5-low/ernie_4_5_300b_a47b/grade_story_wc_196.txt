<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is concrete and specific (dust literacy, post‑emancipation ache), and his micro‑choices—pulling the folder, examining the button, deciding to open a new file—align with his motive to honor erased lives. The “door slam” reveals fragility without melodrama. Internal contradiction is modest (wariness vs. hope) but present. The final renunciation—accepting partial knowledge and proceeding anyway—reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → object discovery → date revelation → conceptual reweighting → new folder. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—he commits to documenting despite uncertainty—with a light but legible cost (choosing work over definitive answers). Stakes remain quiet yet coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The file room’s mildew, bowing shelves, and dust patterns are vivid and functional, not decorative. The environment enables the method (reading dust) and charges the final image through the button’s placement and the newly labeled folder. Object‑as‑setting (the button) and micro‑setting details shape inference and tone. Sensory choices feel lived‑in and filtered by vocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to extract meaning from erasure—tightens with the date discovery and the dust‑ring inference. The door slam gives a small cadence jolt. The final choice to open a new file is a credible escalation of commitment, though the price is understated. Pressure coheres but never becomes acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of erasure, inheritance, and the ethics of witnessing emerge from particulars (dust language, the war‑dated button) rather than sermon. The ending reweights “unknown histories” into an ethic of care without over‑stating it. One line edges toward articulation (“magnify the small kindnesses…”) but is supported by scene work. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Close third is steady and plausible; perception feels vocationally biased and tactile. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with lyric lift that doesn’t obscure sense. No dialogue, but internal cadence modulates with pressure (notably at the door slam and date reveal). No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language serves action (“language of neglect,” “dust settled in patterns”) and avoids mixed metaphors. A few elevated turns risk purple but remain grounded in concrete image. Final lines land by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a post‑emancipation archivist reading dust to resurrect an anonymous boy through a Civil War button. The investigative method and ethical stance feel particular, not templated. Turns are modest yet earned, and the final move (opening “Unknown Histories: The Button”) is an elegant, specific charge. Quiet originality over spectacle.</comment>
