<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Zara’s motive—seeking strength in vulnerability via attentive caretaking—drives concrete choices (following the star, missing the report). Interiority is specific and embodied (the lantern glass, obsidian, crater heat). Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers, so pressure doesn’t expose deeper fissures. The Veyra exchange adds a crisp relational contour without overshadowing her arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from station hush → pursuit → crater → return. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration in the speck-of-stardust reveal and Veyra’s softened stance; the cost (missed report; lantern dimmed) is on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening. The single tightening beat (the star’s death and her choice to witness) suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: plateau, domes, obsidian, aurora, and the crater shape movement and mood. The yellow lantern operates as micro‑setting/tool charging the final image and guiding action. World rules remain consistent and integrated through action. Atmosphere and specificity elevate theme without static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—attend to the “flourishing stillness” over institutional duty—is legible and coheres. Escalation is quiet but real: the star fractures, she chooses the walk, witnesses the extinction, and returns having foregone the report. The price is modest yet felt; no gratuitous complication. A single, meaningful deepening lands at the crater.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (power in vulnerability; listening as work) emerges through concrete images and the lantern/stardust reprise. A few explicit lines (“find strength in vulnerability,” “I just listened”) edge toward statement but are earned by scene. The end reweights science vs. spirit without sermonizing. Ambiguity lingers productively in Veyra’s silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature remains steady and controlled. Diction suits the character’s contemplative stance; dialogue is minimal but subtextual and effective. Rhythm modulates at pressure points (fracture, crater, return). No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and largely efficient; most sentences do more than one job. Occasional near‑purple flourishes are balanced by clarity and momentum. No notable loops or scaffolding, and the closure image is clean. Rhythm and syntax vary to support cadence shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Cosmic janitor” with a lantern that captures a speck of stardust is a fresh synthesis, not a template reskin. The accumulative pursuit toward a quiet, charged payoff feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off. Emotional truth holds without hedging.</comment>
