<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motives and contradictions (orderly mediator torn between vendors and suits) are clear and consistently enacted through decoding, planning, and public advocacy. The interiority is concrete enough (chip’s weight, reading the murals) and pairs with purposeful dialogue. However, her plan unfolds with minimal friction, softening felt cost and limiting deeper flaw exposure. The relationship with Jax adds pressure but doesn’t substantially alter her tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: symbol spotted → plan articulated → week of execution → Council confrontation → strategic refusal that holds the line for now. Orientation is solid early, and the one‑week montage reads as a purposeful transition. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise under a Situational lens: the Council withdraws, the fight persists with a reweighted community stance. The cost is light (largely effort and future risk), keeping it out of the upper band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The raft‑city carnival is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful sensory detail (fried dough and diesel; drowning clown mural), and the chip/mural function as charged micro‑settings. World rules and spatial logic are coherent and integrated into action. The environment flavors choices but rarely constrains them, so it stops short of 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resisting privatization) is clear, and pressure coheres around the Council’s arrival and demand for answers. The tightening is credible—public confrontation—but the escalation is relatively smooth, with little sacrifice or reversal to narrow options. The outcome (Council withdrawal) involves stance crystallization rather than a price that bites on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of order vs. chaos, gentrification, and communal voice emerge organically through graffiti as language and the chip as lineage. The final image reweights the premise toward collective resistance with hope. Some thesis‑y lines (“You can’t privatize that”) blunt subtext. Resonance is present but not piercingly complex.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and character‑specific, with a tactile observational bias that suits an “orderly intuitive.” Dialogue is functional and distinct enough (Jax’s bite vs. Lira’s measured pitch) and advances the scene. Rhythmic control is confident, with clean mechanics and no head‑hopping. No notable register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines are clean, vivid, and purposeful, with good verb choice and minimal scaffolding. Occasional familiar phrasing (“voice like ice”) appears but doesn’t drag momentum. Information density is strong; imagery does double duty without purple excess. Cadence supports scene flow from setup through confrontation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating carnival and graffiti‑code resistance strategy feel fresh, and the “culture shock absorber” role is an inventive angle. Turns grow from character logic rather than gimmick. The piece plays a familiar gentrification conflict with distinctive textures and objects, though risk and cost remain moderate. Overall, a memorable synthesis short of transformative daring.</comment>
