<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to convert confusion into order—consistently drives her choices and aligns with her archivist competence. Interiority is concrete (palming the wood, tracing symbols), though the identity crystallization (“She wasn’t just an archivist…”) leans toward told epiphany. Contradictory impulses are muted; she’s steady more than torn. The cost to her is mostly risk and strain rather than a deeper moral or relational price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the beats link cleanly: symbols → rope pattern → seal → door opens → chamber → scroll reframes meaning → return. Orientation is immediate and stable; the one transition to the chamber is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of role and world-rules, but the on-page cost is modest. No glaring set-up is left unkept, though the return snaps back neatly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The clock tower’s mechanics, chill, sparks, and torches are vivid and filtered through an archivist’s eye. The environment contributes mild pressure (gears slowing, jam, sparks) but doesn’t materially constrain tactics beyond urgency. Object micro-setting (seal, rope pattern) integrates well with action. Strong atmosphere without crossing into indispensability by constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing and aligning lost knowledge—stays clear. Escalation is present (gears grind, sparks fly, glow intensifies), with her persistence narrowing options to “finish or fail.” The price is mostly momentary danger and strain; no lasting foreclosed path is felt. Resolution is earned by her method, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The “fables of absence” evolve from motif to operational rule, culminating in a reframing of purpose. The final beam and return suggest a reweighted world rather than a neat moral. Some theme is told outright (“She wasn’t just an archivist”), softening subtext. Resonance lingers conceptually more than emotionally costly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident, with a measured, tactile lexicon befitting an archivist. The prose modulates with pressure (from study to hazard) without head-hopping or register slips. No dialogue, but the internal narrative cadence carries momentum. Controlled lyricism supports clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful; sensory details do multiple jobs. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but remains legible and scene-serving. Minimal redundancy; actions and images push forward. Opening and closing images align without scaffolding clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of archival method, ceremonial braids, and a diplomat’s seal as a temporal negotiation key feels fresh. Secret-door/ancient-scroll tropes are present but transformed through specific procedural decoding. The return beam “reset” is familiar, though the conceptual repurposing of absence adds novelty. Risks are thoughtful, not flashy, and cohere with the premise.</comment>
