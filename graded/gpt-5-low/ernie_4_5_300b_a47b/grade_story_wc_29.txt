<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lila’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her competency is balanced by fear and trembling hands; “No... But doing nothing guarantees failure” credibly frames her risk‑taking. Internal contradiction is present but mild—she’s mostly steady rather than torn. Hale adds gentle external pressure without hijacking focus. The final stance (“Then I’ll dam it”) reads earned if slightly slogan‑leaning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal throughline is firm: anomalies → funding/chaos pressure → subsonic intervention → truce → renewed threat. Closure lands as Charged Poise with a felt ongoing cost: vigilance against returning tricksters. The multiple time jumps (next morning, weeks later, another night) slightly diffuse the single‑window intensity but don’t break coherence. Setups (charts, transmitter, division) pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station’s basement, oscilloscopes, and transmitter are tactile and profession‑specific, and the equipment meaningfully constrains tactics. The setting charges the ending (the transmitter “a loyal beast awaiting its next command”). Details are filtered through Lila’s technical lens, avoiding tourist cataloging. World rules feel consistent within the speculative premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are legible (community cohesion/reality integrity, the station’s survival) and escalate via Lila’s deliberate interference. The subsonic gambit is a true tightening choice with risk of retaliation that materializes later. Some consequences tilt tidy (board reversal, softened arguments), softening the cost curve in the midgame. The final threat restores pressure and prevents a soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of power, harmony vs dissonance, and communal fracture emerge through action and image. The antagonist’s dictum “Power is a river” edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, and the “chessboard” framing risks familiar metaphor. Still, the truce and later taunt reweight power as ongoing negotiation rather than victory, which resonates. The final stance is conceptually honest but a touch on‑the‑nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person limited stays clean and specific; technical diction aligns with Lila’s expertise. Dialogue is spare, functional, and subtext‑aware, especially Hale’s wary trust and the tricksters’ voice. Rhythm modulates well between procedure and awe (“wind chimes made of starlight”). No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with vivid yet controlled imagery; most lines do more than one job. Occasional familiar phrases (“older than time,” “game isn’t over”) slightly dull edge but do not stall clarity. Figurative language fits the register without mixing metaphors. No significant loops or scaffold clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The university‑radio/cosmic‑trickster interface and subsonic counterplay feel fresh and specific. Some flourishes (the taunting package, “the cosmos was a chessboard”) echo genre commonplaces, but the technical/musical harmony tactic is inventive. The renewed threat reframes victory as precarious equilibrium rather than a twist. Overall, a strong synthesis with a few familiar notes.</comment>
