<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lin’s motive (to understand why some people “magnetize stories”) is clear and character‑particular, and the donor‑heart split gives her a palpable interior contradiction. Her key choice—releasing the wing and later committing her days to illuminating stories—aligns with those motives. The struggle is mostly internal and contemplative; pressure rarely forces messy, contradictory impulses on the page. Cost registers through the wing’s loss and a life‑long vow, but the emotional price could be sharpened.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: wing → light‑tracking → travelers’ tale → flare → disappearance → reweighted purpose. Orientation is strong from the opening; the pattern of light teaches the story’s logic and pays off in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure lands with on‑page cost (losing the talisman) and a new governing commitment. A shade more causal tightening at the mid‑turn would push it higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house, obsidian, mist, and sun‑threads create a distinctive, tactile world filtered through Lin’s attention. Setting actively shapes tactics—the sun’s angle and reflective surfaces guide her movement and meaning—and charges the final image. The bell, terrace, and valley mist evolve with the light, not just decorate. Sensory economy stays purposeful without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are internal yet coherent: will Lin find a way to read and serve the stories she senses. The escalation is quiet but present—cautious handling → releasing the wing → following purposeful light → blinding flare and loss—culminating in a binding vow. The price is conceptual and symbolic rather than visceral; a slight lack of external friction keeps tension gentle. Still, the flare and forfeiture credibly narrow options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, attention, and “iridescent caution” accrue through image and action rather than lecture, and the donor heart reframes perception in a resonant way. The wing’s disappearance reweights value from talisman to practice. The final sentence edges toward explicit thesis (“some stories are meant to be shared, and some hearts are built to hold them”), softening subtext. Overall resonance remains strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a lucid, lyrical cadence and a distinct perceptual signature (light, texture, craft). Diction matches Lin’s sensibility without drifting into academic register; the narration modulates cleanly at the flare. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Minor elevated phrasing is voice‑justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, selective modifiers, and images that carry multiple jobs. Rhythm varies and momentum holds even in reflective turns. A touch of repeated conceptual phrasing (“quiet explosions,” “iridescent caution”) skirts purple but stays coherent and purposeful. No scaffolding loops or figurative muddle at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a floating obsidian tea house, donor‑heart perception, and a blue morpho talisman feels fresh and organically unified. The light‑tracking method is an elegant, specific tactic, not a generic mystical gesture. Emotional truth lands without gimmickry, though the arc remains comfort‑quiet rather than risky. The piece commits to its peculiar logic and follows it through.</comment>
