<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lirael’s need to remember and fear of the stone create credible, embodied tension, with decisive micro‑choices: retrieving the feather, seeding the stone, embracing the shards. Her interiority is specific (mercury skin, borrowed dreams) and her final acceptance carries a visible cost. The one neat formulation—“Home isn’t a place…”—risks tidiness but is earned by the ordeal. Orin functions as light pressure rather than a full crucible, which fits scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: pain/avoidance → feather seeding → vision/cavern → quake → transformation/shattering → return with cost and reweighted meaning. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the two‑shard structure (bookstore → cavern → return) stays coherent. Closure lands as Decisive Change with persistent price (stone gone; shards in skin). Minor convenience in the mother’s exposition doesn’t break the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore and cavern are vivid and purposeful, with tactile objects (stone, feather) integrated into action. Environment actively pressures the climax (quake, falling rocks) and charges the final image (silver‑lit peak). Details filter through Lirael’s sensibility (mercury skin reflecting lanterns; bioluminescent fungi), avoiding postcard excess. World rules are taught through use, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the shape of home) tightens through the decision to engage the stone, then escalates into physical peril and irreversible loss. Agency drives the turns, and the cost is on the page (shards embedded, stone destroyed). The conflict interweaves internal and external cleanly. Slightly guided help via the mother’s voice softens pressure marginally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The feather/stone motifs evolve to reframe “home” as an act of remembering, with the final image repricing prior material. Subtext of bearing others’ memories and transforming pain into craft is earned by events, not asserted. However, thematic lines voiced by the mother and Lirael edge toward statement, tempering ambiguity. Still, resonance lingers through the charged objects and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled close third with lyrical texture suits the mythic premise; diction and rhythm modulate under stress without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse and functional, staying within character and advancing turns. POV remains tight to Lirael with no leakage. Figurative choices feel like her perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and action—with minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops. Imagery (“shadows as sharp as knives,” “hidden thunder”) is vivid yet proportionate, rarely tipping into purple. Rhythm varies and supports momentum through the climax. Line‑level clarity holds even in the transformation beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—mercury‑glass seer, mountain‑bookstore, seeding truth via feather texture, stone as mirror—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Turns are grounded in earlier particulars (Orin’s advice; mother’s feather), not late rule changes. The choice to shatter the key object for embodied cost is a fresh angle. Risk‑taking in concept enhances stakes without obscuring sense.</comment>
