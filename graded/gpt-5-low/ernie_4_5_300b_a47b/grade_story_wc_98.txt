<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive and role are clear, and her micro‑choices (planting the seed, demanding to see the fracture, releasing the seed) align with rising pressure. The doubt beat provides credible internal conflict without stalling action. Some interiority leans abstract (“luminous doubt,” “test”) rather than embodied, softening felt cost. The final resolve feels earned but not deeply priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive holds: causal beats (seed → dream entry → fracture vision → seed release) layered with an accumulative, lyric texture. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: monsoon reframed from ending to beginning; memory “safe, for now.” Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, legible but modest. Orientation is clear early; scope stays within one scene plus a dream shard.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ridge, monsoon, and seed are vividly particular and filtered through Lira’s task; the seed object charges the final image. Sensory details (jasmine and iron, mirrors to liquid light) are purposeful and integrated. Environment lightly constrains action (planting on the ridge before the monsoon) without deep tactical pressure. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve collective memory before the monsoon) is signaled early. Escalation coheres through entering the dream risk, confronting the thesis of fear, and making the consequential choice to surrender the seed. The cost reads as a renunciation of doubt rather than a tangible loss, which keeps pressure strong but not punishing. The mirrors shatter/reform beat provides a single meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece argues memory as compass rather than cage, dramatized via visions of oblivion vs. remembered song. The thematic statement via the chorus borders on overt, but is earned by the dream logic and charged images. Final repricing of the monsoon reweights prior material without tidy moralizing. Ambiguity remains about ongoing cost (“for now”), enriching resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent close third with lyrical precision; rhythm modulates well between description and action. Dialogue from the dream figures has mythic register that fits the world and advances pressure. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference stays within POV plausibility. Diction is elevated but coherent with the tale’s mythic tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; metaphors (mirrors to liquid light, iron‑scented air) land cleanly. Minor abstraction and occasional intensifier phrases risk purple but do not obscure sense. Momentum holds through varied syntax and purposeful paragraphing. The final line resolves with image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “reality checker” of an island entering dreams via a knowledge seed feels freshly synthesized, not merely decorative. The mirror‑cavern and liquid light pool are vivid reimaginings of memory’s architecture. While the fear vs. memory axis is familiar, its integration with setting and object yields distinctiveness. Risk‑taking remains within coherent bounds.</comment>
