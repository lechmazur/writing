<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to ground the spirits and “exhume the truth”) is clear, and her fear of “what I’ll find” creates a credible internal contradiction under pressure. Her embodied work with the needle shows micro-choices and persistence. The relationship with Elias adds gentle pressure but rarely forces a hard trade-off. The ending shift to “Now you listen” is earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional and soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the unraveling intensifies hush → light → key, reweighting meaning and options. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (hush to hum; key to an unlocked door) and a conceptual cost (releasing the kept silence and accepting uncertainty). Orientation is clean early; the throughline is coherent. The cost is felt but not scarring, keeping it just shy of top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight atmosphere are vivid and integrated; the sanctuary’s rule (it “accumulates”) affects stakes and the ending (“the sanctuary thanks you”). The needle/net function as micro-setting constraints shaping tactics. Sensory specificity is strong without museum-catalog drift. Final images (“hum,” prisms, starlight) are charged by what has changed.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release/ground the hush versus fear) is signaled and escalates as whispers grow and culminate in the burst of light. The key turn arises from her ongoing action, not coincidence. However, the price paid is mainly an internal acceptance rather than a felt trade-off that narrows future options. Tension is steady more than tightening into a painful bind.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, love, and the ethics of silence emerge through the net and the fisherman myth, reconfigured at the end into “Now you listen.” The silver key (“to a door that was never locked”) offers a crisp conceptual repricing. Slight on-the-nose line (“Silence isn’t always kindness”) blunts subtext. Overall resonance lingers without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and intimate; diction is lyrical but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“interlaced hush,” “accumulated silence”). Dialogue is economical, with Elias’s riddled cadence contrasting Mara’s grounded focus. No head‑hopping or withholding artifacts. Rhythm modulates effectively at the light-burst and the calm after.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work (world, mood, action) with clean momentum; figurative language is vivid and mostly precise. Minor purple tints don’t impede clarity, and there’s little scaffolding or looped phrasing. The final image is crisp and not over-explained. A few abstractions (“peace,” “prison”) skirt generality but don’t dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, net that collects hush, and key to an unlocked door feel fresh and organically interwoven. The fisherman’s choice reframes the motif of silence with non-obvious implications. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but they heighten texture without confusion. The synthesis reads memorable and specific.</comment>
