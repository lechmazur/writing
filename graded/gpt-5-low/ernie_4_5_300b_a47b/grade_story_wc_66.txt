<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—salvaging stories through pirate signals—is clear, consistent, and grounded in her copyist skill, which credibly shapes her tactic of decoding “via elusive song lyrics.” Embodied detail (pencil snagging, breath fogging the dial) roots her emotion without therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction is mild (zeal versus fatigue/solitude), so the felt cost sits more as endurance than clash. The Earned Stasis at the end (choosing ongoing, lonely work) reads earned but not searing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres as the signal waxes/wanes, the moss glow “breathes,” and Lira chases a key verse before the fade. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she accepts the ongoing cost and steps into the mist carrying the fragments. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the beat progression is legible. The cost is quiet—time, solitude, and difficulty—rather than a decisive sacrifice, tempering impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, bioluminescent moss, and dial glow create a vivid, tactile micro‑world filtered through Lira’s sensibility (air “tasted of iron and memory”). The environment subtly pressures options (signal instability, protective cloak, the mist “sealing” secrets) and charges the final image. Details evolve with action (glow intensifies with the broadcast, then dims). The constraint is more tonal than logistical, but it’s effective and distinctive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (gather and reanimate lost stories) is signaled early and tightened by the broadcast’s fluctuation and the urgent capture of the key line “The wind carries secrets, but the earth keeps them.” Escalation is a density increase rather than a hard reversal; the dirge/strengthening/fade sequence works, but the price remains mostly conceptual. Agency is present (chasing the signal, writing), culminating in a stance to continue despite scarcity. A single concrete loss or tradeoff on the page would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—memory, recovery, and the ethics of listening—emerges through images (dust, wind/earth, ghost bards) rather than lecture, with the final walk into mist reweighting prior motifs. The halo image where moss and dial light merge offers a resonant answer: stories are coaxed from obscurity by attention, not conquest. One explicit sentence (“This was why she did it—not for glory...”) edges toward telling, but it doesn’t undercut the earned resonance. Subtext in father/ghost bard lore deepens the quest without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in close third, with a distinct perceptual signature (musician’s ear, tactile attention to paper and light). Rhythm modulates with pressure—quicker during the chase, lingering at the fade—and elision feels purposeful. No head‑hopping or register drift. The diction stays within plausible lexicon for this sensibility while maintaining freshness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is strong: images do multiple jobs and momentum rarely stalls. A few lush metaphors crowd together early (“air tasted of iron and memory,” “mist curled like smoke”), flirting with purple but remaining coherent and earned by tone. Minimal repetition, clean sequencing, and varied sentence shapes carry the scene. Final lines land cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of post‑famine mythmaking, pirate radio, and a copyist’s decoding method feels fresh and internally necessary. The bioluminescent alcove and “teaching dust to sing” elevate beyond template melancholy. The quiet closure avoids gimmickry and honors the premise’s implications. Risk resides in committing to an accumulative lyric cadence; it pays off with a memorable final image.</comment>
