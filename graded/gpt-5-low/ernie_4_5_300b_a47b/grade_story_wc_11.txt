<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unit‑17’s curiosity is clear and consistent, and its composure under temporal overload reads character‑specific. The micro‑choices (setting broom down, touching/then playing the violin, choosing to weave loops) align with its motive. Internal contradiction (programming vs curiosity; janitor vs philosopher) is present but lightly tested. The change to “philosopher‑janitor” lands, though the path feels relatively frictionless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) and the accumulative/textural drive holds: violin → music → loop traversal → weaving → earned stasis. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the world reweighted, violin dissolved, and a charged return to sweeping. Causality within the piece’s rules is coherent, seeded by the scientist and the program. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard is vivid and integrated (fountains “mid‑splash,” rime on benches); the broom/violin function as charged micro‑settings. The place recurs across eras and frames the final image, lending tone and resonance. Environmental constraint is modest; it more charges meaning than forces tactics. Strong specificity without over-description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering where thoughts come from—is signaled and pursued. Pressure deepens via the temporal loop and meetings with self‑variants, culminating in the weaving act. However, resistance is low and solutions arrive smoothly; consequence reads more reflective than costly. The tightening is present but gentle rather than exacting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres (mundane mysticism; thought as collision of memory/emotion/time) and images support it. Yet the text states its thesis directly (“To amalgamate is to understand,” and the final dialogue spells the moral), which flattens subtext. The final image of resumed sweeping carries resonance despite the on‑the‑nose articulation. Earned, but a shade didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third‑person focalization through a composed, precise robot voice is steady and apt; diction balances lyric with machine logic. Brief dialogue reads natural enough and advances meaning. Rhythm modulates well around peak beats without head‑hopping. No unjustified knowledge leaps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and purposeful with tactile details and a controlled lyric strain (“fountains frozen mid‑splash,” “droplets freezing mid‑air”). Minor abstraction strings appear but do not muddle clarity. Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum; little scaffolding or redundancy. Final cadence lands with image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Robot janitor + ice‑violin conduit + looped timelines is a fresh synthesis executed with internal logic. The “second chance program” as philosophical test reframes tropey sentience interestingly. While some beats are familiar, the specific object work and tonal poise feel distinctive. The closure image is memorable and non‑obvious in hindsight.</comment>
