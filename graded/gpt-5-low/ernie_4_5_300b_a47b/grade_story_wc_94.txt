<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear interior drive (evade censorship, write truth) is embodied in tactile choices—lantern, mask, timer, opening the envelope, writing, sealing. Contradictory impulses register (“furiously tranquil”) without resolving too neatly. The final decision to mail the poem is earned by prior beats. Cost is mostly implied (Ministry risk), not felt on-page, tempering the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm pressure + timer cadence + envelope content accrete to a Charged Poise closure (sealing and intent to mail). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure lands with a credible before/after, though the tangible price is implied rather than dramatized. The single-scene progression is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory, gas mask, and timer are vivid and POV-filtered; weather and gear shape breath, attention, and rhythm. The setting charges the final image (lightning as “divine signature,” storm kissing wonder). While constraint is more tonal than mechanical, environment does narrow tactics (solitary vigil, breath via mask). Specificity remains purposeful without cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—voice versus censorship/self-censorship—is present from the first paragraph. Pressure tightens via the storm’s escalation and the envelope’s poem, culminating in the act of writing and sealing. The trade-off (safety vs. truth) is legible, though the cost is not tested on-page. The escalation is a meaningful deepening rather than a reversal, apt for the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motifs (masks, scars, rarefaction, stars) cohere into a theme of stripping to essence. Subtext operates through image (timer as heartbeat, lightning as signature) and the earned move from vigil to reckoning. One explicit definition (“To rarefy: to purify...”) edges toward didactic, slightly reducing mystery. The final image reweights the material without a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction suits the speaker’s sensibility; rhythm modulates with pressure. No head-hopping or stance slips; elisions are purposeful. The prose remains confident without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong line-level control with varied sentence rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is frequent but mostly clean and serviceable to scene and character (“liquid mercury” clouds, “divine signature”). Minimal redundancy; no visible scaffold loops. A few phrases verge on purple, but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—censored poet in a stormlit observatory using a bus timetable and an envelope to reframe scars as cartography—feels fresh. The timer-as-breath and rarefaction concept elevate beyond trope. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off. Not a radical reinvention, but confidently original within a lyric frame.</comment>
