<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (called for a repair, secretly chasing whispers) and his watch‑maker inheritance ground credible, particular behavior. His micro‑choices—reading dust, climbing, listening, knocking—flow from “skillfully observant.” The internal pressure (ghosts as “weightless burden”) culminates in a choice to engage beyond repair, though contradiction and cost remain relatively gentle. Embodied beats (forehead on metal, shaking legs) keep him specific, if not deeply torn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid tending Accumulative/Textural: investigation layers to a hollow sound, hidden compartment, documentary proof, and a conceptual reweighting of the elevator’s “malfunction.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—he commits to repairing stories, not just machinery—backed by the ghost’s thank‑you. The cost is soft but on‑page (accepting the burden; physical tremor; altered mission). Orientation is clean early; the throughline holds without causality gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is tactile—buzzing fluorescents, peeling laminate, cracked plaster—and it supplies the hidden compartment, tickets, and photograph that reframe events. Tools and micro‑setting (counter as step, plaster’s hollowness, dust strata) guide tactics and the discovery. The atmosphere coheres with the spectral theme and charges the final image. Sensory balance skews visual/auditory but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped ghosts by uncovering what’s hidden—tightens as clues accumulate to a concrete find and a reframed mission. Escalation is quiet but credible: observation → climb → listen/knock → evidence → commitment. The price is mostly internal (taking on haunting as work), so the tension never bites hard. Still, agency drives the turn, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Cracks in the façade” evolves from literal fissures to emotional fissures, linking repair, memory, and release without heavy moralizing. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“weren’t just physical—they were emotional, historical”), but the photograph and canceled tickets earn the insight. The final choice reweights “repair” as an ethic. The resonance lingers more as hush than shock.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a tactile, precise perceptual signature (dust patterns, vibration, hollow sound) that fits a technician‑seer. Rhythm modulates well between hush and discovery; the single line of dialogue fits the register. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Lyric touches feel rooted in Elias’s noticing rather than extraneous flourish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are lean yet atmospheric; images like “shadows stretch like old, thin hands” and the “weightless burden” work, though a few metaphors repeat familiar shapes. Minimal scaffold and no obvious loops; syntax varies. Purple risk is managed and clarity sustained at the close. Small tendencies toward emblematic phrasing keep it shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elevator tech + ghosts + watchmaker’s mainspring in an abandoned circus yields a fresh synthesis. The investigative method feels character‑true, not a stock séance. The turn (repairing stories) is earned if familiar. Risk is thoughtful rather than radical, with specific objects lending authenticity.</comment>
