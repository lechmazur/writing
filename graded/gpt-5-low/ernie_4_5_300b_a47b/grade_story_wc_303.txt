<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific interiority and contradictory impulses (empire vs garden) play simultaneously in scene. Micro‑choices—touching the strings, whispering “Propagate,” reading the stain—reveal values under pressure. The renunciation reads earned and costly (“mulberry ache” remains). Minor safety in keeping all pressure internal keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (coffee, plants, violin, “Propagate”) tighten toward a renunciation. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis—she dismantles the dream—with a felt price (“only the ache remained”). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the setup pays off via object and image turns. Slight softness in explicit causal linkage between vision and world stakes keeps it under 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory, heat, and the ice‑violin are vivid and filtered through Lira’s sensibility; multi‑sensory details feel purposeful. The object‑as‑setting (violin) charges and evolves to the final shattering; plants physically respond, shaping beats. Environment mirrors and pressures choice without museum‑tour excess. Not quite constraining tactics, but it decisively charges the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early; pressure coheres and deepens as visions bifurcate and the violin’s strings snap. The tightening forecloses a live option (usurpation) with a visible cost. Escalation is largely internal but the material world (snaps, vines) punctuates the turns, preventing stasis. One more explicit external consequence would push it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Power vs nurture and fate’s porousness emerge through recurring particulars (violin, coffee stain, plants) rather than thesis. The final dismantling functions as a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting “propagate” from conquest to self‑pruning. The “mulberry ache” tones the afterimage. Rarely didactic and thematically integrated at sentence and image level.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical first‑person‑adjacent close third with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Imagery choices (“perforated destiny,” “liquid moonlight”) stay consistent with voice. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional lushness skirts purple, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with few scaffolds; lines often do double duty (world + pressure). Minor ornamental phrasings flirt with over‑purple but do not blur causality. Rhythm varies and paragraphs cut cleanly to new pressure or image. A touch more leanness at peaks would sharpen momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Ice‑crystal violin, plant telepathy, and coffee‑stain augury synthesize into a fresh, coherent vision. Risks in motif recursion (“Propagate”) pay off structurally and thematically. The final conceptual turn (self‑propagation as renunciation) feels specific and earned. Slight genre‑lyric familiarity prevents a 9+.</comment>
