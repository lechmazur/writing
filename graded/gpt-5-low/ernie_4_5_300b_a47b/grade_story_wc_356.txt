<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (harmonize the village) and a credible internal tension between ambition and patience. Embodied, character‑specific perception through scent grounds her decisions. The grandmother dream as catalyst feels a touch convenient but still coheres with her heritage motif. The final renunciation of rushing reads earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: plant care, scent shifts, and journaling pattern build toward a reweighted ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she slows, the flower blooms, and the village stance changes with modest but legible cost (ambition tempered). Orientation is crisp throughout. Stakes are kept within the chosen scope and pay off on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The treetop village is vivid and sensorial (lanterns, mist, creaking walkways) and filtered through a plant‑focused POV. Environment colors tone and community response, though it seldom constrains choices tactically. Recurring objects (seed/flower, journal) charge the final image strongly. Balanced sensory detail beyond the visual deepens atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early, and pressure coheres via dormancy, doubt, and social skepticism. The meaningful tightening is her shift from forcing growth to stillness, which narrows her options and invites cost in patience and social risk. Elders’ resistance softens quickly, limiting felt danger. The climax is quiet but earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of wisdom-in-hush vs. drive-in-roar arises through concrete acts (scent‑led care, doodling as prayer, renunciation). The elder’s line “Chaos and serenity... are not enemies but kin” edges toward stated moral, slightly flattening subtext. Still, motifs (scent, journal, bloom) reweight meaning at the close without heavy authorial intrusion. The aftereffect is reflective and coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, confident third‑person closely tied to Lira’s sensorial signature; diction is consistent and purposeful. Brief dialogue fits tone and advances social pressure. Rhythm modulates with pressure—denser during doubt, airier at bloom. No POV leakage or unearned certainty beyond her ken.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and mostly controlled, with strong images and clean mechanics. Occasional purple or repeated coinages (“journalized,” “tide’s thought”) flirt with excess but don’t obscure sense. Information density is good with minimal scaffolding. Momentum holds despite reflective mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Corpse flower in a treetop village filtered through an olfactory‑driven herbalist and a doodling lineage feels fresh. The patience turn isn’t surprising, but its execution is particular and textured. The journal/doodle method adds an idiosyncratic lever rather than a generic wisdom epiphany. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off.</comment>
