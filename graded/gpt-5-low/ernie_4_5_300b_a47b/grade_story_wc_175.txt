<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is specific and embodied (trembling hands, aching fingers, fear of shattering the moment), and actions align cleanly with her aim to honor the overlooked. However, internal contradiction is mild; she endures more than she wrestles, limiting dynamic tension. The “esoteric realist” label lands, but the scene rarely tests that belief against an opposing impulse. The renunciation/endurance at the end reads credible but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build is clear and oriented from the outset; the cadence culminates in the monarch’s landing and a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The felt cost is the work’s ephemerality (the lattice dissolving by morning) and the long wait condensed into this moment. Causality is modest but coherent: weaving → beacon → monarch contact → reconfiguration of meaning. The ending’s repricing lands without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and selective, filtered through Lirael’s priorities (moss, silk, wing shimmer, cloud hues). The grotto and tools shape texture and the final image, though they only lightly constrain tactics. Object-as-setting (silk, lattice, wing) effectively charges the ending. Slight bias toward visual, but other senses appear (“air tasted of dew and distant thunder”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring the overlooked—tightens with the monarch’s arrival and the risk of breaking the moment. The meaningful turn is the butterfly’s landing, which validates the signal; the visible price is labor and chosen impermanence. Pressure remains gentle; escalation is textural rather than narrowing options sharply. Still, the cadence shift at the landing credibly reweights the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of ephemerality, witness, and humility are earned through concrete acts (knotting silk, embedding the wing) and a resonant final image. A few explicit statements (“transiently rooted existence,” “had been more than an object—a key”) edge toward telling. Subtext in the monarch touching the moth wing is strong and carries the piece. The quiet, reverent close lingers without a pat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close-third lyric voice with controlled diction and rhythm that modulates at key beats (holding breath; exhale after the monarch leaves). No head-hopping; perspective remains clean and character-specific in noticing. Elevated register feels organic to Lirael’s sensibility. The voice sustains atmosphere without explanatory crutch.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are precise and image-dense with good syntactic variety; minimal scaffolding and few redundancies. Occasional heightened phrases risk purple but remain legible and purposeful. Repetition (“interrupted cadence”) is thematic rather than mechanical. The final cadence is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: spider-silk lattice as ephemeral signal, a moth wing keyed to a monarch’s passage, and a grotto above clouds. The central turn (endurance meeting fragility) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is quiet but committed; the piece avoids formula even while using familiar nature imagery. Originality comes from specific praxis (knotting silk) and the conceptual economy of honoring the unnoticed.</comment>
