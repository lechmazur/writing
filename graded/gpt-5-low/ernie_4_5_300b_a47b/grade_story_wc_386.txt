<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Kael’s motive and modus operandi are clear and consistent, and his choices (reading dreams; placing the globe; opting to “weave” truth) align with a careful, listening temperament. Interiority is particular and embodied via ice, candles, breath, and the globe. However, internal contradiction and on‑page pressure are mild; he encounters little resistance or cost beyond quiet ache. The result is credible but not deeply crucible‑tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and held: three dream shards deepen knowledge toward a quiet reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, the mosaic pattern is legible, and the ending lands with a charged act (placing the globe; deciding on dream‑weaving) that closes the inquiry. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, not strongly dramatized, keeping this short of the very top. Still, the cadence shift at the altar provides satisfying closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candles, and ice are vivid and purpose‑selected, with the snow globe functioning as a micro‑setting that charges the final image. Sensory choices feel filtered through Kael’s vocation and reverence. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain action, but it shades every choice and image. Strong atmosphere without the last step of functional constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging living and dead through truth—emerges early and tightens via the triptych of dreams. Each dream reweights the problem (love vs blame vs endurance) and culminates in a method choice. The escalation is primarily knowledge/depth rather than risk; the price is gentle. Effective deepening, modest pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of “windows of connection,” endurance, and love’s residue accrues through recurring images (globe as pool/prison/mirror) and the final, non‑literal answer (truth carried by dreams rather than proclamations). A few lines tilt toward overt statement (“Windows… were fragile things”), but the closing image earns resonance. The ghost’s simple line about blame grounds sentiment without tipping into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, lyrical, and modulates with pressure; diction fits Kael’s contemplative craft. One italicized line of dialogue lands with subtext and restraint. No head‑hopping or stance slips, and rhythm supports the accumulative design. Distinct, controlled voice without ostentation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lean‑lyric with good image economy; metaphors are coherent and avoid purple excess. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few heightened phrases repeat light motifs (“borrowed starlight”) but serve cadence rather than padding. Momentum holds from shrine to altar without haze.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ghost‑listening wreck‑diver + melted snow globe + dream‑cameo analysis is a fresh synthesis executed with confidence. The triptych device and tender, indirect “exposure” choice feel non‑obvious yet inevitable. Emotional truth outpaces gimmickry, though the conflict remains gentle. Distinctive enough for high marks.</comment>
