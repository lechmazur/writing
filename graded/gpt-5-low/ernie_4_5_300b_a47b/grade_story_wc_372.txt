<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and trait set (“orderly,” “gently meticulous”) are cleanly dramatized in tool use and note-taking, and her frustration spikes credibly. Internal contradiction is modest—methodical patience versus the urgency to hurry—surfacing when she accelerates sampling. Emotional embodiment (“quartz hush,” fist on desk) reads particular rather than generic. The endurance choice lands, though the cost is mostly fatigue and strain rather than a sharper sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single‑scene arc is coherent: she samples, reconstructs, loses it, adapts, repeats, and reaches a stabilizing outcome as dawn arrives. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration under a hybrid (accumulative-dominant) lens; on‑page change is the library’s illusions brightening and her stance of earned, method-driven renewal. Causality holds—with a slight assist from dawn that skirts but doesn’t break agency. Felt cost is light but present; the before/after is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen library, frosted panes, and ice prism aren’t decorative; they shape tactics (using an ice prism, ambient hum) and charge the final image with dawn’s warmth. Sensory curation fits Elara’s priorities—light, frequency, and texture dominate. World rules stay consistent and emerge via action rather than dump. The setting’s evolution at dawn materially affects the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve the library’s magic) is clear and pressure tightens when the vow dissolves and she’s forced to resample faster. The key turn is her method shift (brisk precision) that briefly reignites the vow, testing her meticulous habit. Cost and narrowing are felt but moderate, with dawn as a slight relieving factor. Tension is steady rather than wrenching, but it escalates appropriately for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of vows sustaining worlds and meaning salvaged from entropy arise organically through the frequency‑work and the partial phrases. The ending reweights the motif—renewal via painstaking craft rather than grand heroics. No moralizing intrudes; resonance comes from image and method. Ambiguity remains in the fragility of the magic, which deepens the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is steady, selective, and confident; diction (“quartz hush,” “leather‑bound truths”) matches Elara’s sensibility. Lyric texture modulates under pressure without losing clarity. Dialogue snippets (oaths) function as charged artifacts, not chatter. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences carry atmosphere and action without sludge. Figurative language is controlled and consistent with the optical/musical lexicon. Minor repetitions (vows fading/reforming) serve momentum rather than loop. The final line resolves by image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—archival craft as spectral spectrometry to resurrect vows—feels fresh and character‑true. The ice prism and frequency sampling provide non‑obvious tactics that avoid trope drift. The dawn assist is familiar, but the technical-mystical method grounds it. The piece commits to its conceit without hedging.</comment>
