<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lirael’s softly deliberate temperament is dramatized (choosing study over alarm, aligning images, speaking the key), and her interior stakes (hope’s “shape”) register. However, her internal contradiction remains mild; the risk of “shattering hope” is felt but not borne as a concrete loss. Thalos provides counter‑pressure but largely as exposition rather than as a crucible that forces a harder trade‑off. The final act reads earned yet a touch too tidy to reveal deeper flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens: Hybrid leaning causal—investigation (because) leads to the word, which triggers the metamorphosis on the page. Closure lands: saying “Bloom” decisively changes the shadow and reconfigures the library (RR with DC flavor). Cost is mostly conceptual (risk of shattering hope) rather than embodied; still, the narrowing—pedestal gone, reliance on superimposition and a single word—feels coherent. Orientation is clear early, and the final image cleanly reweights prior details.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blooming library, petrified petals, glass dome, and the river stones are vivid and integrated with action (superimposed pedestal/console, motes charging shelves). The environment and recurring object constrain tactics and charge the final image, meeting the 9‑gate’s spirit if not its maximal severity. Sensory selection tracks Lirael’s priorities; rules (dream/time sharing) read consistent within the piece. Minor: world mechanics are told more than felt in spots.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“preserve the shape of hope”) is signaled and tightened by the fragile shadow that could shatter; escalation moves from inquiry to enactment. The key narrowing arrives with the decision to utter “Bloom,” risking a brittle state. Some tension diffuses via explanatory dialogue, and the solution arrives smoothly, but agency drives the turn. A more visible price or complication at the peak would lift pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of hope’s mutability and definition emerge through stones, spiral, and the library’s re-titling—an earned, resonant reweighting. Subtext surfaces in the shadow “wanting definition,” but Thalos states philosophy overtly (“Metamorphosis of hope”), edging toward didactic. Still, the final image of motes settling on shelves delivers emotional aftereffect without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on preservation vs. change more than it argues a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and selective; diction is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature for Lirael. Dialogue occasionally leans expository, but voices are differentiated (Thalos’s ceremonial register vs. Lirael’s grounded focus). No head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythmic modulation supports the climax without becoming overwrought.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete images, and efficient beats that carry multiple jobs. Occasional abstraction (“hope is a shapeless thing”) is balanced by tactile detail (stone warmth, shelves humming). Minimal scaffolding; momentum holds. A touch of purple and on‑the‑nose phrasing in the philosophy prevents a higher tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—blooming library, dream‑/time‑sharing, twinned stones, and a shadow as hope’s residue—feels fresh and coherent. The metamorphosis-by-word is familiar but recontextualized through the archival method and spatial alignment. Risks (lyric tone fused with SF conceit) largely pay off. More friction or cost at the peak would add memorability.</comment>
