<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s pacifism and avoidance are clearly rooted and put under pressure, culminating in an earned pivot when she chooses to engage. Contradictory impulses (fear of monstrosity vs. duty to mend) are present in scene and inform the final act. The embodied quirk (lighter when happy) adds character texture, though most emotional turns lean conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. A touch of aphoristic articulation (“peace is not the absence of war...”) slightly blunts complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: failing ship → need to activate the Tear → shadow work confrontation → “stitching” the door → opening with cost. Orientation and stakes are clear early, with a contained scene that lands an on‑page Decisive Change and the price of the relic’s shattering. The drive lens reads Causal with a thematic overlay and holds through closure. The internal trial is somewhat telescoped, but not at the expense of legibility or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship, the meditation chamber with Earth holograms, and the locket of collapsed star metal are vivid, selective, and integrated with action. The environment constrains and motivates choices (the ship’s decay, altar placement) and charges the final image with the bioluminescent garden. Details feel POV-filtered and purposeful rather than touristic. World rules remain consistent and are learned via use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is strong: open the sealed dimension to save/stabilize the ship. Pressure tightens credibly from ship shuddering to the shadow confrontation and the dissolution of shadows around her ankles as a test of commitment. The price—the Tear’s destruction and surrender of avoidance—lands, though the internal struggle resolves a touch swiftly at peak. Escalation is agency-driven and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of pacifism redefined as courageous engagement emerge through concrete beats (altar choice, “stitching” with understanding) and the ship/garden reconfiguration. Recurring images (tears, stitching, light) support a resonant reweighting. Occasional explicit statements tip toward moralizing and reduce subtext in the climax. Overall resonance is earned and lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person with a distinct texture sustains across the scene; the AI’s choral static provides tonal contrast without head-hopping. Diction suits the world and modulates effectively at stress points. Minor aphoristic lines flatten otherwise strong voice specificity. Rhythm and stance remain controlled and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few scaffolds; imagery is largely precise and momentum-friendly. Reprises (“long-dried tears on faded photographs”) function as motif rather than redundancy. A couple of lines edge toward purple abstraction, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially at closure. Mechanics are clean and varied.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-human birth rituals, a pacifist with quantum lightness, Kwan Yin’s Tear as portal keyed to shadow work—feels fresh and coherent. Turns arise from established premises rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth aligns with the speculative conceit. Risks are present and largely successful, with only small dips into familiar phrasing.</comment>
