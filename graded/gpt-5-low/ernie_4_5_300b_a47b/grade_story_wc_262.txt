<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (to locate “unused love” via the Alhambra and the film) are clear and consistently pursued through tactile choices (unwinding the strip, re‑focusing the reading, pocketing the artifact). Interiority is concrete and embodied (dust, rain, lilac), though her internal conflict is modest—she rarely faces contradictory impulses beyond tremble and awe. The brief vow at the end signals a change in commitment, but the visible cost is lightly sketched. Overall, she reads particular, if not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece layers charged objects and visions until a cadence shift reconfigures the premise (unused love is locatable and retrievable). Orientation is clean from the first lines; causality holds (touch → visions → identification → vow). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—she commits to a path—yet the on‑page cost remains implied rather than felt. The single tightening (second reading deepens to names/history) is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The projection booth and its paraphernalia are vivid and sensorially varied (dust, decayed film, rattling window, rain). Objects—the crystal and film strip—function as micro‑settings and charge the ending (lilac bloom and pocketed strip). While the environment does not tightly constrain choices, it frames access to the past and shapes tactics organically. Tone and atmosphere remain coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether love can be located/released; pressure coheres through the intensifying reading and discovery of Elise/Thomas. The reversal is modest: nothing at first, then a flood; a second attempt yields names and a past that reframes the present. Consequence is mostly conceptual; little is foreclosed beyond the implied life‑path choice. Tension is steady if gentle, with escalation more emotional than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of archived desire, memory as geography, and the ethics of noticing arise through particulars (hidden letters in canisters, lilac scent, Casablanca). Subtext lives in the objects’ afterlives and the idea of a “theater of light,” rather than overt speech. One line edges toward explicitness (“The unused love wasn’t lost; it was just waiting...”), slightly flattening resonance. The final image still reweights the premise effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a supple, gently lyrical cadence suits the material; sensory focus and diction feel character‑bound. Brief quoted lines from the vision read naturally and advance meaning. Psychic distance tightens at pressure points without leakage or head‑hopping. Rhythm varies enough to carry momentum without fuss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑forward, and largely economical; sentences often do double duty with setting and emotion. A few familiar turns (“ache in her chest,” “hushed thunder,” “perfect place to incubate that pain”) soften the edge of originality and introduce mild purple tint. No major loops or scaffold; action order and clarity remain intact. The final lines land cleanly with a charged image and minimal drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fusion of psychometry with a vintage theater archive and intergenerational letters is appealing, if built from familiar parts. Freshness comes from the “unused love as stored medium” conceit and the sensory specificity of the booth. Risk is modest; the piece opts for a quiet, assured cadence over surprise. It feels distinctive enough to linger without breaking ground.</comment>
