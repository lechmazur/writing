<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s kindly, methodical nature drives her tactics and choices, and her shift from invisibility toward public guardianship reads earned. Interiority is grounded in tactile action (pipe chases, prying the grille), though contradictory impulses (safety vs. visibility) surface more as statements than live friction. The “sense memory” complicates her certainty, but she encounters minimal resistance, reducing pressure on her interior conflict. Still, her micro-choices track her values credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: tape fragment → intensified memory → pursuit through pipe chases → decoder → message → choice to become a messenger. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (identity shift with implied cost to her invisibility). The “Project Lumen—Decoder” appears rather conveniently, softening the felt price of the pursuit. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single-scene coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is richly particularized (“sapphire hush,” stained glass, pipe chases) and constrains choices: crawling, prying a grille, using caches, and finding an industrial decoder in the basement. The environment and recurring objects (reel, decoder, crawl space) charge the final image of hidden guardianship. Sensory detail integrates with action, not just decoration. The library’s underbelly is lived-in and tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>There is a dominant stake (protecting the vulnerable by decoding the message) and one meaningful tightening (committing to the basement and activating the decoder). However, obstacles are minimal and coincidences assist rather than press (the labeled machine works immediately). The price of visibility is stated but not stressed on the page, so escalation feels modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of visibility/invisibility, stewardship, and memory as guidance cohere through images and action. Subtext in the “sapphire hush” and the hidden infrastructure suggests an ethics of quiet care. Final lines tilt toward explicit statement (“she was no longer invisible… a guardian, a keeper of secrets, and now, a messenger”), edging into mild moralizing. Still, the message-as-lifeline reweights the world with sincerity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a lyrical, tactile perceptual signature; diction suits a cautious, resourceful scavenger. The brief voices on tape are clean and effective. Rhythm modulates well between creeping precision and charged discovery. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong image economy and minimal scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs (mood, motion, character). Occasional purple tint (“sapphire hush” recurs, slightly ornamental by the end) but it mostly supports tone. Momentum remains clear; no significant loops or figurative muddle. Final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The crawl-space librarian with a ferromagnetic reel and a legacy “Project Lumen” cache feels fresh and specific. While the decoder’s convenience skirts trope, the synthesis of urban outage, hidden infrastructure, and caretaking identity is memorable. Emotional truth (quiet duty) outpaces twistiness. Risk is modest but coherent.</comment>
