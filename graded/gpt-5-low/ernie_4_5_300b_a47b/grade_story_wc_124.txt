<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s motive is clear and pressurized: her aromatically cautious nature collides with a need for answers, producing a credible hesitation → risk → reframe arc. Micro‑choices (waiting for UV, uncorking, inhaling, replacing the vial) track with embodied emotion (tears, tightening throat). The internal contradiction (fear of unraveling vs. curiosity) is present in scene, not just asserted. The epiphany lands slightly tidy, but it’s earned by the sensory ordeal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the UV activation and inhalation intensify pressure toward a conceptual re‑pricing of grief. Orientation is early and clean, and the reveal deepens options/meaning rather than flipping them mechanically. The closure is on‑page with cost (tears, risk embraced) and a before/after stance. Slight gentleness of external stakes keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse, UV panels, and extinct flora are not décor; they enable the method, impose timing, and charge the final images (crystal shadows fading, the city’s rain/woodsmoke). Sensory detail is vivid, purposeful, and filtered through a scent‑biased POV. The micro‑setting constrains choice (waiting for UV) and shapes the final reconfiguration. Integration is tight without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (risking emotional unraveling to understand her tears) is signaled early and tightened when she commits to UV revealing and inhales. A path is foreclosed: she abandons avoidance for engagement, paying with immediate vulnerability. The escalation is primarily internal but coherent and sufficient for the length. Cost is felt, if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece harmonizes memory, extinction, and grief with the perfume as vessel, and the final city walk reweights prior images. However, the explicit thesis line (“grief wasn’t something to be feared; it was a testament to love”) tips into didactic clarity, softening subtext. The strongest resonance is in the images (crystal shadows, silver vapor), not the overt moral. Still, the revaluation of sensitivity reads earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, sensuous, and plausibly filtered through a scent‑attuned mind. Rhythm modulates well from hushed observation to peak sensory inundation and back. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference remains within what she can know. A few elevated phrases brush sentiment, but control largely holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean and musical, with strong verb choice and high information density in sensory passages. Minor overwriting and repetition (the “transformation completed” motif appears twice) slightly dull momentum. Metaphor remains coherent and tactile (“silver vapor,” “crystal shadows”). The final cadence is clear and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—lantern broker, extinct plants, UV scent‑memory extraction—feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns arise from the premise rather than bolt‑on surprises, and the closure reconfigures value rather than announcing novelty. Emotional truth anchors the speculative flourish. Not radical, but distinct and memorable.</comment>
