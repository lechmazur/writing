<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive and temperament are crystal clear and consistent, and her choices (angling shutters, refusing to answer) align with a coherent inner stance. However, interior contradiction is minimal; she meets little counter‑pressure that forces a conflicted choice. Lines like “Her attribute was spiralingly calm” read as label‑insert rather than dramatized interiority. The endurance/renunciation at the end is credible but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues pressure through pattern‑making and a soft cadence shift as the canal’s “ache” eases; the final lingering patterns form a quiet Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean and single‑scene. Cost is implied (ongoing, solitary tending) rather than sharply felt, so the landing is resonant but modest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: cobalt dock, rain‑slick planks, rusted shutters, and reflected light all directly enable the tactic and final image. The dental mirror as micro‑setting/tool charges both process and parting moment. Sensory choices feel filtered through Lira’s practice. Weather and architecture materially shape the action, not just mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure remains coherent but gentle; the fisherman’s question glances off rather than tightening options, and no substantial price is extracted. The meaningful turn is a tonal softening of the canal’s tension, not a narrowed path. Agency is endurance and attention, but the cost is largely deferred and abstract. Stakes stay internal and low‑flash.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Resonance arises from image (light in darkness), but explicit statement (“core concept of silent empathy,” “motivation was clear”) dulls subtext. The final image reweights the premise subtly, yet the piece occasionally tells the theme rather than letting it emerge. Emotional aftertaste is gentle, not piercing. Less moralizing diction would heighten lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice is largely assured and sensorial, with a distinct perceptual signature. However, meta‑register intrusions (“Her attribute was…,” “core concept…”) break the diegesis and flatten the voice. POV remains stable; dialogue is minimal and functional. Rhythm is good, but the register mismatch prevents a higher tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is often elegant, with strong images and clean syntax. Yet several scaffold/label sentences (“Her attribute…,” “motivation was clear…”) read as prompt residue, reducing density and momentum. Occasional purple touches (“teach darkness the value of stars”) trend toward abstraction. Cutting the explanatory lines would sharpen propulsion and focus.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The amalgam of a canal guardian, a dental mirror as star‑caster, and shutter‑weaving is fresh and memorable. The tactic‑as‑art installation feels specific and non‑template. The quiet closure suits the concept. Minor reliance on overt thematic labeling keeps it from feeling utterly inevitable.</comment>
