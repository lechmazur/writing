<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and temperament are precise and consistent, with credible tension between institutional expectations and her compulsion to reframe the work through dust. Micro‑choices (sampling, monitoring the chrysalis, presenting at a local symposium) reveal values under pressure. The cost—professional skepticism and potential career drift—is visible. Interiority stays character‑particular without therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: density of observations builds to a reweighted stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she rejects the institute’s expectations, embraces a new method), tightened by the chrysalis spiral and the symposium reception. Orientation is clean from the start, and the flood→greenhouse damage→chrysalis→talk sequence coheres. The price is social/professional risk rather than a decisive external turn, but it’s legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storm‑damaged greenhouse is vivid and tactile; humidity, mold, silted drains, and tools are integrated into action and thinking. The environment constrains attention and enables discoveries (dust ingress, lodged chrysalis), charging the final images. Professional gaze shapes detail selection (spectrometer, particle counter) without exposition bloat. No white‑room stretches.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on identity and method: continue cosmic work or risk reputation by pursuing “trivial” dust. Pressure tightens via the institute’s call, the chrysalis’ unexpected patterns, and public exposure at the symposium, with visible social cost. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A single decisive narrowing (choosing to present this work) carries the piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—gradual change, humility before process, and unpredictability—emerges through specific images and actions (dust lattices, fungal growth, spiral shed). A few thesis‑like lines verge on telling, but they are anchored in concrete observation. The final exchange with the botanist shifts the inquiry from insular analogy to collaborative rigor, reweighting prior material. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice balances precise scientific diction with sensuous, grounded observation; metaphoric links (pulsars, accretion) feel earned by character. POV control is steady; modest dialogue is natural and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well across reflection and on‑page action. No head‑hopping or register breaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, efficient, and image‑dense with good propulsion. Minor lapses (“a moth‑eaten ferns frond”) and occasional on‑the‑nose statements slightly nick the polish. Figurative density stays coherent, and redundancy is minimal. Final images land clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis—neutron star researcher retooling method via butterfly dust in a wrecked greenhouse—feels distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking is controlled and purposeful, avoiding gimmickry. The chrysalis spiral as “survival read through dust” is a memorable, specific turn. The piece commits to its premise without hedging.</comment>
