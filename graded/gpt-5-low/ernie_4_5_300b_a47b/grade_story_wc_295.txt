<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s motive (decode inscriptions/find brother) is clear and consistent, and her reluctance to “bear the weight” vs. need to act gives credible internal friction. The decisive choice to witness—surrendering detachment—lands with felt cost (etched verse, acceptance of others’ burdens). Veyra’s pressure is relevant and timely. A few lines lean toward platitude, softening the rawness of the struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative climax: the scene builds from telegram → prism → choice → stabilized glyphs and reweighted meaning. Closure is on-page via a conceptual repricing—map of empathy with cost marked on her skin. Orientation is clean early and the causal steps hold. Stakes resolve quietly but coherently without gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Evocative, selective details—the crater‑edge observatory, frosted glass equations, brass sextant—are filtered through her vocation and mood. The prism-star apparatus functions as micro-setting that enables the key act and charges the final image. Atmosphere supports theme without over-signaling. Spatial logic is coherent across moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to decode or fail/lose the brother’s trail) tightens when Veyra reveals the temple’s rewriting and the need to “bear weight.” The meaningful turn is Lirael’s decision to witness before dawn, narrowing options and risking the fate that took her brother. The cost is more emotional than perilous, so pressure remains elegant rather than acute. Still, agency drives the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of empathy as cartography and knowledge as shared burden emerge through objects and action (prism, voices, stabilized glyphs). The final repricing—“a map, not of space, but of empathy”—resonates with prior particulars. Some thesis-forward lines (“The inscriptions are a language of shared burdens...”) reduce subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical but controlled register aligned to Lirael’s mind and craft. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and carries pressure. Rhythm modulates from contemplative to quietly charged at closure. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong cadence, precise imagery, and efficient line work; most sentences do more than one job. A few didactic formulations and metaphor densities brush purple but do not blur sense. No noticeable scaffold loops or filter stacks. The closing image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—lucid cartography, variable stars as empathic vectors, temple inscriptions rewriting as communal burdens—is fresh and coherent. The prism and etched lullaby localize the high concept in tactile, memorable ways. Risks are thoughtful and integrated rather than ornamental. Minor familiar phrasing prevents a higher mark.</comment>
