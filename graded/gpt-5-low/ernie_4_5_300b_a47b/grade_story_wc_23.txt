<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—mapping the “geography of loss”—is clear and consistently embodied in her choices (answering the calls, building the antenna, using hair as tradition). Interiority is specific (the tactile attention to the censer foot) but shows little contradictory impulse or cost beyond exhaustion and grief. Competence dominates without a hard trade-off or moral pinch. The grandmother’s voice offers pressure but not a crucible that forces a difficult renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the midnight calls and build steps layer into a coherent progression that culminates in the noon hum and final midnight sanction (“Now navigate”). Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the signals reweight reality, ghosts/routes answer, options expand. Orientation is solid early, and props/rules are carried through. The cost is primarily emotional and labor-based, modest but legible for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The signal station, ocean, and censer foot are tactile and purpose-driven; she harvests materials from the station and centers the foot in the build, which charges the final image. Sensory selection fits her vocation (wires, solder, static, chants), and world rules stay consistent. The environment constrains/empowers tactics rather than serving as backdrop. A hair more pressure from the elements could have pushed this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and advances through one meaningful tightening: the cryptic instruction cycle compels the build and culminates in activation. Pressure mounts, but opposition remains soft (no counterforce beyond time and uncertainty), so the felt price is relatively low. The final command (“Now navigate”) crystallizes a stance rather than a trade-off. Still, the cadence shift at activation works.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Loss, memory, and “reverse migration” are embodied through concrete acts (hair woven, censer foot’s weight, choir of navigation chants) rather than stated morals. The ending reweights the premise: her technical craft doubles as ritual, and the dead routes return as both map and chorus. Ambiguity stays purposeful without confusion. Slightly more friction between want and cost could deepen the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close holds steady and selects images that feel navigator-specific; the static-voice dialogue is brief but charged with subtext. Rhythm varies with pressure (build beats brisk, closure expansive) without head-hopping. No register drift or over-explaining. It’s assured rather than flashy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient, with strong noun-verb choices and purposeful metaphor (“antennae clawing… like skeletal fingers”). Minimal redundancy, good line-level propulsion, and clean mechanics. A few elevated images flirt with purple but remain controlled and pattern-consistent. The final images (hum, spin, chants) land clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—bronze censer foot as navigational talisman, moon-phase physics, reverse migration via hacked antenna and hair—feels freshly imagined and thematically integrated. Midnight phone calls carrying ancestral instruction is a smart, eerie device that avoids cliché. The risk reads organic, not ornamental. Only the low explicit cost keeps it from the top band.</comment>
