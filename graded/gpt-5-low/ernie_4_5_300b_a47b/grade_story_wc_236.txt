<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is tactile and character‑specific (anosmia shaping how she “reads” objects), and her micro‑choices—cleaning, noticing the engraving, deciding to write the note—align with her motives. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. yearning to connect) are present but understated. The inference to Eleanor is a touch neat, yet it tracks with her practiced interpretive lens. Felt cost is modest but credible: she risks presumption to offer meaning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: details accrue (fog, gears, engraving, photo) toward a resonant reconfiguration when she links the screw to Eleanor and returns it with a note. Closure lands as a quiet CR/RR rather than a decisive act, with a legible before/after in her stance. Orientation is clear early, and the single‑scene scope fits. Cost remains soft, tempering the ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The water clock shop and fog are vividly integrated and filtered through Lira’s bias; tools and textures are purposeful (algae‑clogged gears, lantern through mist). The screw and the clocks charge the final image and metaphorically constrain choice (tension, release, measured flow). Sensory balance is strong despite her anosmia. Slightly more environmental constraint on action could lift it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Lira responsibly unveil a buried “ordinary miracle”—is clear but the pressure remains gentle. The meaningful tightening arrives with the engraving and photo click, changing knowledge and prompting the note. Prices are implied rather than dramatized; no option is sharply foreclosed. Tension works at a quiet hum rather than a crank.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Resilience, redemption, and the humanizing of objects emerge organically through concrete particulars. However, lines like “She’d unveiled an ordinary miracle” and “humanizing the past” verge on thematic telling. The final image (chimes, lifting fog, shared losses) resonates without needing the explicit statement. Subtext in the object’s return does much of the work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable close third with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical and tactile imagery replacing smell) and controlled lyricism. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and diction suits the sensibility. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Minor elevated phrasing remains consistent with voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences often carry double duty. A few near‑summative lines soften momentum but do not obscure causality or the closing image. Figurative language is coherent and not overstacked. No evident loops or mechanical scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—a anosmic aromatherapist running a water‑clock shop who reads emotional residues in objects—is fresh and cohesive. The screw/clock tension analogy is elegant and earned. The closure is quiet yet distinctive. Risk is artistic rather than structural, and it largely pays off.</comment>
