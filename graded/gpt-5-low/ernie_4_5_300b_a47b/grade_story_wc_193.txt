<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s motive set (skepticism from cult survival, curiosity, “virtuously mischievous” pragmatism) cleanly drives the turn at the bolt. Interiority is concrete and particular (texts as “warnings,” the bolt’s voice) with credible hesitation. The cost is mostly conceptual—foregoing the lure of “diamonds”—so stakes feel slightly soft at the end. Dr. Voss is thinly sketched but functions as pressure rather than partner.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: pressure rises → diamonds destabilize → device prompts → choice to turn bolt → farm stabilizes with a conceptual reprice. Orientation is crisp early, and the decisive change is on the page. The “Turn it” instruction borders on convenient, but it’s pre‑seeded by the device and bolt resonance. Cost reads more as reweighting than consequence, trimming peak impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The geodesic dome, cobalt/violet fungi, and the porthole bolt are vivid and purposeful; the bolt constrains choice and charges the final image. Setting details are filtered through a mycologist’s bias and evolve with action (crystal spores, dissolution). World rules (conceptual pressure) stay coherent at this scale. A hair short of 9+ only because the environment’s cost imprint is more lyrical than binding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit (implode/collapse/death), pressure coheres, and escalation tightens toward a single choice. The decisive action is protagonist‑driven and resolves both external and internal tensions. However, the on‑page price for that choice feels light, and threat dissipates quickly after the turn. Tension at sentence level is steady but not jagged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of pressure translation, resilience after exploitation, and revaluing “diamonds” emerge through concrete beats and images. The final repricing lands, but “Diamonds are a metaphor” states the thesis too plainly, blunting subtext. The pyramid‑scheme past subtly informs the moral calculus without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, yet complexity narrows at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is controlled, with a tactile, idea‑savvy register that fits a wary mycologist. Dialogue is functional and pressurized; Dr. Voss’s lines carry urgency and status without exposition dumps. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure while staying within plausible lexicon. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are clean, information‑dense, and varied in rhythm; images like “sharp as regret” and “shadowseam” work. Minimal scaffold or loops; exposition is folded into action. A few stacked metaphors and explicit theme statements slightly soften edge in the final third. Overall propulsion and clarity remain strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High‑concept synthesis (conceptual pressure, quantum promise device, bioluminescent farm) feels distinct and internally coherent. The bolt as salvaged submarine relic is an inspired, specific pivot object. The final reconfiguration is earned, though a touch of on‑nose phrasing curbs the afterburn. Risk‑taking is purposeful and mostly lands.</comment>
