<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s fear of “losing him twice” versus her urge to graft meaning produces credible, embodied choice when she unclaspes the pendant and asks Elias to stay. Elias reads slightly idealized—gentle facilitator without visible edge—which softens interpersonal pressure. Micro-choices (stone‑placing, pendant opening, inviting him) align with motive and escalate vulnerability. The change is earned, with a felt cost in exposing the pendant’s contents.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: images and small acts densify until the pendant’s reconfiguration and sapling planting land a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate; the single scene coheres. Closure carries cost (relinquishing the pendant’s sealedness; inviting partnership) and reshapes the premise of grief as grafting. Stakes remain intimate but decisive within scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned data center/moss garden is vivid and purpose‑driven: servers as “anchors,” bioluminescent moss, the icicle‑drip map steering action. Environment guides choices (center placement, terrarium racks, sapling site) and charges the final image (pendant catching mosslight). It nearly constrains options, though the pressure is gentle rather than forcing. Sensory texture is balanced without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to integrate grief—tightens through the pendant reveal and the decision to let Elias in. The key turn is Lila’s exposure and modification of the pendant, followed by the explicit invitation to “Stay.” Costs are internal and legible, if softly rendered; external counterpressure is minimal, which keeps tension on the quiet side. Still, the deepening is motivated and reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The grafting metaphor integrates action and theme elegantly (orchid lessons → pendant graft → sapling), and subtext runs through silence and objects. A couple of on‑the‑nose lines (“You’ve been proactive about grief,” “healing wasn’t about erasing the past…”) nudge toward moralizing. The final image nonetheless resonates and reweights earlier particulars without didactic summary. Ambiguity remains humane and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Close third on Lila is steady; diction is lyrical but controlled; dialogue carries subtext and advances action (“anchors,” “heartbeat,” “grafting requires vulnerability”). Voices are distinct: Elias’s gentle precision contrasts with Lila’s rawness. No head‑hopping or stance slips, and rhythmic modulation supports pressure. Minor sentimentality does not breach voice integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and mostly multitask; metaphors (“honeyed hush,” “trapped time”) are coherent and consistent. A few familiar formulations (“Thank you,” “You did the hard part”) and one thematic tell slightly dull the edge. No scaffold loops or cadence templates bog momentum. The prose supports scene propulsion and lands the closing image crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of post‑tech ruin and living garden with grief-as-grafting feels fresh and specific. The icicle‑drip cartography and server racks-as-terrariums add distinctive texture and logic. Emotional turns are familiar but executed with originality through objects and method. Risks are quiet and cohesive rather than flashy, yielding a memorable synthesis.</comment>
