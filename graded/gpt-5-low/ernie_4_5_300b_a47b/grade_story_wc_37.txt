<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motive (rekindle a dying realm) and consistent agency (using the mica window and humming) carry the piece. However, Lira faces little on‑page resistance and shows minimal contradictory impulse or cost beyond fatigue and loneliness. Interiority is specific and embodied but rarely conflicted. The final stance (keep humming) is earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the child’s fragment → mica intake → humming → fruit ignition → night fraying. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the realm begins to mend while Lira accepts ongoing solitary labor. Cost is present but muted. Orientation is clear early; pattern is taught and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich, tactile worldbuilding (mica windows as lungs; fruit that “glowed like captured stars”) that integrates with action as Lira channels the song through the window and the orchard responds. Environment constrains and enables tactics, and the final image is charged by setting (“mica windows burned like tiny suns”). Sensory selection suits the lyric pressure. Minor bias toward the visual is offset by kinetic integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible (revive a dying realm), and escalation follows a clear intensification—discovering the child’s melody tightens options and compels the humming ritual. Still, the conflict remains largely uncontested; no reversal tests her commitment beyond endurance. The price (exhaustion, loneliness, ongoing duty) is felt but soft. The cadence shift reads, but pressure never truly bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory and the necessity of shadow arise organically from image and action (too much light erases memory; songs knit community). However, the line “Through forgotten songs, we remember how to live” states the thesis overtly and blunts subtext at the end. The final image still resonates, but sentiment shades toward didactic. Strong imagery does most of the work without needing the moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A confident, consistent lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (alchemical lexicon, tactile attention) and steady POV. Rhythm modulates well during the humming sequence and closing spread of light. Minor tendency toward lushness doesn’t obscure clarity. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density per sentence and purposeful metaphor. Occasional purple tilt and echoing constructions (“woven dawns,” “endless night”) skim redundancy but do not stall momentum. Syntax varies and images stay coherent to the world’s logic. Closing lines are cleanly staged despite one thematic overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard‑as‑lung ecology, mica windows, and “woven dawns” synthesize into a memorable, non‑obvious frame. The mirror‑world/twin realm device feels fresh here, particularly the critique of “too much light.” The resolution’s quiet Earned Stasis avoids neat heroics. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off.</comment>
