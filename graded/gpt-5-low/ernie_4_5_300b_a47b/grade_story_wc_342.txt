<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motives are clear and character‑particular (face‑blind artist who “memorized souls through textures”), and her choices (opening the panel, choosing to paint, taking the safe) align under pressure. Curiosity vs. caution appears but resolves quickly, with limited on‑page inner friction at peak beats. Embodied perception is strong; emotional contradiction could be sharper as the wrecking begins. The final stance (preservation over place) is credible though not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens held: causal discoveries (coin → panel → safe → journal) drive an accumulative reweighting toward preservation, culminating in a charged exit as demolition starts. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a felt cost (the tree falls; she leaves the portrait behind). The throughline stays coherent with no soft resets. Minor convenience (instant deciphering) is offset by prior setup of the coin and her perceptual acuity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: damp bark, parchment, the hollowed trunk’s hidden mechanics, and the demolition environment constrain timing and access. The oak and its carved library directly shape choices (the secret compartment, star alignment) and charge the final image. Sensory texture is filtered through her artist’s bias without museum‑tour excess. World rules feel consistent and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving a legacy under a live clock—is established early and tightens as discovery leads to action, then to demolition impact. The meaningful turn is her pivot from decay‑portrait to sky‑mirror, foreclosing rescue of place in favor of encoded memory. Costs are present but relatively gentle (no deep moral bind beyond urgency). Tension scales at sentence and beat level without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Preservation vs. loss and “mirroring the sky inside walls” accrue through objects and actions rather than speech, landing in a resonant final image. One on‑the‑nose line (“She’d discovered the guild’s limit...”) edges toward theme‑telling, softening the subtext. Still, the journal’s dictum reframed by her painting and exit provides a clean conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains purposeful (what future the safe enables) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—texture, hue, and pattern guide diction and noticing. Rhythmic control holds through pressure; lyricism does not blur action. No dialogue to test, but narrative certainty stays within what she can infer. Elision is modest and paid off (coin setup to panel reveal).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and purposeful; sensory detail often does double duty. Occasional elevated phrases risk mild purple but remain controlled and clear in peak beats. Minimal redundancy and varied sentence rhythm maintain propulsion. The final cadence is sharp and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—face‑blind painter decoding a star‑calendar inside a living library on the eve of demolition—feels fresh and organic. The coin mechanism and “mirror the sky” payoff avoid gimmickry and arise from seeded particulars. Emotional truth holds even as the conceit leans high‑concept. Not revolutionary, but distinctly memorable and coherent.</comment>
