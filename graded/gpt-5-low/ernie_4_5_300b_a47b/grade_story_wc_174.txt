<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt-driven motive (calligrapher complicit in elegizing exploitation) is specific and propulsive, and his calm, deliberate choices under scrutiny reveal character. Interiority is shown through tactile choices—the lantern, the runes, the reversal—rather than labels. The nurse and drifter apply pertinent social pressure. Slight on‑the‑nose thesis lines undercut complexity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single-scene arc is clean: setup of purpose, trial with skeptical audience, tightening via challenge, and a reconfiguration through reversal. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence shift when the audience moves from unease to release provides closure. Cost is lighter (conceptual acceptance of half-truths plus public risk) but present on the page. Orientation is crisp from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The radar dome’s ribs, echo, and curved wall shape tactics (projection surface, acoustics) and charge images throughout. The story stick functions as a micro‑setting/tool that anchors the final image. Detail is selective and POV‑filtered; the “hush after an argument” dyes the air of the place. World rules (runes/holograph) are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can he test a more ethical mode and earn a live audience—tightens when a drifter scoffs and he must commit to reversal rather than retreat. Pressure is coherent but gentle; the price is social credibility and the risk of failing publicly. The reversal is the lone decisive deepening and it lands. Costs don’t foreclose a path beyond conceptual stance, limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong thematic weave—mirrors vs crowns, light casting shadows—emerges through images and action, and the final campfire invitation resonates. However, explicit thesis statements (“Half-truths are the only kind worth telling”) flatten subtext at the apex. The story still invites reflection on ethics of representation without false balance. Resonance arises more from image than moral, which is good.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature fits Elias’s sensibility. Dialogue has subtext and social texture; Mara’s line about campfires extends theme without exposition. Rhythm modulates well from hush to laughter to quiet. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical; lines often do double duty (e.g., “serifed verses smooth as lies”). Figurative language is fresh and mostly disciplined; minimal redundancy or scaffold. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but don’t impede clarity or momentum. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>An urbane calligrapher wielding a rune-lit story stick for subversive shadow plays in a decommissioned radar dome is a fresh synthesis. The reversal mechanic literalizes the ethical thesis in an inventive way. Risks feel organic rather than gimmicky. Only the occasional thesis‑like line keeps it from higher.</comment>
