<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—listening to what walls have recorded—is clear and particular, embodied in tactile choices (probing ash, transcribing thread-letters). His sensitivity and scholarly curiosity feel consistent and drive action. Internal contradiction is light but present as awe vs. skepticism (“their eyes flickering with a light that wasn’t there before”). The final stance—opting to acknowledge the voices—lands as a credible endurance choice with a conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure tightens through discoveries (tapestry → letters → cross-reference → recognition) toward a clear on-page reconfiguration as the chorus rises. Orientation is crisp from the opening; causality reads as “attention unlocks response.” Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the world has not gone silent, we have. The cost is implied—accepting the haunting burden of listening—though it could be more explicit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The silo library is vivid and integrated (rust, steel ribs, ash, lantern, “bronze quiet”). Environment is not just backdrop: the walls as repository literally charge the final image. Objects (fireplace, railroad spikes, tapestry) are handled and recur with increased significance. The setting’s logic remains consistent and tactile throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the axis from ignoring to hearing—is signaled and deepens through patterned discoveries. The meaningful tightening occurs when the embroidered letters are decoded, reweighting all prior detail. Agency is attention/recognition rather than confrontation, appropriate to the lens. The on-page price is more conceptual than visceral, reducing peak intensity slightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of attention vs. indifference and stories as latent presences emerge through concrete images (ashes to walls, dragons fleeing). Clara’s diary edges toward explicit statement but remains embedded in action, not sermon. The final chorus reweights the initial “last dream” premise with a resonant answer. Ambiguity around the dragons as stories offers lingering interpretive depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and character-shaped by a historian’s tactile noticing. Diction and rhythm remain consistent; no head-hopping or stance slips. Quoted diary lines integrate smoothly without register clash. Compression is purposeful and legible through the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-dense with mostly clean syntax and momentum. Occasional elevated phrasing risks purple but stays coherent and purposeful. Information density is high; repeated stems or scaffolding are minimal. The final line crystallizes rather than over-explains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: walls that remember, a medieval tapestry encoding letters, and the displaced axis reframed as attention. The turn from “last dream” to “ignored dream” feels earned by particulars. Risk is taken in a quiet, conceptual climax that still lands on the page. A touch more concrete cost or complicating friction could elevate further.</comment>
