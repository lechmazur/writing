<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (cataloging turned truth‑seeking) is clear and her micro‑choices—sketching grooves, aligning the stamp—reveal a methodical, calm mind under pressure. The ritual of stamping vs. the need to adapt creates a subtle internal tension that credibly resolves into purpose. Embodied perception (vibration in stone, algae slick on stairs) grounds her emotions. The final resolve tilts tidy, but it’s earned by prior choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout → sound → bronze door → pattern traced → stamp unlock → journal revelation → decision to share. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when) and the single transition to surface is legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt weight (“heavy” truth) and a concrete act (taking journal, leaving door ajar, swimming out). Cost is more emotional than hazardous, but present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken library is tactile and operative: darkness, water damage, algae light, and rusted hinges constrain tactics and stage the puzzle. The owl stamp functions as a tool‑as‑setting element, charging the final image. World rules (submerged yet preservable chamber) hold within the frame. Detail selection reflects Lira’s professional eye rather than a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover the city’s honest origins) is clear; pressure coheres through the metal groan, locked door, and deciphering task. The tightening turn is the door’s code and the decision to press the stamp. Costs are modest—risk and emotional weight—so escalation reads more inward than perilous. Still, agency drives the solve and the concluding commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Through particulars (ritual stamp, vault, algae light), the theme of truth vs. curated myth emerges, culminating in “lost to itself.” However, the journal’s explicit thesis and the closing “Some darknesses, once faced, become light” edge toward moralizing. The owl crest’s vigilance and blackout motif provide effective subtextual chords despite some telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A steady close third with measured, lyrical diction fits Lira’s temperament and task. The perceptual signature (methodical noticing shaped by profession) remains consistent; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well between hush and discovery. Occasional elevated phrasing skims purple but stays controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are largely clean and purposeful, with strong sensory economy (vibration, rust, algae glow). Minor redundancy and a few ornamented constructions (“dappled resolve,” “tranquilly perceptive nature”) soften momentum in the final third. Syntax varies, and images mostly do double duty. No major artifacts or clarity breaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sunken‑city library plus an owl stamp as key, bioluminescent jars, and an archival protagonist is a fresh synthesis. The “truth sank the city” conceit risks allegorical obviousness but is personalized through Lira’s ritual and method. Turns feel earned by prior setup. It’s imaginative without gimmickry.</comment>
