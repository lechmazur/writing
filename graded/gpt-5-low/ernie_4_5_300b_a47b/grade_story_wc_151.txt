<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear personal motive (decode the margins tied to “A. Starling”) and embodied pursuit; she makes active, competent choices under pressure. Interiority is specific (chalk spirals, kinetic clipboard) though internal contradiction is light. The emotional pivot on the grandmother hologram lands, but the cost reads more as resolve than fraught trade‑off. Minor safety in psychology and a tidy final resolve keep this short of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: decode margin → carrier/letter → margin message → fountain test → hidden chip → hologram revelation → new mission. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; prop states and world rules stay coherent. Closure is on‑page (conceptual repricing toward a mission), though cost is soft. The chain never stalls, but the final beat explains its epiphany a touch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The golden arcade is vivid and functional: AI‑imbued walls, fountain “heart,” dawn refractions that match chalk codes, all filtered through Lira’s professional eye. Environment and tools (clipboard, fountain) constrain options and enable the discovery. Sensory selection serves urgency and theme; no tourist cataloging. High marks capped by slight lyric overreach in one moralizing line.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding the margins to recover a thread to her past) is signaled early and deepened by the letter’s arrival and the fountain revelation. Escalation coheres through Lira’s agency; the clue chain narrows options effectively. Price is primarily emotional/missional rather than a foreclosed alternative, muting intensity. Still, the tightening beat at the fountain reads cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resonant motifs—chalk, surface mail, relic tools—organically grow a theme of endurance via analog traces. The grandmother’s message reframes the arcade as an archive, charging the final image. However, “Futuristic nostalgia wasn’t about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it” states the thesis, thinning subtext. More could be implied through image rather than told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Confident close third with a distinct perceptual signature (tech‑meets‑tactile noticing). Dialogue is sparse but functional and registers distinct voices. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance drift. A few expository bends (AI praise line; final thesis sentence) slightly flatten the texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong line‑level control with purposeful detail density; most sentences carry multiple jobs. Occasional purple gloss and one paraphrase‑adjacent moral line create minor drag. Mechanics are clean; choreography and causality remain lucid. The prose is polished but reins in just short of razor‑tight in the final paragraph.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: kinetic clipboard, chalk cryptography under a glass arcade, and resurgent surface mail build a memorable frame. The familial hologram turn is familiar but integrated through earlier phoenix seal/chalk cues. The piece commits to its vision without gimmickry. It stops short of a strikingly non‑obvious moral calculus or stark cost that would elevate it further.</comment>
