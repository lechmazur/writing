<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (restore the fading nexus) is clear and embodied through tactile choices under risk, with Jorin adding crucible pressure. Her shift from forcing control to listening is motivated by history (failed engines) and the ledger prompt, not a tidy epiphany. Internal contradiction—fear of another explosion vs. resolve—registers credibly. The cost is mostly emotional/intellectual rather than materially paid, which softens impact slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation is immediate; the ledger reveal causes a reframed tactic, leading to the decisive act and stabilization—an on‑page Decisive Change with a conceptual repricing. Cost is implied (risk, prior losses, surrender of control) but the success comes quickly once she pivots, keeping the price felt but not biting. The structure stays within a single pressured scene and closes cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (ember nexus, cooled lava shards, prismatic lens) are filtered through Elara’s professional bias and charge the final image as the nexus warms. Objects-as-setting (shell and engine) concretely shape tactics and outcome. The environment’s cold/fading heat applies soft pressure rather than hard constraints. Sensory balance and world rules remain consistent and economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the nexus) is signaled early; the ledger intensifies pressure by narrowing tactics to a risked, new approach. The key tightening is Elara choosing uncertainty over control despite prior explosions. While the scene lacks a fresh complication post‑pivot, the choice under danger earns the resolution. Costs are more conceptual than materially paid.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of revaluation, perspective, and letting the object “speak” emerge through concrete acts (placing the shell, listening to resonance) rather than sermonizing. The final image reweights failure as a resource—credible conceptual repricing. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“The palette…isn’t just for mixing perspective”), but the scene earns it. Resonance lingers without false symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a lyrical, sensate texture suits the concept; dialogue feels purposeful and distinct between Elara and Jorin. Rhythm modulates under pressure, and subtext (mirror/foil dynamic) sits in implication more than explanation. Diction remains consistent to the POV’s lexicon. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and purposeful imagery (“a sound like a thousand crickets waking”), carrying momentum. Occasional abstract terms are grounded by physical beats, avoiding purple excess. Minimal repetition; syntax varies to match scene energy. The final cadence is clean, image‑driven, and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Pocket‑sun alchemist,” “ember nexus,” and “palette of resolve” synthesize into a distinctive, coherent vision. The central turn—letting the shell guide—feels specific rather than template cleverness. Risk lies in marrying technical and lyric registers, and it works without obscuring clarity. Freshness is sustained through object‑driven action rather than ornament.</comment>
