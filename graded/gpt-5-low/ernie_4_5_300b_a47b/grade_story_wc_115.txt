<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, consistent drive (reckless explorer seeking buried truth) and micro-choices under pressure (fitting/turning the wheel, descending, confronting the panel, leaving the wheel). Skepticism fraying gives credible internal tension, though contradictions could cut deeper at the peak. Embodied reactions (“breath fogged,” “hands trembled”) land. The final renunciation (leaving the wheel) carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: rumor → tunnel → wheel fits intake → shaft opens → descent → wheel in panel → hologram reveal → conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean early and held. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a visible cost-image; only minor convenience (the perfect fit twice) slightly softens pressure logic. Single scene window stays coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: condensation, ivy-choked mouth, crumbling cap, humming chamber. The valve-as-object and tunnel environment constrain choices and charge the final image (leaving the wheel as sentinel). Sensory selection tracks urgency and profession. World rules (industrial remnants, hologram) feel consistent within the piece’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (unearth the buried truth), with one strong tightening (activating the intake/shaft → descent → panel activation → reveal). Agency drives the escalations; the price is a reweighted burden and renunciation rather than a hazardous tactical trade-off. Stakes are more epistemic than survival, but tension holds at sentence and beat levels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arc reframes the “ghost” as human failure; motifs (hunger, wheel, hum/hush) accrue and the final sentinel image resonates. One on-the-nose line (“found something worse: human failure, amplified by greed and fear”) edges toward moralizing, slightly dulling subtext. Otherwise, meaning arises through action and image. The ending’s refusal carries thematic weight without tidy absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is steady, diction controlled, and rhythm modulates with pressure. Dialogue snippets feel motivated and propel plot/subtext (the machine’s voice, the psychic clip). Elevated phrasing suits the mood without breaking character plausibility. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lean, propulsive lines; concrete verbs and purposeful images with minimal scaffold. Figurative language (“hush that followed a sudden confession”) is apt and not overstacked. Syntax varies to pace beats; no paraphrase loops or cadence templates dull the climax. Final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Industrial haunting reframed as cover-up feels fresh enough, especially with the talk-radio-psychic cross-referencing and the wheel as talisman/tool. Not wholly novel, but the synthesis is specific and cohesive to this narrator. The hologram’s period detail and the object’s evolving charge lift it above template. Risks are measured and land cleanly.</comment>
