<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s obsession, tremor, and ritualized “bathroom” sanctuary render a specific, embodied psyche under pressure. Contradictions (“organizes chaos,” yet “crumbles” with her own past) inform her choice to claim the legacy. Micro‑choices (asking the orchard, stepping into the grotto, pressing the cameo) align with motive. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening the transformation’s sting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: letter → orchard clues → grotto vision → cameo map → tree fusion. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—she chooses to inherit by fusing the cameo, foreclosing institutional obedience. Orientation is lucid from the opening. The price is implied (career, sanity risk), not dramatized, but still legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astral orchard and grotto are vivid and purpose‑driven; the environment produces clues (shell, map) and hosts the final act (tree fusion). Sensory detail stays selective and POV‑filtered (liquid light, blue‑glowing soil). World rules are learned through action (the cameo’s shifting). Setting charges the last image without devolving into postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to embrace forbidden, nonlinear inheritance—tightens from curiosity to committed act. The key deepening beats (portrait shell, library vision, map) narrow options toward the tree. Resolution is decisively hers, with institutional defiance implied. Pressure remains mostly internal, so the felt price is restrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: legacy as choice, lived truth over curation, and perception as inheritance. The recurring object (cameo) and the orchard reweight meaning at the end. The line “You inherit what you choose to see” edges toward overt thesis but is supported by concrete turns. The final smile of “brightened disquiet” avoids moralizing while leaving a charged aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is steady, with a controlled, lyrical register that matches a curator’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well from wonder to resolve. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and interiority stays within plausible knowledge. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet imagistic; most lines do double duty (world‑build and move). Figurative choices are coherent and not overstacked; cadence varies. Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops or filter‑verb stacks. The closing image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pistachio cameo and astral orchard synthesize into a fresh engine for “nonlinear inheritance.” The bathroom‑as‑grotto method is an inventive personal ritual that shapes discovery. Risks feel intentional and integrated; the turn to the tree is inevitable in hindsight. Only the familiar “forbidden knowledge” note keeps it shy of the rarest band.</comment>
