<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clara’s motive (to rehumanize the victim through empathy) is clear and enacted through specific choices: coming to the quarry, sketching the terrain, directing Voss to trace. Internal contradiction is mild—competence and intuition rarely collide—so stakes feel more principled than fraught. The Clara–Voss dynamic adds pressure and contrast in method. The closing renunciation of numbness is credible though lightly priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, the beats link cleanly: ribbon → sketching pattern → drag imprint/handprint → locket → decision to reopen. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: Clara “sees” Lila and reweights the case from artifact to person, with the reopening as a concrete outcome. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially dear. Orientation is solid from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misted quarry is vivid and purposive: geometry guides the sketching tactic, the pit focuses danger, and the lantern shapes visibility. Environmental details evolve with action (indentation found; glint reveals locket) and the lifting mist modulates tone at closure. The setting charges the final image (portrait/ribbon/stone) without resorting to postcard description. Good sensory economy beyond the purely visual.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover meaning/humanity in a cold case) is clear early and tightens with tactile discoveries (handprint, locket). Agency remains with Clara’s method guiding Voss’s action, though opposition is soft (no antagonist beyond uncertainty). The escalation deepens knowledge rather than narrowing options, which fits the lens but keeps cost modest. The “reopen the case” line provides concrete consequence without feeling contrived.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of empathy versus procedure and “unifying opposites” accrue through image and action, culminating in Clara finally “seeing” Lila. However, explicit thesis statements (“Empathy’s never truly dormant…”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. Strong recurring objects (ribbon, mask, locket) carry real thematic load. The final juxtaposition (death/life, forgetting/remembering) lands even if slightly declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains cleanly with Clara; perceptual signatures (texture/light as facial proxies) are consistent and character‑specific. Dialogue has subtextual tension (art vs. evidence) and moves the scene. Diction occasionally leans elevated but generally suits Clara’s sensibility. Rhythm controls pressure without drift or head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is precise and image‑dense with few redundancies; lines often do double duty (mood and function). A couple of thematic refrains (“Opposites unified”) flirt with abstraction but do not stall momentum. Syntax varies and reads aloud cleanly; no figurative muddle at peak beats. Typos and mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The face‑blind artist using tactile perception to crack a cold case in a misted quarry feels fresh and integrated. The masquerade ribbon as a plea for recognition is a strong reframe. Genre moves are familiar but re-inflected through character‑specific method. The piece plays it safe in conflict intensity, but the conceptual angle is memorable.</comment>
