<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marlow’s motive (to face inherited grief) is clear and his actions—returning nightly, unrolling the ribbon, finally reading his poem—align with a credible inner shift. Interiority is embodied through trade-specific texture (gravestones, chisel-calloused hands) and the greenhouse’s sensory pressure. Contradictory impulses (silence vs. speaking) are present, though the cost is more implied than felt. The ending choice to carve “not by loss, but by love” reads earned, if a touch neat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: repeated visits, density/cadence increase with the butterfly flood, and a final poem produces a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why within the opening), and the spectral guide is established early and sustained. Closure lands via the on-page reading and post-choice reorientation, with a legible cost of vulnerability. Some beats summarize the middle “returns,” but they feed the closing cadence rather than dilute causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and integrally bound to action and tone (rattling glass, damp earth, lantern flare, butterflies against panes). It charges the final image and functions as repository/pressure rather than mere backdrop. The ribbon, lantern, and butterflies recur with evolving weight. While the environment doesn’t force a physical choice, it meaningfully frames and intensifies the emotional one.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he break silence and claim the family grief-language—tightens toward the final night of migration. The escalation is a patterned deepening (presence, voice, mounting butterflies) culminating in the poem read aloud. The visible price is largely interior (exposure, acceptance), which registers but could be more viscerally tested. Still, the cadence shift at the end is decisive for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of grief-as-bridge and word-as-endurance emerge through particulars (family poems, carving, the greenhouse’s memory). The butterfly migration reweights meaning at closure without overexplaining. A couple of explicit lines (“Because words outlive us”) skim close to thesis but are dramatized by the final act. The last image resists sermonizing and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective craftsman; spectral dialogue fits the register. Rhythm modulates with pressure (trickle to flood), and diction stays coherent. Occasional phrasing edges toward purple but maintains clarity. POV boundaries hold without leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, musical, and image-rich; most lines do multiple jobs. A few familiar constructions (“both a prison and a sanctuary,” “like living embers”) flirt with cliché but don’t blunt momentum. Syntax varies well, and transitions are efficient. No loops or scaffold that dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Gravestone carver + spectral mentorship via inherited poems in a living greenhouse during a butterfly migration is a fresh synthesis. Turns feel earned by the established pattern rather than tricked. The ending’s reframing choice is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Not radical, but confidently singular.</comment>
