<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (seek where unused love is stored; shift from documenting to healing), and interiority is embodied through breath and sensory shifts. The artist-versus-healer tension surfaces credibly (“images…secondary to what she felt”). However, pressure is gentle and the cost of the final stance (foreclosing the documentarian mode) is only lightly felt. The arc convinces but remains tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ingestion → breath‑led perception → trail → pool → repriced understanding. Orientation is clean early and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing (“stored…between breaths”). Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized loss, but it does reweight her role. Two‑shard flow (viaduct→woods→return) stays coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and filtered (“flowers…lit from within,” hum of the viaduct), and the environment actively enables tactics (fog pulled into lungs; embers trail; pool activation). The viaduct frames the opening and close, charging the final image. World rules are learned through observation/action without dumps, and specificity feels integral rather than postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the outset, and escalation deepens via chosen risk (taking the Tear) and method (breath revealing the path, then activating the pool). Pressure remains inward and lyrical, with limited visible price. The tightening is sufficient for this length, though the resolution’s cost reads more as serene repricing than a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme coheres around revelation, compassion, and transmutation of “unused love,” and the ending reweights prior images via breath and in‑between spaces. Some lines verge on explicit statement (“She had found where unused love was stored”), softening subtext. Still, the recurring motifs (camera/shadow, breath, sparks) develop meaning organically and leave a gentle after‑resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person close maintains a steady perceptual signature with controlled rhythm and sensory bias consistent with Lira’s vocation. The diction is confident and modulates during peak beats (pool glow) without head‑hopping. No dialogue, but prose carries action and subtext cleanly. Minor lushness never obscures focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, with varied cadence and purposeful imagery that often does more than one job. Occasional purple tendencies and reiterations of glow/mist risk sameness but don’t stall momentum. Syntax supports the accumulative pressure, and scaffolding is minimal. The final image lands clearly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—camera obscura artist, Kwan Yin’s Tear, breath as method, pilgrim of sparks—feels fresh and coherent. The central insight is familiar in theme but gains distinctiveness through specific objects and ritualized breathwork. Risk‑taking is measured and effective without gimmickry. It stops short of a startlingly non‑obvious turn, but the vision is authentic.</comment>
