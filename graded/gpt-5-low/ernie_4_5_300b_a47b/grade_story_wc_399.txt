<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—preserve the echo—drives concrete choices, and her “strange honesty” carries a small relational cost when the prophet recoils. Interiority is present via her peripheral awareness but remains mostly functional rather than richly contradictory. The prophet is thinly sketched, applying little counter‑pressure beyond ritual collaboration. The final endurance—she will keep walking the line—reads earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds from arrival to consecration to a quiet reset. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (“For now”) with the system reconfigured but intact. Causality is clear, but stakes resolve without a hard turn or price beyond exertion and exposure. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The world is vividly particular—the murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and whisperfield operate through action, not exposition. Environment materially participates (parapet glows, rises, locks; pavilion urges and then falls silent), charging the final image. Sensory and conceptual specificity stay consistent and purposeful. Rules feel coherent within this mythic frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear, but pressure stays gentle; consecration proceeds with minimal resistance. The mask’s fall and the prophet’s brief recoil offer a flicker of cost, not a tightening that forecloses real options. No reversal tests the commitment; escalation is mainly a ritual crescendo. The “for now” cadence hints at deferred stakes rather than on‑page consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of guardianship, honesty as risk, and preserving living memory arise organically from particulars (mask reveal, living archives, “for now”). Subtext hums beneath ritual rather than being stated, and the closing image reweights balance and vigilance. However, the resonance remains gentle; the insight doesn’t deepen into a sharper moral calculus or loss. No late moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person maintains consistent distance and diction; the voice suits the mythic register. Dialogue is minimal but functional and distinct enough (“Your honesty is disarming,” “Strangely honest, they call me”). No head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well through the ritual’s rise and settling.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑rich with good momentum; lines often do double duty (world and action). Occasional purple strain and echo (“whisperfield calm,” repeated hums) slightly thicken texture without adding pressure. No major loops or filter‑verb stacks; syntax varies cleanly. Final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “kinetic parapet,” “peripheral awareness,” and “conjured clearings” synthesize into a fresh ritual ecology. The mythic tone avoids boilerplate fantasy fixtures and feels singular. Ingenuity is strong though the conflict architecture is familiar and low‑risk, tempering impact. Still, the conceptual weave and charged objects feel memorable.</comment>
