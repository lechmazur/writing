<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eleanor’s motives—restlessness to “reawaken” stories—are clear and embodied through tactile choices (keeping the scarf, staying after hours, tracing diagrams). Her interiority is specific and consistent, with a credible contradiction between librarian rigor and mystical risk-taking. The change to quiet authority the next morning reads earned if low-cost. The only ding is the absence of significant on‑page resistance to test her resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and conceptual patterning (scarf/geometry/poem) build to a resonant reconfiguration. Causality is clean: scarf + hyperbolic visualization → portal → poem → altered library. Closure lands with a felt before/after, though the cost is more conceptual (responsibility, uncanny risk) than dramatized. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the midnight turn is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is vivid and purposeful—Edison bulbs, lavender ink, math‑shelves beside sonnets—filtered through a librarian’s eye. The scarf functions as a charged micro‑setting/object that constrains approach (tactility as “key”) and returns in the final image. The library’s “breathing” and floating manuscripts evolve with events. Strong sense of place without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken the stories) is clear, with a single tightening at midnight that changes options. Escalation is internal and atmospheric rather than oppositional; the risk/cost remains soft. The mirror corridor and portal room are good pressure peaks but resolve without a hard trade‑off. Effective for a quiet piece, but not maximally testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres: analog memory vs. digital, “mapping the impossible,” and stories as living entities converge in action. Subtext in tactile rituals and geometry-as-language mostly carries weight; a few on‑the‑nose lines (“They don’t just inform—they transform”) flatten nuance slightly. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, third‑limited through Eleanor with a distinct perceptual signature (texture, scent, math‑poetry analogies). Dialogue is brief but natural and advances aims, with a clear idiom contrast between the patron and Eleanor. Rhythmic control modulates from hush to hum without head‑hopping. No unmotivated register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, textured, and efficient; images (lavender, Edison bulbs, raised silk threads) do multiple jobs. Occasional aphoristic lines flirt with purple or thesis‑statement territory but do not swamp momentum. Syntax varies and supports the turn at midnight. Minimal scaffolding or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, analog tactility, and a living library feels fresh and specific. The portal trope is revitalized by the method (visualizing curvature as access) and the librarian‑archivist frame. The ending avoids gimmickry, opting for a quiet repricing of reality. Strong, memorable inflection without overexplaining.</comment>
