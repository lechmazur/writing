<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s curiosity and meticulousness motivate concrete choices (fetching the lens, following the map), and his shift from registrar to “translator of silence” reads earned. Interiority is specific (ticket textures, breath in cold air), though his internal contradiction (faith in words vs trust in silence) could surface with more embodied friction at the moment of renunciation. Lira works as a pressure‑applying foil with clear status control, but she remains largely emblematic. The final refusal to write aligns with his arc but the on‑page cost is implied more than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive: details (doodles → lens → crystals) build toward a conceptual repricing where logging yields to listening. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and each beat coheres causally enough for the chosen lens. Closure lands in the “Begin” ticket and the doodled lens—a reweighted role with a quiet, credible price. The cost is mostly conceptual; a more explicit foreclosing gesture beyond not writing would lift impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt after rain is vivid and purposeful; environmental phenomena (post‑rain hum) enable the meeting and decode. The projector lens as micro‑setting/object shapes tactics and charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Elias’s registrar perspective. Slightly more constraint from space or weather on movement could elevate to the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will Elias accept a truth‑based, wordless mode—tightens as he uses the lens, confronts Lira, and commits to decoding through the night. The walk‑through decoding sequence is a credible deepening rather than a mere montage. The resolution is driven by his stance crystallization (not writing), but the price is soft, with minimal visible loss or risk. A sharper trade‑off on the page would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of honesty beyond speech accrues through objects and choices (lens clarifies, tickets as keys). Subtext operates in the crystals’ hum and the final doodle invitation. However, lines like “Words, he realized, were overrated. Sometimes, honesty was enough…” tilt toward explicit moralizing, blunting resonance. The piece still invites reflection through its final image, if a touch stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Controlled third‑person close with a quiet, polished cadence that suits the material. Dialogue is spare, subtextual, and advances pressure; voices are distinct (Lira’s calm authority vs Elias’s tentative curiosity). The narrative lexicon stays consistent to Elias’s sensibility. Minor lyric turns occasionally generalize, but they don’t break POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean sentences with varied rhythm; images like “gleamed like a promise” risk familiarity but mostly land. Information density is solid and scaffolding minimal; transitions read smooth. A few abstract or slogan‑adjacent lines dilute the otherwise tactile specificity. No material loops or figurative muddle at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tickets as unfinished conversations decoded via a cracked projector lens in a humming crystal forecourt feels fresh and organically integrated. The final reconfiguration (doodled lens invitation) is an elegant, non‑obvious reprise. Lira as archetype leans familiar, but the synthesis of objects and rules distinguishes the piece. Emotional truth is present without gimmickry.</comment>
