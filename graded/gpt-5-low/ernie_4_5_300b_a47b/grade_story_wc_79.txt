<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lira’s motive matrix—grief, obsession, curiosity—drives clear micro‑choices (digging, whistle codes, flight, final defiance). Embodied perception (“air tasted of salt and iron,” trembling hands) grounds emotion without label‑speak. Internal contradiction is present but light (famine vs. answers); most beats read single‑goal driven. The final stance—standing with the journal as the city heaves—registers as earned endurance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: mural → whistle → crack → tunnel → journal → watchers → repriced city. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the gate’s true purpose and the shells’ hunger reweight everything as the city physically turns against its inhabitants. Cost is visible on the page (collapsing tunnels, screaming populace, narrowed options). A touch of convenience (finding the mother’s specific final entry) slightly softens rigor but not the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The city‑of‑shells is tactile and rule‑bearing, shaping action (crack access, tunnel collapse) and charging the ending as the shells wake. Sensory economy is strong (brine, decay, static, grinding edges) and filtered through Lira’s cartographic bias. Recurring objects (whistle, journal) function as micro‑settings constraining choice. World rules (patterns, keepers, rusted gate) stay consistent and pay off at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the truth in a sealed city—tightens coherently: investigation triggers awakening, turning knowledge‑seeking into communal peril. Agency drives turns (she opens the crack; she plays the codes), and each apparent answer births a worse problem. The price is unmistakable in the city’s upheaval and foreclosed safety. The watchers’ passivity at the end keeps the conflict charged rather than neatly resolved.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of misread guardianship, the predatory foundation under civic myths, and obsession vs. survival accrue through particulars rather than thesis. The final insight (“keep us in”) reweights prior images without moralizing. The whistle/pattern motif evolves from language to countdown, deepening subtext about communication and warning. Ambiguity around the watchers’ intent remains purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A steady close third with lyrical texture and disciplined certainty—no head‑hopping or unjustified omniscience. Diction is specific to Lira’s perceptual signature (cartographic grooves, pattern logic) and modulates under stress. Embedded text (journal) sharpens voice contrast without disrupting stance. No withholding gimmicks; elisions serve momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry dual duty (world + pressure) with few redundant scaffolds and good rhythmic variation. Figurative language is vivid but controlled; metaphors align with the marine/shell lexicon, avoiding muddle. Action sequencing is clear at high tempo (crack → tunnel → collapse → emergence). Minor density spikes don’t impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—drowned turtle‑city, pattern‑language as countdown, “keepers” misread as statues—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and closure image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The reed‑whistle code and cartographic sensibility personalize the premise beyond trope. The final turn reframes the entire worldlogic with elegant economy.</comment>
