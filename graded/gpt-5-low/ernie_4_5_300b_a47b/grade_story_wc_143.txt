<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—capture and mark “the last hush”—is clear and consistent, with concrete micro-choices (placing and timing the vial, framing the photo). Interiority is textured through sensory focus and family legacy without therapy-speak. Internal conflict is mild; she’s rarely torn, so cost feels more elegiac than pressured. Still, the Earned Stasis—accepting obsolescence while acting anyway—reads credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure is clean: a tight countdown to dawn and drones, climax on the dissolving grain, then a brief coda that reweights meaning. The accumulative lens holds; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where her act gains post-facto validation by the archivist. Cost is conceptual (meaning vs. automation) rather than material, but legible on the page. Orientation is crisp from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The moon’s summit, airless chill, Earth’s crescent, and the sharp-edged fresh crater are vivid and POV-filtered. Environment and tools (visor, headlamp, vial, camera) shape timing and options, culminating in the charged final image of golden gas over the crater. World rules (vacuum, dawn’s edge, drones) read consistent and functional. The setting meaningfully charges the closing beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving a human mark before automation—tightens via the live clock and approaching drones. The meaningful deepening is the dawn-triggered dissolution and photograph capture just before interruption. Opposition is light and largely atmospheric; the price is primarily existential. Still, the cadence shift at dawn provides a tangible escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of care versus indifference and human trace outlasting utility accrue through the grain, the photo’s shadow, and the archivist’s later recognition. The grandfather’s maxim risks on-the-nose but is grounded by concrete action. The final resonance—truths existing without audience—arrives through particulars rather than sermon. The reprise years later deepens the moral weight without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Close third voice is steady, lucid, and gently lyrical, suited to “dawnlit melancholy.” Diction is character-appropriate with controlled cadence; reflective lines are tethered to present stimuli and actions. No head-hopping or stance drift; distance modulation is subtle but clean. The voice carries subtext without resorting to abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is tight with strong verbs and image economy; sentences vary rhythmically to match the countdown. Figurative language (mirror, hush, hourglass) is coherent and not over-stacked. Minimal redundancy and no template loops that sap momentum. Closing image lands cleanly without purple overflow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The microcapsule “hourglass” signal at lunar dawn and archivist reprise give a fresh inflection to human-vs-automation tropes. The concept blends science detail with a poetic stake in a specific, memorable way. Not radical, but confidently executed with integrated motifs. The final reweighting feels earned rather than gimmicky.</comment>
