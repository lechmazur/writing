<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—“to harvest insights from failure”—is dramatized through specific, pressured choices (playing, descending, risking a discordant attempt, then accepting surrender). Contradictory impulses are live: grief and fear versus duty and curiosity. The visible cost (snapped reeds) and the final renunciation (etching a surrender rune) make the change earned. Minor archetypal tint remains, but interiority stays concrete and embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with an accumulative close: causal beats (play → fissure → descent → discordant attempt → break → silence-revelation) deliver a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure lands with cost: the broken flute and a reweighted rule (“power lies…in its silence”) that reconfigures options. Orientation is clean from the opening. No soft reset; the new rune concretizes the after-state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Thunder‑Echo Range and the Veil’s Edge are tactile and functionally integrated; sound and stone actively shape tactics and meaning. The flute and driftwood serve as micro‑settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone, petrified pine, the canyon’s hush). World rules are learned through action (music opens the obsidian stair; silence closes the lesson).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens: playing to bridge becomes playing to unmake, which forces a harder attempt that breaks the tool. The starfield of failures is a clear deepening, and the snapped reeds are a concrete price that narrows options. Resolution stems from altered stance (surrender) rather than convenience. Stakes remain personal but felt; the quiet ending carries charged consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme arises organically from action—failure, surrender, and the paradox of silence as power—refracted through the flute and driftwood. The mentor’s line risks stating the thesis too directly, but the final acts (etching a new rune; carrying fragments) embody it without moralizing. The silence note reweights prior material with resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively around “unmake.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and lyrical with a distinct perceptual bias (sound, stone, scent). Psychic distance is steady; dialogue is sparse yet subtextual, advancing pressure rather than explaining it. Rhythmic modulation suits beats (needle through silk; avalanchingly quiet note). No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and clean propulsion; images often do double duty (obsidian bleeding to starfield). A few high‑register flourishes verge on purple but remain legible and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or template cadences; syntax varies to match tempo. Final image is sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Familiar fantasy elements are revitalized by specific, uncanny turns (silence as the true bridge; driftwood runes; moth‑dissolving mentor). The unmaking of failure as method feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in imagery and structure pay off without obscuring clarity. Minor trope‑echoes keep it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
