<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation and tactically expressed competence (threading, symbol choice, plate alignment) create a coherent throughline. Interiority is sensory and character‑specific, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely hesitates or reveals competing impulses. The small costs (raw fingers, surrendering the plates’ images) register but don’t pinch her values against each other. Still, agency is steady and decisions feel grounded in her worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: threads, corridors, and motifs layer toward a tangible restoration. Closure lands on the page with the merged plates and the labyrinth’s “recognition,” plus the emptied plates as a conceptual price. Causal clarity is clean at the micro level, though turns are gentle and largely unopposed. Orientation is swift and stable, and the final cadence reweights the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: red canyon stone, murals, symbols at junctions, and the canyon’s “no sky” all steer choices and tone. Environmental specifics (spiral/crescent/flame) guide her route and charge the climax space (the heart chamber pedestal). Sensory balance (scent of damp stone, shimmer of residual magic) is strong and POV‑filtered. While constraint is soft, the place palpably shapes action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates via density rather than confrontation. The main tightening is the heart‑room merge and the commitment to finish “the final stitch,” with the plates’ depletion as price. Pressure remains low‑friction: no credible opposition tests her resolve beyond endurance. The result is resonant but short on felt risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ruin‑to‑reverence emerges organically through concrete acts of mending; “broken precedents” refracts into a practice of repair. The final image (tide pools refilling; plates emptied) offers a quiet, non‑didactic answer about devotion and remaking. Subtext in the sleepwalker tether and the hymn metaphor deepens the moral texture without sermonizing. It’s moving and earned, if safely pitched.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent in third‑person close, with a distinct perceptual signature (thread as question mark; air as “older, sweeter things”). Rhythm modulates well between movement and stillness; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Diction feels native to this character and world. Compression is purposeful and legible under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line work is clean, image‑rich, and avoids redundancy; metaphors cohere to water, stone, thread, and sleep. Sentences carry multiple jobs—atmosphere, action, and motif—without purple drift. Minor lushness never blurs sense, and the final cadence is crisp. No loops, scaffolding, or cadence templates dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a wharf weaver mending a labyrinth via overlapping sleep paths and twin illustration plates. The sleepwalker tether and the plate‑emptiness as cost are striking and specific. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but they pay off with integrity. It’s memorable and confident without gimmickry.</comment>
