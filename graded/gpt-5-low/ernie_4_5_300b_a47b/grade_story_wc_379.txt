<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s motive—curiosity filtered through reverence for objects—drives each step cleanly, and her actions align with that identity. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she never faces a value‑testing trade‑off beyond gentle persistence. Secondary characters add texture, not pressure. The emotional cost registers at the end but remains modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: locket → inscription → stories → code → opening → letters. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph and maintained. Closure lands on page with a decisive change (the mailbox opens) and an emotional price. The numeric deduction via the photo is a touch convenient but seeded enough to hold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn, damp earth, and the tarnished mailbox are vivid and filtered through Clara’s curatorial gaze. The environment functions via the object‑as‑setting: the mailbox and locket shape tactics and the final image. Atmospheric detail enhances mood without bloat. Constraint is more circumstantial than coercive, keeping this just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around solving the mailbox; escalation occurs through gathering stories to the lock‑combination leap. Stakes are largely conceptual/emotional and remain low‑risk; no path is truly foreclosed beyond the mystery itself. The turn to the code is a meaningful tightening, if gently rendered.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of listening, communal memory, and love’s endurance emerge organically from action and image. The line “not by force, but by listening” in the final paragraph over‑articulates the thesis, dulling subtext at the finish. The locket’s inscription works well as thematic engine otherwise. Resonance is present but constrained by that explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and apt; diction is controlled and specific to a curator’s sensibility. Dialogue is minimal but natural, carrying lore without exposition dump. Rhythm modulates well between scene and summary. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, efficient, and image‑forward; openings like “The air smelled of damp earth and old paper” carry weight and economy. Minor clichés (“pulse quickened,” “eyes filled with tears”) don’t impede momentum. Information density is good; sentences often do double duty. No loop or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wartime‑letters/locked‑box motif is familiar, but the thrift‑shop curator lens and inscription‑as‑method give it a fresh angle. The neighborhood‑lore method feels lived‑in rather than gimmicky. Still, the overall arc hews to a recognizable template without a bold risk at the peak. The ingenuity is solid, not striking.</comment>
