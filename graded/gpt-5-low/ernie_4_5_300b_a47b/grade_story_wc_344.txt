<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, coherent motivation with tactile interiority—nostalgia, pressure of legacy, and a credible craft‑driven mindset. The mirror beat briefly shows doubt vs. determination, but contradictions don’t compound and stress never degrades perception. Competence outweighs struggle, minimizing visible cost. Still, the micro‑choices (spotting the wrong reflection, using the vial, working the lock) align tightly with his trait set.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal arc: prophecy → Hall of Mirrors → anomaly → vial → chest → gears; orientation is crisp and single‑scene focus holds. Closure lands as a successful retrieval plus a reweighted self‑understanding (RR), but cost is light. The lens reads primarily causal with a lyric finish. The final ticking clock image ties cause to consequence without introducing new variables.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: cold, frost, and mirror logic shape tactics; the “reflection that did not belong” is a spatial rule that governs access. Objects (vial, crescent lock, runed gears) are integrated and the environment charges the ending’s renewed brightness and ticking clock. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered. It stops short of a hard constraint with a price, but it’s strongly embedded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (find the gear set), but pressure barely tightens and the path offers no meaningful trade‑off or loss. The key turn (uncapping the vial) succeeds without complication or reversal. Internal tension doesn’t scale as options narrow; discovery feels inevitable. The result is satisfying but low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Repair as a moral and metaphysical stance threads through action and images, culminating in the gears as a conduit for renewal. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement (“The rhythm of repair…”) which flattens subtext. Resonance is earned by particulars (mirrors, runes, ticking), but complexity is modest. Emotional aftereffect lingers more for atmosphere than moral ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third lyric voice with controlled diction; perception feels craft‑trained and memory‑tinted. Rhythm modulates well between atmosphere and action; no head‑hopping or stance wobbles. Occasional elevated phrasing nudges purple but stays coherent for the character. No dialogue, but the narration carries subtext cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Polished linework with strong image economy—“liquid light,” “rimed with frost,” “driftwood nostalgia”—and varied sentence rhythm. Minor lushness and a few near‑synonym echoes don’t impede momentum. Information density remains high and sequencing is clear. The closing cadence lands crisply without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—lunar‑eclipse locksmith, frozen sky‑library, liquid‑light vial—feels fresh without gimmickry. The Hall of Mirrors device is familiar but personalized through craft motifs and legacy pressure. The turn is expected yet gracefully executed. Greater risk in cost or an unexpected complication would elevate uniqueness.</comment>
