<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (protect father, secure asylum) is clear and drives her choices; the “wait actively” maxim gives her a distinct operating principle. Interior access is specific (ink colors, counting seconds), though internal contradiction is light and her poise under guns stretches plausibility for a twelve-year-old. The choice to trade the scroll reads as a meaningful cost but her struggle feels frictionless at key beats. Secondary characters apply pressure but remain thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean single-scene causal chain: hiding → confrontation → reveal dummy → negotiation → exchange for asylum. Orientation is solid, and closure lands via a decisive trade. However, the pivotal negotiation is summarized (“For the next hour… She traded the scroll… and a promise”), softening on-page cost and testing plausibility. The causal lens holds, but the off-stage deal mutes the climax’s force.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prep room is vividly introduced (lilies, linen, fluorescent lights) and the casket enables the dummy reveal. Details are filtered through Elara’s priorities, and the ink pot functions as a charged micro-setting. Still, the environment only lightly constrains tactics beyond the casket reveal; the room’s affordances aren’t deeply exploited in the turn. Strong economy but not environment-driven choice-making.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are clear and escalate: guns drawn, a reveal, then leverage-based negotiation. The meaningful tightening is Elara stepping out and forcing the casket to be opened, narrowing options. The price—surrendering the scroll—registers, but the agents’ swift capitulation and the summarized hour reduce felt resistance. Tension is present but resolves too smoothly to fully charge the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of belief vs. “chemistry,” equity vs. control, and active waiting are coherent and recur through the ink pot and tactics. Subtext is present (fear and greed glimpsed via ink) but much is spoken outright (“No body. No crime. Just math.”; “we make sure no one ever has to fake their death again”), shading toward moralizing. The final note leans declarative instead of letting image carry resonance. Conceptual richness is there but undercuts subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV and distance are stable; the voice blends cool observational detail with a taut cadence. Dialogue advances goals but occasionally slips into expositional bluntness and adult polish for a twelve-year-old. The “wait actively” refrain provides tonal cohesion. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with purposeful sensory detail and mostly strong verbs; rhythm varies well. Minimal scaffolding and no major figurative muddle; the “hour” summary is efficient but drains peak-scene immediacy. A few slogan-like lines read templated. Overall, momentum holds with decent density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Funeral-home intrigue plus a cognition-shifting “ink” framed as chemistry is a fresh synthesis; the “mathematics of equity” hook is intriguing. Government-agents-as-opposition and the neat exchange are familiar, moderating novelty. The “wait actively” method feels distinctive and integrated. Solid inventive choices that could elevate further with a less tidy resolution.</comment>
