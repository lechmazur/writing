<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—escaping “emotional numbness” through tactile listening—and her choices (accepting the wire, playing records backward, returning with students) align. Interiority is embodied via vibrations and bone‑felt resonance rather than abstract labels, though the diagnostic line “Emotional numbness, the doctors called it” slightly flattens texture. The relationship with Elias adds pressure and permission, not mere support. The turn from refuge‑seeking to bearer/teacher of hush is earned if somewhat tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the coil, reversed records, sympathetic drums, and communal adoption build to a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when are clear), and the montage “Days passed” remains coherent within one arc. Closure lands with conceptual repricing—the broken needle recast as a gift—and the emotional cost is legible in the ache and tears. Slight softness arises from minimal resistance after the first attempt succeeds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cavern, hides, frost, and sympathetic drums are vividly specific and filtered through Lila’s tactile priorities. The environment actively shapes tactics (vibrating drumheads, mirrored hush) and charges the final image (gifted drum “to carry the hush”). Object‑as‑setting elements (phonograph, horn, wire) integrate naturally with space. Descriptive economy stays purposeful without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—piercing numbness—tightens once when Lila risks the backward play with the hush coil, which immediately deepens sensation. Pressure grows more by density and communal widening than by adversity; no significant reversal or cost threatens failure after the first try. The closing gift drum signifies an earned shift but not a high‑friction trade‑off. Tension is present yet gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The central question—what silence holds—is answered through concrete images (reversed Coltrane, vibrating hides, the coil) and the reweighted needle. Subtext often works via implication and touch, though the explicit line “Silence isn’t empty. It’s a container” tilts toward thesis. The ending meaningfully reframes silence as agency rather than lack. The resonance lingers, if with a trace of stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a supple, tactile lexicon suits a deaf protagonist’s perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but textured (Elias’s gravelly pragmatism contrasts with Lila’s sign/gesture interiority). Rhythm modulates well from hush to ache without head‑hopping or register slips. Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and largely free of scaffold or synonym churn; sentences do more than one job. Figurative choices cohere to the sound/vibration field (“filament of hush,” “palimpsest of emotion”) without mixed metaphors. Minor risk of lyrical saturation is balanced by clarity and forward motion. The final image lands crisply without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—deaf pedagogy, a phonograph’s broken needle, a copper‑wire “hush” coil, and reversed jazz in a drum cavern—is fresh and specific. The concept commits without gimmick, and the backward‑song tactic feels inevitable in hindsight once introduced. Emotional truth arises from tactile pedagogy rather than stock epiphany. The risk is moderate but coherent, with strong follow‑through.</comment>
