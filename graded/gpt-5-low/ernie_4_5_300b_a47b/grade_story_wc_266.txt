<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s grounded certainty and Jorin’s tentative curiosity form a lucid mentor–apprentice dynamic, with micro‑choices (stamping tickets, choosing to leave the punch) revealing values. Jorin’s anxiety shifts into acceptance, but the internal contradiction never bites hard enough to feel costly. Emotions are embodied (“air tasted of honey and regret”), though several insights are voiced as tidy aphorisms. The final endurance choice (vigil) is credible but lightly priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (star stamp, indirect routes, twilight) build toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis ending—returning to the dock to wait. Orientation is clean early, and the single journey shard coheres. Closure lands via conceptual repricing (courage as a shared river; the punch left behind), with a felt but quiet cost (renouncing destination, accepting indefinite watch). Pressure is modest yet coherent across the walk→clearing→return arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ridgeway’s mutable geography (vanishing path, root bridge) and the salt‑iron air feel specific and operative, not decorative. The ticket punch functions as a micro‑setting object that guides tactic and charges the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action (indirect routes, reappearing path). The environment pressures choice without over-explaining its system.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes—learn how to keep vigil and locate/evoke unused courage—tighten through the pattern of traversal and guiding others, culminating in leaving the punch and committing to return. Escalation is a cadence deepening rather than a hard reversal; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond embracing uncertainty and time. The clearing serves as the single intensification beat. Cost is present but subtle, limiting peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: courage as a repeated choice enacted in guiding others, not a destination to find. Recurring images (star stamp, twilight, lullaby) reweight at the end without needing exposition. A few lines flirt with thematic didacticism (“Courage isn’t a lake to be drained”), though they are grounded in action. The final vigil stance offers a resonant non‑literal answer to the story’s question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; diction fits the mythic register without drifting into academic gloss. Dialogue distinguishes Lira’s calm authority from Jorin’s earnest uncertainty and advances the scene. Psychic distance and tense remain stable. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure, particularly around the clearing and return.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied rhythm and clean mechanics; images are vivid but not overstacked. Minor aphoristic tendencies flatten pressure in spots, yet momentum rarely stalls. Repetitions (“traverse,” “vigil”) work as pattern rather than loop. The closing line efficiently recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ferry‑guide mythos, veiled ridgeway, and star punch create a fresh synthesis; the indirect‑route praxis feels particular. The structure favors quiet reconfiguration over twist, maintaining coherence. Some mentor‑apprentice beats are familiar, but the object logic and tonal lullaby inflection provide distinctive texture. Risk is measured but genuine in its restraint.</comment>
