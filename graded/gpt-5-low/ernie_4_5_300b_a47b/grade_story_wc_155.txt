<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—recovering joy from elegy—is concrete and enacted through choices (displaying the fragment, mobilizing the network). Interiority is textured (“the fog clung…until even her memories felt like half‑remembered dreams”). Contradictory impulses surface (cautious elegist vs. reckless hope), but the cost of the shift reads modest. The recognition by Marla deepens Lira’s stakes credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the found fragment → curated display → communal ignition → reconfigured stance. Orientation is clean and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration (from requiem to resurrection), with a felt vulnerability cost. The “exposed film” concept reframes the action at the turn and is paid off at closure. Pressure is gentle but coherent; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fog are vivid, POV‑filtered, and thematically charged; tools (prisms, mirrors, greenhouse) are lived‑in and recur. Fog and decay constrain memory and charge the final image as it “thins” under communal heat. Specifics like encrypted notes in hollow trees anchor world rules. Sensory selection supports tone without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving joy/memory) is clear and escalates via the public display and Marla’s recognition. The crowd’s growth and spontaneous music mark a single meaningful intensification. Costs are primarily emotional and reputational; no hard trade‑off narrows options beyond exposure/vulnerability. Tension is steady but not sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: art as developer of latent history; communal memory vs. fog’s erasure; elegy to joy. The “exposed film” reprices the premise near the climax and informs the final stance. A few explicit lines (“She’d painted with hope…”) come close to telling, but the imagery carries most weight. The ending’s talisman and “What’s next?” echo land cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical yet controlled cadence; diction suits the artist’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual (Marla’s “That’s my mother”). Rhythm modulates well from hushed to celebratory without head‑hopping. No register jolts or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and image‑dense with minimal redundancy; sentences do multiple jobs. Figurative language is frequent but coherent to motif (fog, light, film) and doesn’t obscure action. Minor tell phrases appear but don’t stall momentum. Opening and closing images resonate and are cleanly executed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Light‑painting, encrypted tree‑notes, and a fog‑lost orchard synthesize into a distinctive vision. The fresco fragment’s communal reanimation and the film‑developer conceit feel earned, not gimmicky. Risks are meaningful and coherent; the piece avoids template beats. Only the low‑stakes pressure keeps it short of the very top tier.</comment>
