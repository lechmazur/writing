<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are clear and embodied: the grave and the scroll provoke a choice that costs him physically and psychically. Contradictory impulses—jealousy of former selves vs. compulsion to test the ritual—operate simultaneously. The limp and distrust of gravity sharpen his choices on the climb. The final repricing (“nostalgia as compass”) feels earned by prior beats, though a touch on‑the‑nose.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grave → scroll/map → climb → cave/blank scroll → repricing. Orientation is clean from the start, with a single POV and one transition that stays coherent. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing; the cost is felt in exertion and the relinquishing of envy. The ritual’s convenience skirts contrivance but doesn’t break the chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mountain, cabin, snow, and cave are vividly rendered and constrain tactics—he must climb, squeeze through a fissure, and engage with the pedestal/scroll. Recurring objects (grave, scrolls, lantern) charge the atmosphere and final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, supporting tone and pressure. Minor weather tropes are balanced by specificity (birch bark, ice‑slick walls).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant internal stake is clear and tightens through the decision to risk the ledge despite injury. The meaningful deepening occurs in the cave, where the blank scroll forces a stance shift rather than a simple discovery. Cost registers in stamina, fear, and relinquishing self‑pity. Stakes stay intimate but coherent and sustained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imagery and action develop a theme of memory, self‑multiplicity, and earned reconfiguration. However, the ending articulates the thesis a bit directly (“nostalgia wasn’t a curse—it was a compass”), softening subtext. Even so, the final idea that he is “building the past” reweights prior material meaningfully. Ambiguity remains without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in POV distance; perception is character‑specific and biased. Rhythms modulate with pressure (quieter at the cabin, tighter on the ascent). A few familiar phrases (“green‑eyed monster,” “bones to lead”) slightly dull freshness but don’t fracture voice. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs, and momentum holds. Figurative density is high yet mostly coherent; occasional clichés and mirrored sentence structures flirt with redundancy. Syntax varies and reads clean aloud; no major scaffold or filter stacks. The final line lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The self‑grave, ritual, and blank scroll are familiar motifs made specific by the birch bark, cave, and chronicler angle. The revaluation of nostalgia shows thoughtful synthesis without gimmickry. Not wholly new, but executed with conviction and a distinct sensibility. Risk is moderate and pays off in closure.</comment>
