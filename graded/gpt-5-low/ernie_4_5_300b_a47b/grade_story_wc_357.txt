<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—Lira seeks the planet’s resilience source—and her choices (following the river, inserting the tip) align. Interiority is present but largely functional; contradictory impulses (curiosity vs. fear or exploitation vs. protection) are gestured at rather than dramatized. The final renunciation-to-protect lands but carries limited felt cost on the page. Competence dominates over struggle, keeping the arc clean but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal progression: river → arch → cavern → socket → activation → realization. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing when Lira understands resilience as symbiosis and chooses guardianship. Orientation is strong early; single POV and single-scene continuity hold. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting peak intensity but not clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: floating arches, bioluminescent vines, and midair water spheres shape action and imagery. Inversion physics and the arch-cavern materially constrain choice, and the arrow-socket is a charged object-in-setting pivot. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a pilot’s eye. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stake is coherent (discover the source before/through inversion), and pressure tightens as gravity wavers and the arch pulses. The decisive act (inserting the tip) is protagonist-driven, with a visible world reaction. However, the price remains light—no hard trade-off or enduring loss is dramatized. Tension is present but more wondrous than harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Symbiosis and “gathering of echoes” cohere thematically and culminate in a protective stance. Several images (liquid spheres, root-archives) evolve meaningfully toward the ending. A touch of direct moralizing (“not a machine to exploit, but a truth to protect”) blunts subtext. The resonance lingers, though complexity remains modest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stable close third with a lucid, lyrical texture suited to wonder and discovery. Diction and rhythm are controlled; the perceptual signature (pilot’s practical awe) is consistent. No head-hopping or stance drift. Occasional elevated phrasing remains within voice and does not destabilize POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean and propulsive, with strong verbs and concrete images (glider hum, liquid spheres clinging). Figurative language is vivid without muddle, and sentence rhythm varies well. Minimal scaffolding or repetition; exposition is folded into action. Slight purple glints appear but do not impede clarity or momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gravity-inverting orchard planet with echo-archives feels fresh, and the arrow key recontextualizing resilience is an elegant turn. The synthesis of ecology and physics reads specific rather than generic. The “key in socket” beat is familiar but transformed by the symbiosis reveal. Bold imagery supports a non-obvious, coherent vision.</comment>
