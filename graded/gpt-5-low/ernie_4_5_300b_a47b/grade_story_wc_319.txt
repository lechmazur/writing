<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (oath vs. homesickness) and tactics (waiting, “interiorizing exteriors”) are concrete and drive her micro‑choices. Her contradictory impulses are on the page: desire to return home versus duty to protect, crystallized at the fountain. Dialogue reveals status tilt (cultist’s taunts vs. her controlled silence) and distinct idiom. The cost could register more viscerally, but her renunciation choice reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: stake set (guard/return), pressure arrives (cultist), device heats/calls, choice (toss pendant), threshold opens, then arrival/recognition. Orientation is swift and legible; single transition to the atrium is paid off. Closure lands as Decisive Change with a minor conceptual repricing (“boundaries of light” as doors). The cost is present but a touch soft on the page, keeping this shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden and mist are vivid and purposeful: the mist swallows sound, the blue lantern “reveals hidden things,” the fountain is the crucible for the decisive toss, and the glowing moss path emerges as resource. Sensory detail is economical and POV‑filtered (feral guardian’s body, ice cracking under bare feet). World rules feel coherent through action rather than exposition. Setting pressures concealment and enables the turn without overwhelming the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightened: the cultist’s arrival and demand force a trade‑off between control (keep the key) and risk (toss, step into unknown). The reversal is protagonist‑driven; the pendant’s warmth/symbol shift escalates internal pressure credibly. Cost is implied (abandoning post/safety) more than dramatized, which dampens the afterbite. Still, agency and a narrowing of options are unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Images and objects carry thematic weight (lantern that reveals, mist as thought, “interiorizing exteriors”). The final recognition reframes the premise (“boundaries of light” as doors), but the explicit statement “And uncertainty? That was just another word for home” flirts with telling. Subtext in the waiting, the oath, and the mentor’s “Trust the fog” does good work. A shade less declarative moralizing would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Close third is steady, with a distinct cadence and feral perceptual bias (“ice cracking beneath her bare feet,” “hummed frost”). Dialogue is lean, subtextual, and functions as action (the cultist tries to reclaim control; Mara withholds). Diction stays within character while accommodating the piece’s lyric texture. Psychic distance compresses appropriately at the turn without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is controlled, tactile, and varied in rhythm; metaphor density supports rather than swamps (“mist… felt less like a place and more like a thought” is clear and earned). Minimal scaffolding; each sentence carries atmosphere or pressure. No notable loops or template cadences; line‑level clarity survives the lyric register. A few abstractions at the end skim close to theme‑speak but do not blur the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Feral library guardian” plus “interiorizing exteriors” feels fresh, and the lantern’s anti‑light property is an intriguing twist. The causal turn via tossing the key into a frozen fountain is specific and memorable. While some beats echo familiar portal tropes, the synthesis and diction make it feel singular. The risk‑taking is measured and coherent rather than gimmicky.</comment>
