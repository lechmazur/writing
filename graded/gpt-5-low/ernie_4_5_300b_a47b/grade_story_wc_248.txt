<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—honoring a grandmother’s promise by “translating” with fire and ink—is clear and steadily enacted. Interiority is sensorial and particular (obsidian ink, the unblinking eye), though conflicting impulses are muted; she rarely doubts or pays a tangible price beyond emotion. The final stance shift (arsonist to gardener) lands but feels low-risk on the page. Overall, a strong, coherent portrait with limited contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the patterned acts of art across rooms build toward a conceptual repricing: the archive as garden, vandalism as tending. Orientation is clean early and held, and the ending’s image (the healing tear revealing the grandmother) provides on-page closure. Cost is primarily emotional and conceptual, but legible. The chain of clues coheres without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archive’s rooms and materials (acid burns, astronomical maps, forgotten languages) feel tactile and purposeful. Setting and objects are not backdrop; they enable choices and charge the final image through the portrait’s transformation. Detail selection tracks Mara’s priorities and maintains mood. While constraint is more thematic than logistical, it’s still integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are personal—recovering a promise and the archive’s “true” mode—and the pressure accrues through pattern rather than opposition. One meaningful tightening arrives with the chamber of self-portraits and the grandmother reveal. Still, there’s minimal counterforce or cost that narrows options; her path is largely unimpeded. Escalation is felt but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of translation vs. destruction and archive-as-garden are woven through images and tactics, culminating in a charged redefinition of purpose. Subtext generally does the work, though a few lines edge toward telling (“not as a thief or an arsonist, but as a gardener”). The final image reweights earlier symbols without sermonizing. Resonance lingers through the grandmother connection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent close third that filters detail through Mara’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm support the accumulating pressure without head-hopping or register slips. Brief dialogue is spare and apt. The prose maintains control across descriptive density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is vivid and mostly economical; images do more than one job and momentum holds. Occasional elevated labels (“volcanic tenderness”) verge on abstraction but do not muddy sense. No paraphrase loops or template cadences drag the final beats. The last image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reframing arson as translation and vandalism as horticulture feels fresh, with the self-portrait healing into the grandmother as a striking turn. The synthesis of archive lore, artistic sabotage, and familial vow is distinctive. Risks are coherent and not gimmicky, though the lack of opposing pressure keeps it from feeling radical. Still, originality and integration are strong.</comment>
