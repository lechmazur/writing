<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s competence and ethos are clear, and Lira’s confession provides a credible internal turn with felt cost. The relationship dynamic is focused and functional: his craft presses her toward truth. Some lines over-explain interior stakes (“the ailment was not mechanical but moral”), softening ambiguity. Still, actions and specific tools reflect character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal progression: chamber setup → diagnostic tethering → Lira’s admission → stone flares → reconfigured melody. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—truth replaces denial—with the cost embodied in Lira’s on‑page admission. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single‑scene window holds. The rules (stone thrives with truth) are honored and enacted without late cheats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is vivid and operative, not decorative: its hum amplifies actions, the dais/runes shape the method, and it charges the final image. Tool‑specific detail (obsidian needles, starlight thread, liquid silence) works as micro‑setting that directs tactics. Sensory texture remains purposeful and filtered through Elias’s craft. The environment constrains how the repair can happen, not just where.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—realign the box by confronting truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elias makes Lira name the theft/lies. The decisive beat (her confession) narrows options and triggers change, with an emotional price. Escalation is more deepening than adversarial, but reads coherent under a causal lens. A hint of resistance before confession could have intensified pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres—decay as preservation; truth as a precondition for healing—and the final image reweights the premise. However, several thesis‑like lines (“It’s a mirror,” “Midnight steals light…”) state meaning rather than letting subtext carry it, especially near the end. The covenant’s creed and the lullaby/truth swap do real thematic work. Less overt moralizing would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice blends tactile craft with luminous diction in a stable close third, and dialogue advances pressure with some subtext. Occasional didactic phrasing tilts toward explanation, but cadence and imagery stay controlled. Elias and Lira’s speech patterns are distinct enough for this length. Rhythm modulates well from hum to bloom at the ending.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is confident: varied syntax, strong verbs, and images doing double duty. A few metaphor stacks flirt with purple, but they remain coherent and purposeful. Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum holds through technical actions interleaved with charged admission. The final note image lands cleanly without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The covenant‑of‑rust aesthetic, resonance mechanics, and moral alchemy synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame. The “truth as tuning” turn feels earned and specific rather than template‑mythic. Risks are taken in diction and concept without obscuring clarity. Minor didactic notes keep it just shy of more startling originality.</comment>
