<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s motive and tactics are clear and embodied—pressing the shell to her chest, then to the crack, then to her lips—showing escalating commitment with physical cost (bleeding fingers, snapped string). Interiority is specific to her sensory logic (heart rhythms, vibrations), though the final realization edges toward stated moral. Contradictory impulses surface lightly (fear vs. insistence), but conflict could push her into a starker trade-off. Still, actions align with motive and culminate in an earned shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative, lyric escalation: music seeps into cores, environmental shifts mount, culminating in a decisive orchard reawakening and statue collapse. Closure lands on-page with a conceptual repricing plus decisive change; cost is present but modest. Orientation is clean early; causal links are legible (shell → cores → geyser → statues crack). A single scene holds coherence with effective tightening at the crack discovery and the snapped string.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard’s textures (metallic peaches, humming grass, glass sky-bridge) are vivid and purpose-driven, and the locust shell functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains tactics. Environmental rules (statues enforcing schedules) shape the conflict and are reweighted at the end. The final image is charged by place and object. Sensory economy remains strong without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the orchard from mechanized order—is signaled early and tightened through the crack discovery and the statues’ cores responding. Escalation is coherent and Lira’s agency drives the turns (shell placement, persistent playing, last-resort blowing). The price is felt but not crushing; the opposition never adapts on-page, limiting pressure. Nevertheless, the decisive intensification at the geyser of light credibly narrows options and forces commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonant themes of order versus wildness emerge through recurring objects and acts (shell, heartbeat music, metal fruit shedding), culminating in a reweighted understanding. However, the explicit thesis line (“breaking free wasn’t about destruction…”) edges into moralizing and reduces subtext. The ending still offers a concrete, recharged image that invites reflection. Complexity is present but somewhat narrated instead of fully implied.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature (vibration/heartbeat lexicon) and modulates rhythm well at peak beats. No head-hopping and stance remains consistent. Diction is cohesive and confident without register slips. The final cadence aligns voice with thematic realization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful images; rhythm varies and momentum sustains. Some figurative stacking skirts purple but rarely muddies clarity. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax choices generally propel. The snapped string and iridescent dust sequences land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locust-shell-as-heart-signal is an inventive engine, and the regimented orchard enforced by statues feels fresh in detail and implication. Turns arise from established specifics rather than late-rule fixes. The synthesis of music, biology, and order/chaos stakes reads distinctive. Minor familiar notes in the moral statement prevent the top band.</comment>
