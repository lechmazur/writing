<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elinor’s motivations are clear and coherent—decode the leaves, act on the warning—and her micro‑choices (prodding the dust, building monuments) flow from her orderly nature. Interiority is textured through tactile work and ritual, though internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely struggles or doubts. The final stance shift (from skepticism to committed belief/action) is earned but low-cost. The lack of relational pressure limits deeper character revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is strong from the outset (single POV, clear place and goal) and the causal chain is legible: dust → prod → monuments → readable leaves → decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: folklore is validated and options reweighted toward action. Cost is light—no real risk or sacrifice beyond the dust’s dissolution—so the ending feels poised more than paid. Lens: Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural holds cleanly through to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor and moss-dimmed canopy are vivid and consistently filtered through a seed sorter’s sensibility. Setting details integrate with action (floating island, falling leaves with shifting markings) and charge the final image. While the environment does not sharply constrain tactics, the arbor’s hush and leaf behavior materially shape the procedure and result. Selective, purposeful detail avoids cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are articulated (decode leaves to avert storm/harvest silverseed), but pressure escalates gently without meaningful resistance. The decisive act (prodding dust and building monuments) succeeds without setback or tradeoff. The storm remains offstage, and options never truly narrow beyond the ritual’s commitment. Tension is atmospheric rather than confrontational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Folklore as language and “bridge between seen and unseen” coheres with events; the dust’s dissolution reframes belief as action. Some lines edge into on-the-nose theme statements (“She had always known the folklore was more than tales”), softening subtext. The final charged poise—readying to act—leaves a resonant humility before a larger system. The capped escalation tempers the thematic afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a meticulous worker’s gaze; sensory diction supports mood without slipping register. POV distance remains steady; no head-hopping or unmotivated certainty. Rhythm modulates well between hush and quickened purpose. Compression is clean; exposition is folded into perception.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, textured nouns, and varied sentence rhythm sustain momentum. Occasional lushness flirts with purple but largely serves ambience and character. Minimal scaffold or redundancy; images like “light weaving through the monuments” are coherent and purposeful. Punctuation and clarity are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The seed sorter in a skyborne arbor guided by moonstone dust and folk-ritual monuments feels fresh and specific. The bridge-from-folklore concept is integrated rather than decorative. The turn from skepticism to embodied practice is gentle but earned. It stops short of a truly startling reconfiguration or cost, keeping ingenuity high but not transcendent.</comment>
