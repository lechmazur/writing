<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Zara’s role and motives (observe, encode rebellion, disguise wisdom) are clear and consistent; her micro‑choices with the candle and chart reveal character under pressure. Interiority is present but light—trembling hands and guarded wit—without a felt internal contradiction driving a costly choice. The relationship with Jaxon adds pressure and status contrast (he’s awed, she’s slyly in charge). The final action reads as revelation rather than a hard renunciation or loss, keeping the emotional cost modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single‑scene, Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues (coup imminent, telescopes moved) to a Conceptual Repricing when the flame “synchronizes” the chart. Orientation is clean early; motifs set up pay off in the visual reconfiguration. The closure lands as a charged realization (“the chart changing”), but the cost remains mostly implied rather than concretely paid on the page. Causality holds, though escalation is gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is vivid and functional: the eternal candle’s properties constrain tactics and charge the final image. Seasonal cold, rattling windows, and brass sconce integrate with action rather than linger as postcard detail. World rules (flame as “synchronizer”) are introduced through use, not exposition. Strong economy and POV filtering through an embroiderer’s eye elevate specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving/encoding truth before the council seizes tools) is signaled, but on‑page escalation is soft. The main tightening is moving the sacred flame and revealing the chart’s shift; no option is clearly foreclosed and the danger remains largely offstage. Agency exists (Zara directs Jaxon, employs the candle), yet the price of that action is not made legible. Tension hums, but doesn’t bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Art as rebellion and truth’s nonlinearity recur through stitches, “blueprints of rebellion,” and the candle’s synchronizing effect; the final image reweights prior motifs. Some theme lines are spelled out (“The truth is never a straight line”), shaving subtlety. Subtext does operate in Zara’s seeming “decorations,” but the ending leans more toward affirmation than complex moral calculus. Resonance is present, if somewhat declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyric texture tuned to Zara’s sensibility; dialogue is clean, purposeful, and shows status/subtext (“decorating” as cover). Narrative certainty stays within POV, and rhythm modulates appropriately between hush and reveal. No head‑hopping or stance slips. The voice feels owned rather than generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lush but controlled prose; images (needles as comets, flame as “star’s last breath”) are apt and not over‑stacked. Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum; little scaffold or loop. Minor on‑the‑nose phrasing appears but doesn’t blunt the closure image. Mechanics are clean and rhythmic variety supports the scene’s hush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The galaxy‑chart embroiderer and eternal star‑flame as synchronizer are fresh, integrated, and memorable. The coup as cosmic realignment is an inventive synthesis that coheres with the craft motif. The turn (chart unraveling/relining under flame) feels earned by prior particulars. Risk is taken without tipping into obscurity.</comment>
