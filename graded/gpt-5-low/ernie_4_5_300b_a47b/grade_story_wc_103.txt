<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—obsessively probing time’s fabric—is clear and drives her choices (placing and pressing the fragment, pulling at memories). Interiority is specific and embodied (geometry warping, scents, the fragment biting her palm). Internal contradiction is present but light: curiosity vs. the cost of destabilization/glimpses she can’t hold. The final renunciation (accepting clarity as the visions vanish) reads earned with a felt loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats intensify coherently: fragment → visions surge → garden disintegrates → reformation with altered rules. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: time is “a story,” with the price of inert fragment and lost visions. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what). Causality holds through because/therefore linkages even within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly rendered across senses and functions as an active system: vines retract, paths stretch, the bridge collapses/reforms. The environment constrains and charges choices and the final image (stabilized photographs, reconstituted bridge). Details feel filtered through a designer’s eye (hyperbolic paths, woven railings that hum). World rules stay consistent enough for the mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking/stabilizing time) is signaled early and escalates to a decisive intensification as the garden and memories come apart. Agency drives turns: she places and then presses the fragment, actively “pulling threads.” The cost is legible (tool spent, visions gone), though pressure could tighten earlier with a shaper trade‑off moment. Still, the single decisive escalation suits the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory, time’s fabric vs. narrative, and preservation cohere via recurring objects (photos, fragment, living architecture) and the reweighted ending. However, the explicit thesis line (“time wasn’t a texture to be touched, but a story to be told”) states the moral and blunts subtext. The resonance remains, but subtlety is undercut in the final paragraph. The loss of retrocognition offers a real conceptual cost that supports the theme despite the tell.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable, close, and sensorially rich with a controlled lyric cadence. Diction feels character‑plausible for an obsessive designer attuned to geometry and living structures. Rhythmic modulation under pressure is effective without head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Occasional heightened metaphors remain within voice and do not obscure action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is textured with strong verbs and purposeful imagery; momentum holds across the central disintegration/reformation. Minimal scaffolding and no meaningful loops; information density is high for the length. A few purple touches (“tasted of salt and regret,” “pixelate into a swarm of fireflies”) verge on flourish but generally serve mood and clarity. Mechanics and sequence are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Living bridge garden” + hyperbolic geometry as a loom for time is a fresh synthesis, with the halo fragment and fading photographs integrated across beats. The garden’s reconstitution with stabilized photos is an elegant, non‑obvious turn that feels earned. The final conceptual shift trades mystique for clarity at cost, avoiding a neat reset. Minor familiarity in the artifact‑of‑legend trope is outweighed by specific execution and voice.</comment>
