<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation (to “discover the texture of connection”) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (fitting the lens, leaving the lab despite a destabilized world, pressing the lens to the carving) align with a “powerfully gentle” temperament. Interiority is specific—imagining sound’s texture—though internal contradiction is light beyond a brief hesitation at the cave. The final renunciation (letting machines fall silent) is earned but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than personally dear. Dr. Voss functions as an affirming echo rather than applying pressure that complicates her choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Structure is clean: lab setup → cave discovery → lab reprise, with a clear causal chain from questioning to activation to realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the mountain has always been singing; engineering is secondary. The cost is subtle (a renunciation of device-centric control) rather than dramatized via loss or risk, keeping the turn quiet. Orientation is strong from the opening; the Hybrid drive leans accumulative at the end and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the lens groove in the console teaches world rules; the cave acts as instrument; equations on walls bridge lab and cavern. Sensory detail (golden shadows, damp earth, vibration through bones) is selective and in-character. The environment constrains tactics—the lens as key and the cave’s acoustics dictate action—and charges the final image. Scale and spatial choreography are coherent across the two shards.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the texture of connection) tightens when the cave hum becomes a melody, reweighting what “capture” means. Escalation is more deepening of knowledge than pressure; external risk and material price are minimal, so the narrowing of options is conceptual rather than consequential. The key tightening beat—pressing the lens to the carving—works, but the lack of a felt trade-off keeps tension modest. Resolution arises from Lira’s stance rather than a contested choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (connection as felt, not engineered) emerges through object use and embodied listening rather than mere assertion, though a few lines state it plainly (“We keep questioning”). The scratch-as-groove reveal reweights prior imagery with satisfying resonance. The ending’s quiet refusal of machine dominance invites reflection without overexplaining, but the moral tint is lightly declared via dialogue. Subtext hums; complexity is present but not thorny.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close is steady, with a controlled lexicon and consistent psychic distance. Brief dialogue reads natural and functionally advances turns (“Why do we assume…,” “What now?”). Rhythm modulates well from hum to discovery to hush, and the perceptual signature (sound-as-texture thinking) feels character-specific. Minor purple tinges are mostly earned by the world’s conceit.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with strong verb choices and efficient sentences that carry worldbuilding and action simultaneously. A few elevated phrases and motif reiterations risk ornament, but clarity and momentum persist. Figurative language (shadows, grooves, hum) is coherent to the acoustic premise, avoiding mixed metaphors. The final cadence resolves cleanly without scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The “sound mined like ore” conceit, a carbide lens as key, and a cave-instrument create a memorable synthesis. The revaluation of technology’s role feels fresh and internally motivated. Risks are taken in blending steampunkish lab textures with mythic geology without losing clarity. While the arc is gentle, the specific object logic and tactile theme elevate originality.</comment>
