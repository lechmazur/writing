<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Her vocation and existential motive are clear and embodied in action, culminating in the shift from observer to participant. Interiority is particular and sensorial, with micro‑choices (calibrating, laying the leaf down, modulating heat) revealing values. The cost—letting the fossil go—reads as an earned renunciation. Slight limitation: conflict remains largely internal and serene, with few contradictory impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: warming leaf → float → thermographic “question” → biothermal “song” → dissolution forms a coherent intensification. Closure lands on the page with cost (loss of the leaf) and a reconfigured purpose. Orientation is crisp from the start; no teleports or rule breaks. The final image reprices the premise (from mapping to relaying) without explanatory overreach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vivid and rule‑bound (lichen as emotional thermometers, tidal sanctum), and it directly shapes options (her heat output becomes legible within that ecology). The environment charges the final image as the chamber hums and the lattice forms. Details are selective and filtered through her professional bias. World rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear: to translate what remains; escalation is a meaningful deepening rather than a duel. The turning pressure arrives with the cave’s “question” and her choice to respond, paying with the leaf. Tension is primarily tonal and conceptual, not adversarial; still, the cadence shift narrows options credibly. Slight softness: no strong competing harm beyond relinquishment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory, translation, and the sacred labor of mediation are earned through image and act, not asserted. “Transitional object” matures from concept to function at the climax, reweighting earlier lines. The ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer—voice becomes networked through loss. Ambiguity invites reflection without fog.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a precise technical lexicon (“thermographic,” “resonance”) that matches the focalizer. POV distance is steady; inference reads as inference. Rhythm modulates with pressure, culminating in clean, luminous closure. No leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, image‑rich, and economical; metaphors align with established physics of the piece. Minimal scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs without bloat. A few intensifiers cluster, but they serve cadence rather than blur it. The final lines are clean and weighted.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—heat‑mapping emotion, bioluminescent lichen, and a fossil as conduit—feels fresh and inevitable once seen. Risks in diction and world logic pay off in coherent rules and a charged reconfiguration. Turns arise from established specifics, not late rule insertions. Memorable conceptual and sensory ingenuity.</comment>
