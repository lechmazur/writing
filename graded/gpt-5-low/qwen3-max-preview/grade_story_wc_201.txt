<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Singular, embodied interiority grounds the piece; the survivor’s tactile relationship to pain (“proprioceptively enhanced”) reads specific rather than generic. Micro‑choices—following the light corridor, whispering the answer, offering the strap—reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The contradiction between bracing against pain and bracing against revelation provides live tension. Slight softening: antagonistic pressure is mostly environmental, so relational crucible is absent by design.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and patterned callbacks (bracing, violet ripples, the strap) tighten to a Conceptual Repricing at the clearing. Closure lands when the strap is offered and dissolves, reweighting identity and the math/mercy premise with a felt cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the forest’s rule (resonance with pain) stays consistent. A hairline deduction for the openly stated thesis line that slightly reduces the need for the image to do all the work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid and rule‑driven, shaping options by responding to pain and opening the path. It charges the final image (clearing of symbols; strap sinking into glowing earth), satisfying the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice. Detail is selective and filtered through trauma‑tuned perception without tourist cataloging. Minor flourish risk, but it consistently serves pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming a merciful self beyond “Subject Theta”) is legible, and pressure deepens via pattern recognition, corridor opening, and the clearing’s symbolic demand. The meaningful cost is the renunciation of the strap/identity scaffold. External opposition is minimal, keeping escalation mostly internal and cadence‑driven rather than turn‑driven. Still, the beat‑to‑beat tightening reads coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring objects and bodily perception—mercy as spatial/topological rather than arithmetic. The ending’s realization reweights prior images (angles, curvature, asymptote) into an earned conceptual answer. A slight dock for explicit statement (“mercy is not an equation… but a space”) that edges toward telling where the image already sufficed. Nonetheless, resonance lingers through the costful offering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with mathematical and bodily lexicon fused to trauma logic; stance and distance remain stable. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from jagged awakening to measured revelation) and maintains legibility. Elevated diction fits the narrator’s conceptual frame and avoids register slips. No head‑hopping or mechanical artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; very few scaffolds or loops. Some risk of purple layering and near‑redundancy in the math‑of‑mercy triads and repeated “braced” beats, though the pattern is purposeful. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the final image. Minor deduction for occasional explanatory lines that could be left to implication.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a pain‑responsive ultraviolet biome as an epistemology for mercy, filtered through proprioception and interrogation‑mapped memory. The strap’s transformation is a fresh object‑logic turn. Risks are taken in diction and concept without obscuring clarity, and the closure image feels inevitable in hindsight. A notably original lens on healing absent sentimentality.</comment>
