<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority drives action from the map dealer’s empirically intuitive lens. Motivation (the vow to his sister and the “doorway of decisions”) is coherent and sustained. The main softness is limited internal friction—he moves from discovery to compliance with little resistance or cost-testing. Still, micro‑choices (trusting ants, stepping through, locking the shop) align with traits and feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: chip → ants → hidden door → arch → inversion → letter → departure. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (he leaves) and a resonant reconfiguration (promise reweighted by new rules of time). Magical causality is taught early and holds; the cost is present but light. No major orientation debt; the single transition is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid, purposeful, and POV‑filtered: dust‑hung shop, phosphorescent cavern, creek as ambient clock. Objects-as-setting (chip, arch) and the environment (iron door, moss steps) guide choices rather than decorate. The midsummer bloom and receding creek subtly charge the final image. The space constrains access and cadence without heavy exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (redeem a vow via the doorway), with one meaningful tightening at the arch. Escalation is mostly accumulative; opposition is minimal, so costs feel modest. The letter neatly resolves pressure, leaning on the world’s rule rather than conflict. Still, his final renunciation (locking the shop) is a credible, if quiet, price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of regret, choice, and redemption emerge organically from particulars (maps, type matrix, ants) rather than thesis statements. The ending’s conceptual repricing—loneliness reframed as purpose—resonates without sermonizing. The ant reprise widens the frame to communal guidance, deepening subtext. Slight neatness in the Lisbon reveal keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person close with a cartographer’s perceptual bias; diction and rhythm are controlled. Patterned motifs (“glimmer,” “pulse,” “doorway”) are taught and echoed without confusion. No head‑hopping or stance drift; compression is purposeful. The voice sustains tension through image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with evocative lines; most sentences do more than one job. Occasional purple tilts (“where continents whispered,” “polished promises”) flirt with excess but stay coherent. Minimal repetition loops; motif recurrence is functional. Rhythm varies well and the final line lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—antique cartography, a type matrix as talisman, ant-guided portal, time‑fold letter—is fresh and specific. Turns feel earned by established motifs, not late rule changes. The ending image (ants glimmering as guides) reframes the premise memorably. Slight reliance on a neat future-letter keeps it from the 9+ echelon.</comment>
