<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority and embodied action (thread, damp stone, folding the crane) ground the traveler’s motive. Motivation is consistent—orientation over closure—culminating in a renunciation (no prayer/hope, only mapping). Internal contradiction is mild; the piece privileges steadiness over a thornier conflict. The endurance choice carries cost in solitude more than in a contested on‑page dilemma.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: one continuous scene, pattern taught early, closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis when the obituary is completed and buried. Causality within the lyric mode is coherent; the final act reweights presence/absence with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the outset. The constraint of “after the last ship” tightens timing without requiring a reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: lichen‑wept marble, ivy, withered rosebush, autumn air—all filtered through motive. The garden enables the final act (tucking the crane under roots) and tonally charges the image. The recurring thread functions as micro‑setting and returns in the last line. Constraint is more atmospheric than tactical, just short of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making absence present through mapping—tightens as the traveler moves from observation to inscription to burial. The cost is a chosen loneliness and the refusal of prayer/hope in favor of exacting orientation. Escalation is a density increase rather than a clash; it fits the lens but limits felt jeopardy. The “Elira” passage deepens pressure by specifying what’s being mended.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of explained absence, memory vs. magic, and cartography as grief-work cohere through recurring images (thread, carpet, ships, roots). The ending reframes presence as a mapped, shared act rather than consolation—resonant without moralizing. Subtext operates via “resonance” and the nursemaid’s injunction. High polish with no thesis dumping.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third-person closely held to the traveler maintains distance control and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction is consistent; patterned parallelism serves cadence and meaning. No head-hopping or stance wobble. Slight richness presses toward purple in places but stays legible and voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum; images often do double duty. Some figurative density (“beauty carved from decay,” “frost on a widow’s window”) stacks, but coherence holds. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; copy is clean. The prose is lush but disciplined enough to sustain clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Obituaries for the living” executed through cartographic metaphor and a memory‑thread salvaged in a coup feels fresh and specific. The crane-under-roots ending synthesizes motifs without gimmickry. Risk is taken in a high‑lyric register with accumulative structure that pays off. Slightly conventional images appear, but the core synthesis is distinctive.</comment>
