<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, embodied motives: Elias’s patient, soil‑wise worldview meets Mara’s rigidity-with-ache. Micro‑choices (offering the burned edge; not pulling her up) reveal value hierarchy and restraint. The relationship shifts credibly from refusal to “differently,” with a felt cost—no neat reunion. A minor softness: a few thesis-y lines risk smoothing their contradictions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under a situational/accumulative lens; pressure accrues through talk, demonstration, and a frost-sweet grape. Closure lands as resonant reconfiguration: Mara pockets the letter “as a map,” and Elias remains sentinel. The cost is chosen distance with reweighted meaning, legibly on the page. Slightly gentle turns keep it below the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amber pavilion, frost-purple grapes, clay-to-loam rows—rich, purposeful sensory detail filtered through a vintner’s eye. The burned edge and station frame the final images. While the setting charges mood and metaphor, it seldom constrains choice tactically, keeping it just shy of 9-band. Spatial and seasonal choreography stay coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to honor a mismatched love—tightens via the parallel of entwined vines and the tasted grape post-frost. Elias’s methodical persuasion and Mara’s evolving stance create a clear deepening toward “meant to be… differently.” The price is foregoing reconciliation for reframed regard. Escalation is subtle rather than knife-edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—harmony without sameness—emerges through concrete vineyard particulars and the returning letter. Subtext hums in gestures (hand offered to walk beside, not to lift) and the charged final pocketing. A few declarative lines (“Destined mismatches… invitations”) edge toward didactic, slightly dimming the afterglow. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Controlled lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“poetry wrapped in dirt”). Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext; voices are differentiated and converge intentionally at the end. Distance and tense are stable; no head‑hopping. Minor risk of elevated diction tipping into thesis does not break control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean, rhythmic lines with high information density; vivid images carry multiple jobs (vine behavior as craft and metaphor). Minimal scaffolding, no loops, and crisp paragraph rhythm. A few on‑the‑nose thematic formulations border on purple/didactic, trimming peak elegance. Closure image is clear and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Love-as-vineyard is a familiar frame but refreshed with varietal-specific craft (Merlot vs Pinot, clay-to-loam) and the sentinel/letter motif. The “destined mismatch” reframing feels earned and particular to these two. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; the piece chooses refinement over surprise. Memorable, if not radically new.</comment>
