<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation and contradictory impulses are vivid and coherent—she both hoards others’ echoes and longs to face her own ghost. Micro-choices (climbing the spire, handing over the camera) align with a deepening need to reframe rather than fix. Embodied details (salt‑crusted planks, gestural language) keep emotions concrete. The closing renunciation reads earned with a felt cost: relinquishing the fix-the-past drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned collecting → confrontation → reweighting via the camera and letter. Closure lands on the page with cost when she surrenders the camera and accepts “frame, don’t fix,” shifting her tactic and self‑conception. Setups pay off (camera clicks, ghost’s lens-adjust gesture, spire). No orientation debt; the world and desire are clear early and used at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting and micro‑objects are specific and functional: the kinetic lagoon, spire, and disposable camera are integrated and return charged at closure. The tool-as-setting (camera) directly charges the final image and governs action. Details are selective, sensorial, and POV‑filtered (glass beads, coral dust), avoiding tourist catalog. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake: negotiating with the ghost of ambition. Escalation is a meaningful tightening from collecting others’ fragments to confronting the self—handing over the camera forecloses a path. The cost is legible and internal, not grandly external, but it reweights options credibly. Quiet, single turn escalation fits the length and lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of ambition vs. gravity, memory as framing, and relinquishment accrue through concrete motifs (carousel, camera, fragments). Subtext runs through gesture and object use, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. However, the envelope’s line “You were never meant to fix the past — only to frame it.” states the thesis overtly, dulling subtext in the final movement. Without that explicit dictum, the images alone could have carried the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature; diction and rhythm feel character‑true and modulate with pressure. Purposeful elision and patterned imagery are taught and paid off without head‑hopping. The single spoken line lands with impact and avoids exposition. No stance or tense slips undermine reliability.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean sequencing; images often do double duty for setting and theme. Lyric prose mostly avoids purple excess and mixed metaphors; rhythm varies and maintains propulsion. Minor risk of figurative saturation, but clarity and momentum hold, especially in the spire sequence. No scaffold loops or cadence templates sap the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a stalled sky‑carousel, ghost of ambition, and a disposable camera reframing regret. The closing reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight given the lens‑adjust gesture and camera clicks. Risk‑taking in structure and imagery serves character and closure rather than ornament. The piece avoids genre cliché and sustains a singular vision.</comment>
