<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation and interiority are vivid and character‑specific: her ritual polishing and refusal of algorithmic cultivars align with a long, scarred history. The “mended deception” anecdote shows contradictory impulses (fear masked as indifference) that inform present choices. The intern’s arrival briefly tests her stance and reveals status dynamics without derailing POV. Cost is implied more than felt, keeping this just short of exemplary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative design teaches its pattern early and pays it off with a resonant reconfiguration: fireflies mirror the marble spirals, validating her stance. Orientation is clear (maze center, altar, intern order) and causality holds under a textural lens. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she forecloses compliance and accepts looming institutional costs. The price is mostly conceptual on the page, limiting the ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The garden maze is tactile and governing: altar, vines, fireflies, and weather pattern the action and charge the final image. World rules (probability bands, actuaries) stay consistent and modulate how the environment is read. The recurring objects (marbles, altar) function as micro‑setting tools that constrain her choices. The last image owes its power to this environment’s specific behaviors.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around defying institutional metrics, with a clean tightening when the intern delivers a direct order. The protagonist’s refusal is the resolution, linking internal conviction to external defiance. However, consequences remain largely off‑stage, softening the felt price at the peak. The conflict is strong but remains more ideological than materially perilous in scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reciprocity versus measurement emerges through concrete acts (polishing cracks, altar placement, firefly spiral) rather than abstract lecture. The “consent vs. compliance” line risks thesis‑statement glare but is backed by scene pressure and the intern exchange. “Mended deception” reframes survival and partnership with the garden without neat moralizing. The ending’s mirroring image reweights the premise with honest, lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with controlled cadence and selective, character‑true diction (“no flourish, no waste”). Dialogue is brief but purposeful, with natural register contrast between intern and vine dresser. Psychic distance is stable; imagery is taught and reprised without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates from tactile labor to hushed twilight with authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; metaphors are coherent and rooted in the garden’s textures. Occasional flourish approaches purple but stays purposeful and legible. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm carry momentum even in a reflective mode. Final lines are clean, image‑driven, and unencumbered by redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of actuarial botany, consent‑based ecology, and ritualized cracked marbles feels fresh and inevitable by the end. Risks a sermon, but instead grounds its argument in lived detail and a charged closing pattern. The “measurable luck” worldbuilding is inventive without gimmickry. Key images transform familiar nature‑vs‑tech tropes into a singular vision.</comment>
