<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motives (detach from a constricting self‑lie, answer a deeper call) are clear and embodied through tactile labor vs. luminous summons. Her contradiction—skeptic of magic yet surrendered to whale‑song—feels credible and dramatized. The change is earned via the scrimshaw’s heat and the island’s rise, with a visible relinquishment (the scrimshaw dissolving). Minor softness remains in how little resistance she shows at the pivot from labor to vocation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is steady: maritime ritual → whale’s call → emergence → reentry transformed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; cost is felt in surrendering the scrimshaw and foreclosing the small‑life path. Orientation is crisp early; setup pays off cleanly. Slightly soft pressure/cost keeps it just below the very top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: sublittoral fringe, bioluminescent kelp, tides and skiffs shape movement and enable the central act of wading toward the call. The environment charges the final image (island’s light lifting her). World rules (violence impossible, island tied to compassion) integrate through observation‑action. Exquisite texture without becoming a static postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—alignment vs. self‑erasure—tightens as she moves from dock to chest‑deep water to the island’s lift. The scrimshaw heating and the whale’s summons mark a decisive deepening; surrender has a price (relinquishing tool/identity). No overt antagonist, but internal fear vs. call creates authentic pressure. Escalation is clear if modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Compassion as world‑rule meets vocation as healing—theme emerges through image and action (song, dissolving scrimshaw, tending the grieving). The final movement reweights prior material without over‑explaining. One line leans into moralizing (“true freedom is not escape, but alignment”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance is strong and emotionally honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close with a consistent maritime lexicon and measured cadences. Rhythm modulates with pressure (the call beat tightens, the return breathes). No head‑hopping, no register slippage; voice reads idiosyncratic rather than generic. Flourish is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; verbs are strong and line flow is clean. Occasional heightened diction and stacked metaphors remain coherent and do not blur sense. Minimal redundancy; no template cadence or filter stacks. A few intensifiers skirt purple but do not impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: violence‑free world, compassion‑surfacing island, whalebone penance‑key, and a dock worker’s vocation shift. The whale‑call mechanism and scrimshaw’s dissolution feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric tone pay off without obscurity. Not wholly unprecedented, but distinct and memorable.</comment>
