<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is precise and embodied in action; her nonviolent ethos directly shapes her tactics. The village-grief memory grounds her vocation without derailing momentum. Internal contradiction is minimal—she’s unwavering—which trims depth but preserves coherence. Micro-choices (frequency shifts, breath control) reveal values under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure is clean: attempts, adjustments, fracture, click, and aftermath. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis image (she stands against fireworks, having preserved silences) with conceptual cost. The causal thread is steady if gentle; pressure is time-bound by fireworks. Stakes resolve on the page without mechanical tying-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The workshop’s objects and cosmic night are vivid and functionally tied to action (coils, vials, the clasp) and to the charged final image. Fireworks and the star‑shadowed space shape both tone and timing. Detail selection reflects Elara’s auditory bias, staying POV-true. Environment charges closure rather than decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering fragile silences before the fireworks—is clear. Escalation is accumulative: blunt C‑sharp fails → gentler harmonics → textured braid → fracture → click. Price is mostly conceptual/endurance rather than visceral, but the time pressure and delicacy create credible stakes. Resolution grows from her chosen method, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of empathy-as-listening are woven through concrete acts (tuning, labeling silences) and culminate in a resonant final stance. However, a few thesis-like lines (“Empathy wasn’t taught — it was recovered…”) tilt toward statement over image, softening subtext. The silences-as-vials metaphor remains potent and avoids false equivalence. Overall, resonance is earned, if a touch declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person close with a lyrical, sensorium-rich signature fits the premise; diction remains cohesive and character-true. Rhythm modulates with the tuning process, and the voice holds under pressure. Occasional aphoristic declarations verge on essayistic, but they don’t fracture POV control. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery (“petrified silence,” “braided silk”) that advances scene and theme. Minor risk of purple is kept in check by clear causality and momentum through the tuning beats. No scaffold loops or template cadences; sentence variety supports pace. Final image is crisp and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—archiving varieties of silence via resonance—is striking and executed with integrity. Objects (meteorite clasp, vials) and methods (cathedral bells, whale song) feel singular rather than quirky for its own sake. The reweighting at the end (fireworks vs. preserved quiet) feels inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is high without obscuring clarity.</comment>
