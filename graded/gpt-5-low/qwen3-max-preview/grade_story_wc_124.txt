<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she comes to grieve lost perfumes and to face the question of scent‑triggered tears. Contradictory impulses—lifelong caution vs. daring to open the vial—act simultaneously and culminate in a credible change. Micro‑choices (unscrewing with “trembling precision,” deploying the UV lamp) reveal values under pressure. Slightly declarative thesis lines (“Smells bypass thought…”) skim the edge of over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative build lands a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets grief and alters her future course. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and the pattern—ritual opening → sensorial inundation → UV decoding—tightens to a felt cost. Closure is on‑page and paid: she empties the vial, absorbs the encoded memories, and accepts an altered mission. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds steadily through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse for extinct plants is vividly rendered and integral to tone and meaning; it becomes the “cathedral of revelation.” Tools and objects (lanterns, UV lamp, vial) are woven into space and light, charging the final image with UV luminescence. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a professional, scent‑attuned mind. World rules feel consistent within the lyrical conceit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether she will risk reopening encoded grief; escalation proceeds through opening the vial, the memory “avalanche,” and the decision to reveal and absorb glyphs. The price—piercing beauty that becomes a second skin—is legible and alters future options. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; agency drives the turns. Slight softness in external opposition keeps it just shy of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of grief as curation and scent as a conduit to memory are powerfully embodied by concrete action (UV glyphs, absorbed memories). The final conceptual shift is strong, but the line “For grief…is its guardian” states the thesis outright, skirting sermonizing. Subtext otherwise operates through image (crystal shadows, lanterns humming with UV). Resonance lingers despite the explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinctive, confident lyric voice matches the focalizer’s sensibility and maintains stable distance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (precision in handling the vial vs. lush release during the glyph sequence). No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Elevated language remains character‑plausible for a craft‑driven, scent‑literate broker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and purposeful, with strong image economy (“faceted like frozen tears,” “crystal shadows”). Occasional aphoristic assertions slightly thicken the texture but rarely stall momentum. Figurative language is abundant yet coherent, and sentence rhythms vary to good effect. No material loops or scaffold clutter dulling the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lantern broker, extinct‑plant greenhouse, UV‑revealed memory glyphs—feels striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (making memory literally visible) enhance stakes and coherence rather than reading as gimmick. The final reweighting (grief as guardian; lanterns luminescing to memory’s frequency) is fresh. Specific craft knowledge and sensory bias ground the conceit.</comment>
