<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The undertaker’s motive—answering the lens’s calls—arises credibly from his history and stubbornness, and his hands-on choices (dismantling, embedding, activating) align with that. Interiority is embodied and particular (“molars ache,” bone-handled tools), with a reverent shift at the end that reads earned. However, the internal contradiction is modest: once he commits, there’s little on‑page hesitation or competing impulse. The visible cost is present but soft—he turns from the surface toward deeper work, not a wrenching sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: signals intensify as prisms are placed, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where distress becomes release. Orientation is clean early (undertaker, Vaelith, underwater library), and cause/effect is legible from package to beacon. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—he redefines the lens and his role, accepting deeper commitment. Slight ease in the execution phase (few obstacles) keeps this shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underwater library is vivid and functional; its architecture and “cathedral ribs” enable the embedding tactic and charge the final image. The environment’s memory of light (“The city remembered light”) tightens the thematic and tactical net. Sensory specificity across touch, sound, and sight is strong without tourist cataloging. Small deduction for the setting’s resistance being largely absent; it mostly cooperates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—answer the distress—tightens as he moves deeper and completes the lattice, with a clear cadence shift at activation. Agency is decisive, but obstacles are minimal; there’s no on‑page test that significantly endangers or complicates the plan. The price is conceptual (foreclosing surface, continuing burden) rather than visceral. Escalation is coherent and sufficient for the length but lacks a hard squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece reframes rescue as release and belonging through concrete acts and returns to the lens with reweighted meaning. Thematic work is image‑driven (fractures → harmonized lullaby; mausoleum → cathedral), avoiding sermon. The ending’s “broadcasted belonging” offers a resonant answer without moralizing. A few declarative lines (“It wasn’t broken; it was broadcasting”) brush summary but serve momentum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a textured, brine‑soaked diction that fits the character’s trade and the city’s ruin. Rhythm modulates well from tense discovery to reverent completion; no dialogue needed. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but remains voice‑consistent. Control under pressure is confident, with clean perspective and no head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line craft is musical and economical, with many sentences doing double duty (world + emotion). Some metaphor density and paired fragments (“Couldn’t bury it. Couldn’t ignore it.”) flirt with repetition but feel purposeful. No significant template cadence or filter‑verb stacks; clarity remains high. Minor purple flourish prevents top‑band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—a mortician in a drowned library turning a fractured lighthouse lens into a release beacon via harmonic grief—is fresh and coherent. The “belonging not rescue” turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mode, worldscale implied through micro‑acts) pay off without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction for a frictionless midsection that mutes ingenuity’s bite under pressure.</comment>
