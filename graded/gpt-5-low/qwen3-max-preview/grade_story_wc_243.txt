<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is specific and embodied (preserving “small moments” via walnut ink), with micro-choices that reveal priorities (choosing not to weep so as not to blur ink; returning night after night). Internal conflict is quiet but real: grief-management through craft vs. the lure of spectacle or tears. The archivist’s occupational lens personalizes perception without drifting into label-speak. Change is an earned endurance/renunciation: committing to an ongoing, laborious witness in place of cathartic release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene compounds sensory and thematic motifs toward a charged poise. Closure lands in the on-page resolve to continue (“She would return tomorrow…”) with the locket click and the child’s laugh reweighting the covenant. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when anchored), and set-ups (locket, ink, jetty, covenant) pay off in the final image. Cost is subtle but legible as chosen discipline/endurance over immediate grief discharge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The jetty, lanterns, twilight jasmine, salt, and ink integrate purposefully, shaping tone and micro-constraints (tears would blur ink; tide and lanterns frame the temporal window). Recurring objects (locket, journal, ink) charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding a catalog feel. The environment doesn’t dictate tactics strongly, but it consistently pressures the mode of witness and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate: reclaiming a generational covenant through attentive recording. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal—the drafting of covenant “clauses,” the choice to not weep, and the resolve to return. The cost is endurance and restraint, not spectacle; it reads but remains quiet, keeping the ceiling below the highest band. Pressure coheres with the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars (tea steam, porcelain, the locket, lanterns) and the method (“proximate causes”) rather than sermonizing, though a few explicit statements graze abstraction. The ending reweights prior material—the child’s laugh and the locket click enact conceptual repricing of covenant-as-practice. Sentiment is held in check by craft choices and concrete detail. The resonance lingers without a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, coherent lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful parallelism (“not for X, but for Y”). POV distance stays steady and credible; no head-hopping or register slips. Diction choices consistently reflect the narrator’s sensibility, giving the prose a perceptual signature. Modulations at the close are precise and earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is strong: high information density, precise images, and clean syntax. A few repeated constructions (“not for…, but…”) and abstracted pairs skirt pattern-wear, but they read intentional and do not blur sense. Figurative language holds together; no mixed metaphors or cadence templates that stall momentum. The final image is crisp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “walnut-ink archivist” and “regenerated covenant through proximate causes” frame feels fresh and specific. Risk resides in the quiet stakes and accumulative design; it pays off with a distinct ethos and tactile motifs. The locket click/child’s laugh synthesis is earned and memorable. Familiar grief/community themes are personalized through craft method and object-work.</comment>
