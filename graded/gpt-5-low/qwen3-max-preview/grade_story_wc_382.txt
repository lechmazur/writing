<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tutor’s desire—to answer a building that’s been whispering—feels specific and consistent, and her ritualized teas credibly channel that want. The neighbor dynamic carries lived subtext, with “agreed upon lies” functioning as relationship pressure. Internal contradiction is quieter (companion vs. investigator) but present. The final acceptance of key and truth reads earned, though the felt cost is muted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive: teas → seal presented → key reveal → decision to descend creates a clean tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR—the world is redefined (sentient building; tool to write back) and the relationship discards its scaffolding of lies. On‑page cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening impact. Orientation is excellent from the opening image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Rooftop garden, meteor shower, and the building’s “sigh” yield a tactile, atmospheric stage filtered through her obsession with structures. The cigar‑box seal and rusted key function as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image. While the meteor shower is more tonal than constraining, the basement‑vault directive and the roof’s recognition tilt choice and mood. Vivid without tourist‑catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through revelation and reciprocal disclosure rather than danger: the seal’s function, the building’s sentience, and the key to the vault. The decisive narrowing is choosing truth and the vault, but immediate price is light. The “lies scaffold” motif tightens the relationship stakes nicely. A small, concrete risk or sacrifice on the page would heighten consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Translation, reciprocity, and the ethics of “agreed lies” braid into a coherent meditation on communication and companionship. The final image—roof garden recognition; key and seal carried toward speech—reweights prior details without moralizing. Subtext in their tea‑dance lines is deft. Thematic richness is strong despite low overt conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical but controlled, with clean third‑person modulation and no head‑hopping. Dialogue is spare, coded, and purposeful, carrying subtext and advancing the reveal. Diction aligns with the tutor’s sensibility (hands, mortar, syntax) without register slips. Rhythm varies well across beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images like “silver scars,” “grammar in their gables,” and “charged starlight” are precise and not overstacked. Sentences do multiple jobs (world, motive, action) with minimal scaffolding. No loops or filter‑verb stacks, and the ending image is clean and earned. A few lush turns flirt with purple but stay legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Premise and turns feel fresh: a dead‑language tutor translating a sentient building via a seal, with tea‑ritual lies as social syntax. The coiled‑serpent cipher and vault behind the furnace are specific, not generic. The reveal grows organically from seeded details. Quiet risk‑taking lands without obscuring clarity.</comment>
