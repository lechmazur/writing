<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—abandon power to craft sanctuaries—and her actions align: sweeping, resting, forging orbs, and leaving. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft (calloused fingers, heat, wobbling spheres) rather than label-speak. Internal conflict is subtle (renunciation vs. making) and could use one sharper moment of doubt or risk. Still, the final choice to depart reads earned and carries a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with a clean accumulative drive that culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: orbs installed, she leaves, the room and world begin to “hum.” Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the set-ups (bookmark, spheres, melting) pay off in the final image. The cost—refusing occupation and control—is present though quiet. A hair more tightening or a small on-page impediment would push this higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control room, meltwater, and scavenged furnace are richly specific and filtered through a craftsperson’s eye. Setting charges the closure: droplets chiming on the spheres, rainbow scatter on rusted dials, bookmark suspended like a “fossilized prayer.” The environment provides resources and constraints that shape her tactics (placement of orbs, salvage fuel, console altar). Sensory texture is purposeful and evolves with the scene’s cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on renunciation and building refuge; escalation accrues via ritual beats and furnace ignition rather than direct opposition. The meaningful tightening comes when she seals the bookmark into a sphere and then chooses to leave, committing to initiation over occupation. The price is conceptual and emotional, not visceral—effective but gentle. One concrete obstacle or trade-off in-scene would deepen pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of thawing certainty into curiosity emerges through action and image (melting ice, imperfect orbs, “pause is protocol”), not moralizing. Recurrences (bookmark, spheres, drip metronome) reweight meaning at the end, offering a non-literal answer: craft creates charged spaces where questions live. A few declarative lines flirt with thesis, but they remain character-voiced and integrated as ritual narration. The finale lingers with earned, quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric voice—ceremonial yet grounded in craft—carries the piece without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with action (from patient sweeping to molten handling to hushed departure). The self-narration device is coherent and character-bound, enriching tone and meaning. Diction stays inside her plausible lexicon, braided with tactile specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level control is strong: sentences do more than one job, imagery is legible, and motifs are cleanly threaded. Occasional lushness (“gloriously, quietly, melting”) skirts purple but doesn’t blur sense or stall momentum. Repetition is purposeful (ritual invocations) rather than scaffolding. Final images are sharp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-Frost artisan seeding inquiry via flawed glass sanctuaries in an old control room—is fresh and coherent. The ritualized narration of mundane acts is an inventive engine for tone and stakes. Risks feel purposeful and pay off at closure without confusion. Only the conflict’s gentleness keeps it just shy of the very top.</comment>
