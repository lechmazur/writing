<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motivation and embodied craft details ground her choices; the breath counts and tool use feel earned. Internal contradiction is light—competence outweighs struggle—so tension is mostly reverent rather than conflicted. Her history as “once that child” adds nuance without overexplaining. The final act (pressing obsidian to the dream) aligns with her ethos and forecloses a path (this will be her final craft).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: breath → resonance → approach → capture. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act (the dream flows into the mirror) and a conceptual cost (final craft, boundary erasure that reconfigures her role). Orientation is strong from the opening; no causality breaks. Cost is more conceptual than bruising, but it’s legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and centuries‑thick fog are vivid and integrated with action (fog rings, frost pulses, blossoms erupting where light touches). The sextant and obsidian function as micro‑settings/tools that charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects her craft‑bias and urgency. The environment constrains tactics via timing and medium (twilight frost, breath visible).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is clear and tightens through ritual intensification and the dream’s cautious descent. Escalation is mostly atmospheric; resistance is minimal as the dream is curious, not antagonistic. The final choice is hers and forecloses future flight, with a soft but present price. A touch more friction or risk would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Boundary erasure, the cost of magic, and maker/made reciprocity emerge through action, not thesis. The “she had once been that child” and the astronomer’s failed instrument refract regret and purpose. The final absorbed dream reweights prior images (mirrors as thresholds/invitations/traps). Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—craft and breath inflect diction and rhythm. Distance control is steady; no head‑hopping or helper‑narration. Patterned elision (counts, fog, metal whispers) is taught and paid off. The cadence modulates cleanly at the peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with clean, tactile images; metaphors are coherent and purposeful (glass, frost, resonance). Minimal scaffolding or paraphrase loops; sentences vary in length and propulsion. Lushness stops short of purple—no muddle in peak beats. Final line is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mirror‑maker + broken sextant + breath as instrument to net a dream is a fresh synthesis rendered with conviction. The apple‑blossom eruption and obsidian capture feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in image‑logic pays off without obscuring clarity. Slightly gentler stakes keep it just shy of the rarefied tier.</comment>
