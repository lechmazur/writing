<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Embodied interiority is vivid and particular (phantom twinges, barefoot grounding), and choices emerge credibly from trauma and attention. The “freeze” triggers a believable reframe rather than an unearned epiphany. Slight therapy‑speak (“somatic markers,” “calibration”) brushes the edge but is integrated via action. The ending’s renunciation of vigilance (“before assuming the sky will split again”) carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural arc holds cleanly: entering the arboretum → freeze → reweighting of the photograph → new practice (sketching, gifting) → charged final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost on the page (unmetered crying, risk of openness). Orientation is crisp early, and motif linkages (photo/pearl/stillness) pay off causally in the internal logic. Persistent constraint (trauma imprint) shapes the tactics and final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arboretum and seaside cliff are not postcard backdrops; they constrain behavior (rusted gate gap, barefoot grounding), co‑author the art (rain/wind/petals), and charge the finale (dew “pearl” in web). Sensory detail is selective and lived, with weather and decay affecting outcomes. The lighthouse absence tones the atmosphere without overstatement. The final image depends on this exact environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (calibrating hope without denial) are signaled and tighten through the held‑breath “freeze” that redefines the photograph and unlocks new behavior. The cost is vulnerability and relinquishing defensive counting/measurement of grief. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the accumulative lens, culminating in a practiced pause before reaction. No antagonistic counterforce on the page, but internal pressure coheres and deepens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stillness as the eye within chaos, grief transformed into practice and gift. Recurring images (photo → compass; pearl → pulse) evolve meaning without didactic summary. One slightly explicit line (“stillness… is not the absence of chaos”) edges toward thesis, but it’s earned by particulars. The resonance lingers as a lived method rather than a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and sensorially biased toward tactility and timing; diction remains coherent with the narrator’s history. Rhythm modulates well at the freeze and at the closing cadence. Clinical terms appear but feel character‑true given therapy context. POV is steady first person with clean temporal control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful images (“jasmine and gunpowder,” “vines curl… like frames”). Figurative language is sustained yet controlled; metaphors don’t clash and momentum holds. Minimal redundancy; syntax variety supports breath and pressure. No artifacts or loops that dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Combines war‑trauma aftermath with a decaying cliffside arboretum and somatic‑practice into a fresh, inevitable synthesis. The dew “pearl” translation of an internal state to environment is a memorable turn. Risks a lyric‑mosaic mode without losing clarity. The specific pairing of drone‑strike memory with this place and method feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
