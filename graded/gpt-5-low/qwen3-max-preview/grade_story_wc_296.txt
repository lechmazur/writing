<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority: she fears the seed’s revelations yet chooses to kneel and press her palm, allowing rooting with cost. Contradictory impulses (guardian vs. revealer) operate in scene, not summary. The final unguarding reads earned by the expanding‑circle ordeal. Minor note: her competence makes the path feel assured, slightly softening struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration: the seed’s circles culminate in heart‑level release and a reweighted world (“lake drained into sky”). Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when), and the closure cost is on the page (surrender of armor, cracked ribs as release). Persistent constraints (seed/lake/orchard) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cursed lake/orchard vortex is specific, vivid, and integral; it witnesses, pressures, and then inverts at payoff. Details filter through the druid’s bias (truth as roots/branches), and the environment charges the final images (crown, point of light, lake into sky). World rules are taught by action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (submit to revelation vs. remain guarded) is signaled early and tightens via the seed’s expanding circles. The meaningful deepening comes when rooting reaches her heart—foreclosing the old stance with felt cost. Pressure is coherent under an accumulative lens, though external jeopardy is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus mirror‑surface emerges through events (frozen confessions thaw, ribs unbend) and charged images. A few declarative lines (“Mirrors lie,” the stated mission to “unbend others”) verge on didactic and soften subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs without a neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stable, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythm modulates well under pressure. Diction and metaphors cohere to the botanical/lacustrine palette. Minor risk of elevated register piling, but voice remains controlled and character‑bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density and momentum with few expendable lines; imagery often does double duty. Figurative saturation occasionally edges toward purple (“petals like shards of stained glass,” “obsidian mirrors”), but clarity and propulsion hold. No notable loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a truth‑seeking druid, a flesh‑eating seed that unbends rather than devours, and an orchard vortex that inverts into sky. Risk‑taking in concept and imagery lands with coherence and on‑page cost. The mission coda is the least novel note, but the core vision feels singular.</comment>
