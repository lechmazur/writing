<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation (hunger to map emotion) is vivid and consistent, and specific choices (pressing the halo to her temple, testing the clockmaker, the final unsigned glyph) reveal character under pressure. The erosion from “losing her own name” adds a credible cost and contradiction to her empathy method. However, most turns are summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, so micro‑choices under immediate pressure are limited. The lack of an on‑page relational crucible keeps some complexity theoretical rather than enacted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the halo’s draining, the vanishing stars, and the pamphlet cycle build to a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise ending. Closure carries cost—the halo’s final dimming and her walk into dark with the unsolved mathematics. Orientation is clear early (operator, workshop, night sky); pattern is taught and paid off. Slight distance from causal beats (key consequences happen off‑page) keeps this just shy of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is specific and integrated: the topaz workshop, brass keys, spectral equations, and the halo as object-as-setting shape perception and the closing image atop the press. The “between vanishing stars” sky functions as a temporal and atmospheric frame that tightens the final act. World rules remain consistent and learned through action (halo’s empathy physics). Minor penalty for limited tactile constraint on choices beyond tone and the final cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes escalate via density: halo dimming, vanishing constellations, and the widening social impact (clockmaker, warlord). Her agency culminates in spending the last of the halo on a single multi‑valent glyph, a choice with visible cost. Pressure is coherent but mostly reported rather than dramatized, muting visceral tension. The dominant stake remains conceptual rather than directly contested on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as geometry; ambiguity as pedagogy; cost of boundaryless identification) emerges organically from events and motifs. The final glyph that can mean “beginning/ending/bridge” reweights the whole—an elegant, non‑moralizing answer. Counter‑currents (hunger vs. erosion; revelation vs. manipulation) are alive without sermonizing. The warlord/clockmaker beats serve resonance but, being off‑stage, slightly soften the thematic blow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent with a distinct perceptual signature (“integral of a sob,” “asymptote of longing”). Distance is stable; patterned elision is taught and controlled. Diction matches the mythic-scientific register of the piece without slips. Minor risk of lushness crowding breath in a few sentences keeps it below the top tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line work is largely precise, with layered images doing multiple jobs and few redundancies; rhythms vary and the final cadence lands cleanly. While dense, the figurative system is internally consistent (math/emotion/astral) and avoids mixed metaphors. A touch of purple risk appears in stacked abstractions, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. No notable loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress craft, non‑Euclidean empathy, and a halo fragment as collapsed empathy‑space—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mosaic, conceptual science-emotion fusion) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration honors the setup with a charged, specific image. Slight reliance on summary for major impacts is the only limiter.</comment>
