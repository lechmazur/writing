<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich, particular interiority (“move like fear given legs”) and lived contradictions (phobic stunt double) drive credible choices under pressure. Motivation tightens from decoding guilt-trails to burning the film, with an earned reconfiguration at the end. A few thesis-like lines verge on telling, but the embodied beats (knees cracking, dust, heat) keep it grounded. The final stance reads earned, with visible renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: decrypt notes → locate reel → choose to burn → release. Single-POV accumulative drive holds; the shell’s instruction is seeded and paid off without breaking the world’s rules. Closure lands on-page with cost (destruction of “masterpiece” and self-redefinition). The “respectful” fire feels slightly convenient, but not enough to undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rusted, star-leaking library and the projector create a charged micro-setting that shapes tactics and the final image. Details are selective and purposeful (collapsed astronomy, dust in starlight), filtered through a stunt worker’s body and fear. The environment supplies the hidden reel and frames the burn, directly constraining choice. Recurring objects (shell, projector) charge the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberation from a mentor’s theft—stays coherent and tightens into the decisive burn. The decryption deepens pressure and narrows options; agency drives the climax. Emotional and material prices register, though physical peril is softened by the “respectful” fire. Internal and external conflicts interlock effectively at the projector.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of betrayal, guilt, and vulnerability-as-strength emerge through images (shell whispers, burning celluloid) and action. A couple of thesis-forward lines risk overstatement, but most insights feel earned by particulars (“trembling certainty” as armor). The final repricing—destroying the footage to reclaim self—resonates without tidy moralizing. Subtext of complicity/guilt in the mentor’s trail adds complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinctive, lyrical first-person voice with controlled rhythm and evocative lexicon remains stable under pressure. Compression and patterning are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping and no register drift; imagery tends rich without losing legibility. The cadence modulates effectively from whisper to chant to quiet.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax and purposeful metaphors; lines do multiple jobs. Occasional purple touches (“fire spreads slowly, respectfully”) flirt with sentimentality but don’t blur sense. Little to no scaffolding or loops; propulsion remains steady. Copy is clean and sequencing clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a phobic stunt double decoding a cast in a star-punctured library, guided by a whispering shell, to burn a mentor’s reel. Turns feel earned by prior particulars rather than template mechanics. The sensory and conceptual blend is bold without gimmickry. Minor familiar beats (betrayal confessions) are transformed by specific objects and setting.</comment>
