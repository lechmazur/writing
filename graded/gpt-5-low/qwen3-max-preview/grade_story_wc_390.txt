<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motive and embodied attention to tools and environment; her “logically emotional” calibration reads in action. Limited contradiction or felt flaw under pressure keeps her from transcending into complexity; she’s a near‑paragon. Exhaustion is the only visible cost. The mid‑crisis composure borders on ease, softening character struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: ice sings → key activates → descent → sonic assault → counter‑resonance → absolution. Closure lands on the page with a clear before/after and a modest cost (exhaustion, reconfigured world stance). No orientation debt; the drive lens reads Causal with lyric texture. Slight convenience in the total neutralization of threats keeps it just shy of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina and lighthouse aren’t wallpaper; they shape tactics (step‑matching to ice, hidden seam, bioluminescent descent). Sensory specificity is strong across cold, sound, and light, filtered through her engineer’s bias. The environment constrains movement and solution method. A hair more friction from setting at the climax could have elevated this to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates credibly with the sonic harpoon strike, forcing an immediate tactical shift into counter‑frequency buffering. The dominant stake (protect the Heartstone) stays coherent. Resolution relies on her agency, but the conflict resolves quickly and cleanly, with minimal aftermath cost. The antagonistic force dissolves rather than extracts a price, softening impact.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motifs (ice song, key, resonance) converge into a humane stance: consonance over force. However, the explicit moralizing line (“reminded the world that even violence could be answered…”) states the thesis and blunts subtext at the end. The theme is otherwise organically earned by event. A quieter final image would have deepened lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (engineering precision meeting reverence). Rhythm modulates with pressure, and elisions are purposeful. Diction fits the character’s lexicon; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional elevated abstractions brush sentiment but do not derail control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong line‑level control, vivid verbs, and efficient image economy; repetition (“Through vibrational matching…”) functions as an earned motif. Minor purple glints and a few intensifier stacks edge toward excess, but clarity and propulsion hold. No scaffold loops or filter‑verb stacks; syntax varies well. The peak beat remains legible and musical.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blend of maritime engineering with mystical acoustics feels fresh; “sonic absolution” reframes confrontation inventively. Recurrences (key, pulse, ice song) pay off with non‑obvious synthesis. The absolution of scavengers risks neatness but fits the concept’s integrity. High originality without gimmickry.</comment>
