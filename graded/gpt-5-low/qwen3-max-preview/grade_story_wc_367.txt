<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid, coherent interiority with a distinctive ethos (“neither malice nor mercy”) and concrete ritual choices (raising the wick, whispering paradoxes). The accidental-prophet flaw adds texture and implied cost, but pressure rarely forces a conflicted trade-off on the page. Emotional embodiment is mostly lyrical rather than felt through struggle, leaving contradiction underused. The endurance at the end reads credible but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design is taught early and sustained; the lantern-ritual deepens to a charged poise ending. Orientation is clear from the opening and the pattern coheres to closure. Cost is present (fatigue, eternal charge, love disguised as storm) but stays conceptual rather than dramatized in a decisive turn. The closure image—mirror/map/moment—cleanly reconfigures the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly specific and integral: the emerald lighthouse, jade meteorite stairs, and sea/sky interplay actively frame options and the final image. The lantern functions as micro-setting that charges the last beat. Sensory selection and world rules feel consistent and purposeful. Minor bias toward visual/lyric over tactile constraint keeps it just shy of transcendent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on guiding human longing; the urgency spike (“stars… pulsed with unusual urgency”) and the wick’s flare provide a meaningful deepening. However, escalation lacks a pressured trade-off or narrowed options—she succeeds without significant tactical adaptation. The felt price is endurance and vigilance rather than a costly choice. Tension remains more atmospheric than oppositional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (light/dark reciprocity, story vs. data) unify into a coherent stance, and the final invitation image reweights the world’s desire for awe. Some lines tilt toward thesis (“Not algorithms, but awe. Not data, but destiny.”), edging into declared theme rather than purely emergent resonance. Still, the particulars—lantern of god-breath, inverted shadow—anchor the meditation. The wisdom feels earned if a bit stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyrical voice with stable focalization and measured cadence shifts at peak beats. Diction is purposeful and consistent with the mythic register. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible. A few aphoristic lines flirt with sermonizing, but overall distance control and texture impress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with evocative metaphors that mostly cohere (“inverted shadow” illuminating is a sharp turn). Some list-like parallelisms and intensifiers risk mild overwriting in the final third, but momentum holds. Sentence rhythm varies and carries the accumulative pressure. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—total internal reflection as fate-steering, a lantern wick spun from a god’s last breath—feels singular and inevitable by the end. Risks in diction and cosmology pay off without obscuring clarity. The emotional core (vigilant love as storm) grounds the concept. Slight safety in conflict stakes keeps it under the topmost band.</comment>
