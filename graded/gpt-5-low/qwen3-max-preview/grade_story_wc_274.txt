<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and contradictory—duty vs. conscience—embodied by trembling hands and the “bravely conflicted” stance that resolves into decisive action. Her choice to use the Resonance Table and then accept arrest carries visible cost. The single exchange with Veyra sharpens status dynamics without overexplaining. The endurance afterward (scrubbed name, quarantine) reads as earned consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Structure coheres under an accumulative lens: preparation → activation → citywide resonance → capture → aftermath. Closure lands through a charged reconfiguration—truth seeded into the populace at the cost of the archivist’s erasure. Causality is clean (device → broadcast → social ripple); the later montage expands consequences without diffusing the core line. Orientation is crisp from the first sentence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The frozen library, Resonance Table, and “iron and jasmine” scent create a tactile, purposeful environment. The tool-as-setting (Table, dormant networks in walls) directly enables the decisive act and charges the final image (“walls whispered”). Weather and architecture modulate tone and choice. World rules feel consistent and learned through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ignite truth despite personal risk—is signaled early and tightens when the Table syncs and guards arrive. The cost is legible: arrest, erasure, quarantine. Escalation is mainly internal-to-societal rather than adversarial reversal, but it coheres under the chosen lens. The refusal to flee functions as a credible endurance choice that forecloses safety.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth as contagion versus regime silence emerges through concrete acts and images (Resonance Table, emotional broadcast). The line “truth doesn’t need volume” toes aphorism but is earned by the scene. Recurring quiet/snow motifs reweight the final image without moralizing. Ambiguity remains around outcomes, but meaning is clear and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person close is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature tied to the archivist’s sensibility. Diction is consistent and purposeful; brief dialogue feels natural and charged. Psychic distance tightens at pressure points without leakage. Elision (citywide ripple) is taught and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical for its density; images often do double duty. Minor purple tendencies are controlled, and syntax varies to sustain momentum. No paraphrase loops or template cadences dull the peak beats. The final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of cryogenic archiving, emotion-as-signal, and a resonance device feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Dystopian scaffolding is familiar but transformed by specific mechanisms (cryo-wax, quantum relays as moldings). The risk of a silent, citywide emotional broadcast pays off thematically and structurally. Distinctive tone and imagery elevate beyond template.</comment>
