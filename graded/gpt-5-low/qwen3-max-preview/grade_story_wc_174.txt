<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, coherent interiority with a credible flaw-to-intention arc: from aesthetic evasion to accountable artistry. The veteran’s bottle and the non‑flinch reveal value hierarchy; the final plan to return to Mira with a new show lands as a micro‑choice with cost. Some moments state motive outright rather than dramatize it (“You make poison look like calligraphy”), reducing contradiction on the page. Still, the puppet self and the stick-as-compass concretize growth without safety‑hedging.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: present‑tense rehearsal frame interleaves charged past beats toward a Charged Poise closure (earned serenity; intent to face Mira through art). Orientation is crisp from the opening; the stick and candle recur to scaffold causality. The cost is implied (risking rejection, abandoning lucrative moral evasion) rather than enacted, but it’s legible in the final poise. One tightening turn—the bottle incident reframed as punctuation—reweights the present stance effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective environment—rain as Morse, rivets as eyes, Cold War ribs—filtered through a craft‑obsessed mind. The campfire stick functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image and constraining attention/tactics (listening for epiphanies, warmth as compass). The radar dome’s acoustics and isolation aptly host the rehearsal‑as‑vigil. Descriptions serve pressure rather than touristic catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical accountability vs. complicity) is clean, with a meaningful deepening at the “violence as punctuation” turn. On‑page pressure is contemplative; most danger lives in recollection, so escalation is felt more as cadence than narrowing options. The closure depends on acceptance of a cost to the relationship/artistic livelihood, not a decisive on‑page confrontation. Still, the final resolve to return with a risky show earns a credible tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres—story as fire, truth resurrected through subversion—with strong image systems (char, ink, candle, radar echoes). The line “ethical storytelling wasn’t about purity, but accountability” states the thesis, edging into moralizing and slightly blunting subtext. Nevertheless, the puppet self and “write in blood and honey” reprice prior material without neat absolution. Resonance lingers through the charged final image rather than tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, confident lyric third with controlled rhythm; metaphors are voice‑true to an urbane calligrapher turned puppeteer. Distance remains stable; no head‑hopping; compressions feel intentional. Occasional aphoristic statements press toward essayistic register but don’t fracture the stance. The cadence modulates well from seedy bars to “meteor hush.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete nouns, and multi‑tasking images (“swept up the glass with a calligraphy brush”). Some figurative density risks purple, but coherence holds and images track physically. Minimal redundancy; momentum maintained despite reflection. Final lines land cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis—calligraphy as complicity, puppet subversion, Cold War dome, Navajo story stick aphorism—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The bottle-as-punctuation turn and “stories burn twice” motif elevate without gimmickry. Risk is thematic and formal rather than plot‑twisty, and it pays off in a charged poise. Slight deduct for a few explanatory lines that reduce mystery.</comment>
