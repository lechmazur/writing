<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gardener’s inner drive is concrete and embodied through tactile choices (humming to threads, selecting the needle, stitching to reveal rather than repair). Contradictory impulses—blithe caretaker vs. steward of grief—coexist and sharpen in the silo. Her closing behavioral shift (from lullabies to questions) feels earned, though the visible cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatically tested. The arc is strong but could tighten with one on‑page price or risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: cemetery → descent → tapestry decoding → stitching release → reconfigured worldview. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: graves become thresholds and her practice shifts accordingly. Causality within the lyric frame is clean (silo’s call → case’s needle → action that triggers the release). The cost is subtle but present in the renunciation of her prior stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the cobalt silo’s acoustics, rusted rungs, and open crown shape the ritual and charge the meteor’s final image. Objects-as-setting (sovereign case, tapestry, needle) materially constrain choices and enable the turn. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her profession and grief. The world rule (tactile decoding reveals intentions) is learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes focus on transforming how she relates to the dead/intentions; tension deepens as threads yield specific human costs and the border loosens. The decisive tightening occurs when she uses the needle to stitch-to-reveal, releasing the silo’s stored yearning. Pressure is primarily internal and textural, but the tremor and humming case give it physical valence. A slightly clearer on‑page trade‑off would elevate the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of intention vs. action and care vs. disruption emerge organically from image and task. The line “Intentions were not destinations…” edges toward explicit statement, yet it’s earned by prior particulars and reweighted by the ending image (thresholds, questions). Recurring motifs (lullaby, threads, sovereign case) accrue meaning and transform at closure. The resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains the piece; diction and rhythm suit the protagonist’s sensibility. POV distance is stable, with precise filtering through her tactile attention. No dialogue needed; the voice modulates with pressure (from gentle caretaking to revelation). The lushness is disciplined enough to preserve clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line work is polished, dense, and purposeful; metaphors cohere (threads, serpents, echoes) and rarely overreach. Momentum holds despite lyric scope, with minimal redundancy. Variations in sentence rhythm match pressure shifts (descent, ritual, release). A few stacked images flirt with excess but do not blur the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: a cemetery gardener decoding a tapestry of intentions in a repurposed war silo via a sovereign case-needle. Risks in concept and diction pay off with an inevitable-seeming reconfiguration at the end. Emotional truth grounds the strangeness. The images feel singular rather than template-derived.</comment>
