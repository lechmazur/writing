<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and embodied action (pressing seeds to skin, murmuring syllables) motivate the pursuit. The pivot from “solve” to “carry” feels earned through contact with the crater glass. Contradictory impulses (delight inside loss) are present but lightly tested. The visible cost is conceptual—renouncing certainty—credible at this length but not deeply contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres toward a conceptual repricing at the crater glass. Who/where/when are crisply anchored early; the drive lens holds through closure. The realization that “missing pieces were given away” reconfigures the goal into stewardship with on‑page follow‑through (gathering seeds, pendant). Cost is present but subtle; no causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The geode’s iridescence and phosphorescent moss are vivid and POV‑filtered, with the crater glass functioning as a charged object that shapes the ending image (now a pendant). Sensory economy is strong, skewed to visual with purposeful tactile accents (salt, cool glass). The environment doesn’t force a tactical constraint, but it decisively charges the final image and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via a density shift: seed → crater glass → conceptual flip. Stakes remain largely internal; there’s little narrowing of options beyond the renunciation of “solving,” so the price reads more philosophical than felt. Still, the decision to plant seeds and carry mystery is a credible tightening under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme integrates through particulars (seeds as emotions, routes as gifts) and culminates in a resonant reframe of loss as offering. However, final‑paragraph assertions (“Some paths disappear… so new ones can be sung…”) voice the thesis too directly, softening subtext. The strongest thematic work is in the nonverbal: wearing the glass, planting seeds.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with consistent perceptual signature (salt, auroras, kelp‑paper) and controlled cadence. Diction suits the fable‑lyric mode; brief quoted murmurs feel organic. Psychic distance is steady; no head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythm tightens at the crater glass, then relaxes into the charged final image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with few redundancies; images generally cohere. A mild tendency toward lushness risks purple in places, but clarity holds, and the figurative net is consistent. The final beats are cleanly rendered without loop or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “recollectionist” premise, emotion‑seeds, and crater glass synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The realization that disappearance can be a gift reweights prior images elegantly. Risk‑taking in diction and worldbuilding pays off without obscuring clarity. A deeper on‑page cost might have vaulted it higher.</comment>
