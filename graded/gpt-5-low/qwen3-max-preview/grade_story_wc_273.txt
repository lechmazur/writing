<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clarion motive and embodied interiority (“serene anger,” the reed‑pen work, the self‑trial) lead to a costly, character‑driven choice. Contradictory impulses are muted; she reads as resolute more than conflicted. Micro‑choices (spilling ink by design, applying it to her temples) reveal values without therapy‑speak. The renunciation—choosing disappearance in pursuit of knowledge—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: observation → pattern recognition → self‑experiment → disappearance, with coherent because/therefore links. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and closure lands on the page with cost. The brief coda through Ghostwing’s “understanding” shifts vantage but keeps the lens. No major setup is dropped.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: wind‑carved camp, ozone‑scented ink, titanium hummingbird. Tools-as-setting (ink, Ghostwing) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection matches urgency and POV bias, avoiding tourist catalog. World rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding time in crisis—tightens as her tactics escalate from observing to self‑application with irreversible cost. The key deepening (ink mirrors neural collapse) catalyzes the decisive act. Tension operates at line and beat levels without needing an external antagonist. Stakes remain personal yet consequential in the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Resonant theme (time slow as witness‑protection vs. external mercy) emerges through particulars (ink’s vanishing, neural mirroring, the voluntary fade). The final explicit thesis line (“not to save you, but to let you choose how you vanish”) tips into thematic statement, dulling subtext. Still, the closing image reweights earlier motifs with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—precise, tactile, austere—remains controlled under pressure. Diction and rhythm feel intentional; filtered noticing suits a tracker‑scientist temperament. The brief pivot into Ghostwing’s cognition reads patterned and legible, not head‑hoppy. No dialogue needed; voice carries action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors; cadence varies and propulsion holds. Occasional purple edges (“dirge,” “silent theater”) flirt with excess but do not blur logic. Minimal scaffolding; no loops. Final images are sharp and sequenced cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: disappearing ink as neural/temporal analog, a tracker’s self‑sacrifice, and a hummingbird drone witnessing a metaphysical exit. The turn feels inevitable in hindsight and avoids genre template. Risks (lyric science‑mysticism, object POV coda) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final insight recasts prior images rather than merely decorating them.</comment>
