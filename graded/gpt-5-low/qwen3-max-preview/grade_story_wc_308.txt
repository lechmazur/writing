<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single‑POV interiority feels specific and embodied (“tuning its inner resonance to the rhythm of the flock’s flight”). Motivation is coherent—listening over motion—and the Earned Stasis at the end is credible (“It would not journey today. Nor tomorrow.”). The character’s contradiction (keeper vs. chaser) resolves into principled endurance with visible cost. Slight archetypal tilt limits deeper messy ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds cleanly: observation → decoding → acceptance of the pulse → renunciatory stasis. Orientation is clear early (towers of bone in a canyon) and closure lands on the page with cost. The closing image reconfigures options (becoming landmark, not path-chaser) without causal breaks. Tight, single‑scene coherence with one meaningful tightening via the murmuration beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: bone towers, echoing canyon, and crows are not postcard detail but pressure the tactic (stillness, listening) and charge the final image. The arrowhead functions as a micro‑setting tool that recurs and anchors touch. Environmental rules stay consistent and felt (thermals, echoes, calcified ribs). The milieu meaningfully shapes what choices are possible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guidance through attention, not motion) tightens with the crows’ pattern culminating in the pulse lodging in the chest. The price is renunciation and prolonged waiting, made explicit. Escalation reads as density and pattern precision rather than reversals, which fits the chosen lens. Stakes remain primarily conceptual, but the cost is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—alignment over velocity, guidance as mirroring—emerges strongly from images and recurrence. However, the prose sometimes states its thesis outright (“They mistook velocity for direction,” “You do not chase the path. You become the landmark.”), slightly dulling subtext. Despite that, the final reweighting resonates and avoids tidy closure beyond the chosen stance. The arrowhead and flock accrue meaning effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with disciplined distance; diction and rhythm match the austere reverence of the piece. POV certainty aligns with what the focalizer could infer, and patterned elision is taught early. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Minor risk of elevated diction flattening variability, but the tonal control mostly carries it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: imagery is controlled, syntax varied, and repetitions feel purposeful. Occasional aphoristic lines verge on didactic, but they do not obscure sense or momentum. Information density is high with minimal scaffold or loops. The cadence breathes at key beats (murmuration, final refusal) without purple blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—physics-as-reverence, navigation-by-stillness, bone towers—feels fresh and internally inevitable. The murmuration as instrument and the arrowhead as memory-tool elevate beyond trope. Quiet risk‑taking (lyric accumulative design with Earned Stasis) pays off clearly. Slight thematic explicitness trims the edge from a 9+.</comment>
