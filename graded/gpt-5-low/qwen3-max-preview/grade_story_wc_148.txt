<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crisply framed (“not for redemption — to thread a labyrinth with his own story”) and every choice aligns with it, culminating in sealing the voices into the lens. Interiority is embodied through tactile, sensory specifics (rust, brine, candle wax) rather than labels. The internal conflict is understated—he’s largely resolved—so contradiction is muted, but the legacy of mistrust adds credible pressure. The final renunciation of credibility (“They’d call him mad”) lands as a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: entry → discovery → insertion → summoning → sealing, each beat narrowing options. Closure is on-page and costly: he traps the witnesses in the lens and forecloses being believed in person, shifting truth into the lighthouse’s beam (a Conceptual Repricing with Earned Stasis notes). Orientation is clear early (lighthouse prison, reef, dusk), and the “before they find the bodies” clock is paid off by the search party’s arrival. No teleports or unkept setups; the lattice’s property is seeded and used.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, reef, lantern room, and lens are tactically decisive—each constrains what he can do and charges the ending image. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (brine, copperlight, groaning wood), with weather and architecture affecting action. World rules remain consistent within the fable-logic register. The recurring lens-as-setting functions as micro-setting and object, powering the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (inscribing truth before authorities arrive) is signaled and tightened by the live clock and by the witnesses gathered. Escalation is protagonist-driven: finding, prying, aligning, then sealing—the mid-beat “hover” deepens pressure by reweighting the beam into voices. Cost is legible: personal credibility and bodily expenditure (“spent,” called mad). While the conflict is largely one-sided, the situational pressure coheres and grows.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of belief vs. action and the transmutation of testimony into infrastructure accrues through images (lattice, lens, beam as whispers). Subtext works via witness vs. ghost and the ethical turn from seeking belief to embedding truth. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“Truth, made luminous.”), slightly reducing subtlety, but the final charged poise rescues it. The closing stance—truth carried by ships—offers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and apt, with a distinct lyric cadence that tightens under pressure. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with purposeful repetitions (“copperlight repose,” “hover”) that the piece teaches and pays off. No head-hopping, and the single spoken line lands with weight. The voice’s perceptual signature (salt, metal, prayerlike mechanics) remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiplicity—image, action, and theme—without excess scaffolding, and momentum persists through the ritualized acts. Figurative density is high but largely coherent; occasional intensifiers verge on purple without obscuring sense. Variations in sentence length support breath and pressure, and key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. The closer’s syntax is clean and lands sharply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—confessional lattice installed into a lighthouse to make testimony infrastructural—is striking and specific. Familiar motifs (lighthouse, boy-who-cried-wolf) are transformed with fresh stakes and tactics. The “hovering” light as whispered witness is an earned, non-obvious turn. Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens coherence without muddling clarity.</comment>
