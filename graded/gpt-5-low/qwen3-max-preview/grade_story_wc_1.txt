<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied through tactile actions—studying frost, rebuilding a kiln, and gifting glass. Motivation (heal/transform via “retracing”) is clear and consistent. The contradiction—survival as subtraction vs. making luminous work—registers, though conflict remains mostly inward and gentle. Emotional beats avoid therapy‑speak and feel character‑particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: recurring frost/ledger patterns culminate in the cipher reveal and the altar/ritual closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she renounces commerce, reframes the ledger as mercy and purpose, and institutes a daily rite. Cost is felt conceptually (self‑exile, refusal to sell) and carried through the final image. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon, frost, and kiln are sensorially vivid and purpose‑driven, shaping options (frost as map/pattern source; sand for glass; isolation for healing). Environmental persistence (wind/water patience) mirrors method and constrains pacing. The final image is charged by place—stars, canyon, altar. Details are filtered through the artisan’s perceptual priorities, avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on regaining purpose and reinterpreting the ledger’s meaning; pressure coheres through pattern accretion. The frost‑ledger synchrony is a clear tightening that alters knowledge and reweights her path. Costs are quiet but legible (renunciation of commerce, chosen solitude). Escalation is subtle yet sufficient under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (transformation through patient retracing; survival as subtraction) arises organically from action and image. The ledger’s re‑pricing from commerce to mercy smartly reweights prior material. A few declaratives (“Purpose… wasn’t a destination”) flirt with explicitness but remain earned by the specifics. The final ritualized poise offers resonant, non‑moralizing closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled cadence and image systems; POV distance is steady and plausible. Diction fits the artisan’s sensibility and remains consistent through pressure. Purposeful compression and parallelism are taught early and pay off. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are polished with varied rhythm; images often do double duty (craft, theme, setting). Minor risk of over‑ornament in a few aphoristic sentences, but clarity and propulsion hold. Repetitions (“No grand declarations… No forced epiphanies”) are purposeful and not loop‑scaffold. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—glass art guided by frost patterns decoding a smuggler’s “mercy ledger”—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in a quiet, accumulative mode heightens resonance without obscuring clarity. Objects and place are reimagined with specificity rather than trope. The revaluation of smuggling as escape‑mapping is an elegant, original turn.</comment>
