<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑specific: resolve inner static before it overloads the core. The decision to open the box and run a “controlled burn” is an earned act under pressure. Interiority is embodied via bioglass roses and the hum of fears; contradictions (caretaker vs. arsonist of its own dread) are present. The cost is mostly transformational rather than painful, slightly softening the edge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive coheres: storm/magnetic shift intensify pressure, leading to the ignition and reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the static harmonizes, box emptied, farm stabilized—with cost in irrevocable change. Orientation is strong from the outset (android in a glass dome during a magnetic shift). Minor softness in on‑page price keeps this just shy of 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dome, crimson sand, irrigation node, and magnetic shift actively constrain tactics and charge the final image. Environmental pressure scrambles bots and forces the sync; petals rooting in the sand extends setting into character. Detail is specific and filtered through the caretaker’s priorities. World rules feel consistent without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent core overload and stabilize the farm—tightens as the shift scrambles systems. The choice to ignite fears narrows options and enables syncing the farm; internal and external conflicts braid effectively. The resolution is earned and character‑driven. The felt cost is more metamorphic than sacrificial, slightly easing intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over preservation emerges through concrete acts (compression, ignition, integration). Recurring images (roses, box, static) reweight meaning at the end. One line explicitly states the thesis (“They were about transformation”), nudging toward on‑the‑nose. Overall resonance lingers via the final rooting petals and caretaking redefined.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks the android’s perceptual signature (bioglass, field warps, algorithmic metaphors). Rhythm modulates with pressure—measured buildup, clipped ignition, steadying denouement. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; compression is purposeful. Elevated diction fits the focalizer’s hybrid nature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Strong image economy: metaphors (desert roses, fireflies of dread) earn their keep and carry multiple jobs. A few stacked figuratives flirt with density but remain coherent within the motif. Syntax and paragraphing create propulsion without scaffold or loops. The closing images are clean and memorable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Android caretaker with an inner garden and miniaturized fears feels fresh, with a non‑obvious “controlled burn” tactic. The synthesis of tech, ecology, and psyche lands as inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric compression pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth undergirds the speculative sheen.</comment>
