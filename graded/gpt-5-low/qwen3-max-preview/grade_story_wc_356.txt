<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elira’s motive—cultivating serenity within motion—is distinct and consistently embodied through olfactory perception and ritualized journaling. Her agency (predicting dusk bloom, choosing to inhale, replanting the husk) reveals character under pressure. However, internal contradiction is light; she faces little genuine temptation or risk beyond endurance of the stench. The change reads as deepening of an already-set stance rather than a hard-earned pivot.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative structure tightens from dormancy to omen to bloom to village repricing, with closure landing as a felt CR/Earned Stasis hybrid. The “tide’s thought” turning coheres with the collective shift and sets the clock for the bloom and Elira’s choice to inhale. Cost is legible in the stench endured and in relinquishing control to surrender. Minor reliance on mythic coincidence (collective doubt crest) is thematically apt and does not undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The treetop village and suspended greenhouse are sensorially vivid and filtered through an olfactory lens. The corpse flower as object-as-setting constrains behavior at the climax (most flee; Elira endures), charging the final image. Detail is purposeful and consistent, with weather/scent cues affecting action. Strong economy avoids museum-tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding equilibrium and guiding the village through change) is clear, with a meaningful tightening at the bloom. Elira’s agency is endurance and attention rather than decisive confrontation, but it still forecloses the path of avoidance. Costs are present (stench, tears, the willingness to be altered), though the conflict never truly jeopardizes her core aim. Tension is steady more than harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of surrender, grief as fertilizer, and wisdom beneath chaos emerge organically from the bloom and aftermath. Recurring images (tide, roots, wrapping-paper maps) reweight at the end. A few lines verge on thesis-stating (“grief is fertilizer...”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance lingers through the closing image of “wildflower hush.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with a strong perceptual signature anchored in scent; diction is controlled and consistent. Rhythm modulates well across reflection and event; no head-hopping or stance drift. Compression reads confident and pattern-taught. Absence of dialogue is apt for the piece’s contemplative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent figurative language rooted in botany and weather. Minimal redundancy; sentences propel rather than stall. Lushness occasionally nears saturation but stays legible and voice-true. Opening and final lines are strong images that frame the arc.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The olfactory-driven herbalist in a treetop village with a mythic “tide’s thought” gives fresh texture; the corpse flower as revelation engine feels inventive. Turns grow from established motifs rather than late rule drops. The insight isn’t wholly novel, but the delivery system is. Risk-taking in tone and sensory focus pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
