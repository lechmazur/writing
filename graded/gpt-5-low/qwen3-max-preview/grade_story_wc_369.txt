<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear, particular, and sustained: an arboreal curiosity reframes her “repair” into listening and mapping. Embodied choices—patient deconstruction, refusal to force, the final “Show me”—reveal character. Internal contradiction is light; little friction challenges her competence or belief. The final renunciation of “fixing” for remembering lands but at a modest felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: patient handling → lunar healing → projection of dreams → decision to follow → forest offering → cartographer stance. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a before/after (technician to pilgrim-cartographer). Causality is clean and props are kept; the cost is conceptual/emotional rather than materially pressured. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: stormlit tower, moonlight, and forest all shape outcomes (moonlight heals; trees disclose keepsakes). Object-as-setting (sextant) fuses with place to charge the final image. Sensory texture is carefully filtered through the worker’s craft-driven attention. The environment subtly constrains options without grand exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes tighten through a shift from technical repair to ethical attention—choosing to carry witnessed sorrow. Escalation is lyrical rather than adversarial; the major turn is the projection and the decision to follow. Visible cost is soft (no counter-force tests this choice). Tension holds, but remains gentle, with low consequence risk on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory, stewardship, and the redistribution of grief emerge organically from action and image. Recurring motifs (moonlight, brass, trees as witnesses) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The astronomer’s implied path refracts the protagonist’s choice, adding humane complexity. The piece elicits quiet, earned wonder rather than sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable, with a distinct, patient lyric texture matching the worker’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well, and the single whispered line lands with subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; the diction supports the mythic-literal blend. Elision is purposeful and paid off by closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image-dense, and purposeful; metaphors cohere (e.g., “measuring what fell from them”). Minor flourish is controlled; repetition serves cadence rather than padding. No obvious loops or scaffold; momentum is maintained through discovery. A few high-lyric runs flirt with purple but never blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sextant-as-sorrow-meter guiding a cartography of arboreal witness is fresh and deeply integrated. The moon-healing mechanic and forest offerings feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric closure) pay off with coherence. The synthesis reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
