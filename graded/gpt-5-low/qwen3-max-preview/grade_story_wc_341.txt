<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority rooted in vocation and grief; her ledger entries and cloud-emotion taxonomy reveal a distinctive psyche. The contradiction “quietly explosive” is dramatized through restraint and charged attention rather than summary. Her final acceptance—memorializing “Altocumulus #112: release”—reads as an earned endurance choice with cost. Minor note: some labeled insights verge on explicative (“That emptiness is not void, but vessel”), but they’re grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: one continuous scene where observation and inscription tighten toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (gondola, telescope, profession), and backstory is anchored to present stimuli (the cloud, the ledger). Closure lands in the act of memorializing the dissolving cloud, reweighting the premise with a felt price. The structure is quiet but coherent, with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The gondola, fraying cables, and brass telescope create a tactile, atmospheric micro‑setting filtered through a meteorologist turned mourner. Sensory details (starlight dusting the wicker, breath fog on brass) are purposeful and character‑specific. The tool and perch charge the final image when she lowers the telescope and looks to the stars. While the setting pressures mood more than choice, it frames her options credibly in this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—tightens as Altocumulus #112 shifts and dissolves, forcing her toward an acceptance/memorialization choice. The meaningful deepening is the movement from “quietly explosive” to “release,” which narrows her stance rather than offering escape. Cost is emotional endurance and renunciation of the duet’s return, felt in the ledgered epitaph. Escalation is subtle but consistent with the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres through image and practice: absence as vessel, grief as weather legible only to the broken. Recurring objects (telescope, ledger, clouds-as-feelings) shift meaning at the end, inviting reflection without a neat moral. A few direct statements risk overtness (“emptiness is not void, but vessel”) but are substantiated by scene work. The afterimage—stars “dusty and eternal” over a catalogued release—lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close-third voice with a distinct perceptual signature (professional lexicon bent toward elegy). Rhythm varies and modulates with pressure; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. Diction stays within plausible range for this character and avoids expository crutches. Slight flirtation with purple is managed by consistent idiom and specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images do multiple jobs, and sentences carry momentum without scaffolding. Figurative density is high but coherent—clouds as affect, starlight as residue—avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal repetition earns resonance rather than redundancy (“quietly explosive” reprises with altered charge). A hair of abstraction creeps in at thesis statements, but it doesn’t dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—an aviation meteorologist in a sky gondola cataloguing clouds by emotion to prove memory in absences—feels fresh and particular. The brass telescope and ledger ground the conceit beyond ornament. The ending’s reweighting (release as proof) reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off.</comment>
