<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cohesive single-POV interiority with tactile choices (tracing the cipher, kneeling, breaking the seal) that reveal values. Motivation is clear and character-particular, anchored in the mentor bond and the “joy beneath anguish” quest. Internal conflict is present but gentle; contradictions never truly snag her, which softens cost. The closing renunciation of treasure for “truth” reads earned but low-risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: floors as cadence; light reveals cipher; vellum → diary; acceptance at the peak. Orientation is clean from the outset (elevator, spire, mission), and set-ups pay off (goggles, scattered light). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she descends with a reweighted aim, not coordinates. Cost is primarily emotional and subdued but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally integrated: frost, pressure seals, glacial bronze bell, and wind shape behavior and perception. The “scattered light” enables discovery and the goggles charge the final image, achieving purposeful micro‑setting use. World rules are consistent, embedded in action rather than expository overlay. Economy is strong with selective, character‑filtered detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (integration of grief), signaled early and coherently deepened at the cipher reveal and diary recovery. Escalation is textural rather than confrontational; the meaningful tightening is the discovery mechanism that reframes her search. The price—embracing acceptance over answers—is felt but not acute, keeping tension in a contemplative register. Ending agency (choosing “truth” over treasure) is earned but quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of grief-companionate joy recur via concrete images (goggles’ fractures, frostbloom, bell). However, explicit thematic statements (“Joy is not the absence of sorrow...”) edge into on-page moralizing, reducing subtext. The final repricing is resonant yet slightly over-signaled by quotations. Still, the piece invites reflection through image-led motifs more than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical textures, cold-weather tactility, gentle humor). Voice is stable and modulates well as pressure softens into acceptance at the peak. No head‑hopping or stance drift, and diction feels motivated by character and world. The lyric tone avoids vagueness even when ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with generally clean rhythm; metaphors (“lenses cracked like frozen rivers,” “glacial bronze”) are consistent and legible. A few lines risk purple excess, but coherence holds and there are no paraphrase loops that blunt momentum. Syntax varies and propels scene transitions (floors as breath marks). Ending image is crisp without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Airship relics, ice-spire elevator, and “soul coordinates” reframe discovery in a fresh, integrated way. The cipher-in-goggles turn feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is earned through particulars rather than a clever twist. Risks are taken in sustained lyricism, which pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
