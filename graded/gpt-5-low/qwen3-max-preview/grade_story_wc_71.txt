<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and motive—she tracks “the slow creep of the ordinary” and sanctifies thresholds—with embodied feeling (bare feet, palm to shard). Agency is evident in the ritual choice and how she reads the environment. Internal contradiction is minimal; she’s assured rather than conflicted, so pressure reveals priority more than fracture. The earned renunciation—leaving the shard to dissolve—registers as a quiet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: placement → hush → sensing houses → release of the cottage’s grip lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words (who, where, when, method). Closure cost is present but subtle—the dissolution by tide and her ongoing, chosen burden of noticing. The pattern is taught early and paid off cleanly at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV-filtered (reeds whispering, streetlights “daydreaming,” salt-kissed air). The bay and tide materially shape the ritual and the cost—the shard’s dissolution is both method and price, charging the final image. Sensory selection reflects aim: scent as architecture, orris’ violet/damp earth ghost-notes. Spatial logic stays coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are concentrated: honoring the memory architecture so a lingering house can unclench. The escalation is a tonal tightening—the hush, then the houses stirring, then the cottage’s release—rather than a reversal, fitting the chosen lens. The price (letting go; accepting a perpetual, self-assigned vocation) is felt but remains understated. A single decisive deepening lands; no antagonist is needed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—love as stewardship of place/time, memory made tactile through displaced objects—emerges through concrete ritual and sensory detail, not lecture. “Some houses feel alive because they are loved beyond their walls” risks statement, but it’s earned by the prior scene and serves as resonant crystallization. The final “walk beside the creep” reframes normalization as companionship rather than conquest. Subtext hums in the hush motif and the orris root’s scent-architecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is assured and singular: patient lyricism with controlled metaphors (“shard of hush,” “butter-yellow glow”). POV distance is steady; no leakage or gratuitous omniscience. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure—longer cadences soften into a concentrated close. Diction remains coherent to the sensibility of a “noticer” steeped in scent and thresholds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet disciplined; images multi-task without muddle. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing; syntax varies to sustain momentum. A few metaphoric flourishes verge on purple, but they remain legible and purposeful. The prose earns its music, especially around the ritual and release.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: “scent as architecture,” sanctifying via displaced objects, and a practitioner of creeping normality create a fresh premise. The “shard of hush” is a memorable, functional conceit that shifts options on the page. Risks are aesthetic, not gimmicky, and they cohere to closure. The piece honors quiet stakes with unusual specificity.</comment>
