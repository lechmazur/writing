<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation and method are clear and consistent; she chooses listening over force and takes concrete actions (placing the wing, “cradling” the plea). Interiority is textured through sensory attunement rather than labels. However, conflict within her is minimal—she meets pressure with near-perfect serenity—so the change reads as affirmation more than struggle. The cost is mostly ongoing commitment, felt but soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ritual builds to a reconfiguration where doom becomes a plea and the wing ascends. Orientation is clean from the opening image; pattern is taught and paid off. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise—she commits to returning, reweighting the premise. The cost is quiet and conceptual, not visceral, which slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The brook and nocturnal haven are vivid, sensorial, and integral; cadence, water, and moonlight actively shape her tactic of “mapping silence.” The environment delivers the whisper and charges the final image (“The brook sighed in gratitude”). Detail remains filtered through her creed of flow. Rich without drifting into touristic cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure deepens when the prophecy speaks and reclassifies itself; she must choose to receive rather than suppress. The escalation is consistent with the accumulative lens, but the stakes remain mostly conceptual. There’s one meaningful tightening—recognizing the plea—and it resolves credibly through her agency. A clearer felt price would raise heat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: listening as guardianship, silence as language, and surrender as power. The origami wing’s transformation reweights prior images and answers the central question without a moral. One declarative line (“not meant to warn of doom, but to summon a guardian”) edges toward telling but is earned by scene work. The ending’s vow extends resonance beyond the frame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical voice with controlled cadence and a consistent perceptual signature (flow, hush, breath). Diction is elevated but coherent for this mystic POV; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well around key beats (“She did not flinch”; “She would return”). Occasional dense compounds (“terrestrially cosmic”) flirt with purple but remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax and multi-function images; most sentences carry more than one job. Some metaphor stacking and near-repetitions of “hush/silence” risk saturation but serve pattern rather than padding. No significant loops or scaffold; closure image is clean. Minor purple notes do not obscure sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Mapping silence,” a prophecy as a plea, and the origami wing as conduit feel fresh and specific. The piece commits to a non-combative, ritual-driven solution, which reads as confident rather than evasive. Risks in diction and conceptual frame pay off at the end. Slightly softer stakes keep it below the topmost band.</comment>
