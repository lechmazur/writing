<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear motive (escape metallic city-noise to “unlearn”) drives tactile choices: kneeling, placing the tile, interjecting via the mandala, and finally not drawing that night. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“lilac unease,” cool mist, vibrating tile) without therapy-speak. The change—reframing silence and her own making—is earned by on‑page choices and a visible cost (the tile’s fracture, relinquishing immediate output). Slight limitation: internal contradiction is present but soft; pressure rarely forces a painful trade-off beyond the tile’s sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early (emergent hush, listening) and held through a single scene that escalates from tracing to resonance to unification. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes potential, charged by the tile’s on‑page fracture. Causality is clean within the lyric frame—her interjection changes the pattern and thus the sound‑presence. Minor neatness in the final walk‑home shard keeps it just shy of truly exceptional stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto, mist, and damp sand are sensorially specific and functionally constraining; the space’s acoustics and “emergent hush” shape tactics and outcome. The whispering tile and sand operate as micro‑settings/tools that charge the final image. Environmental rules stay consistent and are learned via action (tile hum → sand rearrangement → tonal presence). The setting actively guides choice and closure rather than decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (recover a way to hold meaning) but they tighten: from listening to placing the tile to the critical “interjection” that unifies the whispers. The price is tangible (tile cracks; she foregoes making a mural) and the city/grotto contrast frames risk and need. Escalation is a density increase credible to the lens. Pressure never becomes harrowing, but it coheres and deepens decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of listening, shaping silence, and honoring mess arise organically through action, resonant motifs (tile, sand mandala), and the earned shift in stance. Subtext operates via image and cadence, especially the harmonized whispers and the final rain‑mandala echo. However, the last declarative line (“meaning isn’t found in the fixing…”) edges into overt moralizing, slightly reducing the afterglow. Despite that, the conceptual reweighting is strong and sincere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, coherent close third maintains a distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic textures, acoustic attention, and tactile verbs. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the lyric register fits the character’s artistic sensibility. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference reads as inference. A few elevated turns court purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: sentences do multiple jobs, images track logically, and figurative language is mostly precise. Momentum holds, with minimal redundancy and clean syntax; the read‑aloud rhythm varies well. Lush diction presses up against excess in a few places but never muddies the closure image. Proofreading and mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—whispering‑gallery shard activating a sand mandala in a mist grotto to reprice silence—is fresh and cohesive. Risks (lyric density, accumulative structure, synesthetic tone) pay off in a unified closure. The emotional truth (listening as creation) feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Distinctive choices avoid template solutions.</comment>
