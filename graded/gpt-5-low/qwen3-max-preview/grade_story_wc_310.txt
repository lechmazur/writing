<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motive (surrendering control to lots to “wavelength align with purpose”) evolves into agency without breaking her contradictions. Embodied interiority (molars, throat, bone, heat) grounds the lyric register. The renunciation of lots is earned by her practiced method and the triggered vision; cost = taking responsibility for the survivors. A hair soft on visible external consequence, but psychologically credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of chance‑driven listening → unbidden vision → chosen act; closure = Resonant Reconfiguration with a legible before/after. Orientation is clear from the ambered deck and coin routine; no causality breaks. Cost is conceptual but present (giving up her crutch to lead). Tight, one‑scene arc with a single meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The deck, amber light, cracked glass, and heat‑core below are vivid and POV‑filtered; the coin on glass and vantage over survivors charge the final image. Setting functions as micro‑stage and tool, not postcard. World rules (static bursts, contraction) are learned through action. Not purely constraining, but it materially frames the choice and closing gesture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to keep abdicating to chance or claim agency for the survivors. Escalation arrives when the static comes unbidden and she reframes the “backwards prophecies,” culminating in the coin toss as celebration, not decision. Price is subtle (accepting responsibility; relinquishing the protective ritual). A touch more external pressure could sharpen the trade‑off, but the internal test lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coin/echo/distill motifs cohere into a resonant answer: meaning is made, not awaited. Subtext operates through tactile listening and the coins as waypoints; the “companion, not a cage” turn is strong. However, explicit thesis lines (“You’re not waiting for meaning. You’re distilling it.” and “We’re the distillate…”) verge on thematic echo/moralizing, slightly dulling the implicit power. Still, the final image reweights prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a stable close third; diction and rhythm match the character’s contemplative attention. Purposeful cadences, recurring syntactic patterns, and image clusters are taught and maintained. Dialogue is minimal but lands with character‑specific certainty at the end. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with largely clean lines; sensory precision (“pressure in her temples,” “honeyed light,” “clattering onto the glass”) propels. Occasional near‑purple stacking (“stellar doubt,” “dying pulsar,” “universe remembering how to breathe”) skirts excess but stays coherent. Minimal redundancy, varied sentence rhythm, and crisp paragraphing. Final cadence is earned and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Backwards prophecy” via coin‑triggered static felt through the body is a fresh synthesis; the post‑contraction frame is specific and lived‑in. The reversal—coin toss as celebration, not fate—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric density and cosmological metaphor pay off without obscuring clarity. Memorable images and a singular stance elevate beyond template SF tropes.</comment>
