<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (stitching timelines for the passengers) drives every action, and professional detail grounds him. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he rarely wavers—so pressure doesn’t expose layered conflict. The “resiliently positive” trait reads persuasively through behavior rather than label. The closing Earned Stasis—choosing stewardship over celebration—feels earned but light on visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Structure is clean: vanishings → discovery of radio → pattern‑mapping → harmonic beacon → convergence. The accumulative lens holds; the braiding of signals, tides, and glyphs tightens toward an on‑page convergence that reconfigures the world. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (ongoing vigilance, acceptance of transience). Causality is intact with planted payoffs (hourglass, radio, grotto) activated at climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The spectral grotto, glowing radio, and empty hourglass are vivid and POV‑filtered, with tactile, sensory detail (ozone, phosphorescent pebbles, liquid starlight). Environment meaningfully shapes tactics (tuning to the grotto’s frequency; placing the hourglass atop the radio) and charges the final image. World rules are learned through use rather than exposition. Specificity sustains atmosphere without overdetailing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates via density: each disappearance tightens the braid until the convergence event. Agency is clear (he decodes patterns, calibrates beacons, and executes the harmonic merge). The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he trades permanence for stewardship—which slightly softens pressure. Even so, the cadence shift at the hourglass ignition is a meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Transience vs. permanence is embodied rather than sermonized; the hourglass and braided time recur and reweight at the end. A few aphoristic lines (“time doesn’t break—it braids”) risk overt statement but are earned by prior particulars. The final “permanent transience” stance resonates and invites reflection without closing ambiguity. Theme coheres with character choice and world logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically maritime with a distinct perceptual signature, consistent distance, and controlled elevation befitting a fable‑like lens. No dialogue, but interior access and diction remain stable and character‑bound. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure spikes (the chord, the tremble, the convergence). Occasional high‑register phrases stay coherent within the established style.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are economical for the mode, carrying multiple jobs (world, mood, action) with minimal scaffold. Some figurative density (“ozone and memory,” “liquid starlight”) skirts purple but remains legible and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or template cadence mar momentum. The final image is crisp and recharged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: nautical labor, spectral geology, and temporal braiding via tactile tools (radio, hourglass) feels singular. Turns arise from prior seeds, not late rule drops. The risk—running a high‑lyric register inside a causal arc—pays off, heightening the concept without obscuring clarity. The convergence image is memorable and non‑derivative.</comment>
