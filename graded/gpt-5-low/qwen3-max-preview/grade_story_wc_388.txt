<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and a competent, particular interiority (“trembled—not from fear, but from the thrill of near-discovery”). The micro-choices (pressing the diamond, committing to the coordinates) align with her worldview. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond sorrow. The endurance/mission pivot reads earned but low-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: orchard observation → letters’ reveal → diamond test → plaque discovery → renewed mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with the “curse” recast and the network revealed. Cost is conceptual (risk, sorrow, burden) more than embodied; still sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean early and never wobbles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard and dust storms are vivid and integrated; weather and radiation shape perception and the diamond’s test. The environment constrains and then alters options (the storm stutters; the air clears) and charges the final image. Detail selection is POV-driven (growth rings aligned with storm cycles). World rules are taught through action rather than exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (excavate truth; test whether the “curse” masks tech) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when she deploys the diamond. Pressure is largely environmental and conceptual; little active opposition limits felt cost. The plaque discovery deepens options rather than foreclosing many; the earned stance at the end still reads as a real commitment. Tension is steady but never bites hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Truth vs. engineered lies, scarcity as control, and “stillpoints” recur through image and action, not lectures. The diamond’s revaluation and the field journal maxim “Truth is not found. It is dug.” cohere without tipping into sermonizing. The ending’s commitment reframes the world with lingering implications. Slight directness in a few lines keeps it from the very top.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, confident single-POV voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. No dialogue, but internal cadence modulates with pressure (quieter at the stillpoint, brisker in the storm). Figurative texture feels character-bound rather than generic purple. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, theme, and action—without sludge. Metaphor density is high but coherent; images (“petals drifting like embers,” “diamond…beat like a second heart”) are clean and purposeful. Minimal repetition and no mechanical cadence loops; momentum holds. Copy and syntax are polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “stillpoint” crystal ecology twist feels fresh, and the debunker-as-archivist of truth provides a non-obvious human angle. The plaque-as-network expansion elegantly widens scope without gimmick. Not wholly unprecedented thematically, but the synthesis of orchard, radiation, and resonant tech reads singular. Risk is measured and coherent.</comment>
