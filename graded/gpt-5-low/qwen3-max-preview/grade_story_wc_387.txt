<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single‑POV interiority is textured and particular; the net‑mender’s values show through tactile choices (whistling to “test the air,” raising the whisk as totem). Motivation is consistent—honoring unseen labor—and her micro‑choices align. Change is subtle but earned: she crystallizes her purpose (“I see you”) and accepts anonymity as cost. Slight limitation: inner contradiction is gentle; pressure rarely forces a sharper trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: a night of listening stacks toward a charged poise closure. The ending functions as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she chooses endurance and witness with an implied cost of invisibility. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and motifs recur causally toward the final image. Slightly modest cost on the page keeps it below the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purpose‑driven: rain, slick stone, washed chalk, and harbor lanterns shape action and attention. The bamboo whisk and parapet environment charge the final image; sound behaves differently “after rain,” and the washed markings prompt a gratitude beat. Sensory filtering is profession‑specific (nets, knots, tides). Minor note: constraints are atmospheric more than tactical, but the object‑as‑setting meets the high‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but coherent: will she meaningfully witness the unseen, not merely admire it. Escalation comes via density—whistle to test air → widow’s name → shanty that synchronizes fireflies—culminating in the “I see you” renunciation of recognition. Cost is felt as chosen smallness, not dramatized threat. The lack of a sharper narrowing keeps pressure from cresting higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—honoring hidden labor—emerges through concrete acts (naming the widow to the wind, thanking erased chalk marks) and returns charged in the final whisper. Subtext rides images (net/weaving/fireflies) rather than sermonizing, though one or two explicit lines (“Her motivation was never fame…”) edge toward telling. The ending reweights prior images without moralizing. Resonance lingers through the conceptual repricing of audacity as quiet witness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature sustains control; diction fits the character’s craft and contemplative bent. Rhythm modulates with calm intensification; no head‑hopping or stance leakage. Patterned elisions (moon paths, whispered names) are taught and paid off. Minor repetition (“demure audacity,” “scintillatingly somber”) is intentional and largely earned by reprise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery; syntax varies and momentum holds. A few phrases flirt with purple or echo (reusing “scintillatingly somber”) but do not blur sense or closure. No scaffold loops or cluttered choreography. The final image lands cleanly and reloads earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—net‑mending as metaphysic, whistle as work‑song for the unseen, whisk as totem—is fresh and coherent. Fireflies aligning with a handmade shanty feels earned rather than cute. Risk lies in the fully quiet stakes; it commits without hedging. Not revolutionary, but memorably singular in texture and moral calculus.</comment>
