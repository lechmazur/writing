<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s meticulousness and integrity are dramatized through concrete habits (field journal, barometer, cache) and a live moral pivot (refusing to report, choosing lateral investigation). The solitude vs. action contradiction lands cleanly (“Solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it”). Emotions are embodied via sensory attention (damp earth, wind bell) rather than labels. Minor note: the internal risk calculus could show one sharper pang of cost beyond implied danger.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: followed → courtyard find → message content → tactical decision → departure to rail yard. The closure is a Charged Poise: he chooses clandestine action with institutional cost implied by “would not report this.” Orientation is crisp from the first lines; lens coherence (situational pressure forcing stance) holds. Slightly modest on-page cost at the end keeps it below the very top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the courtyard’s wisteria, wind bell, and loose brick cache supply mood and tools, while dusk modulates perception. Professional gaze filters details (barometric drift, wind), lending specificity. The object-as-setting (message tube) and gear (monocular) charge the final image. A subtle environmental constraint (surveillance grids, side streets) informs route choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. institutional erasure) is clear and tightens with the unexpected Bureau tube and “They’re rewriting the maps.” The turn is his refusal of official channels, narrowing options toward riskier covert action. Escalation is measured rather than sharp; no on-page confrontation, but pressure coheres. A more explicit immediate cost or blocked option would raise stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of integrity, truth versus sanctioned falsity, and cartographic power (“rewriting the maps”) emerge through objects and choices, not thesis lines. “Covenant” and “order imposed on chaos” reweight the final decision without moralizing. The solitude-to-movement reframing earns resonance. Ambiguity (Marta’s fate, watchers) lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, precise third-person voice with a professional’s perceptual signature (pressure gradients, wind vectors) sustains mood and clarity. Rhythm modulates well between observation and decision. No head-hopping or register drift despite occasional elevated diction; it reads voice-motivated. Compression is confident and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are clean, varied, and purposeful; images often do multiple jobs (tube as object, setting, and covenant). Minimal scaffolding or loops; lyric touches are restrained and coherent. Technical terms are apt and accurate in context. One or two elevated phrases flirt with abstraction but don’t slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Meteorological integrity, cartography-as-power, and pigeons as covert channels yield a fresh synthesis. “Quarantine zones rewriting maps” feels distinctive and thematically integrated. The lateral-progress method and cache tools personalize genre tropes. Risk-taking is measured and coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
