<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Arlen’s motivation—creating a living monument to interspecies respect before he dies—is clear and consistently embodied in action. The “gently systematic” untangling of the fledgling and the ritual of tying up the diary reveal priorities under pressure. Internal contradiction is minimal; he’s serenely resolved, so the arc leans toward Earned Stasis rather than a change. Secondary characters (villagers) apply light, supportive pressure rather than testing him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The accumulative structure coheres: copper work → sparrow rescue → community uptake → final tying of the diary → death → legacy. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with on‑page cost (his death) and a clear before/after (personal craft becomes communal folklore). Orientation is clean early, and cause/effect holds within a lyric frame. The clock (“final month”) informs cadence without forcing contrived turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard with living stone pillars is vividly rendered and functionally constraining; his methods depend on the environment’s properties. Copper coils, hollows, and the Whisper Arch shape choices and charge the final image (burial beneath the arch; diary weathering). Sensory selection feels POV‑true to a caretaker, integrating botanical and animal detail. The setting is inseparable from theme and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern: guiding growth, rescuing the fledgling, climbing the completed Spiral Stair, and surrendering the diary. The dominant stake tightens toward legacy with a visible price—mortality accepted and enacted in the final acts. Escalation is quiet rather than adversarial; the sparrow beat provides the clearest micro‑test of his ethos. Costs are felt but not contested by strong counterforce, keeping the ceiling just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of grown architecture vs. imposed dominance and belonging “in the design” emerge through concrete acts and images. The single explicit statement about respect risks didacticism but comes mid‑piece and is earned by scene work. The ending reweights the premise: the orchard absorbs his life and turns intention into communal practice. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct attentional bias (botanical/animal). Diction and rhythm modulate with calm, never slipping into expository scaffolding or head‑hopping. The magical‑real tone around copper “conducting intention” feels voice‑true rather than explanatory. Control is high throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—worldbuilding, character, theme—with clean rhythm and minimal redundancy. Figurative language is fresh and coherent; no mixed metaphors or purple excess dulls clarity. Pacing breathes where it should and compresses summary efficiently. The final lines land with precision and without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Copper‑guided arboritecture as ethical architecture is an original synthesis, and the caretaker’s brazen serenity reframes legacy narratives. The sparrow rescue as a micro‑proof of ethos is elegant and specific. The folkloric afterlife of his work avoids cliché by staying grounded in material practice. Risk‑taking heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
