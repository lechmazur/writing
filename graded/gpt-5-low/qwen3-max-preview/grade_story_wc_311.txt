<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied: he seeks to transmute grief by naming and crystallizing fears. Interiority is concrete (cloak whispering like regret, echoes clinging to ribs) and choices align with pressure. The refusal to stop “her” haunts the ritual, giving the final renunciation/acceptance weight. Slight neatness in the stated purpose softens ambiguity but doesn’t undercut the earned shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: present‑tense ritual deepens until closure, where the atlas pulses and his stance reconfigures from heartbroken to heart‑carrier. Orientation is clean from the first lines and each beat compounds toward the prism‑lit act. Cost is legible in tears and the acceptance of stewardship. Quiet but definite RR; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, cracked dome, and remnant prism aren’t just backdrop; they furnish the method and charge the ending image. Dusk light and fractured glass constrain timing and enable the crystallization. Object‑as‑setting (atlas, prism) integrates seamlessly with action. Atmosphere deepens character affect without cliche.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal—transform fear by naming—and escalate through the ritual: unfolding the atlas, invoking light, naming, crystal blooming. Pressure tightens as each monster is redefined from terror to witness, culminating in a felt price (tears, stewardship). The arc lacks a sharp reversal, but the cadence shift is sufficient for the accumulative design. The choice to accept a new purpose forecloses solitary mourning.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—naming as a humanizing counter to faceless fear—emerges from particulars (Elan/Virel/Mira) rather than lecture. The final image reweights earlier material, reframing grief as communal bearing. One explicit line (“That was his purpose now”) edges toward tell, but most resonance is image‑driven. Subtext around complicity in sacrifice complicates the comfort.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, measured lyric voice with consistent distance suits a reaper’s centuries‑long perspective. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from hush to charged invocation) without head‑hopping or register slips. Brief whispers and murmurs integrate naturally. Elevated tone feels earned by the character and scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (image, action, emotion) with strong cadence and clarity. Minor repetition of “echo” and occasional lushness flirt with purple, but pattern and payoff justify density. No scaffold or template loops; punctuation and sequence remain clean. The closure image lands crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—reaper as archivist of fear, memory crystallized via prism and dusk—feels fresh and integral. The sea‑monster re‑naming is a non‑obvious turn that reconfigures terror into witness. Risks in lyric density and mythic register pay off without obscuring coherence. Emotional truth grounds the conceit.</comment>
