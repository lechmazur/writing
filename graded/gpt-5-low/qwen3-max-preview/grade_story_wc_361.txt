<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and a credible tug between duty (the dawn delivery) and her compulsion to cultivate wonder. Micro‑choices—taking the Hollow Market fork, revealing the pendant, and ultimately releasing it—track cleanly to her value hierarchy. Embodied emotion (boots singing frost; pendant thrumming her sternum) avoids generic labels. Minor hedge: the mentor’s aphorism edges toward tidy wisdom but is earned by the spiderweb memory.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: auroral cues → fork choice → market hush → renunciation. Closure lands on‑page with cost as she lets the pendant go—foreclosing her secret method. Orientation is clean early; causal threads (pendant resonance guiding choices) remain coherent. The ending’s CR/RR reweights the pact from private routine to public myth without hand‑waving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The aurora‑lit ridgeway and Hollow Market are vivid and purposeful: the fork pressures choice and the auroras generate glyphs that guide action. The pendant functions as micro‑setting/tool, charging the final image as it dissolves into aurora. Details stay POV‑filtered (“lanterns flickered like dragonfly wings,” “moth‑wing silk”). World rules are learned in action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—duty vs. wonder—tightens through the fork and hush scene to the costly release. The market beat credibly escalates pressure as attention concentrates (lanterns sway, wind pauses), making the renunciation feel necessary. Stakes remain intimate but felt; no false antagonist or convenience resolution. Slight softness: the delivery deadline doesn’t materially bite once she reaches the Market.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres—wonder as practiced attention, seeded for others—and is enacted through choice, not just stated. The final image reweights routine into myth credibly. A few lines risk overt moralizing (“That was the pact,” “wonder isn’t inherited, it’s cultivated”) that flatten subtext. Still, the resonance largely arises from particulars (child’s vision; pendant’s return).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but precise, carrying subtext (“It remembers.” / “Everything does…”). No head‑hopping or stance wobble; inference stays within the courier’s ken. Elevated language is voice‑true rather than authorial gloss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images do double duty (frost “sang,” lanterns “harmonic reply”). Figurative texture is consistent and legible without muddle; cadence varies well. Minor purple edges (“sky’s memory,” “fertile as spring soil”) are supported by pattern and do not obscure action. No looped scaffolding or mechanical stems.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a courier who seeds wonder via sympathetic resonance, a market trading in half‑remembered tales, and a pendant forged from First Bloom. The final release reframes power as communal rather than proprietary without cliché. Specificities (last breath of a drowned oracle; aurora glyphs) feel singular, not ornamental. Risk‑taking in a quiet, lyric mode heightens stakes without losing clarity.</comment>
