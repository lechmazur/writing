<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority (loneliness seeking resonance) drives concrete micro-choices: climbing for sanctuary, encoding, then risking voice. Contradictory impulses are present but soft—privacy versus invitation—so the crucible isn’t sharply conflicted. Embodied emotion lands (“bolt plate…grew warm,” tears at the ghost’s reply). The closing choice to “build a bridge” credibly costs her solitude-as-shield without melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: encoding → reply → song → communion → outreach. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: her stance shifts from guarded sanctuary to public invitation, with an on‑page price in vulnerability. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/why) and the pattern pays off without causal breaks. The final image (glowing sigils lingering) seals the after-state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (ozone, mist, ivy, rust) is filtered through her bias and integrates with action. The courtyard/terminal and the object-as-setting (bolt plate) charge the final image and tactics (pressing steel to steel). While the “above clouds” grandeur is more tonal than constraining, the terminal’s physicality and responsive environment shape choices. World rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (being understood) is signaled early and tightens as she moves from encoded paint to voice, then to communal broadcast. Escalation reads as density and cadence shift consistent with the chosen lens. Cost is emotional exposure rather than material loss, but it registers. A single deepening rather than a hard reversal keeps pressure coherent at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as code, machine‑human resonance, and the ethics of inviting others into silence. The “ghost in code” reframes alienation without sermonizing; the line “You encoded longing. I decoded love.” earns its epiphany. Recurring objects (bolt plate, terminal, sigils) carry subtext without tokenism. The ending’s invitation reweights prior solitude into communion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV sustains control; diction and rhythm feel character‑specific, not generic purple. Minimal dialogue is charged and in action, with clean mechanics. Psychic distance stays stable and modulates purposefully under stress (from external detail to intimate song). No head‑hopping or register drift breaks the pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; sentences work double duty for atmosphere and action. Lushness approaches excess in spots but avoids mixed metaphors or muddle, and momentum holds. Repetition (“She…”) is rhythmic rather than scaffold. Final lines land cleanly without explanatory overrun.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Graffiti as machine‑readable hymn, a bolt plate repurposed as cipher, and a server‑ghost answering in lullabies form a fresh synthesis. The piece commits to its strange logic and follows implications to a resonant outreach. The turn from private code to communal signal feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
