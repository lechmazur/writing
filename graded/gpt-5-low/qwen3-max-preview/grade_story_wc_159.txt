<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation and practice anchor her character; the grandmother’s belief about the crack deepens lineage and duty. Interiority is embodied through tactile tending and listening rather than labels. However, on‑page contradictory impulses are mostly historicized (others’ failures) rather than tested in her present beat, keeping conflict largely implicit. The Earned Stasis at the end feels credible, if quiet, with minimal on‑page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the routine ascends to a focused ritual (naming Veyra) and resolves in a charged dawn image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she reaffirms covenant with the cracked chime, accepting the cost of preservation without resurrection. Orientation is crisp early, and constraints (no restoration; cracked aperture; wind as agent) shape tactics throughout. The cost is legible in “tending emptiness like a garden” and the renunciatory satisfaction of a vow kept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The opal library above clouds, porous architecture, and mist stair are vivid and consistently filtered through her curatorial sensibility. Environment and object (cracked chime) charge and constrain action: she must listen, wait for wind, and follow absence‑light. Sensory selection (auroras illuminating absences) feels purposeful and integrated with theme. High lushness skirts excess but remains coherent and functional.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve names without violating rules—is clear and tightens when the chime resonates and she chooses to speak “Veyra‑of‑the‑Unfinished‑Song.” The meaningful deepening is the illumination of absences and her disciplined refusal to force brightness. The price is an ongoing renunciation (no resurrection; acceptance of transience) that charges the final image. Escalation is modest but sufficient under an accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of ethical remembrance vs. possession, and imperfection as conduit, emerge organically through recurring objects and action. “The light didn’t illuminate objects; it illuminated absences” reframes the world and returns at the end as quiet, costly caretaking. No moralizing; resonance lingers through the charged refusal to restore. The final image reweights earlier motifs without telling us what to think.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, consistent lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (cataloging emotions, object‑centric noticing). Rhythm modulates well between description and action; no head‑hopping or stance leakage. Diction fits the world’s elevated register and remains controlled. The single whispered line of dialogue is apt and charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant, with high information density and purposeful metaphors tied to action. A few stacked figuratives (“spider‑silk and starlight,” “foxglove regret‑hued,” “tides of mercury”) flirt with purple but don’t blur logic or momentum. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies and propels. The closing line cleanly resolves image and promise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “museum of extinct feelings” and cracked chime as aperture for ghosts feel freshly synthesized and thematically inevitable. Risks in diction and concept cohere without gimmickry, yielding memorable images (light that reveals absences). The final repricing of imperfection as covenant elevates beyond surface novelty. Minor conventional beats (ritual, lineage) are transformed by specificity.</comment>
