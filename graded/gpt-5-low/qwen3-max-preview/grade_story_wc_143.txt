<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is crisp and embodied: she chooses to climb, kneel, photograph, wait, and label. The vigil reframes her initial goal from documentation to communion, an earned renunciation. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—duty versus elegy—skewing more toward serene acceptance than friction. A slightly deeper on‑page cost beyond elegiac ache could heighten the change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative drive tightens around the 05:00 clock and the dawn thermal spike; closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is immediate; cause/effect holds from the chemical design to the final grain. The cost is conceptual and felt: she witnesses a message no one can receive, then labels and departs. A minimal on‑page reversal keeps it just shy of the very top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lunar summit, vacuum, and dawn timing shape tactics and the final image; tools and environmental constraints matter. Details (regolith crunch, frost on glass, pressure threshold) are selective and POV‑filtered. The hourglass as object‑setting charges closure. Occasional explanatory density slightly dilutes pure atmospheric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate on bearing witness before 05:00; the countdown provides the single meaningful tightening. The price is the acceptance of futility and the choice to keep vigil anyway. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A sharper mid‑scene test of commitment would lift pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of obsolescence, persistence, and the ethics of witnessing emerge through action and image (the label; “message unreceived”). The chemical hourglass refracts commemoration vs. utility without neat moralizing. A few explicit lines (“Some things aren’t meant to be seen…”) flirt with telling but remain earned by the scene. The final whisper “You outlasted them all” elegantly reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is precise, lyrical, and character‑bound, blending technical diction with elegiac cadence. POV control is steady; no leakage or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates effectively around the countdown and the hush. Slight expository swell around the chemistry reads intentional but edges toward essayish register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; images carry multiple jobs; very little scaffold or loop. Figurative language is clean and integrated with physical logic. A few lines lean declarative or redundant, but momentum holds and the closure image is sharp. Diction remains mostly tight without purple saturation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Nightwatch Hourglass—chemistry as timekeeping elegy—feels fresh and inevitable in this setting. The vigil as closure avoids gimmickry and lets concept and emotion fuse. The SF elegy frame is familiar, but specific mechanics and the ionosphere‑tuned farewell distinguish it. Risk is controlled and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
