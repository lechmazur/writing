<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—salvage through reorganization—drives concrete choices, and her dual allegiance registers as a live tension throughout. Interiority is specific (mapping chaos, aligning glyphs with moon phases) and embodied via the foundation chip’s warmth. Her choice to paint the city-spanning mural rather than confront City Hall reads as an earned renunciation. Cost is present but mostly conceptual (postponement, not victory), keeping this shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: small reorganizing acts accrete toward the final mural and communal mobilization. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a coherent before/after (private takeover vs communal re-claiming). The “final contract due” beat tightens the pattern into a decisive act. Cost is legible but modestly scaled (privatization stalls, not ends), just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft carnival is vividly rendered and actively shapes tactics (stall alignment to wind, arrows to kitchens, a mural visible from every pier). Environmental logic constrains options and charges the final image. Sensory specificity (salt, neon, fried dough in monsoon rain) is filtered through Lira’s priorities. World rules are consistent and integrated through action, not expository dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (communal ownership vs privatization) and pressure coheres toward the contract deadline. The escalation hinges on Lira’s method intensifying—private signals to a city-spanning mural that mobilizes hundreds. Consequence is real yet partial, landing as endurance rather than victory. A sharper on-page price paid by Lira personally would raise the ceiling.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: salvage over sabotage, memory as infrastructure, and community choreography as resistance. Recurring images (foundation chip, ferris wheel → logo, phoenix from kernels) reweight the ending without moralizing. A single declarative line (“She doesn’t hate the developers; she pities their blindness.”) edges toward thesis but remains character-specific. The final banner “THIS FLOATS TOGETHER” coheres with the piece’s conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive—lyric but precise, with a consistent, close third tied to Lira’s perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates well between list-like patterning and charged images. No head-hopping or stance drift; compression feels intentional and legible. Diction remains within character plausibility while allowing heightened texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is taut, with high information density and purposeful imagery. Figurative language is frequent but controlled, rarely tipping into muddle. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing sustain momentum. A few stacked metaphors flirt with excess, but they do not blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival and “reorganization via coded graffiti” synthesis feels fresh and specific. The final communal repainting reframes resistance without default confrontational tropes. Gentrification as topic is familiar, but the operational ingenuity and tactile world make it feel singular. Risks serve coherence and pay off at closure.</comment>
