<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is specific and sustained (seeking a “shard of hush” and “the beginning in every ending”), and her choices—tuning, discarding assumptions, conducting—align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile tech (copper‑threaded gloves, teeth tingling) and a credible professional mindset. The internal contradiction (chasing loud answers vs. listening for silence) is present but subtle, yielding a quieter tension than a true crucible. The renunciation of glory for function lands, though cost remains conceptual rather than acutely felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clean: the moon’s perigee, the placed fragment, the hush‑pulse, and the city awakening stair-step toward a Conceptual Repricing. Closure is on the page: towers reconfigured as instruments and the protagonist as conductor, with a charged final broadcast image. Causality is lyric but coherent; no teleporting props or rule breaks. The cost is mostly conceptual (a reoriented pursuit and self‑effacement), which slightly tempers impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city is vividly tactile and functionally integral: gantries, capacitors, antennae directly shape options and the finale. Details are POV‑filtered (engineer‑sensory priorities) and evolve causally as the city “breathes.” Time, weather, and altitude pressure the scene and tone. Description serves momentum rather than pausing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake: unlocking silence at perigee. Escalation accrues via density: perigee’s arrival, the fragment’s activation, the hush’s cut, and the city’s reanimation, driven by her tuning choice. The tightening is meaningful (silence over noise), though the price paid is more philosophical than lived. Lack of a sharper sacrifice caps intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme integrates with action: failures teach a new method (listening to negative space), and the ending reweights endings as beginnings. The Hollywood fragment-as-mirror is a potent thematic engine linking artifice and eternity. However, explicit thesis statements (“every ending contains the seed…,” “fantasy practicality”) edge toward on-the-nose. The resonance endures despite a touch of authorial clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent technical lexicon matches the character’s vocation and the piece’s aims. Rhythm modulates well—shortened lines for pulses, longer for atmosphere—without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off. Diction stays coherent with no register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is dense yet purposeful; images often do double duty (mechanism and awe). Minor purple glints (“carved silence like a blade”) are supported by the established texture and do not impede clarity. No scaffold loops or cadence templates drag momentum. The final image is crisp and recharged by recurring objects.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a Hollywood star prop as cosmic resonator, silence as an operative medium, and “fantasy practicality” as ethos. The move from ruins to orchestra feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in conceit and diction pays off without obscuring closure. Slight thematic telliness is the only brake.</comment>
