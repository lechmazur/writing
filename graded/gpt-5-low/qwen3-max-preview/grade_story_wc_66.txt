<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (“teach dust to tell stories”) and embodied craft choices anchor her. Agency sharpens at the tear‑trigger reveal and the final decision to broadcast. Internal contradiction is present but light (discipline vs. vulnerability); a deeper on‑page struggle would lift it further. The scribing, calibration, and midnight ritual reveal character through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a clean Decisive Change: receiver-to-transmitter. The escalation chain is tight—hotter dial → self‑naming lyric → tears as activation → she composes and cloaks her own broadcast. Cost is legible (emotional mourning, singed thumb, outlaw risk). The pattern is taught early and paid off in the charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, hearthstone, and heat‑only dial are vivid and purpose‑driven; the environment constrains timing (after midnight), detection (by warmth), and stealth (cloth, birdcall frequencies). Embers and dust literally respond, charging the climactic image. Details are POV‑filtered through a copyist’s tactile, musical sensibility. World rules stay consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving story against famine—tightens via a pattern break when the broadcast names her and demands mourning. The felt price (tears as catalyst) forces a new tactic and forecloses mere preservation; she risks exposure by transmitting. Pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial, but it coheres and deepens credibly. A clearer external counterforce could have heightened cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-music and mourning-as-activation emerges through concrete images (dust remembering, clocks weeping rust, embers conducting). The network of silent scribes reframes art as resistance without moralizing. The final broadcast reweights the premise: grief is the key that turns preservation into communal resurrection. Resonance lingers without tidy thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (craft lexicon, sonic metaphors). Rhythm modulates with pressure—calm precision early, intensified cadence at the hot‑dial beat, a quieted poise at the end. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elision patterns are taught and legible. Slight risk of rhapsodic saturation keeps it just under 9+.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is abundant but coherent within the established motif set (dust/ember/mist/music/radio). No meaningful loops or muddle in peak beats; the heat‑only glow and dissolving lyrics are crisp. A few stacked metaphors approach luxuriance but don’t blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a heat‑coded radio, outlaw lyrics that resurrect communal memory, a copyist weaponizing mourning. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the taught rules (glow by warmth, dissolving lyrics, midnight ritual). Bold but controlled risks (networked scribes, birdcall cloaking) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The vision reads singular and fully committed.</comment>
