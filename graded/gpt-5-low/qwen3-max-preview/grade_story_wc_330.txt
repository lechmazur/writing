<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>His motive—to interpret silence as possibility—drives clear, aligned actions, and his occupational specificity grounds him. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he meets no resisting force beyond endurance. Micro‑choices (placing the halo, choosing to “sing” through craft) reveal values credibly. The closing renunciation (he will never speak) feels earned but low‑cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → awakening → completion, with a clean RR/Earned Stasis at the end. Orientation is swift and sustained (carpenter, mist, train), and payoffs honor early seeds (halo, wind bells). On‑page cost is mostly stamina/time rather than a narrowing dilemma, but the closure lands. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train and mist are vividly embodied and filtered through the artisan’s sensibility. Environment and object recur to charge the final image (halo on the pole, wind bells, constellations overhead). The setting supplies resources (half‑built carousel) that direct tactics and outcome. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, especially in the engine‑car “cathedral of whimsy.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates texturally: the carousel stirs, then lives, culminating in a turning crown. Stakes are aesthetic/spiritual rather than oppositional; the piece deepens rather than narrows options. The visible price is labor and devotion, not a hard trade‑off. Still, the final stance crystallizes coherently under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Silence as native truth and craft as liturgy interweave without needing dialogue, and the halo reframes labor as sacrament. Thematic lines occasionally verge on overt moral (“beauty left incomplete is a wound in the world”), slightly blunting subtext. Nonetheless, the ending reweights prior images into sanctuary and salvation with earned resonance. The counter‑reading—silence as agency rather than lack—lingers convincingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, confident lyric voice with consistent distance and clean focalization; no head‑hopping. Rhythmic control suits the piece’s hush, and patterned diction is taught early and sustained. A few lush stretches flirt with excess but remain legible and voice‑true. The nonverbal “singing” reads as voice in action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and image precision; sentence rhythm varies to match pressure. Figurative language is frequent but coherent, with minimal redundancy and few mixed metaphors. Occasional intensifiers and ornate strings approach purple yet do not obscure sense. The final note’s image is crisp and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—silent craft as song, halo fragment as animating reliquary, circus‑train cathedral—is fresh and internally coherent. Risks in tone and motif consistency pay off without gimmickry. While it nods toward familiar magical‑realist textures, the specific constellation of elements feels singular. Closure grows inevitably from seeds rather than late rule changes.</comment>
