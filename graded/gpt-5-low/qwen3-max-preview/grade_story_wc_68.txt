<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal and embodied—he chooses descent, refuses “reintegration,” catalogs artifacts, and enacts Earned Stasis with visible cost (isolation, squalor). Interiority is particular (“abrasive calm,” tile‑crack pacing, counter‑arguments) and consistent with methods-first thinking. Micro-choices around the cog, spitting at Council slogans, and climbing the bell tower reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The endurance resolution feels earned rather than epiphanic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: layered discoveries, Council pressure, and the bell‑tower act culminate in a Charged Poise/CR ending (sundial shadows moving underwater). Orientation is early and clean; the piece coheres as one window with a patterned mosaic. Cost is legible on the page (refused reintegration, chosen exile) and the final image reweights the central stake (depth vs height). The water’s slight shift is an apt, quiet cadence change rather than a plot solve.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional—the sewer as “inverted archive,” submerged mosaics, aqueduct, bell tower, and underwater sundial constrain choices and charge the ending. Sensory specificity is filtered through his methodical gaze (decay rates, sediments, mold patterns as evidence). World rules are consistent (post‑plague Reconstruction) and pressure the tactics. The final image depends on place mechanics (light and water on the sundial).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (memory vs erasure) is clear and tightens via the Council’s approaches, his refusals, and the climb to attempt a measured “signal.” Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; the bell‑tower scene is the peak attempt with cost implied. Resolution is an endurance stance that forecloses reintegration. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than visceral, slightly limiting pressure intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (progress vs memory) arises from particulars—cog, sewer ledgers, submerged sundial—rather than pure statement. The Council’s slogans flirt with didacticism, but the piece counters through image-led rebuttals and method-as-ethic. The final underwater shadow movement offers a resonant, non-literal answer about time and endurance. Subtext runs in the “geological” rebellion and the depth/height polarity without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person close with a distinct, flinty lyric register; syntax and diction mirror his methodical, abrasive calm. Sparse dialogue is purposeful and subtextual (“quarters and deadlines” vs “erosion, pressure, stone”). Distance control is steady; no leakage or head-hopping. Rhythmic modulation at the bell‑tower and closing cadence is confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry density without sludge; images do double duty (mold as narrative map, sundial as time ethic). Repetition patterns (“abrasive calm,” sediment) feel intentional rather than looped. Figurative language is controlled; no mixed metaphors or register drift. Minor slogan explicitness is the only tonal risk and doesn’t blunt the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Inverted archive” post‑plague conservator with a cog as methodology is a fresh synthesis; depth‑against‑height reframes the genre aftermath. Risks—quiet accumulative structure, geologic rebellion—pay off clearly. Turns feel inevitable from seeded particulars (layers, instruments of order). The vision reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
