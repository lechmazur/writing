<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and specific: she hunts ghosts, lies strategically, and chooses to trigger a resonance restore at 07:07. Interiority is textured (“silence in the archive screamed louder than alerts”) and her self‑deception is dramatized (“She even lied to herself”). Actions align with motives and reveal cost (risking job/sanity, refusing to report). Slightly summary‑driven at times, but emotion remains embodied via objects and environment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative drive is clean: recurring 0707 leads to a timed ritual in the deepest vault and a charged final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she becomes their anchor and redefines “deletion.” Cost is legible in the refusal to document/report and the implied personal risk. Orientation is clear early; causality is consistent within the story’s rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is integral: server racks, frosted glass, decommissioned AI cores shape tactics and the climax’s location. The patch functions as micro‑setting/charged object that constrains the final gesture (the silhouette reaches for it). Sensory selection reflects her professional bias and the tonal hum of absence. World rules (data absorbed into substrate) stay internally consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around recovering the de‑referenced crew and the moral risk of breaking protocol. Pressure escalates via the 0707 pattern, the janitor link, and the timed mass restore, narrowing options to a single ritualized action. The earned stasis—choosing silence and ongoing vigilance—carries felt cost. No overt antagonist, yet the corporate/technical pressure is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of memory’s persistence and corporate erasure emerges through negative space and cadence (“the archive preserved not content, but cadence”). The final image reweights the premise: files “linger,” and she accepts the role of anchor—no moral stated, just implication. Recurring motifs (patch, 0707, hum, gaps) deepen without didacticism. The conceptual cost—that truth demands secrecy and endurance—resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular, lyrical POV with controlled rhythm and purposeful parallelism; the piece teaches its pattern early and pays it off. Diction suits the character’s technical/archival mind without drifting into sterile jargon. The one quoted line is sparing and effective; otherwise, voice carries action and subtext. Distance remains stable through peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Prose is taut, image‑rich, and propulsive; repetition is patterned and functional rather than padded. Lines do multiple jobs (world, motive, tension) with minimal scaffolding. No figurative muddle at the climax; the silhouettes and humming drives land cleanly. Syntax varies and supports momentum without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: social media archives as a resonance chamber where “deleted” becomes de‑referenced ghosts. The 0707 temporal coordinate and the patch as beacon feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks a conceptual ending and sticks the landing without expository crutches. The vision reads singular and fully inhabited.</comment>
