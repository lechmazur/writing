<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elira’s drive is clear (find the source of resilience) and she makes concrete, escalating choices: investigate the glint, take the arrow, commit it to the Grandmother tree. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, with competence grounded in her vocation. The emotional turn from fixing to listening lands, though internal contradiction is light and conflict mostly externalized to time/physics. The cost is modest but present in the renunciation of a fixer’s stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causality is clean: inversion enables search → discovery → test touch → urgency → insertion → world‑song. The piece runs an accumulative/textural lens with a clear closure unit (resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing) on the page. The live clock (“minutes”) tightens the final push, and set‑ups (bio‑harmonic echoes, dew‑spirals) pay off in the ending image. Cost is felt conceptually (a new duty to listen) more than materially but reads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The inverted‑gravity orchard and floating arches are vivid, tactile, and rule‑governed, shaping tactics (hovering, landing on what was ceiling, racing the inversion window). Sensory economy is strong—dew as compass, mist as “liquid memory,” bark that hums—and details are filtered through a pilot’s priorities. Environment and object converge to charge the final image (arrow fused to Grandmother’s bark, planet singing). World rules stay consistent through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovery) is signaled early and meaningfully tightened by the inversion window and the glint→vines eruption beat. Escalation is agency‑driven: she chooses to deepen risk by flying deeper and planting the arrow. The price is primarily conceptual (accepting a listening role) with modest immediate hazard; no antagonist, but pressure coheres under the clock. The final act reweights options for her future behavior.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (“resilience is remembering”) emerges from particulars: echoes, dew‑spirals, bio‑harmonics, and the arrow as seed/anchor. The last movement offers a revaluation of purpose from control to attunement and binds it to craft and setting. One explicit line (“Resilience wasn’t in the roots. It was in the remembering.”) edges toward statement, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance lingers in the planet’s song and her future ritual of return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“mist pooled like liquid memory,” “whirling silence”). Diction and rhythm modulate well as pressure rises, maintaining clarity. No dialogue, but the narrative cadence carries action and thought without head‑hopping. Lushness remains legible without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is rich yet controlled; imagery generally sharpens rather than blurs. Minor patterned anaphora (“It sang… It echoed…”) reads intentional and propulsive, not looped scaffold. No figurative muddle at the climax; syntax varies to pace urgency. A few intensifiers stack, but momentum holds and information density stays high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—an inversion‑hour orchard, dew‑navigation, and an arrow that seeds memory—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The echo‑anchor concept transforms familiar SF salvage into a listening ethic. Risks in worldbuilding and lyric texture heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Turns grow organically from established motifs.</comment>
