<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—he isn’t fixing time but preserving “wonder,” consistently embodied through tools (mirrors, prisms) and rituals. A quiet inner tension (fix vs. listen; fame vs. preservation) surfaces in lines like “not because he’d fixed anything, but because he’d remembered how to listen.” Interiority is sensorial rather than abstract, with tactile choices (sealing resin slabs, angling mirrors) revealing values. The lack of a sharper contradictory impulse under pressure keeps it from the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece builds via patterned discoveries (11:03 glyph, 3:17 pulses) to a resonant reconfiguration where the broken timer becomes a fulcrum. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/what). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he leaves without repairing, archive complete, cost paid in renunciation and years spent. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, but legible in the final leave-taking and the silent, curated display.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cavern and its light shaft constrain tactics and timing; the quartz veins, condensation, and marble throat are not mere decoration but the apparatus. Specifics (convex mirror, precise times, glyphs on stone) are POV-filtered and functional. Environment shapes every attempt and charges the final image of “wonder fermented” belowground. Sensory balance is strong, with visual and tactile cues anchored to method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure deepens through patterned revelations and one incisive intensification (the dusk tone cracking a stalactite), confirming stakes in preservation over repair. The dominant stake is coherent and narrows toward a choice to seal the archive and leave. Escalation is lyrical rather than adversarial, so the visible price is nuanced rather than visceral. Still, the cadence shift at thaw provides a clear tightening and earned end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—reason needing wonder, and attention to the periphery—is carried by concrete practice (angles, shards sorted by “emotional temperature”). The final reweighting (broken timer as fulcrum; the archive for “the thirsty”) answers the premise without mechanical moralizing. A few aphoristic lines (“wonder was a nutrient, not a luxury”) skate close to telling but are supported by enacted images. The resonance lingers via the charged last image rather than a declared thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, singular lyric voice with precise lexicon (“foxed leather,” “harvest of echoes”) and controlled rhythm. POV distance is steady; inference reads as inference, no head-hopping, no gratuitous elision. Modulation through moments of quiet awe and sharper beats (the shattering tone) is clean. Minor aphoristic slips don’t disrupt the established texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and efficient for this mode; sentences often do double duty (image + function). Occasional density risks purple but stays coherent and image-true; no significant loops or scaffolding. The final third maintains clarity while compressing meaning. Minor overwriting in a couple generalizations is the only notable friction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—locksmith of light reverse-engineering wonder via optics in a marble cavern—is distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. Tactics (mirror angles, timed reveals) merge craft and concept without gimmickry. The reconfiguration of a broken mechanism into a fulcrum is a fresh, earned turn. Risks in diction and structure pay off with clarity and resonance.</comment>
