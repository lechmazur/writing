<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (resonance over obedience), and micro‑choices under pressure appear in the patient thread‑work and the whispered “I remember you.” Internal contradiction is subtler—“chaste courtesan” hints at tension, but on‑page conflict mostly reads as serene competence, not contested impulse. Actions align with her ethos and culminate in Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a conceptual cost (defying the lullaby, choosing solitude as armor). A deeper embodiment of fear or doubt at the final knot could raise the charge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres; each untangled thread advances toward a clean closure when the last knot dissolves and the echoes release. Causality is rhythmic rather than plotty but holds: patience → partial releases → final recognition line triggers opening. The cost is conceptual and social more than visceral, yet legible through the Court and her chosen solitude. Orientation is clear early; the lens stays Accumulative/Textural through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (silver courtyard, snow that trembles to sound) is filtered through her breath and intent and charges the final image. The environment subtly shapes tactics (synchronizing breath with falling snow) and the object‑as‑setting (prism) anchors the scene’s pressure. World rules stay consistent and learned via action. Strong integration without tourist‑catalog breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (unlock the sanctuary, release echoes), with a meaningful tightening at the resistant final knot. Escalation is accumulative—each released sound raises texture until the thousand‑confession knot forces a different tactic (addressing silence). The price is endurance and defiance rather than harm; it lands but remains largely conceptual. A sharper felt consequence would heighten the stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (refusing conformity’s lullaby to restore silenced voices) emerges through action and image, not sermon. Recurring motifs—breath, threads, snow, echoes—reweight at the end when the vault becomes a voice and her echo is braided with others. The line “She wished to return the echoes…” edges toward statement, but the climax earns it. The closing image resonates beyond plot without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, assured lyric voice with controlled distance and purposeful rhythms; no head‑hopping and clean stance. Diction is coherent to the focalizer’s sensibility, with modulation at pressure points (“I remember you”). Compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off. Occasional elevated flourish risks excess, but overall control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; lines often do double duty (image and action). Figurative language is rich but mostly coherent, with a few baroque touches that skirt purple without tipping. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentence rhythms vary and propel. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “harvest of echoes” premise and thread‑unlocking method feel fresh and integrated, avoiding template fantasy beats. The “chaste courtesan” frame risks archetype but is reframed through poetry-as-body and resonance as motive. The final reconfiguration (vault → voice) feels inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is thematic and imagistic rather than structural, but it lands.</comment>
