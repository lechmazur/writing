<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The queen’s motives (answering the dream’s “invitation”) and flaw set (“power over pulse”) are dramatized through concrete choices—climbing barefoot, entering, then accepting renunciation. Interiority is embodied and specific (“linen that whispered… like regret,” tears forming constellations). The encounter with the hooded figure reveals credible contradiction—seeking truth while owning culpability. A minor softness: the figure articulates her flaw somewhat declaratively, trimming ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene tightens cleanly from ascent to revelation to renunciation, landing a resonant reconfiguration closure (descend “not as queen. As witness.”). The accumulative/textural lens holds via recurring starlight/firefly motifs that reweight meaning at the end. The cost is legible on the page (forfeiture of identity/status and acceptance of grief). Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The environment actively shapes choice and image—trail danger, air thinning, fireflies as guides, the grotto’s bleeding sky charging the final transformation. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven (ozone, warm stone, steam), integrated through action. World rules are learned by observation (starlight as memory) rather than exposition. The final return image (fireflies as living lace) is environment-charged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will she face the truth her dreams demand—escalates through the climb, the bleeding sky, memory-pool, and the figure’s challenge. The decisive turn is her acceptance of renunciation and the charged descent. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and steadily tightening under the accumulative lens. Slightly low external resistance keeps it just short of elite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of memory, grief, and the costs of rulership emerge through concrete images (tears birthing constellations, the Edict of Silence, the firstborn’s release). Subtext operates in the ritualized revelation and the chosen humility at the end. A few lines risk moralizing (“You chose power over pulse,” “The grotto doesn’t punish. It reveals.”), trimming the afterglow of implication. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs without a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person close maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm suit the queen’s sensibility; dialogue is minimal yet weighted and subtextual. No head-hopping or stance slippage; compression patterns remain legible. The elevated register is consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied cadence and strong verbs; images often do dual duty (world + emotion). Figurative language is lush but coherent and disciplined; no major metaphor collisions or loops. A few stacked flourishes push toward purple, yet momentum holds and clarity remains. Open/closing lines land with image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight as memory-leak, fireflies keyed to breath, and the queen’s anti-coronation (descending as witness) feel fresh and integrated. The hooded guide trope is present but transformed by charged particulars (tears birthing constellations; flora recoiling at her aura). Risks in lyric density pay off without obscuring clarity. The synthesis feels specific to this world and voice.</comment>
