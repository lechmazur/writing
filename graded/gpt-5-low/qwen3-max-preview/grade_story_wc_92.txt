<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Her motive and tactics are crystal clear and consistent—she protects silence to seed revolt with geometry—yet internal contradiction is minimal. The calm meticulousness (“never rushed, never reckless”) rings true and guides micro‑choices like aligning the gnomon and timing steps to the bell. A credible risk is present (guards within arm’s reach), but felt cost remains light. Strong, specific embodiment through objects (quill holder, sundial) reveals character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece tightens from rampart watch to courtyard action to rooftop charged poise. Closure lands in a quiet, resonant final image (dawn seep; copies in workers’ hands) that reweights prior imagery without tying knots. Cost is implied more than felt; still, the pattern coheres and the ending reframes options. Orientation is early and clean; setups (blackout, bell clock, sundial) pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fort, blackout, arcane lanterns, and sundial are vividly rendered and purpose‑driven, not postcard. Environment and tools constrain choices (timing to the bell, diminished light, architectural studies guiding routes). The bronze quill holder and sundial function as micro‑settings that shape action and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a watchful professional eye.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (seed a silent revolt) is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening as guards pass close while she executes the alignment and drop. Pressure remains coherent but rarely spikes; no reversal or visible price beyond risk. The blackout and dwindling lanterns help, yet consequences are deferred to off‑page dawn recipients. The resolution is earned but low‑heat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of meaning as rebellion and silence as pressure emerge organically through geometry, patience, and distribution. “Cradle of sparks” recurs as a conceptual frame that the ending subtly revalues as dawn seeps in. No sermonizing; resonance arises from the particular (angles, vellum, ration sacks). Slight thematic over‑signaling in repeated phrasing keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a “winking hush” tonal signature sustains focus without head‑hopping. Diction, syntax, and rhythm are confident and modulate with the action’s quiet stakes. Elision is purposeful and legible; no withholding glitches. The voice feels character‑bound rather than authorially performative.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are tight and image‑rich with good propulsion; most sentences do more than one job. A few lush turns risk purple, but metaphors remain coherent and support mood. Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics. The final image is precise without ornament overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silent revolution via coded sundial angles and a bronze quill holder in a dimmed arcane fort feels fresh and specific. Tactics grow from premise rather than generic spywork, and the closure re‑charges the motif. It takes a tasteful risk by privileging geometry and quiet over spectacle, and it pays off. Minor conventional beats (sentries oblivious) keep it just below exceptional.</comment>
