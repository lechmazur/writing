<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation and competence are crisp and consistent, and her micro‑tactics (puddle maps, analog rewiring) reveal character under pressure. However, she faces little internal contradiction; the piece leans on steadiness over ambivalence. Embodied detail lands (“water cool as forgotten truth”), but emotional texture remains mostly declarative. The endurance/renunciation cost is light, skewing toward competence fantasy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal flow: puddle‑map → hatch → Archive Engine → broadcast → enforcers. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—truth reenters the public sphere—though the on‑page cost remains conceptual more than personal. Orientation is clean from the opening. A single scene arc with one meaningful tightening (sirens/blackout) coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon and the analog relay station are vivid, specific, and functionally integrated (reflections as map; submerged hatch). Objects/tools constrain choices (phone key, cassette tapes, bicycle dynamo), and the final image is charged by place (“lagoon’s glow”) and object recurrence. World rules are consistent and learned through action. Economy of detail supports tone without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (memory vs erasure) and escalate coherently through entry, rewiring, and citywide blackout. Agency drives the turns, and the sirens/enforcer breach provide a credible tightening. The price is implied risk rather than a felt loss, so the peak pressure is high but not searing. Resolution is earned and rooted in her tactical choices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memory versus the “tyranny of indifference” resonates through concrete acts (restoring strike narratives, poets’ tapes) and recurring images (keys, reflections). A few lines verge on thesis‑telling (“The indifference would crack”), slightly flattening subtext. The final “coded freedom” reprise works conceptually, if a touch declarative. Overall, the theme coheres and lingers without heavy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, restrained lyric texture that suits Elira’s careful resourcefulness. Diction and rhythm are controlled; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Compression is purposeful, and elision serves momentum. The voice sustains pressure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is taut with strong verbs and layered images; information density stays high. Occasional heightened metaphors (“swallowing the last blush of dusk”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and purposeful. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentences propel action and mood. Syntax varies appropriately with scene needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The puddle‑map mechanic, analog archive engine, and “Ace of Keys” calling card synthesize into a fresh rebellion modality. The piece commits to non‑digital insurgency with specific, tactile ingenuity. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; they pay off without confusion. The conceptual turn—freedom as reappearing code—feels earned.</comment>
