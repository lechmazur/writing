<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied: the sea glass as “bottled feeling of safety” and the stone‑code ritual reveal motive through tactile choices. Contradictory impulses—reticence vs. a disciplined urge to connect/protect—coexist without tidy resolution. Peak micro‑choices (placing the glass, building the cairn, not turning back when the light relumes) feel character‑true. The endurance at the end reads as earned stasis with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure is clean, with a clear tightening when the lamp extinguishes and a subtle release at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he recommits to tending, reweighted by the lamp’s return and his internal warmth. Causality remains coherent under the lyric lens; ambiguity about the “ghost‑light” supports rather than breaks logic. Stakes and price are contained yet legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lantern room, spiral stairs, and weathered apparatus shape attention and behavior; the room’s flicker directly pressures his choices. Object‑as‑setting (sea glass) and micro‑setting (stone cairns) charge the final image and tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered—iron echoes, bruised sky, salt—and avoids postcard cataloging. The environment both mirrors and constrains, satisfying the 9‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving fragile light/connection—tightens with the lamp’s failure, forcing an immediate reassertion via ritual action rather than spectacle. The refusal to turn back after relume is a priced stance, not a dodge. Escalation is quiet but real under an accumulative lens; coincidence (re‑flicker) complicates but does not resolve. Slightly modest cost visibility keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of grief transmuted into communal care accrue through particulars: letter chain, coded stones, sea glass as returned apology. The final “luminescent” ache reweights prior images without moralizing, offering an earned, non‑literal answer: tending is the form safety can take. Ambiguity around the haunting deepens resonance rather than explaining it away. No platitudes; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close is steady, textured, and credible for this focalizer; diction (“feathered tax collectors”) feels voice‑true and lived‑in. Distance control stays tight and modulates cleanly at pressure points. No dialogue needed; narration carries subtext through gesture and image. Rhythm varies with intent, avoiding committee prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines pull multiple duties with minimal scaffold; images are vivid yet controlled. Figurative language is fresh and largely unmixed; no paraphrase loops or cadence templates drag momentum. A high density of lyric texture never muddies causality in peak beats. Final sentences land cleanly without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lighthouse grief is familiar, but the anonymous letter chain and stone‑message method give the piece distinctive bones. The sea glass as “apology from the ocean” and the haunted light’s nonliteral function feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are quiet and integrated rather than showy; the synthesis reads singular. Freshness arises from tactic‑level choices, not ornament.</comment>
