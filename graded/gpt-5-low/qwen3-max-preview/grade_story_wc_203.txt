<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and character‑particular: he’s there to witness, not fix, and his micro‑choices (angling the barrel, prying the tile, bagging artifacts, the whispered “I see you”) align. Interiority is embodied through tactile attention and occupational detail rather than abstract feeling. The “responsibility, not guilt” stance evolves credibly into a practiced ritual of care. Cost is quiet but felt—he assumes stewardship—though resistance is minimal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → dust spiral → ceiling reveal → apparition → charged exit. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he affirms his role as witness; the building’s “vigil” reframes the haunt. Causality is coherent and props are earned; no teleports. Stakes remain intimate, but the final cadence shift carries conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus office is lived‑in and specific (popcorn/sawdust scent, marquee “C_R_U_,” water drop tone). Environment and tool jointly constrain tactics: moonlight and the barrel’s curve are necessary to read dust, and the ceiling’s architecture directs the search. Details are POV‑filtered and purposeful; the final image is setting‑charged. Spatial and sensory choreography are clear and evolving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—witness and release—tightens meaningfully with the dust‑to‑ceiling discovery and the apparition’s silent ask. Agency drives the key turn (he chooses to pry and to acknowledge). The price is interior and vocational rather than risky; no adversarial force tests him, keeping escalation modest. Still, the cadence shift near the end deepens options and reweights cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of witnessing neglect instead of banishing specters accrues through particulars (artifacts, dust, pearl button) and culminates in “the building…keeping vigil.” One explicit thesis line (“ghosts don’t haunt places; they haunt neglect”) edges toward telling but is supported by scene work. The final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers as a gentled responsibility.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined close third filters world via craft and patience; diction balances technical (horology, accumulation patterns) with lyric cadence. Psychic distance is steady; the single line of dialogue is earned and understated. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well from attentional focus to quiet epiphany.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and image‑rich without muddle; metaphors are coherent and in‑world (“ghost of glitter,” dust as presence). Minimal scaffold, strong verb choices, and purposeful syntax variety keep momentum. A couple of thesis‑y formulations flirt with overstatement but do not blunt the closure image. Read‑aloud rhythm is controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an elevator tech using a mainspring barrel to read dust‑ghosts in a circus office is distinctive and organic. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, and the closing vigil reframes hauntings with gentle audacity. Risks are taken in tone and method without gimmickry. The piece avoids template beats and sentimental clichés.</comment>
