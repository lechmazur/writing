<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (a covenant to the drowned; “to teach darkness the value of stars”), and her micro‑choices (tilting shutters, angling the mirror) align with that aim. Interiority is expressed through tactile ritual rather than exposition, which suits the silence motif. The cost reads as sustained vigilance and renunciation of ordinary life, but internal contradiction is faint, limiting depth. The remembered boy adds specificity that fuels present action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mist coalesces → she activates the shutters/mirror → the drowned woman’s response → star pierces. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: endurance affirmed, threshold work reframed by the unbroken starlight. Causality is coherent via ritual mechanics rather than plot turns, with no orientation debt. Cost is subtle but legible as ongoing duty rather than a decisive sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dock, lamplight, grates, and rain are not ornament—they’re the optical and mechanical substrate enabling her tactic. The dental mirror as micro‑setting/tool charges the final image and constrains choices. Weather and surfaces (slick planks, meniscus) shape method and imagery. The environment’s logic remains consistent and integral to the act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding the lost at the threshold—appears early and tightens when the drowned woman materializes, prompting faster weaving and more urgent glyphs. Pressure is internal and situational rather than adversarial, but escalation is clear in cadence and image density. The price is the guardian’s continued endurance and acceptance of incomplete saves. The climax is quiet yet earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—silent empathy, refracted light, teaching darkness without banishing it—without moralizing. The touch at the mirror incarnates the thesis elegantly. The ending’s single star reweights prior motifs without didactic statement. Ambiguity remains purposeful, with darkness as audience, not enemy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close distance with a distinct perceptual signature (“hope’s geometry,” “shutter‑glyphs”). Rhythm modulates with pressure (moth‑wing clicks quicken), and diction is consistent with the story’s mythic register. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. A few lush clusters flirt with purple but remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (optics as ethics). Variation in syntax and paragraphing sustains momentum. A few stacked metaphors verge on saturation but avoid muddle. The final cadence is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ferryman/psychopomp frame is renewed through specific, inventive means (dental mirror, shutter‑glyph optics), avoiding stock tokenry. The “teach darkness to value stars” stance is conceptually bold and organically dramatized. Risks in lyric mode pay off without obscuring clarity. Freshness arises from integrated mechanism and ethos.</comment>
