<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A striking, coherent interior motive—mapping absence—drives every micro‑choice, culminating in the earned decision to enter the night she charted. Embodiment is vivid (salt, flaking gold, calloused fingers), showing a lived method rather than declared genius. However, internal contradiction is minimal; we rarely see competing impulses challenge her poise. The cost is felt, but a sharper on‑page fray at the brink could deepen it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: the last star’s guttering and the booklet’s closing deliver a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean (oracle, ridge fort, storm, hush), and the causal thread—listen, summarize, map, enter—coheres. The price (solitary descent into the mapped night) is legible on the page. Slight abstraction in stakes keeps it just shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ridge fort, storm, salt, and “ambered hush” are sensorially precise and filtered through vocation, shaping what she can do (the hush permits mapping within chaos). Weather and topography scaffold the final image of descent. The flaking booklet functions as a micro‑setting/object that charges the ending. Constraint is present but not maximally leveraged into tactical necessity, keeping it below 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give shape to endless night—tightens via the clock of the final star and culminates in her chosen entry, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural: density of summarized silences, star’s extinguishing, booklet’s closure. The cost is implied and felt, not dramatized against an opposing force, which limits visceral pressure. Still, one meaningful cadence shift lands cleanly under the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Absence-as-architecture, silence as navigable terrain, and care as cartography emerge through concrete acts (summarizing the hush) rather than sermon. The ending reweights the premise: she becomes subject to her own map, offering coordinates to others at a personal cost. No late moralizing; resonance lingers in the “marbled hush.” The thematic countercurrent (risk of self‑erasure) is present but understated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with a perceptual signature tuned to negative space and tactile minutiae. Rhythm modulates well (from howling storm to ambered hush) without head‑hopping or stance slips. Diction remains coherent and character‑bound. A few lush clusters skirt purple, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with high information density; images often multitask (booklet as tool, relic, and starfield). A handful of figurative stacks (“honeyed resin,” “moth wings,” “marbled hush”) risk saturation and minor synonym echoes. Momentum holds and clarity is not compromised. Slight trimming could sharpen pressure peaks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The central invention—mapping night by summarizing silence within an “ambered hush”—feels singular and internally faithful. Recurring objects and the final reconfiguration are precise rather than gimmicked. Risk‑taking in concept and diction pays off with coherence. Very fresh, just a hair from the rarefied tier due to gentler pressure.</comment>
