<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The poet’s motivation (“to discover the texture of time”) is embodied in tactile, idiosyncratic behavior (tracing frays, spiraling the rope, humming), and her choice to leave the rope behind reads as a credible renunciation. Interiority is specific and sensorial rather than label‑driven. The ethical playfulness manifests in offering “texture” over answers, though the felt cost remains modest. Contradictory impulses (seeking meaning vs. refusing judgment) coexist but rarely collide under real pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rope studies → light‑pulse revelation → village impasse → reweighted closure with the bridge. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis hybrid: she relinquishes the rope, and the village reframes choice, with a conceptual cost (surrendering binaries) on the page. Orientation is clean from the first lines; payoffs honor set‑ups (rope reinterpreted as record). The causal thread is soft by design but coherent at each escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The terra‑cotta grotto, twin moons, and pulsing energy beings create a vivid, integrated atmosphere that actively participates in revelation (light tracing rope frays). The recurring rope functions as micro‑setting and tool, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, avoiding tourist catalog. World rules (beings communicate via light) are consistent and dramatized, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: resist a false binary and find a stance that reweights time/choice. Escalation occurs via revelation (rope as record) and the public act in the square; agency lies in the choice to intervene with “texture,” then relinquish the rope. The price is conceptual/social more than visceral, but it reconfigures the village’s options. No redundant loops; pressure coheres to the ending image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rope-as-record and the bridge image generate resonant subtext about refusing false dilemmas. However, several lines articulate thesis overtly (“The impossible choice was never about right or wrong; it was about the illusion of control”), softening the earned resonance. The final image still reweights prior material without needing explicit moral. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative rather than sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinctive, lyrical voice with consistent psychic distance; diction and rhythm fit the poet’s sensibility. Purposeful modulation at key beats (gasp, soft laugh, low voice) maintains control without head‑hopping. Occasional didactic sentences intrude slightly but do not break stance. Dialogue is minimal and functional, carrying subtext and effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with strong image systems (fray, weave, stitch) that stay coherent. Minimal scaffold and no significant paraphrase loops; syntax varies with scene energy. A few abstract formulations brush purple but remain anchored by tactile detail. The final lines are clean and precise, landing the cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—energy beings as nonverbal revelators, a rope as moral palimpsest, and an ethically playful poet mediating—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric logic, conceptual closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. The bridge‑from‑rope turn is both surprising and prepared. The piece commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>
