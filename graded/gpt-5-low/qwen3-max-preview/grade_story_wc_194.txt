<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, character‑specific motive and method; her discipline of listening and bodily attunement reads particular and credible. Limited contradiction under pressure—she faces little on‑page resistance once the recording begins. The final stance shift (ender → restorer) is earned but the felt cost is mostly conceptual. Micro‑choices are few beyond the deliberate pacing and the decision to play and then to go.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑scene causal build lands a resonant reconfiguration: spinning the cylinder reveals identity, reweighting the mission and options. Orientation is crisp from the opening; the world rule (resonant gramophone) is seeded before use. Cost is implied (mission inversion, personal upheaval) rather than dramatized, but the ending’s charged poise is clear. The lens holds as a causal→textural hybrid, dominated by causal at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Evocative, selective detail (sepia room, law tomes, mahogany, bruised sky) filtered through her auditory bias deepens pressure. The gramophone as tool‑setting constrains action and charges the last image (warm crank, device turning itself). World rules stay consistent and learned through action. Atmosphere supports theme without tipping into empty symbol.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (truth that could end the dynasty) and tightens with the reveal, but antagonistic pressure is largely absent. Escalation is a single, effective deepening from potential to revelation; the cost and narrowed paths are more inferred than contested. Her agency is in attention and restraint, which works, though the scene lacks a hard trade‑off on the page. The pivot to restoration reweights stakes convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silence, resonance, and inheritance braid into a coherent inquiry about how truth is transmitted and who it remakes. The “Golden Silence” policy mirrors her chosen tactic, and the final walk reframes ending/restoration without stating a moral. A touch of thematic neatness (destiny twist) trims ambiguity, but the afterimage lingers. Motifs recur with purpose, not checklisting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent auditory sensibility; psychic distance modulates cleanly. Purposeful elision (tuning to hums) is taught and paid off. A few lush stretches flirt with purple, but rhythm and precision mostly carry them. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density and clean sequencing; sentences often do double duty. Some stacked metaphors (“bridge of intuition… living lattice… standing waves”) verge on excess but remain coherent to the motif. Minimal scaffold or repetition, and the final image lands cleanly. Minor compression could heighten pressure further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival gramophone as emotional resonator, policy of erasure as “Golden Silence,” identity twist that inverts the premise. Risks a quiet, inward climax and largely succeeds. The magic‑tech premise is integrated rather than tacked on. Slight conventionality in the swapped‑at‑birth reveal keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
