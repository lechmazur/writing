<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (“to harvest insights from failure”) and every micro‑choice aligns, from calibrating driftwood to breathing for echo, not song. The interiority is particular—precision over fear, patience over glory—though internal contradiction is mostly implicit rather than dramatized in clash. The renunciation (leaving the flute) reads as an earned stasis with felt cost. A touch more on‑page friction between urge to restore and ethic to witness could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: careful setup → seam crossing → autopsy of collapsed realms → renunciatory return. Closure lands on the page with cost: she forecloses restoration, redefines her role, and leaves the tool to decay, charging the final image. Orientation is clean from the opening; the between‑place shard is legible and paid off by the codex and monument. Causality is tight without over‑explaining; no stray set‑ups remain unpaid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Thunder‑echo Range and amphitheater are tactile and purposeful; silence “presses against the eardrums,” wind memory informs marker angles, and the ghost delta supplies driftwood. The flute functions as micro‑setting/tool, constraining method and charging the final image as monument. Sensory selection feels professional and biased to her craft, avoiding tourist catalog. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the ethical stake: to test the weave without repeating catastrophe. The tightening beats—uncasing, the breath-note seam, the forensic walk through failures, and the refusal to play—progressively narrow options toward renunciation. The price is conceptual and vocational rather than kinetic, but it’s legible and consequential. A minor added stressor in-scene (risk of re‑collapse or a test that almost tempts her to play) could heighten escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—the autopsy frame, the three realms’ distinct failures, the driftwood compass, and the flute’s decay. The final stance (“Some doors stay open by staying closed”) resonates as earned wisdom rather than a grafted moral, though it edges toward aphorism. Subtext—honoring failure, ethics of restraint, silence as agency—pervades image and choice. The named codex is slightly declarative but supported by the scene’s lived cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lucid lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature—technical, reverent, unsentimental—stays steady through pressure. Diction and rhythm modulate cleanly from canyon hush to between‑place to the charged quiet of return. No head‑hopping or register drift; elision is purposeful and paid off. Lines like “This wasn’t ritual. It was autopsy.” exemplify crisp, character‑true compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is tight, with high information density and clean propulsion; metaphors are coherent and scene‑bound (seam, weave, hush). Occasional flourish (“gradient of forgotten hues”) stays legible and pattern‑consistent. Minimal scaffolding; no notable loops or muddled vehicles. A hint of list‑texture in the realm triad is functional but slightly expository.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—forensic ethics of magic, a flute as interworld stitcher, and an ending of principled silence—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet renunciation over spectacle, autopsy frame) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Specifics (wind‑calibrated driftwood, “reed brittle as old vows,” three distinct failure modes) anchor originality beyond surface novelty. The final conceptual reweighting is both surprising and right.</comment>
