<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—testing “necessary distances” to find her father—drives every beat and culminates in a costly choice. Interiority is specific (grain-as-chronology; grief fossilized), with action aligned to motive (decoding via wood, stepping off). Contradiction (loss/fear vs. “featherly determination”) is present but lightly dramatized rather than stress‑tested by on‑page resistance. The final renunciation reads earned, if a touch insulated by lyric remove.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: bench → logbook → vision of maze → step into threshold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with cost (“not falling, but unfolding”), legible on the page. Causal links are mostly internal and symbolic yet coherent; the logbook reveal of her handwriting efficiently tightens options. A hair of convenience in the instantaneous maze sighting keeps it shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the drifting prism terrace and the bench constrain attention and enable the final act. Recurring objects (bench, logbook) charge the last image; rainbow mist as a liminal precipice is functional, not postcard. Sensory selection is POV‑true and consistent with the world’s rules. Minor bias toward visual/lyric over tactile friction keeps it under the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around crossing the final threshold to find/understand the father’s sacrifice. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal: decoding → recognition → vision → step, with the price being self‑unmaking. Pressure remains internal and steady; a single concrete counter‑pressure on the page would sharpen the trade‑off. Still, the choice at the rim narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of sacred thresholds, necessary distance, and sacrifice emerge from particulars (wood grain chronology; maze keystone) and reprice at closure. One explicit statement (“sacred thresholds aren’t marked by stone or scripture”) skews near thesis, but it’s earned by scene work. The father’s vanishing into structure reframes agency and holiness without moralizing. Aftertaste is resonant and open, not pat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled; diction fits the mind that reads grain and weather as emotion. Psychic distance stays stable; patterning (weather code as barometer of surrender) is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or register drift; rhythm modulates toward a poised final cadence. Slight lushness occasionally edges toward purple but rarely blurs sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense and largely precise; images carry double duty (bench as archive; mist as limen). A few metaphors verge on saturation (“regret with teeth,” “soul overcast,” “featherly determined”), flirting with redundancy. Momentum holds, with minimal scaffolding and clean syntax. The final sentence resolves musically and logically.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: wood‑grain divination tied to meteorological emotion, a prism terrace, and a maze‑as‑cosmic keystone. The child’s handwriting coda elegantly loops time without neat mechanics. Risks are purposeful and coherent; the piece commits to its conceit. The only limiter is reliance on lyric escalation over on‑page friction.</comment>
