<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, idiosyncratic motive and embodied perception drive each choice; the renunciation of the ring reads as a credible cost. Internal contradiction is subtler—she “invites the ache” with little visible doubt—so struggle feels managed rather than contested. Still, her micro‑choices (kneeling to translate, stepping into silence, surrendering the ring) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The arc from absorbing to composing constitutes an earned reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern density builds (notes → chorus → stillpoint) to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the pause of constellations frames the window. Closure lands on page with cost (placing the ring, no longer absorbing languages). No causality breaks; the scene flow is tight for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and its acoustic logic are vivid, specific, and integrated with action. Setting constrains method (only silence carries secrets; she must attune) and charges the final image (stillpoint as absence full of potential). The ring as object‑setting also returns in the coda. Sensory selection aligns with the protagonist’s tactile/aural priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around locating the stillpoint before the cosmic pause ends, escalating via resonance density into the silent glade. The decisive act—stepping into and then surrendering the ring—carries a visible price and narrows future options (she ceases absorbing languages). Stakes are primarily internal but legible and scaled to length. A touch more destabilization before the glade could have sharpened the test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: resonance, translation, and the stillpoint recast grief/joy as harmonics. The final cadence reweights the premise (from cartography to composition) without sermonizing action. One explicit thesis line (“grief and joy were not opposites…”) edges toward stated moral, slightly dulling subtext. Overall, the images carry the argument with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric voice with tactile/sonic bias suits the POV and stays controlled under pressure. Diction and rhythm modulate toward the stillness at the core without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off. No dialogue needed; the narrative texture does the work.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are polished, image‑dense, and largely multipurpose; rhythm breathes with the scene’s needs. A few stacked metaphors flirt with purple, but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep propulsion. The closure image is crisp and unsmudged by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind mapmaker, tactile linguistics, ultrasonic ecology, and a stillpoint as charged absence—feels singular and necessary. Risks in concept and diction cohere, with the ring’s reweighting smartly sealing the arc. The imaginative world rules are internally consistent and character‑driven. Freshness arises from specific integration rather than novelty veneer.</comment>
