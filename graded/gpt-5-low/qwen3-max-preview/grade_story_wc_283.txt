<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and a patient, craft‑based interiority anchor the POV; her micro‑choices (placing the cracked ivory button, spinning the glass slower, leaving jars at crossroads) reveal values. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the cost remains mostly conceptual, muting dramatic bite. The transition from solitary archivist to teacher is credible but underpressured. Emotional embodiment is strong via tactile labor rather than overt feeling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural build is taught early and coheres: hourglass → buttons → echo’s clarity → dissemination. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: “future is folded,” followed by a stance shift (sharing jars) and a charged final image. Cost is felt more as renunciation of fixed prophecy than personal sacrifice, but it’s legible. No orientation debt; pattern remains consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, jars, buttons, and hourglass are tactile and integral, charging the final image (“Buttons gleamed under lantern light”). Environment and tools constrain method (spirals on slate, resin‑scented shelves) and define her tactics. The canyon and cliff underbelly are not postcards; they shape capture and risk. World rules are consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are conceptual (truth as possibility vs. false prophecy) and escalate via a clear intensification when the echo speaks plainly after the cracked button. Agency drives deepening as she chooses dissemination over custody. The price remains mostly reputational/ideational; no hard trade‑off is paid on page, keeping the tension refined rather than visceral. Still, pressure coheres and tightens appropriately for this mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from objects/actions: archaeology of choice, communalizing wisdom, prophecy reframed as possibility. The ending reweights the premise through image rather than plot mechanics, with resonance across the hourglass/buttons/echo braid. A few declaratives (“prophecy wasn’t prediction,” “Shared wisdom…”) skirt thesis‑speak, slightly blunting subtlety. Overall, it lingers with earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with consistent psychic distance and perceptual bias (craft, texture, patience) powers the piece. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with purposeful cadence shifts at the echo’s clarity and at closure. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; the single quoted line lands as an earned rupture in texture. Elision is taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; syntax varies and propulsion holds. Figurative language is lush but coherent and pattern‑driven, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minor recurrence (“as the truth unraveled”) reads intentional rather than looped. The final third is clean and sharpened by object reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: prophecy decoded through cataloged buttons, echoes in jars, and an hourglass measuring “truth” not time. The method is specific and irreplaceable; the reconfiguration from oracle to distributed agency feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in conceit and structure heightens stakes without obscurity. The closure image meaningfully recombines motifs.</comment>
