<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is textured and embodied, with clear motive (seeking the “shape of home”) and specific micro‑choices (feather to stone, stepping through the arch). The internal contradiction—seer who translates others versus refusing to translate herself until now—lands. However, opposition is gentle and the cost of arrival is mostly conceptual, softening pressure on the final choice. Still, her renunciation of endless translation in favor of belonging reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: textures → feather ritual → archway → room of belonging. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis (“no longer translating the world, but belonging to it”) with on‑page consequence (stone stilled, environment reorders, gravity steadies). Orientation is crisp early, and the throughline from intent to sanctuary is coherent. The cost is subtle but legible as a relinquishment of stance and identity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore isn’t mere décor; it breathes, rearranges, and forms the archway, directly shaping the decisive passage. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered (mercury/glass/oak/parchment) and charges the final image. Object‑as‑setting (stone, feather) amplifies the world’s rules through action, not exposition. Scale and specificity feel inevitable to the thematic turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: transform pain of remembering into belonging. Escalation is accumulative: tactile pressure intensifies, the stone ripples, shelves shift, gravity reconfigures her stance. There’s minimal antagonistic push; the pressure derives from the risk of accepting a new identity, which reads but remains gentle. The agency is hers, and the outcome results from her chosen method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres around home as resonance and the ethics of translation versus embodiment. Recurring images (mercury, glass, feather, stone) deepen the idea and reweight meaning at the end. One explicit thesis line (“Home was not a place... but a frequency”) verges on statement, but it grows from enacted particulars. The final image avoids moral and reverberates beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical third‑person with a controlled perceptual signature (tactile lexicon, pressure‑as‑light) stays consistent. Rhythm calibrates well to intensification and release. No head‑hopping or stance slips; elisions are purposeful. The diction is elevated yet voice‑justified by the seer’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; metaphors align (mercury, glass, pressure) and remain coherent. A lush register risks excess but rarely lapses into muddle, and momentum persists through the ritual. Syntax varies and paragraphs earn their space. Minor saturation in modifiers keeps it just below the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a mountain‑bookstore as living memory, tactile magic via feather texture, a seer of mercury‑glass translating a lost language into sanctuary. The turn—choosing belonging over translation—recasts earlier details with inevitability. Risks (dense lyric mode; conceptual magic) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The closure image is both fresh and earned.</comment>
