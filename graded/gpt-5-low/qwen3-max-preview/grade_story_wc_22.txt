<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is lucid and embodied—restoration via “submerged concord” drives every micro‑choice from crushing pods to mixing ash. The coachman’s interiority is conveyed through tactile ritual and bird‑spoken cues rather than exposition. Contradictory impulses are subtle (patience vs. urgency; grief vs. repair) but present in the kneeling/listening restraint before action. The endurance choice at the end (return tomorrow) reads as earned stasis with a quiet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: bird permissions, seed selection, ash/soil mixing, and tide cadence build to a charged poise. Closure lands in the final image—he refuses immediacy, accepts ongoing labor, and departs with attention fixed on the sown patches. The cost is endurance over time and the acceptance of slow, uncertain repair on a site of past violence. Causality is lyrical but coherent: signals → planting → resolve to continue.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: jetty slats dictate where he can scoop soil; tide and twilight pressure tempo; battlefield absence charges the ground. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt, kelp, moss, ash) filtered through his vocation. Environment and recurring objects (pods, ash tin, feather) charge the final image. Minor note: constraints are atmospheric more than obstructive, but they still guide action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (seeded reconciliation vs. lingering war‑void) and escalate via bird‑mediated permissions and the ash‑mixing choice. Pressure tightens once as he moves from listening to irrevocable planting, then to the renunciation of immediate payoff. The price is time and continued return rather than a sharp on‑page loss; nonetheless it reweights options at the end. Quiet mode works, but opposition remains largely internal/environmental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory, mercy, and repair arise organically from act and image (pods as ciphers, ash‑soil, birds as grammar). “Submerged concord” becomes practice rather than slogan, culminating in a stance that refuses erasure and embraces reweaving. The battlefield/garden dialectic avoids piety and lands with emotional aftereffect. The final “narrow vastness” reframes loss into charged possibility without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a precise lexicon (botanical/linguistic/marine) sustains POV without leakage. Rhythm modulates with action—listening stretches, planting compresses, departure breathes. The dead‑language invocations feel character‑true and function as action, not ornament. No head‑hopping; distance remains steady and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lush diction is dense but pattern‑taught and purposeful; metaphors align with sea/war/seed fields and seldom clash. Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, character, and theme—without redundancy. No noticeable scaffold or loops; cadence varies. Minor risk of purple excess is kept in check by concrete actions (crushing pods, mixing ash).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Dead‑language dialogue with birds to broker ecological accord on a war‑scarred jetty is striking and coherent. The seed‑pods‑as‑ciphers and “permission” calls feel fresh, inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its premise and ends with a resonant reconfiguration. Risk‑taking enhances clarity rather than obscuring it.</comment>
