<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation is clear and consistent—“to strip needless drama”—and her micro‑choices (ditching gloves, sleeping in the greenhouse, shifting where she publishes) reveal character under pressure. Interiority is distinctive, grounded in sensory detail and professional lens rather than labels. Internal contradiction is quieter than ideal, but the renunciation of her former track reads earned with visible social cost (“breakdown”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from the first beat through closure, with the spiral discovery reweighting the entire enterprise. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why after the flood), and causal through‑lines feel motivated by setup choices (interferometer, humidity, drafts). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—“I found them here, in the dust”—with a legible cost (professional shift, social skepticism, years invested).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storm‑damaged greenhouse is tactically active: humidity, drafts, broken panes and a patched skylight shape dust behavior and observation. The setting’s specifics drive method (interferometer in a surviving corner) and produce the charged final image (slide on the east wall catching morning light). Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered (ozone, dew, creaks) with consistent world rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether she can reframe catastrophe into calibration, and pressure deepens via progressive pattern formation culminating in the logarithmic spiral. The meaningful tightening is the spiral that fuses her astrophysics models with the dust, compelling a professional and existential stance. Conflict is mostly internal and textural rather than oppositional; the social pressure (“breakdown”) supplies a modest external cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: decay as accumulation, perception as filter, patience over spectacle. Recurring images (dust, interferometer fringes, spiral) shift meaning at the end to answer the piece’s question without a neat moral. A few aphoristic lines (“Poetry… physics with fewer equations”) skate close to statement, but they feel earned by the concrete particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is a clean, lyric‑scientific register with a distinct perceptual signature; metaphors arise from her domain and the greenhouse’s textures. POV distance is stable and confident; no head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates well between observation and revelation, especially around the spiral beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with purposeful rhythm; images do multiple jobs (science, emotion, setting). Minimal scaffolding and little redundancy; figurative language remains coherent to the physical logic. A few broad generalizations about the universe flirt with abstraction, but momentum and clarity hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Butterfly‑wing dust as a “temporal lens” that reframes astrophysical inquiry through ecological decay is fresh and integrated. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight once the spiral lands, and the risk of crossing scientific diction with lyric phenomenology pays off. The final repricing line elevates the concept without gimmickry.</comment>
