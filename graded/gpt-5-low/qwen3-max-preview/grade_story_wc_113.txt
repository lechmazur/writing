<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Her motive—to decode the flood‑composed score and “listen” to silence—is vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (lantern angle, mirroring the ghost, playing without sound) align with it. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, filtered through a musician’s bias. The arc to “purpose” reads as earned stasis with felt cost (trembling, lungs empty), though internal contradiction is lightly expressed. A note of fear or doubt under pressure could have layered stakes further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens cleanly: program → apparition → conducting exchange → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the silence is reweighted, the ghost has peace, she leaves with a charged object. Causality is anchored by her intentional setup (37° lantern, water magnification) and paid off by the ghost’s emergence and dissolution. Cost is subtle but on‑page; an added persistent constraint at peak could nudge this into the 9s.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and flickering lantern are exquisitely specific and integrated with action (wading, leaning stands, water pooling to reveal glyphs). Environment constrains tactics and charges the final image (program drying, pit “exhaling”). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true to a musician attuned to resonance and silence. World rules (water as composer) are consistent and learned through observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—summoning/finishing the drowned symphony—intensifies as the ghost materializes and conducts. Escalation reads as a cadence shift under the textural lens (lantern sputter, water vibrating, image solidifying). Agency is clear in her decision to “disrupt” via intention and embodied mime; the price is mostly spiritual/physical rather than peril‑driven. A sharper on‑page trade‑off or foreclosed option would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of absence, silence, and decay‑as‑composition accrue organically through recurring images and culminate in the finale (“the in between spaces finally sang”). The flood’s “masterpiece” reframes loss as authored meaning without moralizing. The ghost’s peace versus her purpose offers a resonant answer to the central question of what silence holds. No platitudes; the insight is earned by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (musical lexicon, orchestrated imagery) and stable close third. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure, avoiding head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (wordless conversation) is taught and paid off. A few lush lines flirt with purple but remain coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme) with clean syntax and propulsion. Figurative density is high but mostly consistent and legible; metaphors harmonize (water, music, breath, decay). Minimal paraphrase or scaffold; momentum sustains to a crisp, charged ending. One or two modifiers could be pared, but clarity holds in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The water‑damaged program as a score only legible at a precise lantern angle is striking and specific. The silent performance with a ghostly conductor transforms familiar haunted‑theater tropes into something fresh. The conceptual repricing of flood as composer is memorable and thematically integrated. Risk‑taking in form and premise heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
