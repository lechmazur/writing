<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Her motive (“to trace honest origins”) is clear and consistently enacted through concrete investigative choices. Interiority is specific and embodied (the stamp’s bite, smudged spectacles), showing competence without bravado. Internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers—so the crucible is endurance rather than a divided impulse. The closing renunciation (witness over condemnation) reads earned but low on visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery of the ledger → architectural anomalies → preserved Master Index → vow. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with a felt, if primarily conceptual, cost (surfacing to speak against suppression under blackout). Orientation is crisp from the first line; no causality breaks. Slight softness in on‑page price keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken library is tactile and functional: water pressure groans, moss‑slick shelves, vents preserving the codex. Environment repeatedly shapes options and meaning (bone stylus prying, sealed vents, bricked stairwells). The final image is charged by place and tool (lantern, stamp, preserved Index). A model of integrated atmosphere with purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are ethical and archival: expose deliberate erasure. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than sharp narrowing, with the Master Index as the key pressure increase. Agency is endurance and verification, not confrontation; the price is implied risk and burden, not dramatized loss. Effective, if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: stillness as attention and sanctuary, truth as seepage not spectacle, preservation versus erasure. Recurring objects (ink stamp, lantern, Index) reweight meaning at the end without sermonizing. A few explicit maxims (“Truth… seeped”) flirt with declarative moral but remain earned by particulars. The closing vow reframes the city’s “failure” as charged waiting—resonant and precise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, restrained lyric voice filters detail through a professional’s eye; rhythm adjusts with pressure. POV distance stays steady; inference reads as inference, not omniscience. Diction is consistent and character‑apt, avoiding register drift. Occasional patterned phrasing (“Not luck. Design.”) is effective rather than gimmicky.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: strong verbs, layered images doing double duty, clean syntax. Minor repetition and a touch of purple (“dappled,” “seeped”) recur but serve motif and cadence. No scaffold loops or figurative muddle that obscure sense. Final line lands cleanly with image and intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—an indexer excavating complicity in a drowned archive—feels fresh, with clever specifics (air‑vent preservation, tide‑table cross‑reference). Risk lies in making quiet inquiry propulsive, largely achieved. The investigative method reframes “stillness” in a non‑obvious way. Not wholly unprecedented, but confidently singular.</comment>
