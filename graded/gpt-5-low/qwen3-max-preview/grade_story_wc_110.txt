<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her actions (arranging tickets, angling the lens, then choosing stillness) align with it under pressure. Interiority is embodied through tactile attention (cool glass, breath, weight of withheld glances). The change registers as earned when she accepts the lens’s cracking and leaves the tickets behind. Slight limit: her internal contradiction is muted; she reads steady more than torn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres and pays off in a resonant reconfiguration: the keepers’ thaw and the lens’s crack mark a before/after with felt cost. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern (silent ritual → communal response) holds through closure. The causal chain is soft but consistent: preparation → projection → gathering → communal hum → physical sacrifice/completion. The cost is on‑page (tool breaks; artifacts surrendered) and reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: rain basins, fractured skylight, and crystal columns aren’t postcard detail; the moonlight via skylight is functionally necessary to the tactic. The micro‑setting evolves (drip metronome, acoustics for humming), charging the final image. Objects-as-setting (lens, tickets) are integrated with place. Strong sensory control across sight, sound, and touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates texturally: private intention → public exposure → communal test via touch and hum → acceptance at cost. The dominant stake (thawing mistrust) tightens when others emerge and risk contact, culminating in the child’s hand and the lens cracking. Agency is endurance and exposure rather than debate, and it earns the resolution. Slight softness remains from low oppositional force on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of transparency, vulnerability, and acceptance without explanation arise organically from action and image, not moralizing. The final repricing—transparency as a relinquishment that breaks the tool—reweights earlier motifs (doodles “not to be decoded” becoming felt truth). Ambiguity is purposeful and generous. No sermon; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person focalization sustains a distinct perceptual signature without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from hush to communal hum to dawn hush. Diction is unified and apt for the mode. Minor risk of uniform elevation, but it remains purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, concrete images, and multi‑tasking sentences produce momentum. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and seldom overwrought; no paraphrase loops dull the peak beats. The final images (child’s hand; lens cracking; tickets fading) land cleanly. A few dense phrasings brush purple but don’t blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of a post‑verbal archive, a projector lens as moral instrument, and “ambiguously clear” transparency feels fresh. Turns grow from established particulars rather than gimmick. The ritual’s quiet risk and physical cost heighten distinctiveness. Not radically novel, but confidently singular.</comment>
