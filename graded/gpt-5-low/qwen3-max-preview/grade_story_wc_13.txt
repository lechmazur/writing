<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and active from the first line—find the place where echoes are born—and her choices (overborrowing, cushioning the chime, midwifing echoes) track cleanly. Interiority is embodied (fatigue, heat of the pendant) with credible stress responses. Internal contradiction (panic vs. trained clarity) appears but isn’t deeply mined for moral cost. The ending’s renunciation—pocketing the pendant and stopping—reads earned if a touch easy emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal moves within an accumulative lyric) holds: the wrong chime → cushioning → searing pendant → release of echoes → city reconfigured. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: birdsong replaces suspended hours, with the conceptual cost of borrowed time and risk to the giant. Orientation is clean early (rooftop canals, sleeping giant, pendant) and stays coherent. The on‑page cost is present but moderate, keeping this just shy of the 9.0+ tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rooftop resonance canals, mossed stone, glyphs, and the breathing giant are vivid and functional—setting shapes tactics and risk. The environment constrains choices (moving along canals, cushioning sound, beating the giant’s nap) and charges the final image (city wakes by birdsong through those channels). Details are selective and POV‑filtered (an illustrator’s acoustical eye). World rules are learned in action without clunky exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early—birth echoes before the giant wakes—and pressure tightens with the premature chime and overborrowing from the giant’s dream. The protagonist actively escalates and adapts (bending time to buffer sound; accepting pendant sear to finish the work). Costs are legible (fatigue, risk of waking a titan, siphoning from a dangerous source) though consequences remain favorable. Resolution feels earned by agency rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Art as time‑sculpture and memory’s midwifery threads through images, not thesis: echoes as unborn possibilities, illustrations as anchors. The final repricing—extinction reframed as temporal erosion reversed by resonance—reweights the whole. Ambiguity lingers (the ethics of stealing from the giant; the durability of borrowed time) without confusion. No moralizing; resonance arises from specific acts and objects.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to the illustrator delivers a distinct perceptual signature (acousticians’ glyphs, resonance canals). Rhythm modulates well under pressure (shortening during the chime crisis, expanding in the chamber). Diction is consistent and character‑plausible for a precise, sensorial mind. No POV leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with minimal scaffolding; imagery is rich yet coherent. A few metaphor stacks risk density, but cadence stays clean and propulsive. No loops or filler under peak pressure; the searing pendant beat is crisp. Line‑level control supports momentum and clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Rooftop resonance canals, a sleeping giant whose breath governs hours, and echoes as unborn sound form a striking, integrated conceit. The time‑borrowing pendant and “womb of resonance” feel inevitable in hindsight given her profession and aim. Risks in worldbuilding are bold and coherent, not gimmicky. The final reconfiguration (city waking by recovered voices) is fresh and earned.</comment>
