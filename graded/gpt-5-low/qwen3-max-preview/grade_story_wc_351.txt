<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single‑POV interiority is vivid and character‑particular: the engineer’s “chaotically precise” mind filters canyon features as synaptic terrain. Motivation is coherent (not to mourn but to modify), and key micro‑choices—touching the mirror, accepting entangled memory, deciding to return—align with that drive. Contradictory impulses (grief vs. curiosity/control) are present but softly dramatized. The cost is mostly internal and implied, landing just shy of sharper on‑page abrasion.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design holds: the mirrored object prompts memory‑merging, which culminates in a reweighted final stance (RR/CR) as she pockets the mirror and commits to return. Orientation is clear early (canyon, moon, engineer) and the pattern teaches itself. Closure has conceptual cost—living with rewired grief—though the price remains more tonal than dramatized. The beats link cleanly without outliney “and‑then” sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is sensorially rich (juniper, binary hoots, shale) and consistently filtered through a neuro/engineering lens. The mirror functions as micro‑setting and charges the final image. Environment doesn’t tightly constrain options, but it meaningfully frames the ritual and tone. Specificity is purposeful rather than touristic, sustaining atmosphere without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: transform grief into agency via modification. Pressure coheres and deepens when she allows the child’s memory to flood and chooses integration rather than avoidance, then escalates with the decision to keep the mirror and return. The cost is present but subdued; no path is palpably foreclosed beyond prior habits of mourning/sterility. One meaningful tightening lands, though it could cut closer to bone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of repurposing pain and re‑mapping self emerge through recurring images (mirror, periscope, neural cartography) and pay off in the final charged stance. A few thesis‑like lines (“She had not come to mourn. She had come to modify.”; “This was her method.”) tilt toward explicitness, slightly thinning subtext. Still, the closing repricing of loss into potential resonates without moralizing. The motif web integrates organically rather than checklisting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with technical inflection (“synaptic plasticity,” “helix‑minded”) matches the focalizer and remains stable. Rhythm modulates well—staccato convictions against longer sensorial runs. Occasional flourish (“owls called in binary hoots”) feels character‑true, not pasted‑on. No leakage or stance confusion appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful repetition. Figurative saturation is heavy but mostly disciplined; a few near‑platitudes and repeated frames (“She did not… She modified…”) flirt with redundancy. No significant scaffold or cadence artifacts slow momentum. The final lines land cleanly by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an engineer’s neuro‑lexicon applied to a canyon ritual with a salvaged toy periscope mirror and entangled memory. The periscope→inner cartography turn feels earned and memorable. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscurity. A touch more concrete cost would push it higher.</comment>
