<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (“to preserve the echo of wisdom”) drives every micro‑choice, with endurance/attention functioning as agency. The mask’s asymmetry seeds a credible internal duality (mystery vs. discipline) that colors action, though conflict is gentle rather than testing. Embodied perception is strong (palming the stone; breath woven into the clearing). The cost is light (spent focus/surrender), but it reads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through resonance, the parapet’s alignment, and the stabilization of clearings. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the pattern taught (ritual via peripheral awareness) pays off. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the place is consecrated; options reweighted; a price of attention and relinquishment is felt. No causality breaks or stray threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, petrified vines, and kinetic parapet create an immersive, sensorially specific environment filtered through the focalizer’s priorities. World rules are learned via action (consent of place; mechanism responds). The setting charges the final image (parapet’s last click; pavilion’s satisfied quiet) and subtly guides tactics. Constraint is soft rather than hard, keeping this just shy of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused and escalates through a felt deepening: air thickens, first clearing stabilizes, multiple vessels form. Agency is a disciplined refusal to force, which narrows tactics to peripheral attention and surrender. The visible cost is stamina/renunciation of control; the parapet’s “click” seals the earned result. Pressure remains low‑temperature but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around wisdom’s residence in silence and edges, developed through particulars (half‑mask duality, consent of place, vessels of absence). Subtext operates via image rather than thesis; the prophet’s quoted line risks on‑the‑nose, but functions as a charged reprise rather than moral. The ending reweights the premise (whispers preserved for those who attend peripherally) without sentimentality. Resonance lingers through the charged final walk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third‑person close POV with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical hush, breath‑guided attention). Diction and rhythm are modulated to the ritual’s calm without head‑hopping. Patterned elision is taught and maintained. Voice remains coherent under mild pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors and varied cadence; images do multiple jobs. A few repeated motifs (“murmur,” “clearing,” “whisper”) flirt with lushness but largely serve pattern and momentum. Syntax stays clear; no scaffold or synonym churn that dulls the closure image. Read‑aloud rhythm supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a kinetic parapet, peripheral consecration, and psychic “clearings” yield a fresh ritual logic. The half‑mask’s “strangely honest” asymmetry grounds abstraction in character. Risks in concept and diction cohere and pay off at closure. Only the gentleness of on‑page cost moderates the ceiling.</comment>
