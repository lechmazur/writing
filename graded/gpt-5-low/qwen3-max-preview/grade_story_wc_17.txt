<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clear motive and a distinctive occupational lens yield embodied choices—listening with her palm, choosing to witness rather than extract, refusing to capture the glowing negative. The interiority is particular (“the hollow behind her ribs”) and consistent. Internal contradiction is subtle (yearning to record vs. electing to leave her sketch), but it’s present and costs her something. A relationship crucible is absent, but not required at this scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of the bend, the diaries, the witnessing, and the moonlit negative tighten meaning toward a resonant offering. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she deposits her sketch with the diaries and leaves with a heavier heart. Cost is legible and on-page (she foregoes pinning the image and relinquishes her map). Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the single-scene structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The environment is vivid and functional: ivy-veiled corridor, collapsed antechamber, hearth, and moonlight all shape options and the final image. The fireplace becomes an altar constraining the offering choice; the broken roof enables the negative’s glow. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, integrated with action. The closing “passage exhaling” charges the final beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure deepens rather than reverses: from hearing murmurs to encountering the diaries to choosing how to respond. The decisive tightening is her renunciation of capture and the placement of her own work with the burned grief—she trades possession for custodianship. Stakes remain internal and thematic, but the price is clear and felt. No coincidental resolution undercuts the arc.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Legacy, witnessing, and communalizing grief emerge through particulars (half-burned diaries, the film strip, the offered sketch). The final image reweights the premise—burden passed to walls and future readers—without over-explaining. One explicit thesis line (“Legacy’s burden was not meant to be carried alone”) edges toward moralizing, slightly blunting subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature; the diction supports the vocation and world. Rhythm modulates well, moving from hushed observation to charged images. No head-hopping or register drift. The elision around the negative’s “breathing” is purposeful and paid off by refusal.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: images are coherent and multitask, and the syntax varies with pleasing cadence. Occasional lushness (“sharp as a scalpel,” “like unborn birds”) remains controlled and legible, rarely tipping purple. Minimal repetition and no scaffold loops; information density is high. The final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “echo cartographer” premise, breathing architecture, and grief-as-offering feel fresh and integrated. The moonlit undeveloped negative is a striking, non-obvious turn that reframes capture versus witness. The risks are aesthetic, not structural, and they pay off. This synthesis reads memorable and specific rather than templated.</comment>
