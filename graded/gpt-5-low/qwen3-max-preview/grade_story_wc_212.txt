<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (preserve life/time) is clear and embodied by specific micro-choices (lifting the acorn cap; pressing it into the dais; whispering seed names). “Furiously tranquil” gives a credible inner contradiction that colors her actions. The cost is more conceptual (letting go, consenting to return differently) than dramatized, softening the felt price. Depth of struggle is modest, but consistent and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres: acorn cap → dais insertion → entropy’s weeping reversal → sapling. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a before/after cadence shift and conceptual cost (surrender/consent). Orientation is clean from the outset; the lens holds. Cost is real but gently rendered, keeping this just shy of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is vividly specific and integrated (weeping ice, rising droplets, dais spirals mirroring the sky). Environment and object interplay charge the final image (sapling replacing egg under thawed starlight). Setting details evolve with action rather than sit statically. While constraint is more poetic than tactical, it still shapes beats.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reopening what entropy sealed—tightens through ritual action and pattern intensification rather than antagonistic resistance. The meaningful turn is pressing the cap into the spiral, triggering the weeping and return. The price is primarily an inward renunciation; no path visibly foreclosed beyond that, tempering tension. Still, pressure coheres and rises appropriately for lyric mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (seeds, memory, consent) integrate with the event‑sequence to answer the thematic question non‑literally. Some lines state the thesis too directly (“Entropy decreased not by force, but by consent”), edging toward sermonizing. The final image reweights prior material convincingly (borrowed time felt as porous, living texture). Subtext largely lives in image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with steady POV; diction and rhythm track the emotional curve. Recurring syntactic moves (“Not melt—weep.”) serve cadence rather than become tics. No dialogue needed; interiority and image carry movement. Occasional abstract declarations slightly flatten the otherwise vivid texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density and image precision (“droplets rose upward…each holding a flicker of color”) with purposeful repetition and clean momentum. Figurative language is lush but mostly disciplined; minimal redundancy. No mechanical errors or clarity breaks. A few thesis‑like sentences modestly blunt edge but don’t stall the line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Seed saving fused with entropy‑reversal via tenderness feels fresh and internally coherent; the acorn cap as paradox key is striking. The “ice weeping upward” and memory‑as‑method are inventive without gimmickry. Risks are taken in mode and concept and pay off cleanly. Minor overtness in theme keeps it just shy of the rarest tier.</comment>
