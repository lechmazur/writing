<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Eleanor’s motive—to “contain” grief—drives concrete micro‑choices under pressure (not rising to the kettle, choosing the chisel). Interiority is textured and particular (circus, Viktor’s laugh, the well‑used chisel). Contradictory impulses (haunting practicality vs. letting the kettle boil) read credibly. The earned renunciation at the end forecloses a path (domestic reflex) with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: rain, tools, and kettle build toward a charged poise. Closure lands on the page when she places the half‑formed lion in light—an RR that reweights time and grief with the cost of inattention to the kettle. Orientation is clean from the outset. The throughline holds without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The loft, skylight, rain, kettle, chisel, and ash blank are integrated and constraining. The kettle’s location/time pressure and the window’s light charge the final image and shape choices. Sensory and occupational detail feel lived‑in and filtered through Eleanor’s grief. Setting evolves with the weather clearing and the kettle’s heat spent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal: whether she can hold grief without drowning. Escalation is signaled by the kettle’s first whistle and its “scream,” culminating in her refusal to rise—an on‑page price. The deepening insight about time crystallization is tied to action (shaving curls, setting the piece in light). The cost is modest but legible and sufficient at this scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of containment vs. control and time as crystallization emerge organically through image and act. However, several lines state thesis directly (“That was the lesson…,” “Time… to crystallize”), softening subtext. The final image still resonates without tidy moral closure. The motif set (whisker curl, amber, frost) coheres and reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident close third with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Diction is consistently elevated but character‑plausible, modulating around the kettle’s urgency. No head‑hopping or stance drift; focalization remains steady. Lyric compression is taught early and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical with strong image work (“fine as a lion’s whisker”). Minor tendencies toward overt abstraction and reiterated thesising slightly thicken the texture. Sentence rhythm varies well; momentum holds through accumulative beats. No significant loops or figurative muddles that obscure sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The widow of a lion tamer carving a resting lion as vessel for grief is a fresh synthesis. The kettle‑clock and “crystallized time” lens feel non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken in a quiet, lyric mode without losing clarity. Images earn their resonance through specific craft and circumstance.</comment>
