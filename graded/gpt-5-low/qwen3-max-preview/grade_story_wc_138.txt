<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular: boredom refined into a reverent hunt for “what happens after goodbye.” Actions align (waiting centuries, calibrating to the storm, stepping through) and reveal values. Internal contradiction is light—he moves steadily from ennui to wonder without much resistance—but the final renunciation of his refuge registers as cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: storm → magnetic crescendo → spatial mutiny → gateway → crossing. Closure lands on the page as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the escondite collapses, and he irrevocably steps into the “resonance” plain. Setups (magnetism, amulet’s nature) pay off cleanly without late rule changes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the prismatic escondite and solar storm aren’t postcards; they constrain method and timing. The amulet as object‑setting charges the final image, and environmental details (aurora dais, magnetic tendrils) are filtered through his ancient sensibility. World rules stay consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is tight and escalates through the storm’s peak and the room’s “spatial mutiny.” The decisive act—stepping through as his refuge implodes—carries a visible price and narrows options. Pressure is more awe than jeopardy, so it lacks a counterforce beyond the environment, but the accumulative cadence still tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of farewell, resonance, and cost accrue through particulars (echoes of last thoughts, magnetic harmonics). The ending’s realization reweights prior imagery effectively, though “What waited… was resonance” edges toward on‑the‑nose statement. Emotional aftereffect is earned by image rather than moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (“spatial mutiny,” “ionized regret”). Distance and tense remain stable; no leakage or unearned omniscience. Elevated diction fits an ancient mind and modulates with pressure without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with strong rhythm; most lines do double duty. The figurative texture is lush but largely coherent; a few stacked metaphors flirt with purple without blurring sense. Minimal redundancy, clean syntax, and a crisp, resonant final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a dimensionally aware shard, “spatial mutiny,” and a refuge of refracted light yield a memorable frame. The god‑heart amulet and the “library between heartbeats” feel specific, not generic SF-fantasy garnish. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens meaning without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
