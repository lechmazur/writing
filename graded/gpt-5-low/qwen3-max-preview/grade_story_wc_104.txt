<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation and tactics are crystal clear and embodied—her patience, chains, and agrarian know-how drive every micro‑choice. The interiority is particular (soil, spores, chord decoding) without therapy‑speak. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, which flattens the crucible a touch. Still, the closing renunciation (leaving key in the arrow, accepting risk) reads earned with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: decode keys → mural shifts → vault access → seed scattering → charged exit. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the drive lens holds as accumulative/causal. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she departs under threat with seeds on her body and a signal left behind. The cost is implied (chains, raiders, dawn clock) rather than dramatized in direct confrontation, but it’s legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The carnival/piano/vault ecology is vivid and purpose‑driven, with objects constraining choice (the piano lock) and charging the final image (arrow marker, spores in the door). Sensory selection (dust, wind through ticket windows, glow of cryo‑tubes) is filtered through her agrarian lens. The setting actively shapes tactics and meaning rather than acting as backdrop. No white‑room drift or static cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early (breach vault before wall falls) with a meaningful tightening at the piano lock and a quiet deepening in the vault. Pressure accrues through time and risk, though opposition remains off‑stage. The cost is present but understated; a single on‑page complication or forced trade‑off would have heightened escalation. Still, agency governs each turn, and the ending forecloses safety for signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of resilience, nonviolent sabotage, and stewardship emerge organically through objects and acts (mycorrhiza, arrow as marker, “soil remembers”). The closing image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing; “They’d find music instead. And green.” resonates. A few lines tilt toward declarative thesis, but the imagery carries the weight. The wall/time motif binds social critique to scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent distance and a tangible perceptual bias (earth, seeds, mechanics). Diction and rhythm modulate effectively around key beats (staccato “Not a metaphor.” vs. lusher description). No head‑hopping or register drift; elisions are purposeful and paid off. The voice sustains pressure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density and clean syntax; images do more than one job (arrow as history, marker, legacy). Figurative language is rich but coherent and not muddled; repetition is purposeful. Minor intensifiers (“quiet, inevitable”) are earned by cadence and do not loop. The final lines land with crisp rhythm and without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a piano‑cipher vault in a derelict carnival, mycorrhizal sabotage, and an arrow as relay for legacy. The nonviolent “impede” ethic reframes post‑apocalyptic tropes. Risks in tone and object patterning pay off in closure. The concept feels singular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
