<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tracer’s motive—prevent unanswered echoes from festering—consistently drives her micro‑choices, from kneeling in the damp to telling a hard truth. Embodied interiority shows in sensory‑tuned method (pressing the hearing aid to her temple, reading rhythm as ache). The relationship with the girl evolves credibly through resonance rather than neat talk therapy. The cost is quiet but present: she risks wounding to end waiting by saying “They’re not coming back.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative texture leading to a resonant reconfiguration: the synchronized pulses and thinned mist close the waiting with conceptual cost. Causality holds—photo’s rhythm → tracking → discovery → counter‑pulse → handclasp → exit. The closure lands on the page with a felt before/after (panic/waiting to calm/movement). Cost is gentle rather than wrenching, but legible in the refusal of fantasy and acceptance of loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atrium’s wet stone, glass condensation, and sentinel statues saturate mood without stalling movement; the hearing aid and photo function as micro‑settings that constrain action and charge the ending. The environment participates in closure (mist thins; atrium “sighs”). Detail selection feels POV‑biased (emotion as frequency), deepening plausibility of the method. World rules are taught through action, not exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure tightens from searching to urgent when the pulse stutters and surges, culminating in the decision to broadcast a steadier frequency and speak the hard truth. Stakes remain intimate and coherent (ending a harmful waiting), with one meaningful deepening. The cost is primarily emotional; no antagonist, but internal and situational pressures interweave. A touch more resistance or failure‑risk could have intensified the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Love as changing frequency emerges organically from tools and acts; the final image reweights the motif through calm, shared pulse. However, “Love doesn’t die—it just changes frequency” and “incidental heroism” state theme overtly, trimming ambiguity. Subtext still operates via gesture (hand over hand, synchronized pulses). The piece invites reflection on listening versus silence without sermonizing beyond those lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice has a distinct sensorium—resonance read as rhythm and ache—steady and confident. Diction matches the character’s vocation and mood; psychic distance tightens appropriately at the discovery and contact. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual, advancing the turn. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered jobs (image, mood, action) with good rhythm; figurative language is lush but controlled and legible. Minimal scaffolding and no loops; verbs do work. A few high‑lyric lines flirt with purple but do not blur sense or pressure. The final line is clear and charged by prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” using a tarnished hearing aid to map emotional frequencies is a fresh synthesis. The willow photo and atrium atmosphere are particular rather than generic. The rescue via resonance, not spectacle, fits the “incidental heroism” frame without gimmickry. Slightly on‑the‑nose thematic statements keep it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
