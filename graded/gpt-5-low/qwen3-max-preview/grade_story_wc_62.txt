<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s interiority is specific and embodied (hands on grooves, breath as carving), and his choices (tying ribbons, carving strangers’ epitaphs, the final crimson ribbon) align with a coherent motive. The spectral mentor relationship reveals values without dialogue and culminates in a credible reorientation. Internal contradiction (“thundering calm”) is evocative but remains low-stakes; flaws and costs are gentler than elite-tier. Still, the arc to acceptance reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: butterflies arrive, Silas’s presence deepens, ribbons multiply, culminating in the grandmother’s ribbon and a repriced stance. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the closure is an on-page resonant reconfiguration (joining the current, beginning the next stone) with felt cost. Causality is poetic, not mechanical, but linkages are legible and purposeful. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, yet sufficient for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse, ribbons, butterflies, stone, and thunder interlock as lived environment and charged micro-objects that shape tactics (tying ribbons to rafters, carving tempo to wings, the final dusk cadence). Vivid sensory economy—glass panes, moss-slicked flagstones, lemon tree—filters through a carver’s eye. Setting constraints and charges the final image, satisfying the 9-band gate. World rules stay consistent and discovered through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (“discover the shape of collective grief”) are clear and deepen through the ribbon-installation and the final, personal ribbon that reweights the communal web. Pressure coheres but remains gentle; the meaningful tightening occurs at the last-butterflies/last ribbon beat. Escalation is textural rather than oppositional; visible cost is subtle. The quiet resolution is earned but not razor-edged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motifs (ribbons/poems/butterflies/letters as vessels) fuse into a cogent meditation on communal grief. However, explicit theme statements—“He believed grief had geometry” and the final “grief was not a void…”—tilt toward telling, especially in the last paragraph. Subtext otherwise operates strongly in image and gesture (Silas’s palm; thunder’s bass note). Resonance lingers, but a lighter thematic touch would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature—craft lexicon, tactile noticing, lyric cadence that modulates with pressure (“thundering calm”). No head-hopping; certainty matches what Elias can know. The prose carries authority without register slips, and rhythm tightens toward closure. Dialogue absence is appropriate to the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is elegant and largely efficient; images often do double duty (letters as vessels; wings as mallet rhythm). Occasional lushness skirts purple, but metaphor control holds and repetition reads patterned rather than looped. Momentum is maintained across paragraphs with varied syntax. Minor overtness in thematic lines slightly dulls edge but not clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Gravestone carving + spectral mentorship + greenhouse ribbon-loom + butterfly migration is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable by the end. Risks are aesthetic, not gimmicky, and the final reweighting lands cleanly. Emotional truth is particularized through craft detail rather than template beats. Only the mild thematic explicitness keeps it shy of the topmost band.</comment>
