<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Jasper’s interiority is specific and embodied—catalog numbers as ritual, the loupe he chooses not to reach for—showing a credible contradiction between control and longing. His shift from “insulating with facts” to “listening” is earned by on‑page micro‑choices (holding the cloth to his ear, typing the project). The faint dialogue with Ruiz adds pressure and status without hijacking the lens. Cost is felt as vulnerability and the renunciation of his protective method.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative drive is clear: object patterns and sensory echoes build to a resonant reconfiguration when he starts “Project Echo” and pins the motto. Orientation is clean from line one; setup (quarry, job, cloth, Milwaukee failure) coheres into closure with cost (risking renewed engagement with music). The final image crystallizes a before/after without false neatness. The causal chain is soft but consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The quarry trailer and the valley’s acoustics are vivid, filtered through Jasper’s technical eye and a sound‑centric sensibility. Setting charges the final image—the wind, rock cuts, and echo valley make “listening” literal and thematic. Objects (cloth, harmonica, tools) function as micro‑setting elements that shape attention and choice. Detail economy is strong; no museum‑tour dilution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether he remains insulated or risks meaning again; pressure tightens when the cloth’s light changes and he chooses to feel rather than measure. The decisive action—typing the project and pinning the cloth—forecloses his safety strategy. Cost is emotional rather than situational, but it’s legible and scaled to the form. Escalation is modest yet purposeful for a quiet piece.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motifs of echo, rust, ghosts, and salvage accrue into a coherent theme: recovering resonance from fragments. The ending answers the central question non‑literally—purpose emerges through listening to absence rather than chasing applause. A few explicit lines (“He didn’t believe in value anymore…”) tread close to telling, but the images do most of the work. The motto risks neatness yet is grounded by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is precise, tactile, and technically flavored in a way that suits Jasper; rhythm modulates from clinical to lyric as he opens. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon (cataloging, tensile strength) and tilts warmer at closure without breaking stance. POV is stable and confident, with clean dialogue mechanics. No head‑hopping or register slips under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—image, character, and theme—without bloat; cadence varies and reads aloud cleanly. Figurative language is controlled and coherent with the sound/echo motif. Minimal scaffolding; no paraphrase loops dulling momentum. A few aphoristic statements skate close to abstraction but remain anchored by concrete objects.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of quarry archaeology with audio ephemera feels fresh, avoiding typical “washed‑up musician” beats. Turning a speaker cloth into a tuning instrument for meaning is a distinctive, earned move. Risk is quiet and interior yet committed. While not radically experimental, the specificity and craft elevate it beyond template.</comment>
