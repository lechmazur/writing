<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The librarian’s motive is singular and consistent, and her micro-choices (angling the palette, selecting wavelengths, deciding the three-part blend) align with that drive. Interiority is concrete and character-particular via tool-use and sensory focus rather than label-speak. Contradictory impulses surface subtly (obsession versus surrender) but could sharpen under peak pressure. The closing exchange earns a quiet renunciation/savoring without false tidiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design tightens toward the dawn-mixing act, yielding a clean on-page reconfiguration when the dream manifests. Orientation is strong from the opening; setup beats (method, components, stakes) pay off causally in the final brushstroke. Cost is largely conceptual/emotional (years of pursuit, the surrender hue) rather than a fresh on-page sacrifice, softening impact slightly. Nonetheless, closure lands with a felt before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archipelago, stilts, tides, and jetty are tactically relevant: they supply and constrain light-capture and define the search arena. The palette as tool and dawn as environmental resource charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (jasmine/ozone, tide bells) without museum-touring. World rules (capturing wavelengths, vitalizing vellum) stay consistent and are learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (reclaim the runaway dream), and pressure coheres via the chromatic cipher culminating in the decisive blend. The meaningful tightening is the three-component formula executed under a specific dawn window. External resistance is minimal; escalation is primarily internal and procedural, which suits the lens but limits visceral cost. Resolution feels earned by her endurance and method, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of longing as cartography, the materialization of absence, and custodianship of memory arise organically through action and objects. The final “luminous absence—filled, at last” reweights prior images without over-explaining. The line “Longing is the only map that never lies” edges toward thesis articulation, slightly flattening subtext in the final turn. Overall resonance lingers through image rather than moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, distinct lyric voice sustains through controlled syntax and precise diction; POV is steady and modest in claim. Rhythmic modulation suits pressure shifts (from patient harvesting to the held-breath mix). Minimal dialogue is natural and charged, with subtext built from prior images. No head-hopping or stance leakage; patterned elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and economical for its density; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, action). Figurative language is lush but coherent to the conceit (light as pigment), avoiding mixed vehicles. No noticeable scaffold loops or cadence templates; momentum is maintained. A few stacked modifiers approach purple but do not obscure sense or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The palette-of-light archivist in a tidal archipelago is a fresh synthesis, with the chromatic cipher translating longing into method. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (the three hues seeded then combined). The piece takes aesthetic risks (lyric density, conceptual tool) that heighten rather than obscure stakes. Emotional truth stays particular, avoiding generic mysticism.</comment>
