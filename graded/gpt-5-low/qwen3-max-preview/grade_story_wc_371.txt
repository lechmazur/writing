<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority and motive (“permission from the earth itself to feel sacred again”) drive concrete micro‑choices: offering bread, delaying entry, lighting a candle, uncloaking, planting seeds. The contradiction—armored caution vs. vulnerable attention—shows on the page and resolves into a credibly earned stance. Cost is subtle but present in the risk of hope and exposure. Slight softness remains around how much pressure her choice to wait truly exacts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: a sequence of gentle acts compounds toward a resonant reconfiguration at the hidden spring’s drip. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; one continuous scene tightens coherently. Closure lands as Charged Poise/CR (remembering how to ask; water stirs) with a modest but legible cost. A touch more on‑page consequence or foreclosed alternative would raise the impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are sensorially vivid and consistently filtered through her noticing. Environment meaningfully charges choices (no birds to take the bread; moss, cracks, fountain as planting sites) and the final image (the spring’s drip). Detail selection is purposeful across senses. A single constraint that forced a trade‑off would push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (seeking tenuous absolution), signaled early, and deepen through offering, candle, uncloaking, and seed‑planting. The key tightening is the uncloaking and the act of guerrilla gardening—small defiance against forgetting—which leads to the charged final image. Cost is mostly conceptual; no significant option is explicitly foreclosed. Tension remains steady rather than sharpening into a decisive test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of grief’s normalization, ritual, and reclaiming sacredness arise organically from repeated objects (bread, lanterns, seeds, fountain). The ending reweights prior material without sermonizing: the world’s “quiet rebellions” answer attention, not demand. Earned, unsentimental insight (“remembered how to ask”) resonates. A hair more friction between want and fear would deepen the counter‑read.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a stable close-third focalization; perception is selective and character‑particular. Rhythm modulates well, with reflective clauses balanced by clean, concrete action. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional elevated diction skirts purple but stays within a coherent idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong line craft, vivid images, and efficient sentence variety carry momentum. Some metaphor density and adjective stacking verge on lush (“paper lanterns long dark,” “crust hardened like old promises”), but coherence holds. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax throughout. A tighter trim in a couple of descriptive clusters would quicken the pulse at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “creeping normality noticer,” guerrilla gardening as ritual defiance, and a secret tea house in ruin feel fresh and integrated. The spring’s response as closure avoids cliché and fits the story’s quiet logic. Risks are taken in committing to a subtle, non‑event climax. Novelty comes from synthesis rather than twist, with only a slight familiarity in some ruin/renewal imagery.</comment>
