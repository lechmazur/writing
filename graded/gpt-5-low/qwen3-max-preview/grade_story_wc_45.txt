<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (“repair” over vengeance) and embodied micro‑choices (kneeling, planting/leaving the tooth) reveal a coherent, particular psyche. The “forgiving skeptic” contradiction plays credibly through pity versus myth. Internal tension is gentle rather than pressured, so cost registers more conceptual than visceral. Still, endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds from the riverbank revelation to the garden ritual, landing a resonant reconfiguration in the tooth’s final pulse. Who/where/when anchor early; one scene with clean progression. Closure cost is subtle but legible: she forecloses vengeance/clarity for a charged threshold. The pattern is taught and kept without lens drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The garden and hedge maze are vivid and idiosyncratic (backward clocks, cinnamon/ozone) and filter through the protagonist’s priorities. Setting charges key actions (altar‑stone, tooth rooting) and the ending image (maze “learning to forgive”). While it rarely constrains tactics, it deeply conditions tone and meaning. Specific sensory detail is purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recomposing a harmful myth into a practice of repair—is clear and deepens after the substitute’s reveal. Escalation follows an accumulative cadence: myth shatters → ritual → leave the tooth, inviting communal healing. The cost is a renunciation of vengeance/closure rather than a hard trade‑off, so pressure stays low‑temperature. Still, the tightening is coherent and protagonist‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief “outsourced,” bone‑setting of histories, objects becoming sacred through tending. The final image reweights the myth toward reparative stewardship without moralizing. Recurring images (tooth, garden, maze) accrue meaning and culminate in a conceptual repricing. Emotional aftereffect is tender and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature sustains consistency and modulates with the scene’s quiet pressure. Diction (e.g., “nostalgic innovation”) fits the world and focalizer. No head‑hopping or stance drift; compression is purposeful. A few lush lines flirt with over‑ornament but maintain clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, high information density, and images doing double duty. A few metaphor stacks (“architecture of redemption,” “constellations,” “rewired time”) near the same beats approach saturation but stop short of muddle. Momentum is steady without scaffold or loops. The closing cadence is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Old‑world changeling lore is freshly reframed as restorative practice via “bone‑setting” of histories—an elegant, non‑obvious synthesis. The secret garden’s paradoxes and the tooth’s quiet pulse feel singular and earned. Risk‑taking in lyric, accumulative design heightens resonance without sacrificing legibility. Only the gentle stakes keep it shy of the very top band.</comment>
