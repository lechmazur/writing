<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear, credible motive (rescue the promise) drives concrete micro‑choices—creating incomplete works, pressing her palm to the portrait. The destroyer/savior contradiction is present and animating without being over-explained. Interiority is embodied through tactile engagement with dust, ash, and glyphs. The visible cost is mostly conceptual (accepting criminality above vs. duty below), limiting the upper band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: her art‑breadcrumbing intensifies until the archive “answers,” culminating in the palm-press and choral release (a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing). Orientation is clean early; causality is lyric but legible (her actions → archive response → chamber). The cost is felt conceptually, though external resistance is minimal, keeping it short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The archive is vividly rendered (“volcanic tuff,” “petrified ink and salt”) and functionally shapes options: glyphs glow, doors open, the obsidian seal and pedestal focus the final choice. Setting details are POV‑filtered and purposeful, charging the closing image. Slight convenience (“No guards. No traps.”) trims the ceiling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates via density: from fragment to trail to responsive architecture to the sealed chamber. However, pressure lacks genuine friction—no counterforce or meaningful trade‑off beyond identity redefinition. The final act is her agency, but the path feels unimpeded, muting cost and tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-fire and destruction-as-preservation accrues through recurring images and is reweighted at the end. “We promised you would remember. Now break the silence.” risks overt statement but is partly redeemed by the charged ritual act. The destroyer/archivist synthesis lands cleanly without tidy moralizing, though the text occasionally tells what the images already imply.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Singular, confident lyric voice with controlled rhythm (“Dust shifted. Hidden doors sighed open.”) and precise lexicon tied to her perception. Psychic distance is steady; no head‑hopping or register slippage. The voice modulates with pressure toward the lit, choral ending without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful fragments and varied cadence; images carry double duty (world and theme). Figurative language is rich but generally disciplined; only a few lines verge on purple without obscuring sense. No loops or scaffolding; the final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Arsonist-as-archivist within a volcanic archive, using incomplete artworks as a deciphering method, feels freshly synthesized and inevitable by the end. The archive’s “response” to art is an elegant turn that suits the premise. Minor conventional ease (unguarded pedestal) keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
