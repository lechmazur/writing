<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The historian’s motive—salvaging memory from entropy—is concrete and consistent, and her micro-choices (probing the hearthstone, cross-referencing symbols, deciding to descend) align. Interiority is vivid and character-particular (“seismograph” perception; reading walls), though internal contradiction is limited. The change at the end is a credible stance crystallization rather than a revelatory leap. Slight lack of on‑page cost or doubt keeps this short of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries stack (fireplace diaries → tapestry → cross-references → directive line) to a Charged Poise closure (decision to go to the underlibrary). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the causal thread among clues reads as purposeful. Cost is implied (gravity stutters, clocks forget) rather than paid on page but still charges the final decision. No teleports or rule breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The silo library is tactile and singular (rusted into reverence; ash like regret; humming walls), integrated with action and theme. The fireplace, ash, tapestry, and underlibrary evolve from description to function, and the final “bronze quiet” image is charged. While the environment doesn’t quite constrain a hard choice, it meaningfully shapes discovery and closure. Sensory balance is strong beyond the visual (smell of salt and incense; humming wall).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—realigning memory against the displaced axis—tightens through clue accrual and culminates in a deliberate next step. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than a hard narrowing with paid cost; still, the “loom” plan and underlibrary hazard raise pressure. No antagonist is needed under this lens, though a sharper on‑page risk or trade‑off would lift stakes. The final choice reads earned, not incidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Memory versus entropy and the moral labor of mending the world through testimony are embedded in concrete images (dragons as weavers/menders; walls that have heard). The tapestry’s reweighting—from image to instruction—lands a resonant thematic turn without moralizing. Occasional explicitness (“Not with magic, but with meaning”) skirts declaration but remains earned by scene. The ending reconfigures the premise with lingering conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close focus with a distinct perceptual signature (“silence grew teeth”; “bronze lamp whose glow pooled like liquid metal”). Distance is stable; diction matches the sensibility of an archivist attuned to material traces. Rhythm modulates well from hush to charged recognition without head‑hopping. No dialogue needed; narrative certainty stays within plausible access.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; images do more than one job (tapestry as world logic, theme, and plot device). Minimal redundancy and clean syntax support momentum. A few stacked metaphors approach lushness but remain coherent and legible, avoiding purple drift. Final cadence is clean and exact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑dream world, displaced axis as existential condition, dragons as celestial menders, walls as witnesses—is fresh and feels inevitable by the end. Risks (mythic tapestry functioning as a technical manual of reality repair) pay off without gimmick. The conceptual reframing through testimony-as-weaving is distinctive. Only the lightly implied cost keeps it shy of the rarest tier.</comment>
