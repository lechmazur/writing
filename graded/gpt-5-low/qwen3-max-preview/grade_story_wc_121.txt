<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motivation (integration over escape) drives concrete micro-choices—stepping into the room, touching landings, choosing a “third path,” and finally speaking confessions. Interiority is particular and embodied (“bare feet hovering,” “runes grown like roots”). Contradictory impulses surface credibly: a poised defier who admits fear and unworthiness. The change at the end—merging echoes at personal cost—feels earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the sequence of corridors, frozen rain, and echo-selves tightens into a Charged Poise/RR closure as the tablet blooms and echoes merge. Orientation is strong from the first line; the tablet’s logic provides coherent progression. The cost is legible on the page (viaduct cracking, reality’s “resistance,” surrendering the safety of singular identity). The because/therefore chain is largely internal but consistent and felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The viaduct after rain, temporal phosphorescence, and frozen droplets are vivid and purposeful, not postcard. Setting actively charges choices and the final image: suspended time permits the confessional act; the viaduct shudders and cracks in response. The tablet as tool-object integrates with place and light. World rules feel consistent, learned by observation, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integration vs recurrence) is clear and escalates from entry to confession. Pressure deepens at the crossroads/third path and the explicit risk of endless recurrence (“doomed to recur unless she reconciled them”). The decisive tightening occurs when she names fears and reclaims gravity, provoking the environment’s backlash. Costs register conceptually and physically, though a second external counterforce could have sharpened the pinch further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres: not defiance but acceptance; runes as admissions, not instructions, is an elegant reframe. Recurring images (rain, glow, corridors) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the bloom. Minor explicitness (“I am the branching. The fracture. The recursion.”) edges toward thesis-stating, trimming subtlety at the finish. Still, the emotional honesty lands without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—technical lexicon (“procedural,” “algorithmic”) braided with sensuous image—stays stable and earned. Psychic distance tightens at confession lines for impact. No head-hopping; elision and compression are taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates under pressure without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with largely clean propulsion; many lines do double duty in image and function. Metaphor density is high but mostly coherent and controlled (roots, veins, fractures). Minor repetition/ornament (“between drop and ripple” echoed, some stacked modifiers) adds a trace of purple without obscuring sense. The final image is crisp and unsmudged by overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: procedural-generation logic applied to a mythic self-labyrinth, gravity refusal as ontology rather than power. The runes-as-admissions turn is fresh and reframes the quest. Stakes remain human-scale amid cosmic imagery, avoiding template mysticism. Risks in diction and structure pay off with a specific, memorable vision.</comment>
