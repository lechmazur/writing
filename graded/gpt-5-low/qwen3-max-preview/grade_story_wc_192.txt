<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (teaching breath after absence) drives each micro‑choice, and the refusal to knock reads as a principled renunciation with cost. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (cold ring, ash, scars). The character’s contradictions—tenderness paired with ruthless silence—are present in scene action. Slight abstraction in biography limits the fullness of lived specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via pattern (silence, scars, threshold) to a charged reconfiguration as the door surrenders and the lantern field replaces the room. Closure lands with cost—no reunion, the ring clattering, and a forward step that forecloses the old petitioning posture. Orientation is clean from the outset; set‑ups (doorknocker, threshold) pay off precisely. The constraint of silence shapes tactics throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary, ring, ash, and threshold are vivid and purposeful, not postcard detail; they steer choices (refusal to knock, pressing instead). The environment evolves (sanctuary dissolves; altar becomes sky), charging the final image. Sensory balance favors tactile and visual with purposeful specificity. Occasional symbolic heaviness is kept coherent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconfiguring relation to a wound/place—tightens via the decision not to knock, the scar‑linking method, and the step into the lantern field. The price is a renunciation (no reclaiming or forgiveness), made tangible by releasing the knocker and leaving the sanctuary to fold behind her. Escalation is a cadence deepening rather than reversals, fitting the lens. Stakes never sprawl beyond the central pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of silence as truthful and healing emerges from recurrent acts and objects rather than thesis, culminating in a non‑literal answer: permission to gasp and fumble in the dark. The reprise of “burns bridges carefully” is earned, reframed as ethical design, not vengeance. The single explicit line “You are allowed to gasp” risks statement but lands as sacramental action within the scene. Resonance lingers without tidy moral accounting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and consistent psychic distance; diction matches the story’s ritual seriousness. Elision and patterning are taught early and paid off at closure. The lone spoken line feels organic to the mode. Minor risk of uniform cadence in stretches, but modulation around peak beats keeps it alive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (ring as weight, plea, and release). Repetition (“She burns bridges carefully”) functions as purposeful motif rather than loop. A few saturated metaphor clusters flirt with excess but do not muddy causality or the final image. Syntax varies enough to maintain propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—ritualized silence, scar‑weaving as mechanism, and a sanctuary that surrenders into lanterns—feels fresh and internally coherent. Gothic and numinous tropes are transformed through specific tactics (refusal to knock; stitching a passage). The final reweighting avoids gimmickry and feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor familiarity in certain metaphoric gestures keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
