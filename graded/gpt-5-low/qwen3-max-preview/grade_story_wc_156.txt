<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s motive (curiosity over preservation) is concrete and drives micro-choices: inviting rather than commanding, discovering reflection, and pressing the nickel in. The internal contradiction—restorer vs. desire to be un-fixed—surfaces credibly at the pivot. Embodied responses (pressure-waves as memory, taste, terror) avoid abstraction. Slight softness: conflict is mostly surrender rather than struggle, so the price is subtle rather than harrowing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery of reflected method → inward spiral chime → layered awakenings → mural’s migration into her. Orientation is clear early; the pattern is taught and paid off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (loss of the nickel; identity relinquished; new constraint within her body). The causal chain is tight within the lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden isn’t decorative; its brass petals, echo-bending arches, and benches make the reflected method possible and frame every turn. Sensory palette is rich and purposeful (pressure, scent, hums). The final image (heartbeat in D-minor; B-flat stone) is charged by place-made acoustics. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes focus on whether she awakens the mural/self; escalation is a density increase rather than adversarial struggle, fitting the lens. The meaningful tightening is the shift from direct contact to ricochet and the surrender to nested layers. Cost is felt as the forfeiture of her fixed role and the nickel; still, resistance is low, keeping pressure elegant but not fierce.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme (curiosity over certainty; awakening via indirection) arises from concrete acts and returns in the final cadence (“in the pause between question and reply”). The coin→stone exchange reframes value and control without moralizing. The “She’d come to be un-fixed” line is explicit but earned by scene work. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled rhythm and lexicon that fits a sonic restorer’s mind. Patterned phrasing (“pause between question and reply”) is taught and reprises cleanly. No head-hopping or register drift; the voice modulates smoothly from playful to awed under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and economical; metaphors track the established sonic logic. Repetition works as motif rather than scaffold, and sentences vary in rhythm to match intensification. A few elevated turns lean lush, but clarity and propulsion never falter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—restoration via reflected sound in a resonant garden, a hobo nickel as acoustic talisman, awakening migrating into the body—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric structure, conceptual closure) heighten meaning without obscuring it. Specific details (harmonic resin, ultrasonic blue/subsonic crimson) deepen originality beyond ornament.</comment>
