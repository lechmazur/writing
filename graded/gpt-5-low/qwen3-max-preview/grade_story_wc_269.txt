<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and particular—compulsion to understand “vanished paths”—and her micro‑choices (tapping, code‑digging, diving) align with it. Interiority is embodied through tactile habits and sensory bias rather than labels. The final renunciation—she stops “searching” and starts “revealing”—feels earned and character‑specific. Slight ding: inner contradiction could surface more under peak pressure to add friction to the dive decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Structure coheres under an accumulative drive: taps → lag → subroutine → dive → coral revelation → practice transformed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world and her work are re‑priced (listening as method and ethic) with a felt cost in solitude, time, and relinquishing the search posture. Setups (atlas, tapping, AI) pay off causally without hand‑waving. The chain maintains because/therefore linkage while preserving lyric texture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The station is more than backdrop: stilts, sensors, AI, and submersible shape tactics and enable the breach→discovery chain. Sensory specificity is selective and POV‑true (metal bones, drowned mangroves, salt‑mildew paper). The environment charges the final image (console tapping; “temple of tactile cartography”). A touch more spatial constraint at the dive juncture could have heightened immediate physical stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure tightens meaningfully: storm breach forces action, the 17‑second lag reframes the mission, hidden logs escalate into the dive. Stakes remain coherent (truth vs. disappearance) and culminate in a knowledge cost that changes her practice. The price is more conceptual/emotional than physical; a sharper on‑page tradeoff in the dive scene would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of silence, listening, and metamorphosis arise organically through rhythmic motifs and object reprises (atlas, tapping). The final revaluation (“not with ears…with fingertips”) resonates and reweights prior beats. Minor deduction for two near‑moral sentences (“The fossil fuel ban hadn’t saved the reefs. But listening had.”) that verge on didactic. Subtext otherwise works through image and practice, not proclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—tactile, rhythmic, and professionally inflected without jargon bloat. Distance control is steady; lyric compression is taught early and remains legible. CALYPSO’s minimal chime mirrors the voice’s restraint and supports subtext. Occasional aphoristic closures flirt with generality but are anchored by concrete motifs.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, character, theme) with clean propulsion and varied rhythm. Repetition (“tap‑tap‑tap…”) is purposeful, pattern‑taught, and paid off. No paraphrase loops or figurative muddle obscure causality; diction remains coherent. A few high‑level phrases (“periodically eternal,” “temple of tactile cartography”) skate close to purple but remain supported by scene work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—tactile acoustics as epistemology, reefs pulsing on a 17‑second rhythm, an atlas reauthored in depth and time—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric‑scientific hybrid, minimal dialogue, resonance over spectacle) heighten coherence rather than obscure it. The delayed revelation concept is embedded in both plot and poetics. It avoids template environmental elegy by turning listening into an operational method with communal uptake.</comment>
