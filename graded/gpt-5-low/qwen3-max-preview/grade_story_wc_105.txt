<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline from the opening—she comes “not for refuge but resonance”—and her actions (feeding the forge her sister’s absence, pressing the device to her temple, choosing to leave) align with it. Interiority is embodied through synesthetic perception and marrow-tracked time, avoiding abstract labels. A live contradiction—grief’s pull versus a utilitarian mission for others—threads the piece. The Earned Stasis at the end (leaving without healing) carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: sensory density builds to the precise “crack,” then resolves with the forged memory-catcher and departure. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and no causal cheats occur. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she cannot mend, but she can warn—paid for by the loss of the sister’s voice and the bodily depletion on the page. The marrow clock supplies persistent pressure without derailing the lyric flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse-orchard ringed by shipwrecks is vivid and functional: she chose it specifically to echo trust’s fracture, and the hulls later “resonate” with her imprint. Environmental details (aurora, cracked panes, phosphorescent algae) are integrated through action and sound-bias, not static cataloguing. The setting charges the final image as she exits via the galleon under dimming aurora. Scale and specificity match the narrative’s stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the sound before it’s too late—tightens through the marrow clock and the deliberate sacrifice of personal absences. The decisive intensification is the heard “crack,” leading to the device’s creation and the charged choice to leave. Cost is legible (relinquishing the hope of restoration, bodily hunger, sanctified ashes). Tension works on sentence and scene scales without requiring an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—transmuting grief into guidance without sentimental repair—emerges from particulars (burning absences, imprinting silence) and culminates in the refusal to “mend what was broken.” Subtext resides in sound-color and the forge’s negative fuel, not in moralizing. The final “compass” reprices loss into communal warning with a conceptual cost. Ambiguity remains purposeful: salvation is not offered, only a charged caution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice’s synesthetic lexicon and rhythmic control are consistent and character-specific, modulating under pressure around the “crack.” No head-hopping or register drift; free-indirect texture stays tight to her perceptual biases. Compression is purposeful and legible; no dialogue required. The cadence sharpens at key beats without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet disciplined; images (“burns absences,” “memory-dust”) do more than one job and rarely overflower. Repetition patterns (“Not loud. Not dramatic.”) are purposeful, not looped scaffold. No figurative muddle at the climax; syntax varies to control breath and momentum. Minor lushness never obscures causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Conceptual invention—an ashen forge fed by absences, a device that captures the frequency of fracture—feels singular and inevitable within this voice. The synesthesia and marrow-timer integrate organically, avoiding gimmickry. The final reweighting (from healing to warning) is fresh and earned. Risks in lyric density pay off without confusing the arc.</comment>
