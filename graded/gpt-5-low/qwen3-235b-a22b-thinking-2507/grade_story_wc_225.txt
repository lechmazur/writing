<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven motive is clear and enacted through tactile micro-choices—fidgeting turns into purposeful thread‑work. Internal contradiction (shame versus analytic rigor) plays on the page and culminates in a credible renunciation of self‑punishment. The exoneration arrives a touch neatly, but it’s anchored in her specific skillset. The final apology to her younger self reads earned rather than ornamental.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain holds: tapestry cipher → revelation of sabotage → revaluation of guilt → decision to leave. Single scene, clean anchors, and a legible closure unit (resonant reconfiguration) with conceptual cost. The conspiracy proof via tapestry risks convenience but remains internally planted and paid off. Thunder’s crack provides a motivated cadence shift into closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The time‑frozen village, tapestry, and platinum labyrinth are vivid and POV‑filtered; details are purposeful rather than touristic. The “woven hush” and thunder modulate pressure and charge the final image (hush becomes benediction; rain on frozen earth). The environment subtly constrains options without over‑explaining world rules. Sensory selection fits her chess‑tuned perception.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self‑forgiveness—tightens through the decoding sequence and culminates in a stance change that forecloses self‑punitive exile. The thunder crack and accelerating “winnow” beats supply a concrete deepening. Costs are primarily internal and conceptual rather than externalized, but they’re felt on the page. No antagonist needed; opposition comes from shame and the hush’s pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of agency, manipulation, and forgiveness emerge through objects (labyrinth, tapestry) rather than lecture. The final image reweights earlier motifs (“pawn in a larger game” → compass to peace) with satisfying resonance. One line leans toward moralizing (“Forgiveness… integrating its lessons”), slightly blunting subtext. Overall, insight feels earned from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑limited voice with consistent perceptual bias (pattern‑seeing tutor). Diction, rhythm, and image patterns stay coherent under pressure; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Elevated register suits the mythic hush and does not break plausibility. Compression is confident without coy withholding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with largely clean syntax and varied rhythm; metaphors are mostly coherent and grounded in the woven/time motif. A few near‑repetitions (multiple “winnow” and “woven hush” echoes) flirt with over‑insistence but serve patterning. No significant scaffold or filter stacks; momentum holds. The prose is lush but rarely purple enough to blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—chess tutorship, time‑freeze, tapestry cipher, and a platinum labyrinth as moral instrument—feels fresh and specific. Turns arise from her profession‑rooted perception rather than arbitrary magic. The reweighting (from pawn to compass) is memorable and earned. Minor convenience in the conspiracy reveal prevents an even higher mark.</comment>
