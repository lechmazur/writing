<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is precise and embodied: a sensory cartographer pursuing the weight of a hidden truth about Lyra. Micro-choices under pressure (pressing the shard, “redirect” as a tactic, refusing to flee the bay after the near‑strike) reveal her hierarchy of values. The conflict between the impulse to follow and Lyra’s injunction to contain reads on the page. The final acceptance—carrying the truth as compass—feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens, with causal steps (shard → weave → vision → reweighted understanding) delivered through accumulative texture. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what she wants), and the single transition to the live‑accident shard is legible. Closure lands as conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: the truth reweights the quest and forecloses the fantasy of rescue. The cost is on the page in the extinguished shard and the chosen burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bay and the shard operate as charged micro‑settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Instability physically pressures Elara (the hydraulic arm surge) while the shard gates access and then goes cold, reframing her options. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose‑driven across modalities (ozone, hydraulics, jasmine). World rules are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates: from mapping echoes to nearly being struck to witnessing the live breach. The decisive deepening is the witnessed sacrifice, which narrows Elara’s options from rescue to stewardship. Agency is present in her tactical “redirect” and in the final choice to bear the truth rather than pursue denial. Slight passivity during the ghost‑witness beat fits the premise and doesn’t blunt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice versus pursuit of truth emerges from concrete images (the shard warming then going ice‑cold; Lyra’s hand into the field). The ending reweights “map‑making” into an ethical compass without sermonizing, though one line edges toward articulation. Subtext flows through sensation and charged objects rather than thesis. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third‑person closely held voice with a distinct perceptual signature (mapping via senses). Diction is consistent with the character’s vocation and the world’s tech. Rhythm modulates with pressure—denser during the weave, cleaner at closure. No POV leakage or unjustified certainty beyond her sensory frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and purposeful figurative choices; cadence varies with scene needs. Occasional lushness (“cyclically spontaneous,” multiple modifiers) edges purple but doesn’t obscure causality or closure. Minimal redundancy; images often do double duty. Final beats are crisp and well‑aimed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—sensory cartography, a shard as anchor, weaving as perception rather than travel—feels fresh and integral. The sacrifice revelation is a familiar trope, but it’s reframed via method and object to feel specific. Risks in diction and concept heighten coherence rather than distract. Turns arise from established tools and character choice.</comment>
