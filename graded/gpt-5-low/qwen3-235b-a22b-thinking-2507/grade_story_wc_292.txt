<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—clearing her grandfather’s name—drives every beat, with embodied contradiction (sticky fingers, “spongey dread” vs. steady voice) under pressure. The micro‑choice that matters—holding, reading, and finally reinterpreting the nail—aligns with her librarian/mapmaker competence. The decision to stay in a failing station forecloses an easier path with a felt cost. A slight neatness to the epiphany trims messiness of human error, but it remains credible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: coded stanzas → focused question (“Why the nail?”) → reinterpretation → stance to stay and finish the map. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the nail and the grandfather’s “exile,” with Earned Stasis in her choice to remain. Cost is present (isolation, failing generator), though it’s more implied than dramatized post‑decision. Orientation is clear early, and the single‑scene frame holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Arctic station’s damp, failing body and the groaning ice create tactile atmosphere that constrains options. The generator flicker and environmental hostility heighten pressure and inflect perception, while the copper nail functions as charged micro‑setting in the final image. Detail is selective and POV‑true, avoiding tourist cataloging. A few metaphors verge on overt symbolism but remain integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring honor) is legible from the outset; the tightening arrives when the lights flicker and she interrogates the nail, narrowing interpretive options. The turn is internal but decisive, reweighting tactics (salvage the keel fragment) and committing her to stay in danger. External conflict is light, but the environmental pressure coheres with the internal. The price is present but could be sharpened with one more concrete loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth as a means to reverse a social exile—emerges through object work and the coded‑map method rather than sermonizing. The nail’s meaning shifts from death token to “key,” offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Some lines tilt toward explicit explanation (“Honor wasn’t in the grave...”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Still, the final stance carries a clear, earned moral weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close POV with a tactile, slightly lyrical diction that fits a map‑librarian’s mindset and isolation. Rhythm tightens around the question and loosens into the closing certainty. Minimal dialogue is functional and subtextual (self‑address), and the narrative never leaks out of her knowledge. A touch of purple in image density is noticeable but controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs and concrete sensory anchors; the copper nail and station textures do multi‑work. Occasional metaphor stacking (“spongey dread,” “like damp insulation,” “grasping hands”) risks saturation and slight redundancy. Momentum holds, and syntax varies well across beats. Minor trims could heighten propulsion at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—an idealistic map librarian decoding weather‑poem coordinates to reprice a family “exile” via a copper nail marker—is fresh and specific. The realization grows from established particulars rather than a late rule change. Quiet risk‑taking in method (poetic ciphers) and object‑driven closure elevates without gimmickry. Only the conspiracy backstory feels familiar, though it’s secondary.</comment>
