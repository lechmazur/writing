<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (to recover lost joy) is clear and drives concrete choices: salvaging the projector, loading flawed film, casting the image, committing to return. Interiority is vivid and embodied (tears, grime, tactile handling of the fragment), though contradictory impulses are light—fear or doubt seldom push back in‑scene. The remembered network and grandmother calibrate her values without safety‑hedging. The final renunciation of passivity (she will display daily) reads earned with a gentle, credible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: discovery → recognition → application of knowledge → projection → reconfiguration of purpose. Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality is clean (fragment cues memory; network informs tactic; film enables resurrection). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an on‑page decision and a felt emotional price, though external pressure is minimal. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, not obstructive, which keeps it below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fog‑choked orchard is specific, sensorial, and functional: the fog literally becomes canvas; ruin contrasts and charges the projection and final vow. Objects (fresco, projector, reel) act as micro‑settings that constrain and enable choices. World rules (light on fog; exposed film as latent memory) are learned through action. Scale and selection stay tight and character‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on internal recovery; escalation deepens through the fragment’s reveal, the network’s guidance, and the risked attempt with flawed film. The decisive act (publicly committing to daily displays) forecloses withdrawal and implies ongoing cost. Pressure is coherent but gentle—no counterforce tests her commitment in scene, so tightening is more lyric than adversarial. A single meaningful intensification lands, but with low friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of exposure as revelation, communal memory, and beauty persisting through decay emerge organically via particulars (exposed reel, fog canvas, grandmother’s maxim). The final image reweights the premise with a humane, resonant answer (joy as reaching, not destination). One line edges toward moralizing (“Joy wasn’t a destination...”), slightly flattening subtext. Otherwise, symbolism remains integrated rather than declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent close third with lyric texture and a distinct perceptual signature (light/film bias). Diction suits the character’s sensibility; rhythm modulates well between description and action. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions are motivated by mood. The voice sustains intensity without turning mannered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is precise, image‑dense, and largely economical; sentences do multiple jobs and propel mood and action. Occasional abstract or aphoristic phrasing nudges toward purple, but clarity holds and momentum rarely stalls. Repetition is purposeful (light/exposure motifs) rather than scaffolding. The final cadence lands cleanly on image and intent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Projecting archival light into fog to resurrect communal joy feels fresh, synthesizing muralism, cinema, and ruin ecology. The knowledge‑network concept reanimates craft lineage in an original way. The internal arc is simple but true; the risk is artistic rather than plot‑twisty and pays off. High ingenuity without gimmickry.</comment>
