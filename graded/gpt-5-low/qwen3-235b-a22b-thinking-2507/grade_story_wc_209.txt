<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and particular—reckon with Leo’s mystery—and her actions (waiting in the cold cathedral, angling cards, then choosing a new mural approach) track cleanly. The interiority is embodied (pigment‑stained fingers, cold stone in her bones) and avoids therapy‑speak. The shift from “shouting” murals to “umbral tenderness” feels earned by on‑page discovery, though the realization lands a touch neatly. Contradictory impulses—public vividness vs. private hush—coexist and resolve credibly at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: the pattern of hush/light/hidden layers intensifies to a Conceptual Repricing at the window and a tangible new tactic (the mural). Orientation is clear from the outset; the cathedral move is causally set up and paid off. Closure carries cost in relinquishing her prior coping mode and reweighting grief’s terms. The two‑shard structure (pavilion → cathedral → return) coheres with one clean transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally decisive: the etched glass at dawn literally enables the reveal and charges the ending image; the amber pavilion frames opening and payoff. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑driven (amber slats, cold stone, fractured beams). World rules are consistent and the environmental constraint (timed dawn light) shapes options. The final mural folds both places back into a single charged image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding what Leo meant and how to live with it—tightens through the dawn constraint and the switch to the cathedral method. The reveal reconfigures what she’s after (botany → grief), narrowing her path. The price is soft but legible: renouncing the catharsis of loud murals for a more vulnerable mode. Escalation is understated yet coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: darkness as gentler light and grief’s truth emerging in hush. The etched‑glass mechanism embodies “hidden layers,” and the final mural offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing from the narrator. Leo’s quoted lines toe the edge of explicitness but are integrated as artifact‑voice, not authorial sermon. The reweighting of “night‑blooming” from botany to trust/grief lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical without drift, and stays within Elara’s perceptual signature. Modulation suits pressure—compressed at the cathedral, more expansive at the pavilion. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elision is purposeful. Diction and rhythm sharpen at key beats (“the dawning hush pressing around her like a velvet glove”).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images do multiple jobs and momentum holds. Figurative language is rich but not muddled; minimal redundancy and no noticeable scaffold loops. The final paragraph’s syntax carries propulsion into the image. A few heightened phrases approach purple but stay anchored in action and object.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Night‑blooming flowers as grief isn’t new, but the specific mechanism—etched cathedral glass revealing lemon‑ink notes at dawn—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The amber pavilion/cathedral braid gives the piece a memorable signature. Risks are tasteful and coherent rather than showy. The closure synthesis reads organic to character and place.</comment>
