<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and flaw (driven to repair a past mistake while doubting outcomes) are clear and embodied in precise micro‑choices—unbending the nib, writing sparingly, targeting the botanist’s hesitation. Contradictory impulses (“confidently uncertain”) operate in scene and guide tactics. Emotional texture is concrete (station groans, starlight warps) rather than label‑only. The visible personal cost is modest (accepting ambiguity, draining the pen) but credible at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: reactivate pen → exploit anomaly → inscribe revision → anomaly responds → charged poise at peace. Orientation is strong from the outset, and setup pays off in the closing image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses certainty and accepts a new stance at cost. The price is more conceptual than material, keeping it short of a higher tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The anomaly and pen function as micro‑settings/tools that constrain options (time‑bending windows, contingent mechanics) and directly shape the final image. Details are selective and goal‑filtered (capillary channels, entangled reservoir, station’s recycled air). World rules are learned through action rather than dumps, and the final lullaby‑like cradle pays the atmospheric setup. A touch more tactile constraint during the writing beat could push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake is maintained: risking a revision to avert/reshape a planetary mistake. Escalation tightens through agency (unbending the nib enables action; writing sparingly increases risk of shattering relationships; station lurches respond). The felt cost remains primarily internal and procedural, with success ambiguous. Effective, if not punishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motifs (seeds, threshing, unbending) cohere, and the ending reweights meaning toward process over outcome. However, the final line articulates the thesis directly (“meaning wasn’t in the harvest but in the threshing”), tipping into thematic echo/moralizing. Subtext otherwise works through image (empty pen, softened spirals). Strong resonance dulled by explicit statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with consistent focalization; uncertainty is voiced as perception, not exposition. Diction and rhythm vary purposefully with pressure (from quiet calibration to the station’s groan). No head‑hopping, no gratuitous register drift. Slight purple edges are kept legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with multi‑tasking sentences and clean sequencing; images often carry double duty. There’s mild density/ornament (“condensed starlight,” repeated “thresh meaning” motif) that risks redundancy but doesn’t stall momentum. No significant scaffold or loop artifacts. Tighter pruning of repeated abstractions would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nib of neutron‑star matter inscribing gravitational waves via contingent relationships is a fresh, specific synthesis; the “confidently uncertain” stance aligns with the method’s delicacy. The closure image feels earned rather than gimmicky. The risk is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting the ceiling slightly, but the vision reads singular.</comment>
