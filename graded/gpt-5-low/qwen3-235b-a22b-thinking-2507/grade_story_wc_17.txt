<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s obsession and perceptual gift drive concrete choices (opening the diary, handling the negative, deciding to carry the record forward). Interiority is textured—his re-valuation of what walls “dream” reads earned rather than declared. Contradictory impulses (curiosity versus the sorrow he uncovers) are present but lightly rendered rather than dramatized under sharp pressure. Still, the final resolve feels credibly motivated by the scene’s discoveries.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the diaries and film steadily reweight the premise until the closing conceptual repricing—walls dream of redemption when listened to—lands. Orientation is clear early (abandoned university, resonator, scorch marks) and the scene remains continuous. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (shouldering legacy) rather than dramatized as a loss, but it’s legible in Thorne’s shame and Elias’s acceptance of burden. The final “compass” image provides a clean cadence shift with paid pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting work is vivid and selective—the ivy-veiled corridor, soot-bruised beams, desert wind—filtered through a specialist’s gaze. Objects-as-setting (resonator, fireplace hearth, film) meaningfully charge options and the final image. Weather/ruin textures shape tone and discovery rather than feel postcard. Not quite environment-as-constraint at a 9+ level, but it strongly charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Elias convert haunted memory into actionable testimony—tightens as the resonator spikes and the film reframes his quest. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than a high-stress turn; the key narrowing is his acceptance of burden over mere cartography. The price is felt but soft (resolve to carry sorrow, not a visible sacrifice). Still, the turn from lament to resolve is clear and earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars (ashes, strip, soot, resonator hum) rather than abstraction, culminating in a reweighted answer to “what walls dream.” Subtext in images—film as rescued future—does the heavy lifting. A few lines edge into explicit moralizing (“Legacy’s burden wasn’t meant to crush but to compel”), which trims subtlety. Overall resonance remains strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close distance is steady and convincing, with a distinct perceptual signature (sound-centered noticing, material textures). Diction and rhythm are controlled; elevated phrasing matches the character’s vocation and aims. No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful. Voice modulates toward a quiet, charged poise at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely lean for its density; images often do double duty (bruise-like soot, film as compass). Minor redundancy and a touch of purple in places don’t impede clarity or momentum. Syntax varies with scene needs; transitions are smooth. The final cadence is clean and image-led without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “echo cartographer” premise and walls-as-dreamers reframed by a film negative feel fresh, synthesizing climate grief with material memory. Specificities (resonator needles, hearth, silver halide) ground the conceit. The combination reads inevitable in hindsight without gimmickry. Familiar climate-collapse notes appear, but the lens through sound and architecture elevates.</comment>
