<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and character‑particular, and her tactile, professional noticing grounds her. The interiority is embodied (“calloused fingers,” breath fogging) and her loneliness shades choices. However, internal contradiction is light; she solves cleanly without a palpable self‑conflict testing her values. The final stance shift (isolation sweetened by purpose) feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases (numbers, bird rhythms, hopscotch angles) culminating in a triangulation and logged bearing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—perception becomes the map—with a credible plan for tomorrow. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what pressure). The cost is modest but legible in isolation and risk of misreading; the throughline never breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The deck, brass railing, fog, and hopscotch board are vivid and used, not toured; the board functions as a micro‑setting lens that directly constrains tactics. Environmental rules (fog, refracted light, currents) stay consistent and inform action. The antique airship context colors every noticing and charges the final bearing. Minor lyric flourish aside, specificity remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate Solis Aeternus to guide home) is clear, and pressure coheres as the murmurations intensify toward dusk. The meaningful tightening comes via decoding cadence and aligning the board to flight paths. Still, the path to solution is smooth—few obstacles or trade‑offs, and no option foreclosed beyond time and cold. Tension is present but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of perception as discovery and earth/sky reciprocity emerges organically through objects and action. The closing image reweights “stranded luminance” from trap to beacon with quiet emotional payoff. A near‑thesis line (“the next great discovery not of land, but of perception”) edges toward telling. Overall, resonance lingers through image rather than moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature—technical yet tender, befitting an apprentice cartographer. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head‑hopping or register whiplash. Elevated lyric moments feel voice‑motivated by craft and obsession. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and action cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Linecraft is controlled with varied syntax and high information density; images often do double duty (hopscotch as map/lens). Occasional stacked metaphors (“cosmic punctuation,” “scripture”) flirt with excess but remain coherent and don’t blur causality. Minimal redundancy; momentum sustains through the decoding sequence. Mechanics are clean and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hopscotch ciphering starling rhythms to locate a fixed star on an antique airship feels fresh and integrated, not ornamental. The phrasebook dog‑ear as an intertextual nudge is clever and causally active. The revaluation of “stranded luminance” is a non‑obvious synthesis that lands. Risk is taken in the lyrical, scientific‑mystic blend and pays off in coherence.</comment>
