<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear goal and competent agency (water‑flow navigation, using the arrow as resonator), with embodied perception under pressure. Internal contradiction is light; awe and focus dominate without much competing impulse. Micro‑choices are present but low‑risk, so the final stance shift reads more contemplative than hard‑won. Effective, but not yet character‑revealing at a deep level.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: orientation is clear early, the cove/arrow resonance tightens meaning, and closure lands as a conceptual repricing. The decisive act (pressing the tip to the arch) coheres causally with the earlier water‑guided approach. Cost is mostly conceptual/time‑bound (the inversion window), making the ending persuasive but soft. Structure is clean, single scene, with one meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and used functionally: inversion, arches, crystalline sap, and inverted rivers constrain tactics and reveal the cove. Sensory texture is engaged beyond the visual (pressure of silence, thrumming), filtered through a pilot’s priorities. The environment charges the final image via the arch’s memory and water’s flow. Fully integrated without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the source) is legible, with one clear intensification at the cove and the resonator test. Pressure is coherent but gentle: few obstacles beyond time and navigation, and the success carries limited on‑page price. Agency drives the turn, yet consequence remains largely conceptual. Solid deepening, modest escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of resilience as gathered memory emerges organically from water/stone echoes and the arrow’s failure‑turned‑tuning fork. The final paragraph edges into direct thesis (“resilience wasn’t found—it was gathered”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the image chain (inversion → echoes → accelerated growth) sustains resonance. Thematic coherence is strong if a bit declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in a pilot’s sensibility; POV stays stable and confident. Rhythm varies appropriately, tightening around the resonance moment. No head‑hopping or register drift. Elision is minimal and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax and purposeful metaphor; “whirling silence” and “inversion” recur as motifs rather than loops. A few lush lines risk purple but remain clear and propulsive. No notable scaffolding or cadence templates; punctuation and sequencing are clean. The final image resolves without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: gravity inversion as navigational window, water‑guided flight, and echoes as planetary memory feels fresh. The arrow‑as‑resonator reweights a relic into a living tool, avoiding genre cliché. Risk is taken in concept and texture without obscuring clarity. Emotional complexity is moderate, but the vision is distinctive.</comment>
