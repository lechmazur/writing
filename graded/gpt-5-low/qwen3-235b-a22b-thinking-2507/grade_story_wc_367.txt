<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s duty, fear, and stubborn dismissal of omen create credible, contradictory impulses that tighten under storm pressure. Her embodied focus on temperature, angles, and the physical wick grounds interiority in action. The panic at “broken light” and the later conceptual pivot feel earned by prior competence and doubt. Minor safety: the herald is more pressure than relationship, so interpersonal complexity is limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: tending → storm pressure → off-axis blow → scattering → re‑seeing “broken” as amplification → decisive re‑steer. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing of failure into method, with the dawn as concrete outcome. Cost is legible in the near‑catastrophic scatter, white‑hot wick, and frayed focus under pressure. Structure is single scene, clean anchors, and one meaningful tightening at the rogue wave.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, storm, and glass apparatus are tactile and constrain choices—temperature precision, beam angle, and a rogue wave physically disrupt tactics. The emerald glow and rain‑slick surfaces return in the closing image, charging the final cadence. World rules (TIR + “ancient shadows”) are learned through use, not dump. Environment and tool function as setting to shape the decision path.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit and pressured: make dawn or risk lasting gloom. Escalation coheres under storm intensification and the physical jolt that forecloses the initial plan, forcing a reinterpretation. Agency drives the turn—she reframes “broken light” and alters tactics under the same constraints. The price is felt in panic, risk of failure, and the wick pushed to white‑hot limits.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resonant theme of mending through “brokenness” and “shadows” emerges from action and the final reweighting of scattered beams into strength. The “last print newspaper” obits add mortality and duty, not just color. One line edges toward explicit statement (“using brokenness to mend, shadows to illuminate”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the final image refracts the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled third‑person closely held to Elara’s technical and mystical lexicon; rhythm tightens under stress and breathes on resolution. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with the herald’s line carrying subtext and pressure. Repetition of “total internal reflection” risks slight register monotony but fits her craft‑mind. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum; images are vivid and purposeful. Minor redundancy (“total internal reflection,” “ancient shadows”) slightly over‑rings in the middle. Figurative logic holds; no mixed metaphors or scaffolding clutter the climax. Clean mechanics and high information density with pressure‑paced syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of physics (TIR) and mythic dawn‑craft in an emerald lighthouse feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The twist that “broken light” amplifies rather than fails reconfigures the premise organically. The Laughing storm herald is a distinctive pressure, not a stock storm trope. Risks are purposeful and legible without gimmickry.</comment>
