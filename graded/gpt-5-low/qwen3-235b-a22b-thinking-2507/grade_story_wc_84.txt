<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—chasing a “frequency of belonging”—is specific, embodied, and coherently tied to her competence and wartime loss. The trembling at the decisive moment (“Now!”) credibly contradicts her steady pilot’s hands, earning the turn. Micro‑choices (waiting for convergence, aligning chip) reveal values under pressure. The only softness is a near‑tidy emotional landing that minimizes lingering cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid with accumulative dominance: atmospheric density escalates to a causal insertion that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and setup pays off with a timed, stakes‑charged act. Closure lands on the page (astrolabe activating; hum into lullaby) with a conceptual price—she renames herself beyond “drone pilot.” Cost is more interior than external, but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory, fractured astrolabe, star trails, and fading light are vivid and purpose‑driven; environment and tools constrain timing and action. Sensory range is strong (taste of dust, vibration in bones) and filtered through her pilot’s eye. Rules (starlight aligning sockets) are learned via action, not told. Occasional lyric flourish approaches overrichness but remains legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and tightened by the convergence window and missing pieces; the “click” is a decisive narrowing. Pressure coheres from observation → alignment → insertion, with a single meaningful escalation. The price is internal (identity shift, tears), not contested by an antagonist, which keeps the heat modest. Still, the timed insertion functions as a credible high‑pressure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Belonging as frequency emerges through objects and sound, not mere assertion; the final hum/lullaby reweights prior images. The motif set (chip, broken rings, star trails) evolves into thematic answer: she is the missing piece. A single on‑the‑nose line (“This was the frequency of belonging”) trims subtlety. Overall resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single close third is stable, with a distinct observational lexicon shaped by her pilot’s acuity. Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative arrival to clipped urgency at “Now!”. Diction flirts with purple but stays consistent with the lyric frame. No head‑hopping or elision lapses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with solid propulsion and few redundancies. Occasional stacked metaphors and intensifiers (“brilliant dimness,” “air tasted of dust and longing”) risk saturation but rarely blur sense. Syntax varies and the closure image is clean. Minor compression could heighten momentum in the middle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drone pilot meets ancient astrolabe and type‑foundry chip is a fresh synthesis; the star‑trail mechanic and sonic payoff feel distinctive. The conceptual phrasing “frequency of belonging” is familiar, yet re‑embodied through tactile detail and choice. Risks are integrated rather than showy. The turn feels earned and particular to this setup.</comment>
