<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—“to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”—and his choices (reading the tarp, committing to the descent, playing the closing note) align under pressure. Interiority is concrete via tactile anchors (glass flake biting, shale shifting). Internal contradiction is thin—he moves decisively with little hesitation—so complexity feels slightly underdeveloped. Still, actions reveal character with credible cost and urgency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal beats (tarp → descent → discovery) supported by lyric accrual; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual repricing of “amnesty.” Orientation is clear early and the mapping device is taught before use. Cost is legible in risk and in the broken bow’s return as transformed proof. A minor convenience feel remains—the path yields without a true setback—but the cadence tightens effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The environment shapes tactics (wind‑read tarp mapping, hidden ledge, shifting shale) and charges the final image (moss sprouting through the bow). Detail selection reflects the fiddler’s perceptual bias, especially toward materials (collodion, scaffold wrap) and wind. The canyon and pullout aren’t postcard backdrops; they constrain movement and enable discovery. Strong sensory integration without drift into cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—disproving “never” and finding the boy’s path—is clear, and the meaningful tightening occurs when he commits to the mapped descent. Escalation is coherent, but largely frictionless once the code is recognized; the ledge appears and delivers proof without a hard turn. Emotional cost registers, yet physical or moral trade‑off remains modest. The ending’s image reweights stakes more than a high‑stakes confrontation would.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Pixelated amnesty” integrates across object, action, and final image, culminating in moss growing through the broken bow—an earned, non‑literal answer to the central question. Thematic development arises from particulars (glass shard/pixel mapping to forgiven trespasses) rather than thesis statements. Resonance lingers without moralizing, though the titular phrase is repeated a touch often. The reweighting at the end feels inevitable and emotionally clean.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinctive, lyric texture attuned to material detail and wind‑read perception. Diction is elevated yet plausibly filtered through an artist’s mind; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates well into the final charged note. A few repeated constructions and label reuses (“dynamically observant,” “scaffold wrap flutters”) slightly dull the edge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are largely clean and propulsive, doing multiple jobs at once (image, action, theme). Occasional over‑richness and repetition risk purple tint—e.g., iterative “luminous disbelief,” multiple mentions of “scaffold wrap flutters”—but clarity holds. Information density is strong, and the final image is crisp. Minimal scaffolding; no major loops or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of wet‑plate collodion shards, wind‑mapped tarp signals, and a music‑driven quest for “amnesty” feels fresh and specific. The method of decoding landscape via industrial detritus is inventive and character‑true. Risks in tone and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. Small safety in escalation keeps it shy of the truly singular tier.</comment>
