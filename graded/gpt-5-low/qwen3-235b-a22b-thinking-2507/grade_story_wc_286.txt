<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Kaito’s motive (to understand why some places resist change) is clear and consistent, and his micro-choices—aligning the glass, shielding the lavender, placing the river stone, deciding to carry the shard—reveal values under quiet pressure. Interiority is embodied through tactile craft memory and sensation (“thrum” through his bones). The main limitation is low contradiction; his zen steadiness rarely meets friction that forces a harder trade-off. Still, the endurance/renunciation (accepting the wasteland’s persistence) reads earned at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise as “kindness is a kind of light” reweights the site and his task, with the final image of him carrying the warmed shard. Orientation is clean from the start; beats increase in density via the thrum and cross-time overlays. Cost is subtle—he embraces witness over repair, accepting limits while taking on stewardship—but it is legible. The causal thread is secondary, yet the accumulative cadence coheres and lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The oasis, well, brittle sage, withered lavender, and the glass are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered, with the potter’s craft bias shaping notice. The sun’s angle and the shard function as micro-setting constraints, charging tactics (aligning the glass) and the final image. Sensory range (heat, dust, scent, vibration) supports tone without touring. World rules (fractures, phototropism) are learned through action rather than dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can tenderness reconfigure a dead place’s time?—tightens as the thrum intensifies, the lavender manifests, and he chooses offering over intervention. The overlay with the keeper and his river-stone act provide the key deepening. The price (refusal to fix the wasteland; accepting a daily, quiet resistance) is present but softly framed. No hard reversal, but under the accumulative lens the escalation is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: care as phototropic light that can bend time; the shard as vessel; making as ethics. Recurring images (sun patterns, thrum, lavender, the lantern) meaningfully shift at the end when the glass “generates” light. A few lines verge on thesis (“kindness was a kind of light”) which slightly blunts subtext. Nonetheless, the final bow and the warmed shard sustain resonance without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—craft-inflected diction, patient rhythm, and tactile noticing. Distance and tense remain stable; no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Patterned elision (visions across fractures) is taught and legible. Musicality tightens where needed without overornamenting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are controlled and efficient, with a good mix of sentence lengths and strong verbs. “Thrum” repetition reads motif rather than loop, though one or two instances feel redundant. A couple of explicit abstractions risk slight over-telling, but momentum holds. No significant grammatical or sequencing slips; images do multi-task.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-apocalyptic beekeeping oasis, a potter navigating fractured timelines via sun patterns, glass “phototropic to kindness”—feels fresh and internally coherent. The cross-time meeting at the lavender is a memorable, non-obvious turn grounded in prior particulars. Some genre textures are familiar, but the ethical reframing and craft lens elevate. Risk is measured and effective without obscuring clarity.</comment>
