<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s curiosity evolves into an ethically risky choice, moving from observer to participant with credible interior friction (“her own silence… felt suddenly like complicity”). Embodied perception is strong and particular (the lens heavy in her palm; the rain-slicked glass). The action of offering the lens and tickets earns the change without sentimentality. Minor limitation: the cost is social/emotional more than materially risky.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of doodles → decoding via lens → overheard conflict → transparent offering. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s stance changes and the musicians’ bond thaws on-page with felt cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; no causality gaps. The arc is quiet but tightly linked by object and setting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt’s acoustics materially enable the eavesdropping and charge the final image, not just decorate it. Rain, glass, and the projector lens integrate into tactile choices and tone. Spatial and sensory choreography stays coherent and purposeful. The closing peace reflected on wet stones is earned and specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to remain in complicit silence or intervene—tightens when the decoded doodles reveal live mistrust and the forecourt amplifies voices. The decisive act (stepping out, offering items) forecloses her safe anonymity. Cost is subtle but legible; pressure coheres without contrivance. Slightly soft escalation compared to top-tier pieces, but effective for the mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of honesty enacted, not declared: doodles map silences; strap adjustment replaces apology; Elara’s transparency transforms her isolation. Subtext flows through object use and gesture (“returning the light”). A hint of explicitness (“Motivated to thaw mistrust with transparency”) edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut resonance. The final image reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third filters detail through Elara’s sensibility; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext and shifts status credibly. Rhythm modulates with pressure and remains legible. Elevated diction fits the hall’s hush and never slips into false register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with precise, musical imagery; sentences do multiple jobs. A few lush lines skate near purple but remain coherent and scene-advancing. No loops or scaffold drag; the closure image is crisp. Syntax varies and the prose moves.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The projector lens decoding cryptic ticket doodles that chart silence and tension is fresh and integrated. The acoustically reactive forecourt after rain is an inventive constraint. The final “returning the light” turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric tone and concept pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
