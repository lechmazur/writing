<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s interiority is specific (the truth compulsion as embodied pressure) and her micro‑choices under stress (choosing to reveal everything, including the riddle) align with motive and cost. The compulsion meaningfully complicates her interaction with the man, revealing character through action. A slight neatness at the end tilts toward tidy reassurance, shaving edge from her internal conflict. Overall, she reads particular and credible within the scene’s pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Blackout → hive failure → riddle reframed as diagnostic → forced reveal → man runs to fix; the chain is clean, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) with cost via her compulsion and exposure. Orientation is immediate and stable. The final image reweights options without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tower, copper collectors, and the hive infrastructure are vivid and functionally integrated; the core regulator and service entrance tangibly steer action. The lacquer box/matchbox as micro‑setting charges the final image. Sensory detail (“nectar dusk,” wind through copper) supports tone without stalling momentum. World rules stay coherent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the grid or at least catalyzing repair—tightens when the man arrives, forcing Elara’s costly truth. Escalation is modest but coherent under the causal lens, and the turn (her compelled reveal) narrows options and triggers action. The price is primarily social/psychic, not material, limiting peak intensity. Still, the scene earns its shift from paralysis to charged possibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—attention as quiet magic, truth as costly duty—emerges from particulars (the matchbox reinterpreted as diagnostic, her compulsion). However, the line “the truth—and the quiet magic of paying attention—had kept the light alive” edges into stated thesis, diminishing subtext in the final beat. The riddle’s reweighting is strong and almost carries the resonance alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice balances lyric description with clean, functional dialogue; the man’s plain speech contrasts credibly with Elara’s more textured perception. POV is stable and focalization plausible. A single code‑switch (“取出”) jars slightly, and “fault code” risks minor register clash within the lyrical frame, but propulsion and clarity hold.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are generally tight, vivid, and purposeful with solid rhythmic variation. Occasional purple tilt and the stray “取出” create small texture snags; a few phrases echo sentiment already implied. Still, information density is high and imagery serves action rather than piling up. No significant loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—drone beehive as city grid, a grandmother’s matchbox riddle reframed as a diagnostic code, and a truth‑compelled toll keeper—is fresh and coherent. The turn feels inevitable in hindsight once the riddle is reinterpreted. While not radical, it reads distinctive and committed without gimmickry.</comment>
