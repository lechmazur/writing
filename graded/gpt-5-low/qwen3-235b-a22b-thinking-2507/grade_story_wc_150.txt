<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is specific and consistent—restore a fractured faith—and her tactics (patient wandering, deep listening) align with that. Interiority is embodied through tactile observation rather than label-speak. However, conflicting impulses are muted; she rarely faces a live inner contradiction that forces a painful trade-off on the page. The final act reads earned but relatively unopposed emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: wandering accrues pattern and culminates in the gnomon’s click and shadow—a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear and the set-ups (sundial, temple lore, absorbed rhythms) pay off causally. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (diasporic ache, patience) rather than a sharp on-page price, but it’s legible in the elder’s tears and her endurance. The closure image reweights “interrupted time” into continuation convincingly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and particular—roots, bones, damp earth—and the sundial/light function as environmental tools charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s priorities, avoiding tourist catalog. The setting constrains action (search patterns, the root-hidden stone) and thematically mirrors life/death cycles. Strong integration without excess exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling a lost faith) is clear, and pressure tightens through the find-and-fit sequence. Escalation is gentle, accumulating understanding rather than confronting barriers; the primary price paid is time and attentiveness. One meaningful turn occurs at the discovery of the seed-shaped gnomon and the decisive fitting. Still, the conflict lacks a palpable risk or foreclosed path beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of cyclical time, diasporic return, and restoration emerge from concrete acts (purposeful wandering → reassembly → shadow moving). The sundial’s journey from function to fragment to function again reframes “interrupted journeys” without sermonizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—continuation rather than reset—anchored in particulars. Complexity is present, if gently held.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>PoV is steady and close, with a controlled, lyrical texture that matches Elara’s attentiveness. Kael’s brief dialogue feels natural and understated, adding history without expository drag. Rhythm modulates well at the closing “click” and shadow movement. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image-dense, and mostly economical; lines often do multiple jobs (setting, theme, and character at once). Occasional lushness skirts purple but stays coherent and purposeful. No evident loops or template cadence, and the final sentence lands strongly. Momentum remains intact despite reflective density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and diaspora-sundial linkage feel fresh and integrated rather than ornamental. The “purposeful wandering” method risks quietness but yields a specific, memorable synthesis. The closing repricing of time as continuation is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Strong originality without gimmickry.</comment>
