<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Leo’s motivation is clear and consistent—save the ferry by merging timelines—and his competence under pressure is convincing. Interiority surfaces in tactile ways (trembling hands, tuning by starlight), but inner contradiction is minimal; he rarely falters or doubts. The relationship pressure with Captain Mara functions as operational coordination more than a crucible, keeping emotional complexity modest. The ending’s endurance stance (he stays, work continues) reads as earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages are clean: pattern recognition → horn triplets → lattice → hourglass capture → ferry reforms. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a conceptual price (he remains in the grotto, vigilance ongoing), though the cost is light. Orientation is firm from the outset and the throughline never breaks, but the solution comes without a meaningful setback.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and its time‑skewing clocks are vivid and functionally integrated—starlight reflections dictate radio settings, and the grotto as nexus constrains tactics. The hourglass as micro‑setting/tool charges the final image. Sensory selection and rule‑learning occur through action rather than exposition. Minor over‑ornamentation appears, but not enough to blunt clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (ferry reconstitution) and pressure coheres as the window closes; the horn sequence and lattice provide one solid tightening. Escalation is largely smooth rather than teethy—Leo never loses a tool or suffers a failed attempt. Agency drives the resolution, but the visible price is modest, capping intensity. Tension works across beats without a pronounced reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interconnection, duty within liminality, and constructive hope accrue through concrete motifs (patterns, starlight, hourglass). The final endurance image reframes “emptiness” as potential, offering a quiet repricing. However, a few lines edge toward on‑the‑nose thesis (“Always look for the connections”), trimming subtlety. Resonance lingers but avoids deeper moral friction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady and textured, with controlled lyricism matching Leo’s perceptual habits (professional attention to signals/patterns). Dialogue is functional, brisk, and goal‑driven without stiffness. Diction stays largely within an apt register, and psychic distance remains consistent. Minor elevated flourishes ride the edge but remain legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and propulsive; sentences pull multiple weights (world rule + action). Occasional purple phrasing and repeated motif statements threaten density but rarely stall momentum. Rhythm varies and information is efficiently stacked; no major loops or muddled metaphors at the climax. The final image lands clearly without syntactic haze.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ferry commute realism with a starlit temporal nexus and signal‑pattern solution feels fresh and character‑specific. The hourglass‑as‑gap and horn‑lattice mechanic are inventive without feeling gimmicky. While the conflict resolves a touch easily, the “permanent transient” stance gives the piece a distinct signature. Risk‑taking is confident and coherent.</comment>
