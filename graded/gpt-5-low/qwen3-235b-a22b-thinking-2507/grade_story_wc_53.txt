<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—gather 100 sorrow‑fragments to negotiate with her own ghost—is specific, persistent, and drives every choice. Interiority is embodied (“cold wire” of regret; the crunch of glassy silt), with credible contradiction between resolve and erosion. The final renunciation—offering the fragments as apology and accepting silence—reads as an Earned Stasis with visible cost. Minor limitation: “chronologically confused” appears more as texture than a live constraint on her peak choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the count toward 100 and the ritual’s rules escalate pressure to the center‑lagoon negotiation. Closure lands cleanly with cost when the ghost dissolves and Elara exits with “hollow certainty,” reweighting “It only stops if you look away.” Orientation is solid early (who/where/what happened). The cause chain is coherent: fragments → ritual → encounter → refusal/silence; no contrivances.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above the clouds, the halted carousel, and disposable camera detritus are tactile and rule‑bound, learned through use. The environment constrains tactics (scavenging in shallows, ritual at the center) and charges the final mirrored image. Sensory specificity is purposeful and POV‑filtered; objects evolve (wheel shards gain meaning). World rules stay consistent and amplify theme without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reclaim or reckon with her earlier self/ambition. Pressure tightens via the fragment count (98 → 99 → 100) and the move to the center—one decisive cadence shift. The cost is unmistakable: she offers the fragments and receives silence, foreclosing a path. Slight softness: external counter‑pressure is mostly atmospheric rather than adversarial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of attention vs. erasure, survival vs. art, and the price of looking away emerge from particulars (film strips of regrets, “traded my song for safety”). The refrain “It only stops if you look away” recontextualizes the carousel and her career choices without sliding into moralizing. The final image earns a melancholic repricing of permanence and loss. A hair shy of transcendent because the aphorism edges close to stated thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent, sensuous, and filtered through Elara’s perception; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. No head‑hopping; psychic distance is controlled and tight. The single quoted line from the ghost functions as charged action, not exposition. Elision patterns (memory shards, overlaps of time) are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet largely clean, with varied syntax and high information per line; images work double duty (film as sorrow, lagoon as memory). Minor risk of purple density is managed; few redundancies and no muddled metaphors in the peak beats. Momentum holds through accumulation to the center‑ritual. Closing cadence is sharp and unencumbered by scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—an above‑clouds lagoon that materializes overheard regrets as salvageable fragments from a halted carousel—is striking and coherent. The disposable camera wheel as memory engine is a fresh, integrated device; the ritual count adds elegant pressure. The conceptual turn (attention as motion; looking away as cessation) feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold concept remains character‑driven, not gimmickry.</comment>
