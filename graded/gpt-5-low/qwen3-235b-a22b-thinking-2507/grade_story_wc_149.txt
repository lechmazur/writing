<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Silas’s caretaking and the ghost bride’s debt‑driven purpose are clear, with embodied reactions (fogged breath, raw voice) grounding feeling. The ghost’s paradox—healing that harms—gives her motivation specificity. However, Silas remains largely reactive; few micro‑choices under pressure limit layered contradiction. The relationship dynamic is poignant but offers limited on‑page negotiation beyond his plea to stop.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the opening: winter fields, greenhouse, Silas, and the ghost’s pattern. The causal chain is strong: threat to heartseed trees → ghost deploys bead → orchard saved at the cost of her dissolution. Closure lands on the page with cost (“Debt repaid” and her vanishing), cleanly under a hybrid/causal lens. Minor soft spot: protagonist agency is secondary to the ghost’s decisive act, but the structure still coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse and “endless night” are sensorial, purposeful, and pressure the action (frost, resonance starvation). The carved bead and heartseed tree function as charged micro‑settings that constrain choices and shape the final image. Details are integrated through action rather than catalogued. Atmosphere and world rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the orchard) is early and focused; escalation crystallizes with the heartseed crisis and the ghost’s thinning form. The price is unmistakable: her dissolution is the cost of revival. Agency resides chiefly with the ghost, yet Silas’s resistance and grief give the conflict relational tension. The tightening is singular but sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of restitution, paradoxical care, and the cost of repair emerge organically from the bead’s “lovingly venomous” awakenings. The final image (inert bead in his palm; life thrumming) reweights guilt and grace without moralizing. One explicit line (“The debt requires both healing and harm”) edges toward telling, but it’s earned by action. Ambiguity lingers productively around forgiveness versus balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady and sensorially confident, with diction suiting a caretaker of an alchemical orchard. Lyricism modulates under stress (the chord, the plea, the hush) without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and subtextual. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical, with images doing multiple jobs (ash and starlight; liquid gold racing roots). The rhythm breathes and tightens at the climax; lines rarely repeat scaffolding or drift into vagueness. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains coherent and scene‑bound. Grammar and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—an alchemical orchard in perpetual night, a resonant bead, and a ghost bride repaying a karmic debt—feels fresh and internally coherent. The “healing that harms” mechanic reframes familiar sacrifice tropes with specificity. Turns are grounded in established rules rather than late conveniences. It’s bold without gimmickry, with a distinct emotional truth.</comment>
