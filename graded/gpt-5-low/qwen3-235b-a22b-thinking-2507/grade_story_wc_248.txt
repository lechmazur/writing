<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserving knowledge at personal cost—is clear and consistent, with the arsonist/guardian tension giving her a credible inner contradiction. Embodied details (“volcanic tenderness,” the charcoal stick, ash) keep emotions grounded. The final renunciation—choosing secrecy—earns its weight. A few declarative self-positionings (“She wasn’t a criminal; she was a guardian.”) flatten nuance slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal spine: clue → chamber → blank scroll → choice to become keeper. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—she redefines “rescue” as secrecy, with the cost of continued misrecognition. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the throughline holds. Minor ease in puzzle-solving slightly reduces pressure but does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The jungle heat, sulfur, ash, and volcanic rock are vivid and purposeful; setting informs tactics (ash-veil, sealing the entrance) and charges the ending image. Objects like the tapestry, charcoal, and murals recur with increasing meaning. Specific sensory choices track her priorities rather than touring the space. A touch more constraint from the environment under strain could further elevate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue the promise—tightens as the clues compress toward the blank scroll and the decision to keep the archive hidden. The on-page price is isolation and being misnamed an arsonist; it’s legible if quiet. Escalation is more procedural than pressurized; the puzzles present little resistance. The final choice is earned but arrives without a hard external push.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The preservation-through-destruction paradox resonates, and images (serpent-swallowed constellation, blank scroll, ash veil) carry thematic weight. However, explicit thesis statements (“She wasn’t a criminal; she was a guardian.” and the concluding declaratives) nudge into moralizing, dulling subtext. The final repricing—meaning over location—lands. A subtler last paragraph would deepen afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual biases, with consistent distance and tense. Rhythmic variation supports discovery and the quiet climax. Occasional label-y phrases (“analytically intuitive,” “vessel for tenderness”) skim the edge of abstraction but the line-by-line sensuousness steadies it. No head-hopping or stance confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean sentences with good propulsion and efficient detail; several lines do double duty (world + psyche). A few mild redundancies and slogan-like formulations flirt with purple but don’t blur sense. The closure image is crisp (charcoal map to meaning, ash veil). Slight trimming of restatements would sharpen momentum further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Guardian-as-arsonist” reframed within a puzzle-vault of vandalized art feels fresh, especially the coordinates encoded in gouges and the ash-as-veil. The final shift—from location to meaning—offers a non-obvious turn that fits the premise. The lost-civilization frame is familiar, but the tonal coinage (“volcanic tenderness”) and artistic logic personalize it. More risk in the obstacle design could raise distinctiveness.</comment>
