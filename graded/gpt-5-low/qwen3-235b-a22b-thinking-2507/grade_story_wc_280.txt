<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—mend one shard before demolition—drives each choice, and her synesthetic interiority yields concrete, character‑particular perception. Her decisive act (choosing to save the boy rather than herself) aligns with the established values and reveals a credible hierarchy under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but subtle: she balances desperation with tenderness, hope with the acceptance she can’t fix everything. The felt afterstate (nostalgia replacing crushing failure) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal spine: worklight → scent → hidden orchard → coin → woven echo → intervention → charged token. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she cannot repair the catastrophe yet salvages one life, and the theater’s demolition persists. The coin’s pearl gives on‑page proof of change and price. Orientation is early and clean; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard and hedge maze are vividly rendered through multisensory detail and POV filter, and they constrain options by supplying the coin and the serenity needed to weave echoes. The environment actively guides movement (bioluminescent walls) and charges the final image via the garden’s “quiet magic.” The coin as micro‑setting/tool anchors the closure. Specificity is lush yet purposeful, mirroring Elara’s sensoria.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit early: salvage a possibility before dawn’s demolition. Pressure tightens as reflection becomes tactical action—she must choose where to direct the echo and pays by accepting the larger loss while saving the boy. The decisive push is agency‑driven and creates a meaningful change with lingering consequence (pearl on the coin). Escalation is elegant rather than explosive, but coherent and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of limited repair, earned hope, and art’s afterlife emerge through particulars (tarot coin, saved tear becoming a pearl) rather than stated morals. The ending reweights the premise: mending doesn’t erase loss but seeds a new possibility within fracture. Ambiguity is meaningful—she remains unmoored, the theater falls, yet the echo endures. The resonance lingers without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature (synesthetic cross‑sensory mapping) remains stable and apt. Diction modulates with pressure—lush in the garden, taut in the intervention—without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision supports cadence, not concealment. The final chime lands cleanly through voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet largely efficient; images do double duty (e.g., “painted roots seeming to burrow into her skin” enacts both magic and commitment). A few stacked modifiers flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially across the action overlay. Sentence rhythm varies, and the final image is crisp. No significant loops or scaffolding dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—stage ghost, secret orchard, tarot coin, synesthetic time‑weaving—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “echo” method transforms a familiar rescue beat into a precise moral calculus (save one without undoing tragedy). Risks (lyric density, hybrid lens) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The pearl‑tear reconfiguration gives a memorable, singular stamp.</comment>
