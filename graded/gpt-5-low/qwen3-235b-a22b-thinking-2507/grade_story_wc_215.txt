<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—guarding the unspoken—reads clear and consistent, and his renunciation at the end (choosing to listen, not speak) feels earned. Interiority is specific to his perceptual habits (reading chips and splinters as history). However, internal contradiction is light; curiosity vs duty never truly bites, keeping tension modest. The ghost child’s cue catalyzes him, but his emotional struggle remains mostly serene rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from daily vigil to charged recommitment via the child’s sign and the dew-honeycomb. Orientation is clean, single scene, single stake. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he forecloses speech and assumes keeperhood with felt conceptual cost. A sharper on‑page consequence could have pushed this higher, but the cadence shift is undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The scorched beekeeping oasis, shattered hives, and the stubborn shed are vivid and purpose‑driven; the box as object‑setting charges every beat and the final image. Environmental rules (ghosts avoid the shed; covenant woven into land) remain consistent and inform choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Silas’s vocation‑bias. It constrains action without becoming mere postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—tightens when the ghost child inscribes the “remember” sigil and the dew honeycomb appears, transforming passive guardianship into a chosen vow. The cost is his continued silence and isolation, reframed as duty. Escalation is quiet and coherent under the accumulative lens, though largely internal and without a visible loss beyond renunciation. One bolder test (e.g., temptation to open the box) could have heightened pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: silence as stewardship, covenantal memory, and the ethics of holding unsaid words. Recurring images (bees, glass, ash, honeycomb) reweight the final stance without overt moralizing. A few sentences verge on stating theme directly (“They were not trapped; they were messengers”), slightly thinning subtext. Still, the final charged stillness answers the core question with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent close third with lyrical control and a distinct perceptual signature (reading fractures as history). Diction suits the meditative tone and never breaks POV modesty. No dialogue needed; silence is the action. Occasional flourish edges toward ornament, but cadence remains controlled and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is confident and image‑dense with generally clean syntax and momentum. Some lines cluster metaphors (“trapped fire,” “tangled covenant,” “mute eloquence”) risking purple, but clarity survives and images earn their keep. Minimal redundancy and solid paragraph rhythm. A leaner pass could heighten pressure and shave ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ghosts, bees, and a stained‑glass reliquary for unspoken words make a fresh, coherent synthesis. The quiet reconfiguration at the end feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, near‑mythic register) mostly pay off. A more idiosyncratic contradiction or cost could push it toward exceptional.</comment>
