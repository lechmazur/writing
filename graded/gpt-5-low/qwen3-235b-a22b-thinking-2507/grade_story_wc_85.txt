<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silas’s motive is clear and particular—atonement through truth—and his internal conflict (professional self‑justification versus belated accountability) breaks on the watch‑hand reveal. Embodied emotion lands (“sharp edge biting into his skin”) and aligns with action. The ending renunciation is earned and carries visible cost. Slight convenience in his retroactive “remembering” tempers peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: sifting → discovery of the watch hand → recovered context → self‑indictment → vow. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the cost is legible in the final image. Orientation is crisp from the first lines. The coincidence of finding that exact shard presses plausibility but serves the causal turn without undercutting it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and shore are sensorially vivid and integrated with action; the driftwood practice is a lived micro‑setting. The watch hand functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image and constraining the choice. Atmosphere and environment mirror inner weather without feeling over‑signaled. Scale and specificity are proportionate to the narrative’s stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake—learning the truth and facing complicity—with a meaningful tightening at the watch‑hand reveal. The emotional price is explicit, and the renunciation forecloses a path. Escalation is primarily internal but remains tense and purposeful. A lightly convenient memory snap slightly softens the turn’s rigor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Complicity, revisionist memory, and the ethics of erasure emerge through concrete particulars, not thesis. The recurring “sieved hush” and the watch hand reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer—no more falsehoods—anchored in cost. Ambiguity about Elara’s fate supports, not muddies, the theme.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A consistent, controlled lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and cadence suit Silas’s haunted precision. No head‑hopping or stance slips; free‑indirect texture is steady. Elevated language remains motivated by character and mood. Minor risk of purple flourish is managed by clear narrative focus.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean, rhythmic, and information‑dense, with purposeful imagery that carries plot and theme. Repetition (“sieved hush”) works as motif rather than padding. A few lush descriptors skirt the edge of excess but do not blur sense or momentum. Syntax varies and lands emphases at key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—black market genealogist who fabricates lineage and memory—feels fresh, and the driftwood‑sifting method and watch‑hand clue are striking. The turn that his craft likely armed the harm is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and motif pay off without gimmickry. The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
