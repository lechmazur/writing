<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, rooted motivation (reclaiming a battlefield through a garden) with embodied grief and endurance; choices (seed scattering, replying in dead tongues) align with his values. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—sorrow versus hope—without a sharp in‑scene clash. Micro‑choices under pressure (trusting birds’ signals, crushing pods) reveal a principled, ritual mindset. A felt cost exists (war memory, patience), though a sharper internal rub would elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned listening → birds’ responses → incremental planting culminates in a charged poise ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the final seed pour and planned return reframes loss into a binding vow, with conceptual cost tied to the dead reef and long labor. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks. Cost is more conceptual than immediate, keeping this shy of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and pressure‑bearing: the jetty’s narrowness, dead reef, and specific species guide tactics (where to plant, what’s viable). Environmental details (soil patch near pilings, shell fragments) directly shape action and charge the final image. Sensory texture and world rules stay consistent through the ritual. The place is not postcard static; it’s a partner in problem‑solving.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens via the birds’ escalating cooperation and the final vow. Pressure grows through density and pattern rather than direct opposition; no real antagonist, but the dead reef and barren soil function as constraints. The felt price is patience and commitment, not a hard sacrifice. A single sharper complication would raise the turn’s force.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of restoration over monument, language bridging species/time, and translating water‑harmony to land accrue through concrete acts. The “submerged concord” reweights into a land‑born concord at the end without moralizing. Symbols (seed pods, shells, jetty) work in scene, not as labels. Resonance lingers, though ambiguity remains comfortably navigable rather than bracing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent, lyric third‑person closely held to Elias, with a confident, sea‑salted diction that matches his history and ritual. The dead‑language replies feel purposeful and active, not ornamental. Rhythm modulates well, with compressed beats at calls and broader sentences in remembrance. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs without scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is mostly clean and integrated (“narrow vastness,” “submerged concord”) with minimal purple. Sentence rhythm varies, propelling the ritual while allowing breath. Final line resolves by image and vow, not summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fertilizing by decoding bird calls in dead languages against a war‑killed reef is striking and specific. The synthesis feels inevitable by the end: sea’s lost harmony → birds as translators → land as new concord. Risks (mythic diction, invented tongues) pay off without confusion. A touch more friction would push it into rarer air.</comment>
