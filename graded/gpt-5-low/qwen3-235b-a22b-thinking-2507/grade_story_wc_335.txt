<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives (win readmission by redeeming a trapped shadow) are clear and embodied in specific behaviors (backward pacing, shard handling), with a credible contradiction in her combative tenderness toward Kael. The mentoring relationship functions as a crucible, producing his insight that forces her shift. Her change—stopping the backward retreat and annotating with his words—feels earned. Minor neatness in the speed of her emotional pivot keeps it shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: the dusk deadline, tea‑leaf geometry, and Kael’s crack insight chain into a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on page when she redirects from the shadow to the fracture, stops walking backward, and annotates with cost (acknowledging past failure). Orientation is clean early, and the lens holds through the final charged image. The cost is conceptual/emotional but undeniable and tied to the central stake.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The forgotten library is tactile and functional: ladder for the crack discovery, loose floorboard and scrolls shaping movement, window framing the swing as a live clock. Recurring objects (shard, swing, tea, quill) charge the final image. Environmental pressure subtly constrains choices and pace. Sensory specificity is purposeful and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (annotate before dusk to prove exile is reversible). Escalation tightens through the triangle reading to the emotional spike, then flips with Kael’s revision to focus on the crack. The cost is accepting her misfocus and yielding epistemic authority to the mentee. Slight softness: the deadline pressure stays atmospheric rather than directly constraining the last move.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of exile/mending, redemption through repair, and mentorship’s hard tenderness arise from concrete images (crack vs. shadow, triangle, swing slowing). The final repricing—repair the fracture, not rewind time—lands without moralizing. A couple of explicit lines (“Reversible exile wasn’t just theory…”) edge toward telling but do not derail subtext. Resonance lingers via the warmed shard and the halted backward motion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically precise yet grounded in Elara’s perceptual signature; dialogue distinguishes Elara’s serrated care from Kael’s rough defiance. Modulation under pressure is controlled, and focalization stays tight. No head‑hopping or register drift. Lines function as action, especially the “crack vs. shadow” exchange.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with clean rhythm; images do more than one job (triangle as geometry and loss). Figurative language is vivid but coherent and integrated with action. Minimal scaffolding or loops, and syntax varies to support momentum. A few lush phrases approach saturation but remain clear at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Shard‑mirror archivist lore, tea‑leaf geometry as method, and “reversible exile” are fresh and organically fused to character and stakes. The mentor dynamic rendered as combative tenderness feels specific rather than templated. The turn from shadow to crack is both non‑obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
