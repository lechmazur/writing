<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear and escalate—from vigilant duty to a personal imperative to break inherited silence. Her embodied choices (descending the mud, prying the tin, accepting tears) reveal a textured interior. The contradiction between guarding and revealing resolves credibly into a costly vow. No false epiphany; the photos earn the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: receding water → shard/label → remembered instruction → hearthstone tin → revelation → decision. Orientation is firm early and held; single‑POV continuity stays tight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with discernible emotional cost. The hearthstone clue verges on neat but is pre‑motivated by Silas’s words, preserving plausibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purpose‑driven: mud, lantern, and hush shape movement and perception; the lowering reservoir materially enables the search. Recurring objects (chimes, shard) charge the final image. The world feels consistent and tactile, with sensory breadth beyond the visual. The environment both constrains and culminates the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: whether to exhume and share Cedar Bend’s full story. Escalation is a deepening of cost via discovery rather than reversals, appropriate to length and lens. The final stance forecloses continued silence, with the price of grief and communal exposure felt. Stakes remain intimate yet tangible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, selective storytelling, and communal duty arise from images and choices, not just assertion. The sapphire shard and resurfacing town shift meaning by the end, tying joy and sorrow. One line edges toward stating the moral, slightly softening ambiguity. Nonetheless the emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is steady, sensorial, and filtered through Elara’s professional and familial bias. Rhythm and diction modulate with the scene’s hush without overexplanation. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elision is minimal and purposeful. Elevated phrasing fits the tone and never outruns POV credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet evocative, with strong verbs and purposeful imagery; most lines carry multiple jobs. Minor purple notes (“midnight bled,” “precisely humane”) flirt with over‑ornament but don’t stall momentum or blur sense. Sentence variety and cadence support propulsion. No notable loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drowned‑town premise is familiar, but the levee warden lens, the sapphire label, and the “precisely humane” inheritance give it fresh specificity. The photo‑trail method grounds the reveal without gimmickry. It’s not radically novel, yet it feels authentic and integrated. The final reweighting is earned rather than clever.</comment>
