<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and profession are crisply defined, and her inner tension between “assuring” and “chasing ghosts” drives the pivotal breach of procedure. Embodied reactions (the earpiece’s warmth, the mist, the thrum) anchor her choices. However, her competence faces little pushback or cost beyond urgency, so the arc reads slightly tidy. Lily and the mother serve as pressure but do not substantially complicate Elara’s decisions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: faint pulses → bench → photograph → pointed finger → structural flaw → evacuation; the blueprint knowledge and caretaker recognition reinforce plausibility. Closure is on‑page with a decisive change (evacuation before collapse) and a charged final handoff of the photo. The cost is mostly conceptual and reputational rather than materially felt, limiting peak impact. Orientation is immediate and stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mist‑clad atrium, weeping willow, and cold bench integrate with action, while the north wall’s decay directly constrains stakes and tactics. The hearing aid as tool within the setting sharpens specificity; moisture, stone, and veiling branches shape searches and urgency. Environmental detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The final image is charged by place, though a hair more tactile constraint at the climax could push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing imminent collapse harm) tightens from eerie whispers to a concrete, time‑sensitive threat. Elara’s choice to abandon standard reassurance for decisive action escalates pressure credibly. The visible price is moderate (risking credibility and precipitate evacuation) rather than deeply sacrificial. Still, tension scales across sentence and scene beats to a functional peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of listening to vulnerable voices and love as protective force emerge through concrete events (the photo’s pointing finger, the caregiver husband recognizing posture). Subtext in “contact tracer for hearts” versus actual lifesaving reframes the vocation. The final line edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly flattening resonance. Nevertheless, the reweighted photograph provides a strong thematic anchor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident, with a lyrical yet controlled diction that suits Elara’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, advancing stakes without expository drag. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure, particularly around the sprint and evacuation. Occasional elevated metaphors nibble at naturalism but don’t break voice cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with efficient images (“pendulum judges,” “cobwebs against skin”), generally balancing clarity and atmosphere. Minimal scaffold or redundancy; sentences carry multiple jobs without bloat. A few purple flourishes risk saturation but stop short of muddling action. Copy and sequence remain clean through the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” using a decades‑old hearing aid to decode residual emotion feels fresh, and the photograph’s directional cue to a structural hazard is a non‑obvious, satisfying turn. The heroism arises incidentally from method and empathy rather than tropey bravado. The synthesis is distinctive and coherent, though the resolution’s costs remain relatively safe. Still, the concept commits and pays off with specificity.</comment>
