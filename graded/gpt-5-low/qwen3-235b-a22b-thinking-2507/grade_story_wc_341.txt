<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority ties vocation to grief; her choice to ignore oxygen to secure proof is credible and costly. Contradictory impulses (survival vs. vindication/connection) operate simultaneously in scene. Small moves—the telescope’s focus ring, the decision not to retrieve it—reveal priorities under pressure. Slight sentimentality in the epilogue softens edge but doesn’t undercut motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure coheres from drift → anomaly → spiral revelation → oxygen warnings → charged final image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: proof secured at personal risk, reweighting “emptiness” with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and no causal seams break the frame. The rescue-at-dawn coda risks dilution but functions as afterglow, not resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The gondola’s altitude, the broken string, oxygen console, and telescope act as lived constraints, not wallpaper. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (“dusty starlight,” brass warmth, creak like bones). The telescope and condensation charge the final image. World logic is consistent within its lyrical speculation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and tightens: discovery escalates to recognition (spiral), then to risk (oxygen warnings) as she chooses proof over safety. Agency is attention/endurance with a felt price. One decisive deepening suffices at this length. The later museum/pilot reports are garnish; the core pressure crystallizes earlier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Core theme—memory held in apparent voids—emerges through action and recurring objects, culminating in “Altocumulus paternalis.” However, explicit thesis lines (“We are never truly gone,” “Empty spaces didn’t just remember; they honored.”) tilt toward moralizing. Subtext is strong in images (condensed lens as sky’s tears) but occasionally overstated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent lyrical voice with a scientist’s perceptual bias; diction balances technical and numinous. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure without losing clarity. A few high-register declarations verge on purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs and propel momentum; images recur with intention. Some density/purple pressure (“quietly explosive,” “spooled wholeness,” “ancient luminescence”) clusters, risking overrichness. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep causality clear. Final image lands without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Conceptual synthesis feels fresh: emotional meteorology, “spooled wholeness,” and a sky gondola bound by a broken tether. The lenticular spiral reweights the personal and scientific in a non-obvious, inevitable-feeling turn. Risks (lyric science, mythic coda) largely pay off. Only minor sentimentality curbs further lift.</comment>
