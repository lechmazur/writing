<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained—she comes to locate and save unused love—and her actions consistently align with that drive. Interiority is sensorial and embodied (lilacs, tear‑stained paper), though contradictory impulses are limited; she rarely hesitates beyond the brief incubation pause. The final choice to carry the love within herself reads as an earned endurance with a conceptual cost. A sharper on‑page tug between personal risk and mission would have deepened complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid lens: accumulative lyric texture with a causal spine—film threaded → psychometry → clue → coordinates → descent → transfer—culminates in a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the demolition clock coherently pressures tactics. Closure lands: she transfers and leaves, bearing a burden as the theater will fall; the cost is legible though primarily conceptual/emotional. A single concrete impediment during the descent could have further tightened causality and price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The projection booth, projector beam, spliced film, and inter‑frame “black space” are integrated as both world and mechanism, directly constraining discovery and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true (dust, decaying celluloid), with the tool (projector) functioning as conduit. The building’s imminent demolition charges the setting with time pressure. Minor: a few atmospheric lines verge on declarative symbolism but remain grounded by use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save the unused love before demolition—tightens through the discovery of coordinates and the dawn deadline. The meaningful turn is the on‑page clue (“where the projector’s light never fades”) forcing a tactical shift downstairs. The price is chiefly internal (carrying the love) rather than an immediate loss or trade‑off, keeping escalation strong but not blistering. One more tangible obstacle would have amplified pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motifs (interstitial spaces, forgotten lyrics, light vs. gaps) accrue toward a resonant answer: love kept alive in memory and charged absence. The sonic key and crystal reprise the theme without feeling token. However, the line “The crystal gazer had found where unused love is stored: in the act of remembering...” edges into thesis‑telling, slightly flattening subtext at closure. The piece mostly earns its insights through image; trimming the explicit moral would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice has a distinct, tactile lexicon that matches Elara’s sensibility, and psychic‑distance shifts are controlled. Cadence modulates well between ritual stillness and urgent movement. No dialogue needed; the interior texture carries action. A few elevated formulations flirt with abstraction, but the perceptual signature remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is clean and propulsive with effective sensory economy; several sentences do double duty for mood and plot. Minor redundancy and one small typo (“psychomy”) slightly distract. Figurative language stays consistent to film/light/space, rarely overstacking. The final third maintains clarity without purple smear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Storing unused love in inter‑frame gaps accessed by a projector and stabilized by a half‑remembered song is a fresh synthesis. The psychometry + cinema apparatus feels purposeful rather than quirky. Risks are taken with lyric logic and they cohere; the crystal transfer reweights prior images. Slight thematic explicitness prevents a higher band, but the conceptual ingenuity is memorable.</comment>
