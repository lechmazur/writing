<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Kaela’s desire to protect the truth and learn why “some people echo” is clear and consistent, and her embodied perceptions (rock vibrations, shell hum) ground her interiority. The fear/resolve tension is credible, especially when Renn warns and she chooses to sing anyway. The relationship functions as pressure, not comfort, sharpening her choice. The final commitment reads earned with a visible risk cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single scene, clear anchors, and a coherent progression: meeting → revelation (gene) → tactic (progressive disclosure) → commitment despite warning. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she forecloses safety by deciding to sing only a fragment, with cost made legible by surveillance danger. The causal thread holds; new knowledge (gene/twin shell with Elara) tightens options. Stakes remain focused on survival of truth and her brother’s fate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The canyon’s acoustics, sandstone, and star‑lighted “serpentine nexus” are vivid and character‑filtered, and the seashell functions as a micro‑setting tool. The environment informs tactics (listening for watchers; choosing Dawn Cleft/Moon Arch) and charges the final image. World rules (echo, resonance) are learned through action rather than dumped. Rich atmosphere supports theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure tightens with the gene revelation, the guarded twin shell, and Renn’s warning that “they’ll come,” forcing Kaela to adopt a risk‑managed tactic (first verse only). The dominant stake—truth vs. suppression—stays coherent and escalates into an on‑page stance. Cost is implied but credible; we feel the danger of exposure. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice vs. silence, truth vs. control, and bloodline as “curse/bridge” emerge from concrete beats, not sermon. The lullaby/echo motif shifts from memory to insurgent method, reweighting the ending. Renn’s exposition edges close to thematic stating, but the final image (“She would sing. And the canyon would answer.”) earns resonance. Ambiguity around the spirits and the Council’s motives leaves productive space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Kaela’s perceptions; no head‑hopping. Dialogue advances plot with subtext (Renn’s fear vs. Kaela’s resolve) and distinct rhythms. Elevated diction matches the world; a slight register bump (“progressive disclosure”) jars but doesn’t break voice. Psychic distance modulates well under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence music is strong and images are largely precise; sensory density serves momentum. Minor purple edges and a few abstraction labels (“progressive disclosure” repeated) create small tonal friction. No major loops or scaffold; lines generally do more than one job. The closing cadence is clean and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The echo‑singer/council premise, the gene‑mapped twin shell, and insurgent lullaby tactic feel freshly synthesized. Risks (quiet rebellion through fragments) align with theme and setting rather than gimmickry. The conspiracy frame is familiar but reanimated by tactile specifics and the canyon’s cosmology. The final stance clicks with what’s been seeded.</comment>
