<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserve the last luminous vow—is clear and expressed through concrete, meticulous actions under time pressure. Her competence is particularized (precise alignment, balancing grief/resolve) and her nerves register physically, though internal contradiction is modest. The micro‑choices (increasing sensitivity, adjusting angle, prioritizing core truth) reveal values and stakes. Emotional cost is felt, if quietly, in the acceptance of a tomb‑like vocation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single‑scene structure is clean, orientation is immediate, and the accumulative pressure coheres: illusions fade, instrument calibrations intensify, and the vow’s capture culminates in sealing the data. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: from tomb to a “quiet pulse of hope,” with the cryo‑vial as priced seed. Cost is legible in the vanishing world and the risk of mismeasurement tied to a predecessor’s failure. A hair soft on a decisive external turn, but cadence and stakes tighten effectively under the textural lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The frozen library above the clouds, the quartz hush, and ice‑glass windows are not decorative; they shape attention, constrain tactics (misalignment risks fracture), and charge the ending image. Tools (sampler, prisms, slide) are integrated as micro‑setting that governs choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered with occupational precision. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the vow before the illusion fades—is present early and tightens via the live clock and the risk of turning meaning to static. Escalation comes through agency: isolating bands, compensating angles, and balancing grief/resolve frequencies. The felt price is largely conceptual/endurance rather than a harsh loss, but it suffices at this length. The predecessor’s failure underlines the costs and heightens pressure credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Memory versus oblivion, and promise as measurable light, emerge through particulars (741 Hz as “promise,” grief/resolve harmonics) rather than thesis. The final seed of hope reframes the tomb‑library and resonates without moralizing. One line edges toward told theme (“This number was not just data; it was the vow’s soul”) but the surrounding scene earns it. Ambiguity remains purposeful: preservation as vow renewed, not victory declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is steady, with a distinct technical‑poetic lexicon befitting an archivist of light. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to faint whine to sealing), and focalization stays tight to Elara’s perceptions. No dialogue, but the narrative stance holds confidence without omniscient leakage. Elevated diction is consistent and voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is polished, with strong verbs and purposeful imagery; tools and actions do multiple jobs per line. Occasional density verges on purple, but metaphors remain coherent to the light/memory motif. Minimal redundancy and good propulsion for a contemplative piece. Final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—archival science of vows as frequencies in a frozen sky‑library—feels fresh and specific. Tactics (harmonic balancing) arise from the premise rather than abstract mysticism. Risk‑taking is quiet but present; the piece commits to its accumulative texture without retreat. Emotional truth rides through craft, not cleverness alone.</comment>
