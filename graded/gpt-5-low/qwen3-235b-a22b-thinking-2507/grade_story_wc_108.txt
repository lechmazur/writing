<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s motives and contradictions are vivid: aquaphobia and injury versus calculated, adaptive action. Her decoding and decision to broadcast evidence are credible micro‑choices under pressure. The relationship with Lena is felt through status and betrayal, even off‑stage. Slight neatness in late epiphanies trims the edge of psychological messiness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: seashell clue → cipher realization → decoding → on‑camera accusation. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she risks career and safety to state the truth publicly while still injured and afraid. Cost is on‑page (injury, fear, reputational stakes); the final image reweights prior material. Minor convenience in the cipher leap is motivated by Leo’s established pirate code.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is striking and threads through action (moonlight pool, filming), with the cast and seashell functioning as charged micro‑settings. Sensory specificity aligns to her stunt‑pro focus. The environment mostly charges tone rather than constraining tactics, which keeps it just shy of top tier. Still, the final image is powerfully situated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim agency by exposing sabotage—is clear and tightens through the decoding breakthrough to the public accusation. Internal fear escalates the cost of the external choice. Lack of an on‑page antagonist response limits visible pushback, but the risk is legible and the narrowing of options reads. The send‑it‑to‑everyone move forecloses retreat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Recurring images (cast, shell, stars) support a theme of weaponized vulnerability and truth in imperfection. However, lines like “Vulnerability wasn’t a cage; it was the key” and “You were always enough” edge into stated moral. The piece still earns resonance through action, but the final paragraph leans declarative over subtext. The emotional aftereffect is solid if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third with a consistent perceptual signature—stunt craft terms and tactile fear meet luminous imagery. Psychic distance modulates well under stress. No head‑hopping or unjustified knowledge claims. Slight register lofting is voice‑motivated and doesn’t break plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with clean mechanics and varied rhythm; most sentences do double duty. Occasional purple or thematic tell softens the edge but doesn’t obscure clarity. No notable loops or template cadences. Final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a stunt double’s aquaphobia, a rust‑ruined library, a seashell cipher, and a recorded accusation feel particular and memorable. The betrayal premise is familiar but transformed by specific tactics and objects. The closure’s charged poise is earned without gimmickry. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent.</comment>
