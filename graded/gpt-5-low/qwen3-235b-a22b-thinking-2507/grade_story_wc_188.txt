<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt as a fireworks designer who caused a tragedy crisply motivates her hyper‑vigilant “Step. Breathe. See.” attention and the final, risky act of lighting a flame. The contradictory impulses—fear of fire versus need to kindle hope—surface in tactile beats (handling the rag, choosing the basin). Micro‑choices track cleanly and reveal values. The closing shift to “Create” reads earned rather than tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → relic → mosaic declaration → controlled flame → renewed vow. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she accepts a smaller, risk‑aware practice with visible emotional cost given her past. Orientation is clear early, and the final image reweights the world’s rule (from void to a disciplined spark). The because/therefore link is modest but coherent for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the moonflower fortress, dry basin, and starless hush shape tactics and charge the last image. The mosaic and basin constrain the safe way to answer the void; the flame reflecting in glass literalizes the theme. Sensory specificity is POV‑filtered with professional acuity (designer’s eye). World consistency holds without exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (resisting despair) tightens through discovery beats that progressively narrow options to an embodied, peril‑tinged act. The mosaic’s stubborn declaration reconfigures her calculus and tips her from vigilance to action. The cost is emotional and reputational (risking fire again), and the chosen containment (basin, single match) demonstrates trade‑offs. Escalation is quiet but legible for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of resilience and re‑scaled artistry emerge from particulars rather than sermonizing; the mosaic’s text is diegetic, not authorial moral. The flame refracting across shards reinterprets “spark” from spectacle to practice. The ending’s “Create” reframes playfulness as resistance, not escape. Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with selective noticing and rhythmic refrain sustains POV integrity. Diction suits a once‑pyrotechnic artisan in penitent, sensory attunement. Psychic distance modulates naturally under pressure without leakage. No dialogue to test, but internal cadence carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images do double duty (living architecture mirroring living craft), and repetition of the chant is purposeful. Figurative language is rich but not overgrown; rhythm varies and propels. Minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops; syntax stays clear in the climax. The final line cleanly resolves motif and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fire‑artist guilt in a living fortress with a mosaic credo and an abandoned spinner’s tool yields a fresh synthesis. The small, disciplined flame as counter‑spectacle is an elegant turn. Choices feel inevitable in hindsight without trope dependence. It’s not radical, but it’s distinct and assured.</comment>
