<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aris’s motive (survival via a clean signal) collides with panic, yielding a concrete, earned renunciation: he suppresses the instinct to bolt and commits to focus. Interiority is embodied (rebreather hiss, cold limbs) and character‑specific via the hush’s memory‑touch guiding his tactics. The visible cost includes time, oxygen, and relinquishing the vial. A hair of lyric generalization creeps in, but the choice remains credibly pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: temple resonance snarls the beacon; the vial’s hush, once released, “wraps” and clarifies the signal; rescue follows. Closure lands on the page with cost (oxygen depletion, surrender of the vial) and a decisive change (from failing distress to successful extraction). Orientation is immediate and stable; the window holds through rescue. The one potential ease—that the hush works on first try—is mitigated by the earned internal turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple and failing gear constrain options and dictate tactics; ocean pressure and environment are not mere backdrop but active limiters. The vial functions as object‑as‑setting; its properties charge the final image when he releases it back to the temple. Sensory texture is purposeful (algae‑slick, silt, cold, the hiss) and filtered through urgency. World rules (resonance snarls, hush clarifies) stay consistent and learned in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (survival/rescue) is clear early, and pressure tightens via dwindling oxygen and the internal pull to flee. The meaningful turn is his deliberate override of instinct to apply the hush, foreclosing the immediate escape path. Cost is legible—time, risk, and relinquishing the vial—and fuels a charged end image. If there is a limit, it’s the relatively single‑step solve once he commits, though it remains earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silence as harnessable power deepens from ritual memory into practical salvation, then reweights the closing image as an ongoing inner resource. The theme is carried by action and image (distilled quiet spiraling into the signal, the return of the vial), not just assertion. A few lines verge on stating thesis (“unsnarled death’s knot by surrendering to stillness”), but the resonance holds. The final charged poise—silence blooming within him under open sky—lands without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third maintains a coherent, lyrical register that matches the premise and never head‑hops. Diction is elevated but consistent with the story’s ritual/mystic frame and the character’s controlled focus under stress. Rhythm modulates well between pressure and release; minimal dialogue still functions as action. No withholding or stance drift undermines credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and purposeful, with strong verbs and multi‑tasking images (“distilled quiet” doing plot and theme). Minor purple edges and repeated formulations (“lonesome splendor,” “hush”) flirt with redundancy but do not stall momentum. Syntax varies and propulsion stays clear through the peak beat; no artifact loops or muddled metaphors dull closure. Line‑level craft is strong, if a touch lush.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A striking synthesis—ritualized silence in a crystal vial used to purify a distress signal in a drowned temple—feels fresh and cohesive. The turns arise from prior particulars (memory‑touch → tactic) rather than late rule swaps. Final reprise (releasing the vial back) reweights the premise elegantly. It’s bold without gimmickry, with only slight familiarity in rescue‑frame convention.</comment>
