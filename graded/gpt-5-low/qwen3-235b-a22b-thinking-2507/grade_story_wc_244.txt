<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris’s contradiction—desperately jocular exterior versus raw ache—reads cleanly in action and voice, with the cracked spectacles and forced jokes grounding him in specific embodiment. His micro‑choices (overpaying beans, tracing rumors, palming the moon rock, finally convening the circle) align with the loneliness motive. The shift from frantic catalysis to vulnerable presence is earned and forecloses the fantasy of a potion. Secondary figures pressure him credibly without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, rumor‑driven beats accrue toward a conceptual repricing: the cure is participation rather than a found object. Orientation is early and stable; the moon rock’s reprise anchors closure. Cost is present—he relinquishes the quest for an external salve and risks showing up—but it’s subtle rather than bruising. The throughline from rumor to gathering provides a clean cadence shift at the lantern scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ivy‑choked station, lantern light, wrenches, tea, and the moon rock are vivid and filtered through Aris’s sensibility. The environment shapes social rules (barter, “polite anarchy”) and charges the final image as community forms in that space. The moon rock functions as a micro‑setting object, constraining attention and reweighting the ending. Detail density is selective and purposeful without slipping into catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes (the “cure” for loneliness) are clear; pressure coheres as rumor momentum that forces a stance at the end. The search’s collapse tightens options and prompts renunciation, but escalation remains soft—no hard external test beyond dissolving leads. The meaningful turn is internal and legible, though the price is modest. Resolution grows from his agency in reframing and convening the circle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through reciprocity, the rumor chain as catalyst, and the moon rock’s reweighting; the closing image answers the question via communal presence. A slight ding for explicit moralizing (“turns out it’s mostly just showing up”), which states what the images already imply. Subtext in the mask slipping and barter‑economy gestures works well. The emotional aftereffect is warm, earned, and not saccharine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is consistent and character‑particular, with nimble modulation between banter and ache. Dialogue sounds lived‑in and advances aim/subtext (his jokes as armor). Diction and rhythm are controlled without register drift. No head‑hopping or stance wobble undermines trust.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; images (cracked lens, ivy curtain, hanging lantern) are crisp without overgrowth. Minimal scaffold or loops; figurative language stays coherent and grounded. The final cadence lands with clarity and economy. Minor lyric flourish is disciplined, not purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blend of disaster‑relief logistics, barter‑community “polite anarchy,” and a moon rock as loneliness talisman feels fresh. The rumor‑chain conceit cleverly refracts the theme of connection. The conceptual turn is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is quiet and controlled rather than flashy, but it pays off.</comment>
