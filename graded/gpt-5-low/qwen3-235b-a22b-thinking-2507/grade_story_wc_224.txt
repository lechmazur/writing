<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and embodied: grief-driven avoidance of reading collides with the urgent need to recover “the shape of home.” Contradictory impulses (fleeing pain vs. choosing to read/activate the stone) operate simultaneously at the peak beat. Micro‑choices (feather pressed, scraping the sliver, holding through the dawn fray) reveal values with felt cost. The closing stance shift—carrying home within—feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory glyphs translate into sensation, reweighting the premise from “place” to “texture” on the page. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost—letting memory return without anesthesia as the nightly reality collapses and time pressure bites. Setups (feather method, lost language stone, nightly substitution) are honored causally in the climax. The final image (feather pulsing, mountain heartbeat) crystallizes options and forecloses the prior search pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore and its nightly revision are vivid, sensorially balanced, and integrated into action (origami corridors, Hall of Echoing Whispers, dawn collapse). Setting constraints—the shifting maze and temporal fray—shape tactics and urgency. Micro‑objects (stone, feather) function as setting-tools charging the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through use rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens as dawn approaches, forcing Elara to act under a live clock. The key deepening occurs when the feather unlocks sensation-glyphs, transforming options and compelling the risky seeding of the quill before the dream collapses. Cost is internal but legible (reopening grief, irreversible repricing of memory). External antagonism is light, but pressure remains coherent and escalates appropriately for the mode and length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars—home reframed as texture rather than map—without moralizing. The feather/stone motif evolves from tool to truth‑vessel, and the ending reweights prior material with emotional aftershock. Insights feel earned by embodied struggle rather than assertion. Resonance lingers as the mountain’s heartbeat fuses setting and self.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and precise diction; imagery coheres to the character’s perceptual signature. Psychic distance modulates intentionally under pressure without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision (rules of the stone, nightly substitution) is taught through action and paid off in the climax. No dialogue needed; narration carries subtext and drive cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, action, and theme—while maintaining momentum. A few flourishes flirt with over‑density (“hidden thunder,” “captured star”), but they remain coherent and functional. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly. No loops, scaffold, or filter‑verb stacks dull the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—labyrinthine mountain bookstore, mercury‑glass seer, feather‑textured activation of a language stone translating into sensation—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, accumulative closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from established patterns and character choice rather than late rule changes. The final reconfiguration feels singular and memorable.</comment>
