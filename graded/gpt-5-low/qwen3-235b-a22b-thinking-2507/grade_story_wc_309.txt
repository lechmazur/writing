<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—seeking the sacred beyond the Engines—drives concrete choices (returning the keystone, mist walking, discarding her pack). Interiority is embodied (cold ache, trembling) and character‑specific. Minor over‑articulation (“She would never again mistake automation for art”) trims ambiguity and slightly tidies the internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: placement of the keystone deepens pressure, the luminance reweights meaning, and the descent fixes stance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with a visible cost (risk on the spire, surrender of the object, abandonment of the pack). Orientation is clear early and the final image is paid by prior beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The icebound spire, mist, and cold tangibly constrain options and tactics (necessitating mist walking, charging the keystone’s insertion, and heightening risk). The recurring object (keystone) and micro‑setting details (snowflake refracting into rainbows) decisively charge the ending image. Sensory specificity is vivid and filtered through Elara’s priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates when the keystone clicks home—luminance blooms, the spire groans—forcing Elara to commit to surrender over control. The cost is felt in risk and renunciation (returning the keystone, dropping the pack, choosing the slow, shunned method). It’s a quiet arc but the tightening is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme (sacred in the simple vs. optimized art) emerges organically through action and image (snowflake’s “stubborn grace,” soft luminance), with a resonant final reweighting. However, a few direct thematic assertions (“The Engines would never comprehend this”; “never again mistake automation for art”) edge toward sermonizing and reduce subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is consistent, with controlled rhythm and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction (“brilliant dimness,” “accommodated impossibilities”) is patterned and purposeful, matching pressure without head‑hopping. Slightly declarative lines near the end modestly flatten the otherwise supple modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Strong sentence‑level craft with high information density; images do multiple jobs and momentum rarely stalls. A few near‑repetitions (“luminance,” “brilliant dimness”) flirt with overuse but function as motif rather than loop. Minimal scaffolding; rhythm varies and the final line resolves by image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Familiar AI‑vs‑art premise is refreshed by the keystone’s whimsical lineage, the mist‑walking ethic of surrender, and the “brilliant dimness” motif. The synthesis feels specific and emotionally honest; the final reconfiguration avoids gimmickry. Slight on‑the‑nose statements keep it shy of the most daring band.</comment>
