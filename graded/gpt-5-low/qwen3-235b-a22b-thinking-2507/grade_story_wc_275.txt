<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism in tension with her father’s violent legacy is concrete and enacted under pressure; the sheathing choice reads as an earned renunciation with visible risk. Interiority is specific (leaf angles, strut tremor), and action aligns with motive. The felt cost is kneeling under a raised rifle to protect seedlings. Slight softness: the raiders’ retreat comes quickly, trimming some grit from the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: external pressure (raiders) forces stance crystallization; closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise via the deliberate sheathing and protective act. Orientation is clean early; causal throughline from finding the engraved scrap to its tactical use lands. Cost is legible on the page; the antagonist withdrawal feels plausible but borderline convenient, keeping this just under the 9.0–9.4 band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dome, ash-wind, and desert roses are tactile and POV-filtered; the environment constrains choices (protecting seedlings; dome’s light draws raiders). The sandbag scrap functions as micro-setting/tool charging the final image. Details evolve with action rather than static cataloguing. Atmosphere consistently girds theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defend the farm without violence) is clear; escalation arrives with armed intruders and a raised rifle. The decisive tightening is the sheathing that forecloses violent options and raises immediate cost. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively. Slight downtick: resolution leans on opponent hesitation rather than a visible consequence beyond their confusion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Care versus conquest is dramatized through specific acts, with “quiet” reweighted from inscription to tactic. Subtext runs through nurturing gestures under threat, culminating in a resonant final image. One line (“The roses remember. They know the quiet.”) edges toward stating the thesis, but most meaning arises from action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical close third is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature and disciplined cadence shifts as pressure rises. Diction fits character and world; no head-hopping. Sparse dialogue carries subtext and purpose. No withholding artifacts or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with largely clean propulsion; images like “tranquil blaze” and “skeletal remains” are vivid and coherent. A few stacked modifiers verge on purple, and some lines could tighten without losing texture. Rhythm varies and supports turns; no scaffold loops. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The engraved “quiet” as both talisman and tactic is an elegant, non-obvious turn in a post-apocalyptic frame. Nurture-as-defense feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Final reconfiguration is memorable and integrated. Minor conventionality in the raiders’ retreat keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
