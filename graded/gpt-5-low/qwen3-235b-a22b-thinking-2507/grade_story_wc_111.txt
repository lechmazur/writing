<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to prove care outruns metrics—is clear, embodied, and consistent, and her ritualized micro‑choices (polishing, placing the marble) align with that drive. Interiority is specific to her tactile craft and age. The internal conflict is understated (stubborn endurance vs. creeping doubt) rather than dramatized as a sharp contradiction, which keeps it shy of the top band. Still, the closing renunciation of the Quantifiers’ authority reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single, continuous scene with crisp orientation and a coherent accumulative/textural lens: images and actions intensify toward a conceptual repricing in the final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she privileges the garden’s “knowing” over numbers) with an implied cost of decades of endurance and present frailty. The turns are quiet rather than causal, but the white rose and the still‑red “8%” give on‑page stakes to the repricing. Not quite 9+ because the cost remains largely conceptual and softly articulated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and purposeful: damp earth, jasmine, moss, overgrown arches, and the brass Quantifiers all filter through a gardener’s eye. The setting’s logic stays consistent and the recurring object (marble) charges the final image. The maze does not materially constrain tactics in the moment, so it stops short of the 9‑band gate where environment must pressure a choice. Nevertheless, specificity and tone are exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—art vs. accounting—appears early and coheres; escalation arrives as a density deepening (forget‑me‑nots leaning, ivy greening, late white rose) under the accumulative lens. The on‑page counterpressure of the glowing “8%” holds. However, there is limited narrowing of options or visible price paid in scene; endurance is the choice, but no live path is explicitly foreclosed here. Strong, quiet pressure rather than a decisive squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The marbles as “mended deception” evolve into a thematic answer: resilience and relationship outweigh sterile metrics. The final image—rose opening while the Quantifier stays red—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture and offering rather than thesis statements. Minor dock only because the theme is fairly legible from early on and gains depth rather than surprise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in touch, scent, and craft; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates gracefully from patient detailing to charged poise at the end. Diction remains coherent to this seasoned, tactile mind. A hair below the top band due to occasional high‑polish lines that slightly smooth conflict edges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sonorous, and image‑dense with strong verb choices; most sentences do multiple jobs. A few stacked modifiers and repeated constructions flirt with purple, but clarity and momentum hold. No notable loops or scaffolding; the final cadence lands cleanly. Not at 9+ due to occasional lushness that modestly dilutes pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “Luck Quantifiers” in a garden and the cracked‑marble ritual feel fresh and integrated, not gimmicky. The synthesis of speculative device with intimate craft yields a distinctive stance. Turns are earned from established images rather than late rule changes. It stops just short of exceptional because the conflict frame, while elegant, remains familiar in its art‑vs‑metrics contour.</comment>
