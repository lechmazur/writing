<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Aris’s motives emerge credibly from his shrewdness turned toward remorse and repair; his micro-choices (admitting complicity, proposing the archive, calling the printer) align with an internal reorientation. The tension between transactional reflex and new empathy reads on the page. Elena’s grief is embodied and catalyzes his turn without becoming a prop. The cost is mostly conceptual/social rather than immediate, but it’s legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: misaddressed envelope → connection → recognition of Mateo’s deeds → proposal → concrete first action. Closure lands as a decisive change with on‑page initiation (printer call) and a reconfigured aim. The cost is implied (challenging union skepticism and Aris’s prior self‑image), not dramatized, but present. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the causal lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Specific, lived details (salt and jasmine, lantern light, the library garden) filter through Aris’s sensibility and charge mood and choices (displaying stories in that garden). The recurring objects (envelope, locket, notebook) integrate smoothly with place. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it meaningfully colors the final image (“Let the stars witness them”). Strong atmosphere with purposeful economy.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—tightens via the union’s likely rejection, prompting Aris’s tactical shift (“start small”). Escalation is gentle but coherent, moving from discovery to plan to concrete action. The price is soft and largely deferred; no direct opposition appears on the page. Still, agency drives the turn and reweights options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of unseen labor and cyclical compassion arises from particulars (Mateo’s medicine, Elena’s archives, Aris’s pledge). However, the text leans into explicit thesis statements (“Compassion… wasn’t a gesture but a cycle”), tipping toward sermonizing. Subtext does operate in images (stars, locket), but the final moralizing note blunts ambiguity. Resonance remains, though lessened by over‑telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third maintains a steady perceptual signature: a broker’s eye for manifests and addresses meets lyrical attention to night air and objects. Dialogue feels natural, economical, and goal‑driven. Diction is elevated but coherent for the mood and never breaks POV knowledge. Rhythm modulates well from hush to purposeful resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and propulsive without major loops or scaffolding. A few purple/abstract phrases and thematic reiterations slightly thicken the texture near the end. Syntax and paragraphing vary with scene needs, and concrete nouns carry weight. The line-level holds clarity and momentum overall.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The port‑library nexus, survivor‑benefits envelope, and a broker’s moral pivot feel fresh and specific. The misaddressed letter as catalyst is elegant and unforced. While “cycles of compassion” edges familiar, the occupational specificity and quiet procedural close (printer call, records cross‑reference) add originality. Not radical, but distinctly wrought.</comment>
