<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—mapping and “becoming the voice of the unknown”—is clear and intensifies as the fossil’s role reconfigures her task. Interiority is concrete (visor fog, panic regulated by the fossil) with a credible tension between private talisman and communal beacon. Her choice to reframe her maps and release exclusive ownership reads earned. Minor neatness in the self-narration (“factual mysticism”) trims some rawness but doesn’t undercut credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative discovery (spectral readings → floating fossil) and causal follow-through (she pockets it; levitation ceases; she reframes mission). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the object’s meaning shifts from personal comfort to communal signal with a conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single-scene coherence holds. The cost is felt (relinquishing ownership, burden of translation) though not devastating.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coastal cave is tactile (silt, brackish pool, dripping stalactites) and filtered through her professional tools and aims. The environment and the tidal pool focus discovery and physically stage the climax. The fossil functions as a charged micro-setting object in the final image. While constraints are more observational than obstructive, the setting meaningfully shapes action and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes consolidate around articulating lingering human emotion; pressure rises via the spectrometer’s escalating heatmap to the reveal of levitation. The decisive deepening is the fossil’s communal reframe and the on-page test of its effect (levitation stops when pocketed). Costs are conceptual and vocational rather than perilous; escalation is coherent under the hybrid/accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Resilience, memory in landscape, and transitional objects emerge from image and action—the floating fossil reweights hope from diary theory to embodied fact. Subtext about custodianship vs. possession quietly underlies her tears and choice. A touch of explicit statement (“Survivors needed more than geological surveys…”) edges toward telling but mostly supports the earned resonance. The final commitment to “spectral conversations” answers the thematic question without a sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled and particular to a sensory cartographer—technical yet sensorial. The recorder log integrates naturally and reveals stance shift. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; rhythm modulates well at discovery and closure. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient, with multi-tasking lines that carry atmosphere, world, and character. Minor tell-y phrases (“It floated because… a symbiosis science couldn’t replicate…”) slightly over-explain what the image already shows. Otherwise, cadence, clarity, and variation keep momentum. No notable loops or figurative muddle at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-hibernation sensory cartography, heat-mapped emotions, and a “factually mystical” fossil as transitional object—is fresh and cohesive. The levitation reveal feels earned by prior particulars, not a late rule add-on. Risks (science-mysticism blend, vocational specificity) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reweighting of mapping practice is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
