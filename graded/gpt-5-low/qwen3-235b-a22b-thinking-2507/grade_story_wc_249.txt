<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and urgent—reviving Lyra’s vision—and every tactic (the coded drumming, ignoring prompts) reveals character under pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied (“drumming on the pulse‑point of her own wrist”) rather than diagnostic. The quiet defiance versus the risk of neural overload gives a real internal contradiction. The Earned Stasis at the end (choosing to remain, fingers remembering the rhythm) lands with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: ritual drumming → harmonic alignment → apparition → overload → extinguished vision. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise that reweights the premise with cost. Causality holds—her escalating insistence triggers the machine’s breach and loss. If anything, the final turn is more imposed failure than a dilemma, but the price is still felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden, resonators, and neural lattice are vivid and functionally integrated, translating drumming into visible sound and constraining outcome via overload. Sensory specifics (pre‑light glow, auric radiance, salt‑spray) feel POV‑filtered rather than touristic. The environment directly charges the last image (dawn bleeding into a now‑silent garden). World rules stay consistent without expository drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear from the outset; escalation is a clean tightening from tentative probing to near‑contact to catastrophic flicker. Agency drives the crisis—her rhythmic insistence aligns and then breaches limits. The price (loss of the fragile connection and acceptance of extinguishment) forecloses a path. Stakes remain intimate and coherent, never inflated beyond the scene’s scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Grief versus institutional erasure emerges through image and action rather than thesis, with rebellion recast as care. The lagoon motif returns charged, shifting from hope to “auroral sorrow,” reweighting the premise. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: endurance with cost rather than cure. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric, close third voice is steady and character‑specific—cosmic metaphors feel organic to Elara’s perception. Modulation under pressure is controlled, tightening as the machine spikes. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the diction remains coherent to this mind. Elevated phrasing is consistent enough not to read as register slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry strong image density with generally clean propulsion; most sentences do more than one job. A few phrases flirt with purple or redundancy (“auric” recurs), but clarity and momentum hold through the climax and closure. Syntax varies well and the final image lands clean. No scaffold loops or muddled metaphors impair the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound garden + neural lattice + drum‑coded rebellion to recover a sister’s entangled memory—feels fresh and earned. The central turns arise from established tactics rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth grounds the speculative frame, avoiding template beats. Boldness is measured but distinct, especially in how tone and tech interlock.</comment>
