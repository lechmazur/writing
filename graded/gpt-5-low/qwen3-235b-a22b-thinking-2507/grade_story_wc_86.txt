<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—translating past failure into present mercy—is clear and drives the final choice, with the drawer pull concretizing his guilt and resolve. Interiority is embodied through tactile detail (cold brass, slick stone) rather than label-speak. The contradictory impulses—protocol/pride vs. release—are credible and present in-scene. A minor ding: some history is told rather than dramatized, softening the live struggle slightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a Situational lens, the exchange window, neutral ground, and moon-timed pressure force a stance crystallization at the “now” beat. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he chooses release with acknowledged, unpaid costs (no apology or forgiveness yet). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the envoy’s arrival tightens to a single decisive act. Cost is legible in the final grip of the drawer pull, reweighted from loss to tool.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The parapet, mist, wind, and moon function as active constraints (silence, empty hands, midpoint ground), shaping nonverbal tactics and timing. Sensory detail is vivid and selective; weather isn’t wallpaper—it restricts speech and visibility. The drawer pull operates as a micro-setting object charging the last image. World rules (neutral territory, moon clock) stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing Vanya as an act of moral recalibration—is signaled early and tightens with dawn and the envoy’s silent cue. The decisive turn is the release gesture; the cost is an internal renunciation without absolution. Pressure remains coherent, if quiet; there’s no reversal beyond the timing squeeze. Stakes integrate internal and external threads without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of apology, forgiveness, and salvage accrue through concrete images rather than thesis-talk, culminating in the reweighted drawer pull. The ending refuses neat absolution, landing on charged poise that invites reflection. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“recycle mistakes into wisdom”), but they’re earned by the particulars. Subtext in silence and gesture works well.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-limited voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“furrowed hush,” “stone slick”) sustains pressure without head-hopping. Diction aligns with Aris’s thoughtful temperament; the rhythm modulates effectively as the moment arrives. Elision (no dialogue) is taught by the environment and paid off in the silent exchange. No withholding or omniscience breaches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful imagery, and clean syntax. Minor redundancy (moon-phase method and neutral-ground framing recur) verges on over-insistence but doesn’t blur action. Figurative language remains coherent and context-driven. Momentum holds despite lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prisoner exchange frame is familiar, but the moon-phase protocol, mist-imposed silence, and the drawer pull as salvaged ethics feel fresh. The final reconfiguration of the object is elegant rather than gimmicky. Risk is measured and coherent, avoiding twist-for-twist’s sake. The synthesis reads specific to this character and setting.</comment>
