<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is crystalline and embodied in action—profession, duty, and grief align into a focused aim. The urgency of “Now” grows credibly from her method of attunement. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she executes without a complicating blind spot or competing impulse. The endurance at the end reads earned but not morally fraught.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/what) and the accumulative drive coheres through pattern-finding to the precise infusion. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the world ends while a single spark endures, with the loss felt on the page. Causality is clean: practice → pattern → timing → infusion → preservation. The cost is explicit—Kael’s death and world’s obliteration—and charges the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto, aurora, moon-bloom, and obsidian slab are vivid and filtered through her vocation. The environment and objects (aurora/static, emerald chip) meaningfully shape timing and the final image. Sensory detail is economical and purposeful, especially the sonic “static” guiding action. World rules remain consistent and legible through observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake—capture a last spark before oblivion—tightens through the cadence pattern to the “Now” trigger. The single decisive act narrows options irreversibly and exacts a price. While tension is steady rather than volatile, the escalation suits the selected accumulative lens. The ethical/moral calculus is simple but weighty and clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Order wrested from entropy (pattern in static) and the dignity of witnessing survival cohere without didacticism. Recurring images (aurora, hush, stone) reweight meaning by the end, avoiding platitudes. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer—preserving a soul as hope—without stating a moral. Slight sentiment risk is contained by specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, consistently close to Elara’s perception and vocation. Rhythm modulates well at the peak (“Now”), and diction stays coherent. No head-hopping or gratuitous elision; certainty tracks what she can infer. The prose texture feels particular rather than generic-lyric.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied sentences, purposeful images, and minimal scaffolding. A few lush clusters flirt with purple but maintain clarity and momentum. Figurative logic is consistent (static → pattern; starlight weaving as focus). The last lines land cleanly without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “beautician mortician” premise, auroral mortuary rites, and static-as-cosmos-method feel freshly synthesized. The emerald-soul vessel is familiar but transformed by the professional lens and ritual timing. The ending’s charged poise reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and they pay off.</comment>
