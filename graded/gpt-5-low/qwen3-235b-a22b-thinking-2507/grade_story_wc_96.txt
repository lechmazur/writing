<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, character-particular interiority with credible contradiction between the timid Scribe and the bold Architect drives the on-page choice. The coffee tin and tactile actions ground motive. The cost is felt but somewhat idealized; pressure never forces a messy mistake or visible stumble. Lack of a live counterforce in-scene limits crucible intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: present-tense goal (plant the next phase) coheres with a charged final image. Orientation is immediate (moon, rusted library, Elias) and the prison shard reweights the present. Closure lands as Charged Poise: committing to gatherers before his courage fades, under pursuit. Cost is implied (authorities, persona cycle) rather than enacted, but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail—the rusted library, liquid silver moonlight—filters through a poet’s bias and deepens tone. The library and coffee tin function as micro-setting/tools charging the final image. While atmosphere is superb, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond concealment and staging. Consistency of world rules and spatial coherence are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: catalyze rebuilding by shifting from hidden verses to organizing. Escalation arrives with the written signal and the decision to scatter blanks, narrowing options before the Scribe returns. The pursuit pressure is external but offstage, keeping the price mostly inferred. Still, the stance crystallizes with a felt trade-off in timing and risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of making beauty from anarchy and words as bricks/welding are embodied in objects and action. The Neruda/Mateo backstory enriches the manifesto without devolving into sermonizing, though “Beauty from anarchy...” edges toward on-the-nose. The final image reweights prior motifs into communal hope with cost. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric, confident third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature and clean stance. Elevated diction matches the character’s sensibility and modulates with the moonlit pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; elisions are purposeful. Rhythm carries momentum without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong nouns/verbs, purposeful imagery, and varied cadence. Minimal redundancy; images often do double duty (tin as tool and reliquary). Occasionally borders on purple, but coherence remains intact and propulsion steady. Opening and closing lines are charged and aligned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The monthly molt persona mechanic, coffee-tin reliquary, and rusted-library cradle synthesize into a fresh resistance fable. Familiar rebel tropes are made specific through tactile detail and a memorable final action. The risk-taking is measured, not flashy, but coherent and earned. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
