<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is crystal clear and intensifies under pressure; her lies and the last‑second launch of the script align with motive. Interiority is lean but specific (patch, pulse, “heart pounded”), though internal contradiction is modest beyond duty vs. obsession. Vance functions as immediate pressure with legible status dynamics. The final stance shift—rescue over search—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: anomalies → VOID → Leo clip → reassembly script → Vance confrontation → exposure. Orientation lands early (who/where/when), and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing charged by the reveal and the archive noticing (“numbers stopped recurring”). Cost is present but not crushing; career and existential danger are implied more than dramatized. The lens holds Causal through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The social network archive is concrete (partition ‘VOID,’ deletion protocol), integrated through action rather than static description. The mission patch and console work as charged micro‑setting objects, with the patch returning at the end. Sensory texture is efficient if a bit visually biased; plausibility reads fine for this scope. Environment constrains options via the system’s rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and tightens with the video discovery and Vance’s attempt to shut her down. Elara’s decision to lie and then launch the reassembly script under threat is the meaningful narrowing. The archive’s “notice” escalates consequence, though on‑page cost remains mostly conceptual. Tension escalates coherently without coincidence solving the problem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Memory as consumption, institutional erasure, and grief’s “sensed absence” braid coherently; the final image reweights the premise. Some theme lines are on‑the‑nose (“The archive doesn’t delete... it consumes memories”), trimming subtext. The patch and numbers motif earn resonance by the end. Reflection emerges from events rather than sermonizing, aside from a couple thesis‑like sentences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is steady and apt, with controlled compression of technical detail. Dialogue reads functional and goal‑driven, especially Vance’s intervention. Diction is consistent with Elara’s professional lens; a few declarative theme lines flatten the texture slightly. Rhythm holds under pressure without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with minimal scaffolding; concrete verbs carry action. Some repetition and expositional phrasing (“She realized…”) dampens immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language is restrained and coherent; no mixed metaphors. Final lines land clearly without purple inflation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archive as predator of memory with consciousness fragments is a strong, specific twist; numbers as timestamp‑breadcrumbs feel fresh. The supervisor cover‑up is familiar, but it’s woven cleanly into the engine of the piece. The reweighting (“they go nowhere, because they’re still here”) sticks. Not radical, but confidently synthesized.</comment>
