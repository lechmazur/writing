<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—recovering erased memories—drives clear, coherent choices (grounds-reading, digging, the flower ritual). Interiority is specific (bone‑tug, brine sting, brittle flowers) and avoids therapy‑speak. Internal contradiction is limited; he doesn’t truly wrestle with reclaiming vs releasing until the end. The final acceptance lands as earned, though the emotional price registers more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: investigation sequences (grounds → dig → chest → ritual) are causally neat while the closure is a conceptual repricing. Orientation is quick and clean (who/where/when by the first lines). Closure lands on the page: “He left…with empty hands” as memories remain transformed in the salt, a real cost. Beats link because/therefore without contrivance, and the final image reweights earlier signs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt chamber, crystals, and gravity pockets are vivid and functional; salt’s lattice explains “memory wells” and constrains tactics (map the pockets, dig at the vortex). Sensory texture is rich across senses (hum, brine, lift/pin of dust) and filtered through Aris’s workman’s eye. Environment decisively charges the ending (memories suspended in crystalline glow). World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover/understand lost memories) is present early and tightens through the map → dig → read → ritual sequence. The surge/release is a meaningful deepening that forecloses the simple “get them back” option. Cost is clear but mostly conceptual (he doesn’t reclaim; he sets free). Pressure is coherent if understated; no antagonist, but the wells’ pull and his attrition do the work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of keeping vs theft in memory and grief emerges organically from the salt lattice and the mother/whale parallels. The recurring wildflowers shift meaning from relic to key to release. The line “weren’t thieves but keepers” edges toward a thesis statement but the scene work earns it. The final luminous image invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close-third with a distinct, tactile lexicon (lantern hook, whalebone chest, coffee grounds augury). Rhythm modulates well from hush to surge; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Purposeful elision supports mystery without withholding established knowledge. Lyrical without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: most sentences do multiple jobs, and figurative language is controlled and coherent to the world (salt, gravity, light). Minimal scaffolding; momentum holds through descriptive density. A faint tendency toward lushness in the closing paragraph doesn’t blur sense. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravity pockets as salt‑lattice memory wells, a lantern lighter using coffee grounds, a whale surrendering memories—is striking and specific. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, grounded in the mother’s journal and the chamber’s logic. Risks (lyric mode, quasi‑mythic science) pay off cleanly. Only the declarative keeper/thief sentence slightly tempers the singularity of the finish.</comment>
