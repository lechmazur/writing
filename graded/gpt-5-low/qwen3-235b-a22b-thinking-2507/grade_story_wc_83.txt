<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Aris’s grief-driven rigor and the contradictory surge of hope are embodied in concrete micro‑choices (placing the geode, rerunning sequences, logging coordinates). The interiority feels specific and physical (rail bite, hum through deck), avoiding stock therapy‑speak. Final stance (map pools, not reclaim the past) is earned and costs him the fantasy of reversal. Minor melodramatic edges don’t undercut credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal progression: cooling downtime → auxiliary harmonics/perturbation → array tone → lattice reveal → geode manifestation → reframed mission with cost. Closure reads as a charged poise/conceptual repricing, with the decision to hunt/map and the cost of irreversibility on the page. Orientation is crisp from the opening. No soft resets; the geode’s presence pays off prior set‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory above Helios, the cooling breakers, and the geode function as charged environment and object, shaping tactics and the final image. Sensory integration is strong (hum, scent of petrichor, ochre storms) and filtered through Aris’s priorities. The mandated cooling window plausibly drives the use of auxiliary systems. World rules are learned via action with minimal exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding pools/meaning) tightens when the array “screams” and the geode manifests, forcing a reframed goal that forecloses reclaiming Elara. Agency drives the deepening; his technical choices produce the reveal. Emotional price (accepting loss) charges the final act of logging coordinates. Pressure could escalate one notch more via a concrete risk, but remains coherent and meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of grief, stolen futures, and the ethics of channeling latent potential emerge from particulars and culminate in a resonant reweighting (map/stabilize pools rather than revive the past). The geode as love‑conduit ties idea to image effectively. A few explicit thesis lines (“He understood the hunt’s purpose…”) shave subtlety. Still, the ending’s image earns reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric‑technical voice is consistent with a scientist in extremis, with controlled cadences and sensory bias that fit his mind. No dialogue needed; the focalization stays tight and plausible. Elevated diction feels voice‑motivated, not intrusive. Rhythm flexes with pressure, landing clean at the close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient with strong verbs and multi‑tasking lines; motifs recur purposefully (hum, thrum, lattices). Brief flirtations with purple (“intangibly tangible”) are made functional by recurrence and payoff. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing keep momentum. Not quite razor‑cut lean, but polished and clear under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Combining perturbation theory with “unused potential pools” that manifest a stolen future through a geode is fresh and integrated with character need. The reveal feels inevitable in hindsight given the seeded geode flare at the wedding. Risks (scientific lyricism + metaphysical conceit) pay off without obscuring clarity. Distinctive and memorable.</comment>
