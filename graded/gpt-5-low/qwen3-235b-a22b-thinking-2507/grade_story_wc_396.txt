<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Silas’s motive (prevent violence by “mapping empathy onto action”) is consistent and enacted through concrete choices (seeking the mirrors, assembling shards, confronting Kael). Interiority is present via shadow‑embodied sensation but contradictory impulses are light; Silas reads highly competent with minimal on‑page doubt or cost. Kael’s brief on‑page presence adds social pressure but doesn’t deepen a relationship crucible. The closing stance feels earned though somewhat low‑friction for Silas emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: loss of visions fractures trust → Silas uses mirror glimpses to reconstitute the crystal → public projection resolves the accusation and reconfigures terms. Orientation is strong from the first lines and the two‑shard structure (store → confrontation) is clean. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration (the clans’ pact and Kael’s visible shame). Cost is present but externalized to Kael more than Silas, keeping it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, shifting floes, and the vintage store’s mirrors are vivid, idiosyncratic, and functionally constrain options (the cliffside shard, time pressure from gathering clans, mirrors as the only viable method). Sensory selection feels character‑filtered and purposeful; recurring objects charge the final image (apples “like tiny lighthouses,” lanterns along the cliff). World rules (mirrors capture time’s echoes) are learned through action. Setting tangibly drives tactic and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens under a live clock (“the weighted breath before reply”). The meaningful turn is Silas’s reconstruction enabling the public revelation that flips Kael’s stance. Escalation is coherent but relatively smooth—few setbacks in the mirror sequence lessen felt price. Still, the clock and public risk provide sufficient pressure for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of empathy operationalized into communal action is integrated through plot and images (shared patrols, joint signals, lanterns). Subtext functions via the mirror motif reweighting fractured time into present repair. However, the explicit thesis line “Courage wasn’t the absence of fracture…” reads as moralizing in the final paragraph, dulling earned resonance. Despite that, the closing images retain a lingering aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person that stays within Silas’s perceptual bandwidth; diction and rhythm suit the fable‑like register. Psychic distance modulates effectively under pressure without head‑hopping. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; reportage avoids expository clog. The voice maintains consistency through the turn and charges images without clouding clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; metaphors are coherent and thematically aligned (mirrors, fracture, breath). Minor repetition (“map empathy onto action,” “weighted breath before reply”) skirts loopiness but largely functions as motif. Syntax varies and sustains momentum across the two shards. No significant figurative muddle or register drift at the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of lighthouse orchard, time‑echo mirrors, and a shadow‑woven mediator feels fresh and specific. The method of repairing an artifact via reflective glimpses is inventive and organic to theme. The final reweighting (empathy as actionable protocol) reads earned rather than gimmicky. Slight safety in obstacle design keeps it from the topmost tier, but the synthesis is memorable.</comment>
