<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to preserve the lighthouse’s promise when the lamp dies—is clear and embodied through concrete micro‑choices (descending, stone codes, leaving the note and glass). Interiority is specific and filtered through her profession; the “warmly observant” trait shows in what she notices. Internal contradiction is present but muted (helpless to relight vs. compelled to protect), keeping it more steadfast endurance than fraught conflict. The earned renunciation of repairing the lamp tonight in favor of a quieter safeguard reads credible and costs her certainty.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the lamp’s failure, letters, sea glass, and stone language build toward a charged poise ending. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and the two‑shard structure (lantern room → beach) is clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she cannot relight but redefines “keeping the watch,” with the harbor still blind, which is a real cost. The sea‑glass-as-first-link inference is a mild convenience but doesn’t break coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment is vivid and constraining: the seized mechanism and storm‑dark shore force her to choose the stone code method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt‑stung darkness, iron grating echoes), and the micro‑settings (lantern room, shingle beach) shape tactics. Recurring objects (sea glass, letters) charge the final image. The world’s rules hold and feel plausibly nautical and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect mariners after the light fails—is signaled early and tightened when she discovers the mechanism is seized, foreclosing relighting. The meaningful turn is her pivot to the stone‑signal system, with an on‑page cost: the beam stays dark tonight. Pressure is coherent though mostly atmospheric; no live external antagonist or immediate vessel heightens urgency, but the situational risk is felt. The resolution is earned by her stance crystallizing into protective action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, communal safety, and memory-as-infrastructure emerge organically through letters, stones, and the “promise” of the light. The final image (“a lighthouse of the soul”) reweights the premise without tipping into sermon, though it brushes the edge of overt statement. Subtext in the chain of anonymous caretakers and the tactile rituals avoids platitude. Resonance lingers as obligation chosen over powerlessness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person closely held voice with a distinct nautical perceptual bias sustains across pressure. Diction is elevated but consistent with Elara’s sensibility; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates well between haunted stillness and deliberate action. Elisions (e.g., code meanings) are taught on the page and integrated as action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is polished, with strong verbs and layered images doing multiple jobs; momentum holds despite reflective density. Figurative language is frequent but controlled and coherent with the sea‑haunted register. Minimal scaffold or repetition; sentences vary in length and function. One or two phrases skim purple (“luminescent ache”), but they fit tone and do not blur clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While lighthouses and ghosts are familiar, the anonymous letter chain and stone‑code method feel fresh and integral. The sea glass token as a passed‑down key adds a memorable, specific inflection. The piece commits to a quiet, risk‑embracing closure rather than a fix‑it turn, which sharpens distinctiveness. Emotional truth is particular to Elara’s vocation rather than generic melancholy.</comment>
