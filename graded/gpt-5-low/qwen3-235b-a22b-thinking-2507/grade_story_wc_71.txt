<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to test why some houses feel alive—is specific and steady, and her embodied perceptions (boots crunching, the orris shard warming) ground her interiority. Agency escalates from small trials to the Finnegan place and culminates in tears and acceptance. Internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wavers or pays a concrete price beyond vulnerable hope. Still, micro‑choices with the objects reveal a distinct hierarchy of values and a credible, earned softening at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence of sanctifications (inert yellow cottage → warmly alive bungalow → “dying” Finnegan place) coheres and tightens toward a conceptual repricing: houses are held, not haunted. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands on the page with the Finnegan house’s faint pulse and Elara’s realization. Cost registers as emotional and conceptual, not material, yet it is felt in the risk of failure and the fragile, partial recovery. The pattern holds without contradictions or late rule cheats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bay, streetlights, and weathered cottages are sensorial and purpose‑driven; the environment supplies the displaced objects that shape tactics. The orris root functions as a tool that charges the final image, and the houses’ differing responses map directly to setting‑embedded rules. Details are filtered through Elara’s bias and escalate with the ritual. The world remains consistent and tactile without tourist catalog drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through patterned trials: failed sanctification (stakes: the method might be empty), successful warmth (stakes: method works), then the Finnegan place (stakes: can a “dying” home rekindle). The final beat offers a fragile win, not a cure‑all, which narrows options to care and patience. Explicit cost is primarily emotional and reputational (risking a mythic method against communal lore), but it’s legible. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme—care sanctifies the ordinary; homes are held by displaced traces of love—emerges through concrete acts and charged objects. The last paragraphs risk overt statement (“The living ones weren’t haunted; they were held”), slightly flattening the subtext. Nonetheless, the Finnegan pulse and the orris root’s quieting deliver earned resonance beyond a tidy moral. The piece invites reflection on ritual, grief, and attention without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is coherent, lyrical, and confidently filtered through Elara’s perception (“streetlights daydreamed,” “hushed blaze”). Distance and diction remain steady; no head‑hopping or register breaks occur. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure shifts from bay to porches to the fragile awakening. The lyricism serves action rather than muffling it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, action, and implication—with minimal scaffold or repetition. Figurative language is vivid yet disciplined; motifs (hush, blaze, daydreaming lights) reprise cleanly without muddle. Momentum remains intact across paragraphs, and the final line reframes prior images. A few abstract summaries in the close nudge toward tell, but do not blunt the image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sanctifying homes via displaced objects and an orris shard that holds “hush” is a fresh synthesis executed with conviction. The ritual’s quiet, tangible stakes feel non‑derivative and specific to this place and mind. The final reweighting (“held, not haunted”) reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric tone and magical realism are taken without gimmickry and land cleanly.</comment>
