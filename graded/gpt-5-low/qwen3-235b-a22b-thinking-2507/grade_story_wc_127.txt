<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motives (precision, profit, and a guarded care for clients) are embodied through tactile procedure and sensory mapping, not labels. Her contradictory impulses—affectionate detachment vs. a drive toward empathy—are dramatized in the assessment beats and the closing renunciation. The emergent resonance forces a credible internal shift. The final choice (to leave space in the formula) reads earned by prior particulars.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the dusk “transformation” and static intensification deepen pressure until the vapor’s lingering “ghost” reweights meaning. Orientation is clean from the start, and the single scene coheres. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a tangible forward choice and implied cost. The because/therefore chain is subtle but intact through environmental interaction rather than plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto at dusk is not decorative—its mineral/static conditions catalyze the emergent property at the exact temporal hinge. Sensory specificity is rich (visible vapor, resinous wall, molar‑deep hum) and POV‑filtered by her professional attention. The place charges the final image and constrains what’s possible. World rules stay consistent and legible through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—ethical precision vs. counterfeit solace—tightens when the vapor lingers and forces re‑evaluation. The turn is clear: an emergent “ghost” recasts her craft and narrows the path of perfecting deception. The cost is conceptual and professional rather than visceral but reads on the page. Pressure remains coherent without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of half‑truth versus authentic empathy arise from concrete acts (deploying, inhaling, mapping; the ash; the reconfiguration of purpose). The final recognition reweights the premise without saccharine moralizing, though “true empathy resides…” edges toward explicitness. Subtext lives in the lingering vapor becoming a “ghost” of understanding. Resonance is strong and coherent with the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, sensorial, and technically controlled, matching a meticulous practitioner. Diction (“language of the limbic system,” “emotion’s architecture”) fits the character’s professional lexicon. Psychic distance stays stable; no head‑hopping or unexplained omniscience. Lyric modulation under pressure serves the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and purposeful; most lines do double duty for atmosphere and action. Minor repetition (“as the transformation completed”) risks faint echo, but cadence mostly varies and momentum holds. Figurative language is coherent to the established physics and sensory palette. No scaffold loops or clarity breaks dull the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—black‑market emotion craft, static‑sensing, an amber grotto clocked to dusk—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The emergent “ghost” of genuine understanding is an elegant non‑obvious turn. Risks in worldbuilding and tone pay off without muddle. Freshness resides in both premise and execution rather than garnish.</comment>
