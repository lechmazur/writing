<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara’s competence under pressure and embodied actions (adjusting lenses, reading the sea) feel motivated and specific. The yearning “to transpose her life into a new key” is present but functions more as tonal ballast than as a driver of her peak decision. Contradictory impulses (duty vs. desire for change) skim the surface rather than collide on the page. Still, the micro‑choices align cleanly with her keeper identity and yield an earned shift at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: Chen’s delivery → microdot specs → storm cue (“sea sings backwards”) → optical reconfiguration → rescue. Closure lands with a concrete Decisive Change (freighter saved) and a resonant internal reconfiguration. Cost is present but light (risk, exhaustion), sufficient at this length. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, storm, and Devil’s Teeth aren’t ornamental; they constrain tactics and enable the exact method of salvation. The emergency optical array as a lived‑in tool grounds plausibility and charges the final image of the “shadow walk.” Sensory detail is purposeful, with weather directly affecting options. Economy is strong; there’s no museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preventing wreck) is clear early and tightens when the freighter appears dead in the water. The escalation is protagonist‑driven via the beam’s redesign, not a lucky break. The price is mostly situational (time pressure, physical risk), credible if not deeply harrowing. The “sea sings backwards” cue converts ambiguity into a single, urgent path that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>“Open secrets” resonate through the microdot and the projected shadow, and the ending reframes Elara from keeper to “conductor.” However, the final paragraph drifts toward explicit theme statement, dulling subtext that was already visible in image. The insights feel earned by action but partially over‑explained. The lingering image of dawn after the recalibrated beam carries genuine emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third‑person close is stable and calibrated to Elara’s perceptual bias (tools, light, sea). Diction is lyrical but controlled, with rhythm tightening under stress at the switch‑throwing moment. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty intrudes, and the sparse dialogue fits character and function. Minor elevated turns of phrase occasionally flirt with purple but do not break voice credibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (setting + action + theme) with good momentum and varied syntax. Occasional ornamental phrasing and summary restatements (“open secrets” explicated) trim some edge. Technical terms are used lucidly without clogging cadence. The final image is clear and unblunted by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of fortune‑cookie microdot spycraft with lighthouse optics and a storm rescue feels fresh and coherent. The “shadow walk” signal as a literalized open secret is an inventive turn that feels earned. Risks are taken in concept without gimmickry, and the resolution leverages prior specifics. Minor familiarity in lighthouse‑rescue tropes is offset by the microdot device and thematic synthesis.</comment>
