<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to understand story‑magnetism after her transplant—is vivid and consistent, and her dye‑master habits translate into on‑page choices (retrieving the wing, using it as lens). Her internal contradiction (seeking vs. holding still) is dramatized and resolved credibly in the final renunciation. Emotions are embodied through craft‑specific perceptions rather than labels. The change costs her the chase and self‑foregrounding, which reads as earned at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid lens: a causal beam (wing/prism → journal) catalyzes an accumulative conceptual reweighting. Orientation is crisp and the single scene holds. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt price (renunciation), though the floorboard journal illuminated by light flirts with convenience. Still, the because/therefore chain is legible and cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and misty valley are not postcard décor: drifting currents and lattice windows constrain tactics (timed sun trails), and the environment charges the final image. Object‑as‑setting works through the wing and prism, filtered by a dye master’s eye. Sensory texture is purposeful and anchored in POV. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes stay focused on understanding how stories “magnetize,” with a meaningful tightening when light exposes the hidden journal. Escalation is quiet but coherent: setup → experiment → discovery → reconfiguration. The cost is inward (giving up the chase), clear but subtle, keeping pressure modest. No antagonist is needed, yet the internal/external weave reads earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres through action and image: “iridescent caution” becomes a lived stance—holding space rather than grasping. The wing’s reprise and the final exchange with the child deliver a resonant, non‑literal answer. Slight deduction for the donor’s journal stating the thesis rather directly, which edges toward didactic clarity. Nevertheless, the closing image lingers with charged implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is consistent and character‑specific (craft lexicon, light/dye metaphors) without head‑hopping. Rhythm varies with purpose, and the brief dialogue feels natural and subtextual. The perceptual signature—seeing light as dye—creates distinctiveness. No stance or tense slips undermine clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line work is polished, image‑dense, and largely efficient; most sentences do multiple jobs. A few moments flirt with purple or redundancy, but momentum holds and metaphors remain coherent to the dye/light domain. Syntax varies and the final line lands cleanly. No loops or filter stacks impede the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating tea house, dye craft, morpho wing, and post‑transplant listening ethic—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “iridescent caution” concept is an original thematic engine rather than ornament. Risk‑taking in premise and imagery heightens coherence without obscuring sense. The discovery mechanism and final stance avoid template beats.</comment>
