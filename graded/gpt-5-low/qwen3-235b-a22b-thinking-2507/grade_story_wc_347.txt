<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (oath-bound necessity) is clear and consistent, and her choices—assembling the path, timing the move—align with it under pressure. The hate/duty tension is credible, though live-on-page inner contradiction could be sharper during the rescue beat. Embodied details (trembling hands, breath impressions) ground the emotion without therapy-speak. The final wondering about her freedom reads earned rather than tacked on.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages hold (oath → blueprint method → path assembly → travelers’ escape), with a tidy Charged Poise at the end. Closure’s cost is modest but legible: time window closes as frost forms and Elara’s duty persists. Orientation is crisp early; no causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The environment and tools directly constrain tactics: the labyrinth’s patrol patterns, the frost clock, the nut’s shadow, and breath-trail mechanics. Sensory specificity (whirring copper wings, glass eyes, frosted nut) is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s practiced eye. World rules are learned by watching her act, not via dumps. The final image is charged by setting (frost arriving) and object (the nut).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—get the travelers out before frost/birds—tightens cleanly with a visible near-miss (the dipping bird) and the clock’s close. Agency drives the outcome via the assembled, non-contact path. The price is felt more as strain/endurance than loss; a sharper foreclosed option would elevate. Still, pressure coheres and rises under the causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Duty vs. graceless care, guidance through absence, and the possibility that saving others may loosen a curse interlock without sermonizing. The “whispering the way” method and the frosted nut reprise deepen the theme. The final wonder reframes the premise with conceptual cost (her soul’s bind) rather than pat answers. Resonance is earned through particulars, not declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A steady close third with a distinct perceptual signature—precise, workmanlike diction cut by lyrical edges when warranted. No head-hopping; stance and tense are stable. The voice modulates under pressure without register drift. Compression is confident, with inference left to image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong line-by-line economy: images carry multiple jobs (world rule, tension, theme). Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops; rhythm varies, and syntax serves momentum. A few heightened phrases (“offhandedly exact” repeated) read intentional rather than purple. The final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—mechanical birds, breath-trace assembly, shadow-aligned nut—feels fresh and integral, not ornamental. Tactics emerge from world logic with non-obvious elegance. Emotional truth (resentful duty performed precisely) lifts it beyond concept-coolness. Risk is taken in method and tone and pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
