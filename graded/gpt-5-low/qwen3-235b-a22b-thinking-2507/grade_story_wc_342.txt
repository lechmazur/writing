<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserve the library by mirroring the sky—is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (coin sequence, stylus work). Her tactile interiority feels specific and embodied, with competence balanced by genuine limits (the tremor). Internal contradiction is present but modest (ambition vs. exhaustion/limits). Lack of relational pressure keeps the crucible narrow, but it suits the single-POV frame.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: coin → safe → materials → precision craft → slip → demolition. Orientation is crisp early and the final image delivers Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with cost (failed containment, building’s destruction). Each step tightens the window toward dawn without stray detours. The closure lands cleanly on-page and reweights the attempt over outcome.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The oak-trunk library is vividly tactile and integral to choices (carved shelves, hidden safe keyed to touch). Environment and objects constrain tactics (moonlight, wood grain, ancient mechanisms), and the final image is charged by place (wrecking ball through the tree as the flawed mirror holds). Details are selective and POV-filtered via touch. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor the sky before demolition—tightens via time pressure and the “fractally precise” demand. The slip is an on-page reversal born of agency and fatigue, foreclosing perfection and reframing success. Stakes are personal yet consequential; the cost is tangible (failed mirror, demolition). Escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the impossibility of containment, the dignity of attempt, and human limits. The last lines verge on stating the insight (“mirrored not the sky, but the act of seeking within the limit”) but remain earned by scene pressure. Recurring motifs (touch, fractal precision, hush) transform meaning by the end. Subtext runs through craft and constraint rather than commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, tactile-forward, and consistent with Elara’s perceptual limits; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. No dialogue, but the internal cadence acts as action. POV certainty aligns with what she can plausibly know, avoiding leakage. Lyrical texture stays legible at stress points.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-rich, and purposeful, with strong information density per line. A few repeated formulations (“fractally precise”) flirt with over-insistence but don’t blur sense or momentum. Syntax varies and carries the hush-to-rumble cadence effectively. No notable scaffold or loops; closure image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—face-blind artist using fractal touch to mirror the sky in a living library minutes before demolition—feels striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual method) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The coin mechanism and quicksilver craft read fresh rather than ornamental. The final reweighting is non-obvious yet right for the premise.</comment>
