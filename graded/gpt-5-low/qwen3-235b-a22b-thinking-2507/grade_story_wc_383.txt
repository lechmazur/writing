<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, coherent motivation and steady agency under pressure; her micro-choices (adjusting stones, recalibrating the lapis orb) align with her goal. Embodied emotion lands (tears, trembling) without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction is modest—resolve overrides doubt—so the arc feels slightly tidy. The cost of reliving the memory reads, but she never risks failing beyond the ritual’s precision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build toward a clean on‑page closure: the archiving completes, the seashell’s whisper ceases, and she leaves it buried. Orientation and stakes are anchored early, and the before/after is legible with felt cost (reliving the accident). The ritual’s steps flow causally even in a lyric mode, with a clear clock (before dawn). Slight smoothness—success feels assured once the pattern holds—keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The velvet garden is vivid and functional: moonflowers, quartz, lapis orb, and singing stones actively enable and constrain tactics. Sensory specificity and rule‑consistency (resonance harmonics) are integrated with action, not pasted on. The environment charges the final image (seashell buried in luminous soil). It’s richly atmospheric without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused and escalates through density: whispers intensify, memory floods, the clock tightens, and the final activation forecloses a path. The price—enduring the unsealed memory—reads on the page. Tension is primarily internal; no reversal beyond intensification, so the pressure is strong but not punishing. The ritual’s success feels slightly preordained once the resonance holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of transformation vs. erasure and physics entwined with longing emerge organically from the ritual’s particulars. The final images (buried shell, softened glow) resonate. A couple of explicit statements (“not erasure, but transformation,” “elegant physics of healing”) tilt toward telling and trim the lingering ambiguity. Still, the emotional aftertaste is earned and honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature—scientific-poetic diction suits a “charmed skeptic.” Rhythm modulates with pressure, and focalization stays tight. Minor repetition of key terms edges toward mantra but remains pattern‑consistent. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean syntax, good propulsion, and multi‑tasking sentences; images advance action and mood. A few paraphrase echoes and repeated phrasing (“resonance structures”) flirt with loopiness but largely read as motif. Figurative language is consistent and supports clarity. The final cadence is crisp and unencumbered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The science‑lyric hybrid of archiving trauma via resonant horticulture and mineral acoustics feels fresh. The seashell, singing stones, and lapis fidelity add non‑generic specificity. Risk is controlled and coherent; closure grows inevitably from the method rather than a late trick. Not revolutionary, but distinctly imagined and integrated.</comment>
