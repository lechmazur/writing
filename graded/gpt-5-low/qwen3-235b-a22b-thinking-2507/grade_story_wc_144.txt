<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and specific (repair the drone in time for her daughter’s departure), and her competence is embodied through tactile, technical choices. The interiority is sensorially distinct without therapy‑speak. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she encounters little emotional friction beyond concentration. The final renunciation/cost reads as quiet endurance rather than a charged trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single‑scene causal chain is clean: feedback anomaly → water‑refraction diagnosis → micro‑patch → harmonized hum → launch aligned with the anchor lift. Orientation is immediate, and the drive lens reads Causal with a live clock. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the drone launches), though the cost is soft. No dangling setups or convenience plotting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: leaky pipe/water basin, mist, and depot acoustics actively shape Elara’s method and choices. Sensory specificity is filtered through her tactile/auditory priorities, not tourist catalog. The environment charges the ending image as the drone maps fog and the bells/anchor time the release. World rules stay consistent and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (fix it before the ship departs) is legible, and the bell/anchor clock tightens pressure. The diagnostic spike offers a small turn, and the micro‑patch is a precise, consequential action. Yet resistance is limited; no meaningful setback or price tests her commitment. The resolution feels earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around translating uncertainty into direction, with blindness reframed as a unique lens. The water/refraction motif evolves from method to larger navigation metaphor, culminating in the drone guiding through fog. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Slight neatness keeps it shy of profound ambiguity or cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and POV‑coherent, with tactile and auditory diction befitting a blind artisan. Distance and stance are stable; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythmic modulation tracks pressure well, culminating in a calm, recharged final image. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts lushness but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet clear; images carry multiple jobs (world‑build, method, mood). Minimal scaffolding and few redundancies; syntax varies and supports momentum. Some figurative saturation edges toward purple but doesn’t blur causality or the closure image. Technical terms are precise and anchored in action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The refraction‑through‑water diagnostic for a blind mechanic is fresh and integrated with the depot’s micro‑ecology and the ship’s fog navigation. The mother‑to‑daughter gift reframes the tech with emotional specificity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the chosen method and clock. High originality without gimmick.</comment>
