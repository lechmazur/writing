<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is crisp and consistent—he seeks to navigate without moving—and his micro-choices (shifting from skimming stones to appraising the arrowhead; returning it) align with that aim. Interiority feels embodied (dust, bone resonance) rather than labeled. The internal conflict is subtle rather than oppositional; stakes ride on endurance and renunciation more than contradictory impulses. The final renunciation reads earned but low-temperature.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: bird pattern → arrowhead discovery → resonance comprehension → renunciatory closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he stops skimming, maps internally, replaces the arrowhead. Cost is legible conceptually (decades invested, relinquishing the tool), though not sharply dramatized. Orientation is clear from the outset; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon of endless echoes and bone towers isn’t a postcard; it actively shapes method and meaning (harmonic strikes, resonance, echo-chorus at the end). Object-as-setting (arrowhead) and environment fuse to charge the final image. Sensory specificity is high and POV-filtered. World rules remain coherent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clean—achieve still navigation—and pressure coheres via the flock’s surge and the arrowhead’s discovery. Escalation is a deepening of pattern and cadence rather than adversarial push; it’s effective but gentle. The visible cost is primarily renunciation and restraint, not a narrowed, painful trade-off on the page. Tension operates more in tone and accumulation than in jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—listening to the land’s memory; movement through stillness—emerges from particulars (echoes, starlings, arrowhead) and culminates in a quiet, resonant ending. A few explicit lines (“He understood then—”) brush the edge of statement but don’t collapse into sermon. The final image reweights prior material without a neat moral. Subtext runs in the reverent handling and the decision to re-bury the compass.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person close POV with a distinct perceptual signature (sound as touch; history as pulse). Rhythm modulates well at intensifications (flock surge, inner mapping). No head-hopping or register drift; elisions are purposeful and legible. The voice’s confidence matches the character’s learned austerity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: images carry multiple jobs, and repetition (“pulse,” “bone”) is motif, not loop. Sentences vary in length and cadence, keeping momentum in a quiet mode. A few abstract phrasings appear but don’t blur sense; no figurative muddle at the peak beats. The final line cleanly resolves by image and echoes earlier diction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: harmonic stone-skimming, bone towers as resonant architecture, birds translating a silent compass. The turn from kinetic skill to internal cartography is non-obvious and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (mythic diction, quiet stakes) cohere without obscuring clarity. The conceit commits fully and follows through to a charged renunciation.</comment>
