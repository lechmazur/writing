<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—seeking beauty in the incomplete—is distinct and drives her micro-choices (approaching the water to “tend” discord rather than fix the kite). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific, revealing a perfectionist tension that she reweights by the end. The cost is modest but present: she relinquishes the fantasy of a “perfect” poem and returns the feather. Stakes stay intimate, yet the shift reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of images builds until the kite‑snap disrupts the hush, leading to a conceptual repricing of “woven dawns.” Closure lands on the page through the concrete act of releasing the feather and accepting an imperfect poetics. Orientation is clear from the outset; no causality breaks. The cost is felt in the renunciation of wholeness as an aim.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain is vivid and functional: it produces the hush, the mirror surface that’s ruptured, and the shallows where the feather appears. Environmental specifics recur to charge the final image (the feather returned to the current), not mere postcard imagery. Sensory detail is well‑curated across sight, sound, and touch. Setting meaningfully shapes the outcome and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding a truthful way to write—tightens when the kite snaps and discord intrudes, forcing a stance: harmonize vs. fix. The discovery and use of the feather deepen options rather than create a hard reversal; escalation is quiet but coherent. Cost is internal (abandoning perfectionism) and lands via action. Pressure is sufficient for the length, though largely interior.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Images (snapped string, feather, rain‑washed lagoon) carry the thematic turn from wholeness to connection effectively. However, several thesis‑forward lines (“completion was a myth, but connection was real”) edge toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The ending’s gesture returns to image, mitigating the didactic notes. Resonance is genuine, if a touch over‑articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks a poet’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and apt. The perceptual signature (attentive, tactile noticing) remains consistent under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; modulation suits the turn. Elevated register feels voice‑justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with varied syntax and few redundancies; images generally cohere. Occasional purple edges and abstract statements slightly slow momentum in the final third. Still, information density is high and the closure image is clear. No significant scaffolding or metaphor muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The kite‑snap/feather as catalyst for a reframed poetics feels fresh within a familiar contemplative mode. The “beauty in fragments” insight is elevated by concrete particulars rather than novelty alone. Risk is moderate but coherent, with a clean final image. Not groundbreaking, yet distinctly and deftly realized.</comment>
