<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—restore quiet—is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (reading crack patterns, aligning the stone, choosing inversion over force) reveal competence under strain. The cost lands as earned exhaustion and the relinquishing of the map. Internal contradiction is subtle (depletion vs. will), not deeply dramatized, keeping this shy of the top band. Still, her embodied focus and tactile engagement with tools and ice feel specific and character‑particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from dissonant noise → diagnostic search → focal alignment → “bloom of hush.” Closure is an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt price (spent energy, map let go), and the lens holds cleanly. Orientation (who/where/what now) is immediate and stable. The cost is modest but legible and tied to the final stance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and ice formations are not mere backdrop; their acoustic logic constrains tactics and provides the decisive focal point. The echo stone as tool-object is fully integrated into the setting’s physics, and the final image is charged by environment (“the harmonic caves breathed again”). Sensory specificity across sound, touch, and light is purposeful and filtered through professional attention. World rules remain consistent and dramatized.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (quiet vs. invasive noise) is clear, with a material tightening: the stone’s initial weakness forces a methodical pivot to pattern-finding and resonance alignment. The reversal is inward (absorb/invert, not blast), aligning agency with theme. The price—drain and surrender of the map—lands, though the external resistance is largely atmospheric rather than adversarial. Tension is steady, texturally escalating to the bloom.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Listening over force, transforming chaos rather than annihilating it, and earned repose emerge organically from action and image. The “bloom of hush” reweights prior motifs (map, crack-tracings, hum) without moralizing. The final stance (“silence itself was the truest guide”) functions as a resonant repricing with emotional afterglow. Complexity is maintained without tidy sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is controlled, with a distinct sensory lexicon keyed to a mapkeeper’s perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates with pressure, avoiding head‑hopping or stance slips. A few lush phrases verge on purple but remain legible and voice‑consistent. No dialogue is needed or missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with strong verbs and concrete images; momentum rarely stalls. Figurative texture is frequent but coherent (“frozen lightning,” “bloom of hush”) and tied to scene logic. Minor repetition (“gently luminous”) and stacked modifiers nibble at concision but do not blur causality or the closure image. Sentence variety supports the swell into silence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—acoustic cartography, energy beings, an echo stone that inverts shriek into harmony, and the coined “bloom of hush”—feels fresh and internally necessary. The resolution routes through specificity (crack signatures as an acoustic map) rather than genre default combat. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off in a memorable final image. A slightly generic label (“energy beings”) is the only small ding on distinctness.</comment>
