<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The guardian’s motive is crystalline and embodied through patient, precise action; the child’s shift from trembling to wonder reads as a credible, earned response. Interiority is largely externalized via image rather than thought, which limits contradiction and layered self‑deception. Still, micro‑choices (mirror angle, shutter width, when to stop) reveal values under pressure. The restraint from speaking functions as character-specific ethos rather than a generic silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene, single focus, with clear anchors and an accumulative/textural drive that tightens through the pattern-building to the held star and the gentle unweaving. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the child’s stance toward darkness is reweighted on the page. Cost is quieter—renunciation of speech and the deliberate, time-consuming craft—but legible. No causality breaks or rule resets; the pattern teaches itself and pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dock, rain, shutters, and canal surface are not postcard décor; they are functional constraints that enable the tactic (reflection, refraction, slit-width control). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through intent, not touristic. The tarnished dental mirror as micro‑setting charges the final image. Tone and environment align to shape choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate and coherent: transform a child’s despair through silent craft. Escalation is an intensifying weave—more lines, more intersections—culminating in the single radiant star and then the intentional dimming. The price is subtle (endurance and withholding overt comfort), which keeps the pressure elegant but soft. One meaningful tightening occurs; a harder visible cost would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through enactment—light made from darkness without speech—rather than sermon, though a few lines name it (“teach darkness the value of stars,” “not its end, but its adornment”). The final cadence (star held, then shutters closed) offers a non‑literal answer about presence and witness. Subtext rides gesture and image, sustaining emotional honesty without schmaltz. Slight explicitness trims the mystique.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person maintains distance and rhythm suited to the ritualistic act; diction is consistent and confident. The perceptual signature favors tactile precision and reflective imagery that mirrors the method. No head‑hopping or register slips, and elision is purposeful. Minor flourish (“spiralingly calm”) is idiosyncratic but not destabilizing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry strong image density with clean syntax and momentum; the action remains legible under the lyric surface. Occasional intensifiers and repeated constructs flirt with overwriting but do not obscure cause/effect. The prose varies sentence rhythm and avoids scaffolding or paraphrase loops. Final image lands clearly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tactic—redirecting starlight with a dental mirror and calibrated shutters to weave constellations on wet water—is striking and memorable. The guardian archetype is refreshed by the method and the accumulative, wordless pedagogy. Risk-taking is purposeful and integrated with stakes and setting. Only the explicitly stated theme notes keep it from an even higher band.</comment>
