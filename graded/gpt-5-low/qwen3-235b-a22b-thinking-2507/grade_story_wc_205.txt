<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (atonement through proof) is clear and intensifies under the storm, and her interior conflict—fervor vs. regret—is embodied in tactile choices (placing the shard, reciting the verse). Her ex‑revolutionary guilt sharpens the final cost without hedging. Varek functions as a focused counter‑pressure that reveals her stance. The closing acceptance of loss reads as an earned endurance/renunciation rather than a neat cure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: storm pressure + delegation demand → Elara’s devised demonstration → irrefutable stabilization → conceptual repricing with cost. The closure lands on the page with a concrete act and a felt price (her mourning of what she destroyed). No major teleports or resets; beats link by because/therefore logic. Slight convenience in the immediate success of the verse/shard combo keeps it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, visible time‑rivers, broken dome, and Oratory mirror are not decorative; they constrain tactics and enable the solution (the river’s light through the dome, the mirror’s placement). Sensory specificity and spatial coherence remain strong under pressure. The shard as tool/object‑as‑setting charges the final image in her palm. World rules emerge through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible (prevent ideological violence by proving the shard’s purpose), with the storm supplying an on‑page crucible. Elara’s choice to act publicly in defiance of Varek tightens options and yields a decisive turn. The price is internal but concrete in the ending’s foreclosed path to restoration. Tension scales from ideological debate to embodied peril cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around science vs. dogma, revolution’s unintended erasures, and rituals as engineered compassion; the final image reprices the civilization’s wisdom. However, lines like “We destroyed the very wisdom we needed…” and “They didn’t cover mirrors to hide…” tilt toward stated thesis, slightly dulling subtext. The sorrow is earned through particulars (dust, cold shard, calm mirror) and lingers. Complexity remains—victory without solace.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric yet controlled voice suits Elara’s poetic mind and holds under stress; psychic distance modulates cleanly. Dialogue is brief, goal‑driven, and reveals status dynamics without exposition bloat. Diction remains consistent with the world’s register. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is vivid with strong noun‑verb choices and purposeful imagery; momentum rarely stalls. Occasional high‑gloss phrases flirt with purple but stay coherent and scene‑driven. No noticeable loops or scaffold clutter, and sentence rhythm adapts well at the climax. Minor moralizing moments soften edge but do not blur closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Visible time, mirror rituals as engineered temporal stabilizers, and a baroque asteroid create a striking synthesis. The demonstration twist feels earned by seeded lore and character traits (poetic recitation). The final repricing—ritual as science, victory as loss—reads fresh and inevitable. Risk‑taking is high without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
