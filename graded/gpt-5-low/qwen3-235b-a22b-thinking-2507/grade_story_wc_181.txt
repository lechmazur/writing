<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Aris’s interiority is specific and embodied—“brightened disquiet,” the lavatory refuge, the tactile weight of the shell—grounding his bewilderment in concrete choices. The directive “Observe. Do not interact.” sets a credible internal conflict that he breaks, revealing character under pressure. The leap to epiphany is earned by prior sensory anchors, though the moral cost of violating the Archive could be more explicitly felt. His final act—replacing the cameo—credibly forecloses a path and accepts consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: arrival → discovery of shell → bathroom breakthrough → test in orchard → revelation → loop closure via burial. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing coupled with a decisive physical act, reconfiguring meaning of “inheritance” and his role. Cost is primarily conceptual/social (forsaking linear time and breaching the directive), which reads but isn’t heavily stressed. Orientation is crisp from the outset; one controlled transition maintains coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Astral Orchard is vividly, economically rendered and functionally active: blossoms respond to the shell, enabling the etching and loop revelation. The cramped lavatory micro‑setting modulates pressure and frames the breakthrough. Details are filtered through Aris’s curator sensibility, keeping description purposeful. The environment charges the final image (the burial) rather than serving as a postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (pursuing forbidden knowledge versus non‑interference) tightens with each beat, culminating in a choice that commits him to the loop. Escalation is internal but coherent under a causal lens: inquiry compels testing, which narrows options. The felt price is more intellectual than visceral; the risk to his role/status is implied rather than dramatized. Still, the loop closure forecloses alternatives in a meaningful way at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around non‑linear inheritance and the ethics of knowledge, culminating in the garden/time image that reweights the story. Subtext operates through the shell’s blankness filling with “remembered” images and the orchard’s responsiveness. The explicit thesis statements (“Non‑linear inheritance isn’t about…”) slightly flatten mystery, nudging into tell. Nonetheless, the final acceptance scene resonates beyond plot mechanics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The close third voice is consistent, textured, and modulates with pressure; diction choices (“simply complicated,” “brightened disquiet”) create a distinct signature. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference matches what Aris can plausibly know. Occasional abstract phrasing skirts exposition but stays anchored by concrete sensory cues. Rhythm varies appropriately between lyric observation and decisive action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and purposeful, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Recurrent phrases work as motifs rather than loops, though the explicit philosophizing risks slight over‑explanation. Syntax and imagery stay controlled; no figurative muddle in peak beats. The final sentence lands cleanly, recharging prior images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pistachio cameo blank as time‑carrier in a cosmic orchard feels fresh, with the bathroom breakthrough adding idiosyncratic charm. The time‑loop is familiar but revitalized via “non‑linear inheritance” and object memory. Integration across setting, object, and concept is tight and character‑driven. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity.</comment>
