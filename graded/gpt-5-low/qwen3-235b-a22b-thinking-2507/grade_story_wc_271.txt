<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and contradictions are embodied: the freeze, the deliberate reach for the photo, the sensory grounding, and the return to planting reveal a credible, costly endurance. The trauma is dramatized through physical cues rather than labels, though a few terms (“somatic markers,” “pearl of stillness”) flirt with therapy‑speak. Micro‑choices under pressure are clear and aligned with her values. The final refusal to surrender reads as earned stasis with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene structure with a clean arc: gull cry triggers panic, she escalates into deeper freeze, then methodically grounds and resumes work. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; density builds, culminating in a charged, purposeful resumption. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost and no soft reset. Orientation is clear from the outset (arboretum on a cliff, automated lighthouse), and there are no causality lapses.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cliffside arboretum, salt wind, and automated lighthouse are tactile and specific, consistently filtered through Elara’s priorities. Environment and recurring objects (photo, trowel) constrain and enable choices, and the harsh coastal conditions charge the final image of planting against erosion. Sensory detail is well balanced (touch, smell, sound) and purpose‑driven. World logic (automation, erosion) coheres without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (remain present and continue the work vs. panic) is explicit and tested by a coherent, escalating pressure. The freeze is a meaningful tightening that narrows options; grounding tactics cost effort and risk failure. Resolution is an earned refusal with on‑page price. Quiet conflict, but never static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of realism vs. optimism and tending beauty amid erosion emerge through concrete acts and recurring images (photo, sea holly, lighthouse). The final “compass” image reweights prior material without needing a plot moral. A brief declarative pair (“Optimism wasn’t… Realism was…”) edges toward thesis stating, softening the subtlety. Overall, resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct sensory signature and measured lyricism. Diction occasionally leans clinical (“somatic markers”), but it remains plausible for the character and integrated into action. Rhythm modulates with pressure, sustaining clarity. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, vivid, and mostly economical; images carry multiple jobs. Minor redundancy and a few elevated abstractions prevent a higher score, but momentum holds and syntax varies well. Figurative language stays coherent; no muddle at the peak beat. The final image lands crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Grief‑and‑grounding is familiar territory, yet the coastal arboretum, automation backdrop, and tactile coping method feel particular. The crumpled photo and “pearl of stillness” thread create a specific synthesis. Not radically reinventive, but emotionally precise and thematically integrated. Risks are quiet and controlled rather than flamboyant.</comment>
