<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s professional mindset and guarded openness are specific and consistent, and her choices (comparing reels, overlaying surveys, clearing ivy, waiting on rain) are well motivated. Interiority is embodied (“breath fogging the lens,” hum through her palms) rather than abstract. The internal contradiction (skepticism vs. welcome for revelation) is present but not deeply stressed under pressure. The emotional turn at the hum feels earned, though the personal cost is quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: footage comparison → inference about blocked fissure → gentle restoration of airflow → rain catalyzes the whisper. Orientation is swift and stable; single scene coherence holds. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost as fresco fragments wash into the earth, reconfiguring the site’s meaning. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a lyric overlay and stays consistent through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The vault, henge, fissure, and weather are tactile, selective, and used as constraints—light angles, roots, rain, and airflow all govern tactics. Tools (Super 8 reels, vellum overlays, brush) integrate with the environment rather than decorate it. The setting charges the final image (the vault “breathing,” frescoes “weeping”). World rules (resonance via airflow) remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reopening the chapel—tightens as options narrow from footage analysis to a single fissure and the patient wait for weather. The reversal is subtle but clear when overgrowth is identified as the silencer, forcing a precise, non‑destructive tactic. Cost is more conceptual/emotional than material, but the fresco loss and the renunciation of force register. The escalation remains coherent and protagonist‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silence reframed as presence emerges organically through action and image (airflow, light shafts, roots sealing/unyielding). The final hum reweights prior details and offers a resonant non‑literal answer about listening and connection across time. The explicit line “Silence is not absence” risks slight didacticism but is plausibly a survey note and earned by the scene. Ambiguity lingers around cost and preservation without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to a map framer’s sensibility (isobars, erosion lines, angles of light). Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate with pressure without head‑hopping. Purposeful lyricism is taught early and remains legible through closure. No dialogue; the narrative stance remains cohesive and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, method, mood) with minimal scaffold; sentences vary and propel. Figurative language (“saints into ghosts,” “vault breathing”) is vivid without muddle, and mixed metaphors are avoided. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple but do not blur sense or slow momentum. Opening and closing images are strong and interlinked.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—archaeological lyric with film analysis, airflow acoustics, and a map framer’s ethos—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The Super 8 method and resonance concept avoid cliché and shape real choices. The “shielded openness” stance is a distinctive tonal risk that pays off in the quiet climax. The final conceptual reweighting is memorable without gimmickry.</comment>
