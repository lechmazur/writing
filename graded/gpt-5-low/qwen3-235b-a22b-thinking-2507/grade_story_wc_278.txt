<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motive (to hush guilt) threads through concrete choices, culminating in the risky tether ritual. Interiority is specific (amber, Lyra, “meteor hush”) and not therapy‑speak. The coincidence of finding precisely relevant letters is a slight softener, but Aris’s agency remains primary. The ending earns an endurance shift, not a tidy cure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal spine: firmware cry → letters’ reframing → ritual tether → hush. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: silence is achieved but cost persists. The letters verge on convenience yet function as a motivated reveal housed in the console, keeping causality intact. Cost is legible in channeling terror and in the acceptance of lingering grief.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds, resonator cabinet, and amber are vivid, tactile, and rule‑consistent. Setting actively constrains tactics (hidden compartment, unstable firmware, time‑fold) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Aris’s priorities. The environment meaningfully shapes the solution and the last tableau.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent; escalation tightens from eerie hush to the intolerable translated cry, prompting a committed ritual. The tether choice forecloses flight and risks self‑harm by channeling terror. The price is felt but could be sharpened with one more beat of physical or psychic toll during the channeling. Resolution arises from Aris’s agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, translation, and turning sound into mercy emerge through objects and acts rather than statements. The mother’s letters reweight blame across time; the final hush reframes silence as grace, not avoidance. Ambiguity remains humane—guilt is hushed, not erased—creating lingering resonance. No sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical register that matches subject and pressure. Diction and rhythm modulate effectively from tense to ceremonial without head‑hopping or register slips. Patterned motifs (hush, Lyra, amber) are voice‑true and paid off. No withholding beyond purposeful, legible elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do multiple jobs (amber as relic, tool, and reweighted symbol). Metaphoric texture is rich but cohesive to sound/silence; few to no loops or scaffolds. A touch of elevated phrasing edges toward purple but remains disciplined by action. Closing cadence is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Haunted firmware that translates baby cries” fused with amber‑ink tethering is boldly specific and emotionally credible within its logic. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight given seeded motifs. Risks (ritual line from machine to skin; time‑fold ambiance) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
