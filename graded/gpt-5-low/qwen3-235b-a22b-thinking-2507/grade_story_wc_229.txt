<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Eli’s motive—save the Marigold and vindicate Mara’s lesson—is clear and intensifies under pressure. His restraint (weeping instead of cheering, refusing to shout) reveals contradictory impulses handled in scene. Embodied detail (sea-slicked stone, aching throat, trembling fingers) grounds emotion. Minor idealization of his belief system trims some ambiguity but not momentum.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative texture dominant: pressure coheres from heat‑shattered systems to scent‑borne intent. Closure lands on page as the bow turns and Eli chooses silence, with a felt cost in withheld celebration. Orientation is clean from the opening sentence, and set‑ups (dead lamp, foghorn’s limits) pay off. The price is quiet but legible in his self‑suppression and tears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, fog, and dawn are vivid and functional—lamp warped, foghorn useless—forcing Eli’s alternative tactic. Sensory weave is rich across touch, smell, and soundlessness, with the cobalt paint and lingering scent charging the final image. Details are selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. Strong object‑as‑setting use with the vial and railing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is singular and present early: avert the reef disaster. Escalation tightens from sighting the dying flare to the deliberate turn, driven by Eli’s chosen method and the risk of failing quietly. The visible price is restraint and the gamble on a “fool’s hope.” A secondary complication could have sharpened the squeeze, but the single decisive tightening suffices.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of quiet, precise love versus brute force integrates through recurring images and the method itself. The closing sentence reweights the premise effectively, but lines like “love travels farthest when it doesn’t demand to be heard” edge into articulated moral. Subtext otherwise rides gesture (not cheering, the cork as anchor). Resonance is earned but slightly overdeclared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical yet controlled POV with a distinct sensory lexicon (“midnight violets,” “garden’s breath”) that matches Eli’s inner life. Distance remains steady; no head‑hopping and no gratuitous exposition. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the turning of the bow. Elevated diction fits the fable‑like register and rarely overreaches.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with strong cadence and clean mechanics. A few moments flirt with purple (“vibrations of intent… hummed in his bones,” “each drop a purified wish”), but they remain legible and purposeful. No meaningful loops or scaffold; momentum holds. Minor density excess in figurative stacking keeps it below the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—beckoning a ship via scent‑borne intention—feels fresh, and “screaming tenderness” reframes heroism. Familiar lighthouse stakes are reimagined through an unexpected tool and ethic. The mother’s garden and Mara’s aphorism braid into a singular stance. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity.</comment>
