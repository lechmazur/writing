<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Aris’s motive and methods are vivid and consistent—“hands‑on folklorist” is dramatized through scraping, diving, and using a sextant. Interiority is concrete (salt‑crusted goggles, trembling glove), and the moment of reframing the witch from thief to guardian reads earned. The internal conflict (resentment vs. yearning) is present but resolved a bit smoothly. Emotional cost is felt but leans gentle rather than thorny.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, each step (“study shards” → “trace aberrations” → “find ring” → “touch” → “revelation”) follows and tightens. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual repricing plus a decisive shift (memories restored, forgiveness). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and props/rules pay off. The only soft spot is how safely the resolution arrives once the method works.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard/greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is indelible and functional; broken panes and their “constellations” directly shape tactics and outcome. Tools (goggles, sextant, headlamp) and environment (silt, algae, caps) are integrated into action. The setting charges the final image of ascent and peace. Detail selection is purposeful and filtered through Aris’s professional lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover memories) is clear, and escalation is coherent: mapping anomalies to coordinates to tactile risk. The fairy ring touch is a meaningful tightening choice that cannot be walked back. Costs land primarily as emotional reweighting rather than jeopardy, so pressure feels elegant but not harrowing. Still, the internal/external weave works at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of preservation vs. theft, ritual/habit, and the gentler truth of guardianship arise from concrete acts and recurring images (constellations, ring). The final repricing (“The witch hadn’t stolen…”) resonates and reweights prior assumptions. A touch of explicit statement trims ambiguity, edging toward telling. The closing breath above the wrecks offers a clean, earned echo without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident close third with a measured lyric texture; diction matches a seasoned folklorist-diver. Rhythm varies well, carrying momentum through description without clogging. No POV leakage or unearned omniscience; inference reads as inference. The voice modulates under pressure (trembling, quickening pulse) while staying controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—image, action, and thought—without scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is rich but disciplined; metaphors (serpent spine, broken teeth) cohere to the watery ruin. Syntax varies and sequencing is clear. A few explicit explanatory lines slightly dilute compression but do not impede propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: underwater greenhouse astronomy via shattered glass to detect a memory‑keeping witch is striking and specific. The reconfiguration at the end reads inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric method, myth fused with fieldwork) heighten stakes without confusion. The piece commits to its premise and follows through cleanly.</comment>
