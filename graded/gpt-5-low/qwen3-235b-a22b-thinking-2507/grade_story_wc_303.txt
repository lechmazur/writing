<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives (protective idealism vs. pragmatic capitulation) are clear and intensify under pressure, culminating in a costly renunciation. Interiority is embodied and specific (“mulberry ache,” tactile gardening pain) with credible contradictory impulses (play to shatter will vs. surrender to protect the idea). Micro-choices—propagating by splitting the root, taking only a drop, handing over the violin—reveal values under duress. Vorlag’s brief on‑page presence cleanly pressures a final stance without diluting Elara’s centrality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: a live clock and converging forces compel a stance at closure. Causal steps are coherent (plant warning → coffee divination → propagation → nectar repair → confrontation → renunciation) and the cost is visible (losing the violin). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the object is surrendered while the propagated hope shifts meaning. No orientation debt; world logic supports the miraculous growth under solstice rules seeded earlier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (velvet observatory, glacial violin, dew‑laden garden, solstice moon) are filtered through Elara’s priorities and constrain choices (the solstice window, soldiers climbing the tower). Objects-as-setting (violin, bloom) function spatially and symbolically to charge the final image. The environment evolves with action (garden to observatory to breach), maintaining spatial and tonal coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens: plant warnings and the clock precipitate a risky propagation; success raises the moral cost at the door when a coercive solution (playing) is possible but ethically fraught. The renunciation forecloses a live path and exacts a price (loss of relic, potential imperial misuse). Stakes stay focused (dream vs. empire) without telescoping or soft resets.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonance is strong—seeds vs. objects, choice as perforated destiny—and the final image reweights meaning toward silent, patient defiance. Subtext operates through the garden act and the withheld power of performance. However, the explicit statement “destiny wasn’t in objects, but in seeds sown unseen” edges into thematic spelling‑out in the last paragraph, slightly dulling the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyrical texture; diction and perception feel character‑specific to an attuned, plant‑hearing researcher. Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative description to urgent action, with clean mechanics and a credible single line of dialogue. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elisions serve pressure rather than hide information.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled and propulsive despite lushness; images carry multiple jobs (tone, world, stakes). A few stacked metaphors push toward purple, but clarity and momentum hold in peak beats. No scaffold or loop artifacts; sentence variety supports pacing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ice‑crystal violin, plant telepathy, and solstice propagation synthesize into a fresh, coherent mythos. The decision to surrender a newly mended, powerful object to protect a subtler seed of resistance feels non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risks in tone and concept pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
