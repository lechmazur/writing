<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives (decode anomalies, warn rebels) are clear and intensify under pressure. Her split between “scatterbrained” performance and razor‑focused craft reads embodied (thimble drop, mirrored glass). Fear and composure coexist convincingly as the guard passes. Minor safety: her competence borders on smooth, with little on‑page cost beyond risk.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: hidden coordinates → plan keyed to dome’s rotation → timed signal → received reply. Orientation is precise early; single scene holds. Closure lands as a decisive transmission with a confirming blink, risk priced in. The cost is mostly implied, not suffered on the page, but pressure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory’s mechanisms and the eternal candle constrain tactics (heat‑ink reveal, slit alignment, mirror signal). Sensory texture is rich and POV‑filtered without excess. The final stitched candle image recharges earlier objects. Space and tools evolve with action rather than sitting as décor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (get the warning out before the coup) is clear and tightened by the seven‑minute window and the guard’s proximity. The turn is the dome’s alignment window hitting under watch, forcing the fumble‑act cover. Cost is chiefly exposure risk; no overt loss, but commitment is tested. Tension scales plausibly to the blink reply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of “wisdom masked as foolishness” and “listening for unheard stories” is enacted through craft and subterfuge, not stated. Light/candle motifs accrue meaning and culminate in a quiet, resonant final stitch. The reply’s single blink reframes “silence” as charged signal. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers around the coming cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third is steady, lyrical yet controlled; diction fits Elara’s meticulous, observatory‑tuned mind. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext and status dynamics. Rhythm tightens at the timed beats without muddle. No head‑hopping or unjustified elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is precise and multi‑tasking; images earn their keep (phosphorescent ink, brass instruments). Minor lushness never obscures cause/effect. Sentence and paragraph rhythms support momentum and hush. No notable loops or mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Spycraft via embroidery and telescope mechanics with a candle‑mirror code feels fresh. The coup framework is familiar, but the craft‑based tactic and tone distinguish it. Turns arise from established constraints rather than late contrivance. Specificity yields originality without gimmickry.</comment>
