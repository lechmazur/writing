<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aris’s motive—discovering the color of sound—anchors every choice and stays legible through concrete acts (descending, decoding, testing vows). Interiority is specific (synesthesia, the grandmother’s riddle) but shows limited contradictory impulses under pressure; fear, doubt, or competing values rarely interfere. The closing renunciation is quiet but earned: he closes the book and accepts an inward compass at a cost of leaving mysteries submerged for now. Strong, if more gravitas under strain could deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from festival → descent → cipher → chromatic revelation → inward compass. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: sound’s color is real but interpretable only through darkness/light, and the compass points inward. Cost reads as a chosen restraint and acceptance of partial knowledge rather than spectacle; it’s present but subtle. Orientation is clean from the outset; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The harbor, the rusted ladder, the tide-locked sunken library, and the lanterns are vividly tactile and consistently filtered through Aris’s senses. Environment constrains choices (lowest tide window, wading, intact doorway) and charges the final image when a sky lantern reflects into the library, fusing gold with emerald tone. Tools and objects (lantern, key tag) are integrated, not scenic. World rules are learned by action rather than dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around time (lowest tide, festival) and the physical risk of the wreck, with escalation via the deciphering and intensification to the projection moment. The dominant stake is internal discovery; external hazard stays background, so the felt price is modest. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the tag’s etchings align and unlock the vows. Effective, if low on jeopardy and trade-off complexity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme arises from specifics: vows as absorbed echoes, synesthetic seeing, and the compass’s inward turn—knowledge requiring both darkness and light. The last image reweights prior motifs without over-explanation, though one line (“its compass pointed not north, but inward…”) flirts with on-the-nose. Emotional aftereffect is earned through image and implication rather than sermon. Strong coherence with room for subtler phrasing at the moral edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyric, and consistently tethered to Aris’s perceptual signature (sound-color mapping, tool-awareness, tactile details). Psychic distance stays steady; no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Elevated diction matches the contemplative, ritualized night-work and quest tone. Minor risk of lushness is managed without blur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multifold loads—atmosphere, action, and motif—while maintaining clarity; rhythm varies and momentum holds. A few intensifiers (“meteor hush,” accumulated modifiers) edge toward purple but don’t obscure sense. No obvious loops or scaffold lines; information density is high. Final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—a tide-revealed ship library of luminous vows, a ciphered hotel tag, synesthetic questing, and sky lantern reflections—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Turns grow from seeded particulars (the grandmother’s riddle, the tag, the lectern) rather than late rule changes. The risk of high lyricism pays off with conceptual clarity at closure. Distinctive and memorable.</comment>
