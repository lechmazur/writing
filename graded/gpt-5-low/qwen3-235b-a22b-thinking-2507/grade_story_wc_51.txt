<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is concrete and enacted through micro-choices (lamp orientation, wrist rotation), and her burden-logic feels character-specific. The “fractal weaver’s curse” deepens interior conflict without feeling like label-speak. The faint smile at the end reads as earned endurance/renunciation with cost. A touch more contradiction under peak stress could elevate this further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual repetitions escalate from revealing small burden to the rope-shaped betrayal and the snow sealing the entrance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: trapped again, she accepts and recommits with visible cost (“weight sinking into her bones,” entrance sealed). Orientation is clear early and consistent. The causal web is coherent, though not razor-tight, befitting the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, starlight seams, and the lamp function as micro-setting constraints that directly shape tactics and the final image. Environmental elements evolve (first snowmelt to first true snow) and press the ending shut. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, especially the bronze hum and the weeping burden. A strong, integrated setting that avoids postcard staticness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect burdens under hostile stillness) is signaled early and tightened by the betrayal-stone and the entrance sealing. Agency drives the turns through ritual alignment and careful handling. The price is felt but the danger remains mostly atmospheric rather than physically jeopardizing, keeping tension high but not acute. Still, the cadence shift at the snow’s sealing provides a clear escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thematic weave of consequence, grief, and transmutation (calcify/soften) accrues through particulars. The ending reweights prior images—the lamp as companion, burdens as craft material—without moralizing. The “fractal weaver” premise ties choices to consequence with conceptual bite. Ambiguity lingers productively around whether collection redeems or perpetuates the curse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric voice is confident, image-forward, and consistent with Elara’s perception; no head-hopping or stance drift. Recurrent diction (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) is patterned rather than repetitive. Rhythm modulates to land turns (flame flares; hush fractures). A few dense metaphor stacks flirt with purple but stay legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with strong verbs and integrated imagery; sentences usually do more than one job. Minor over-density (metaphor-on-metaphor) appears in peak beats but doesn’t obscure action. No scaffold or synonym loops; progression remains clear. Precision could tighten a few lush lines for added propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise and imagistics feel fresh—the ritualized optics, burden-minerals, and bronze acoustics cohere into an original system. Risks in diction and concept mostly pay off, and the closure image is non-obvious yet inevitable. Emotional truth (accepting entrapment to continue the work) grounds the strangeness. Slightly gentler stakes prevent a higher leap.</comment>
