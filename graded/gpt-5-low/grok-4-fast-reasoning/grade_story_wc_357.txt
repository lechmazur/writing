<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and competent, tactically driven choices under pressure (anchors, following the Cascade). Interiority is serviceable but thin—few contradictory impulses or embodied conflict beyond “heart raced.” The final pocketing of the tip reads as gain with little on-page cost or moral friction. Distinctive occupational texture helps, but the arc feels low-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Coherent causal chain: inversion → anchors → echoes → vortex → discovery. Orientation is clean and the single-scene progression holds, but the closure’s cost is soft—responsibility is implied rather than felt. The ending functions as a conceptual repricing more than a decisive change, which is valid but modest in impact. Setups generally pay off without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, integrated worldbuilding (floating arches, dual suns, luminous rivers) that constrains tactics (anchors, water-guidance). Environmental rules stay consistent and shape action during inversion. Strong sensory economy and a clear professional gaze. The setting charges the final image, though not to a transformative 9-band level.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (survive inversion, find source) are clear, and the inversion beat is the lone meaningful tightening. However, obstacles glide aside; once the anchors hold, the path to the vortex and artifact is relatively frictionless. Costs and trade-offs are minimal, so tension plateaus after discovery. Agency is present but rarely tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Resilience, stewardship, and ancestral continuity accrue through images (echoes, orchards, the arrow’s legacy). The visions reweight the premise effectively, avoiding overt moralizing. Resonance is real but tidy, with limited ambivalence or lingering ethical price. The thematic aftertaste is thoughtful rather than haunting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with controlled diction and a distinct perceptual bias (water, arches, inversion tech). Lyric inflections (“whirling silence”) are patterned and legible without head-hopping. Rhythm varies well through the inversion. Minor repetition keeps it shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean sentences with good momentum; information density is solid and images carry multiple jobs. Occasional purple tilt and motif repetition (“whirling silence,” “echoes”) skim redundancy but don’t obscure causality. Syntax and paragraphing breathe with the action. No significant artifacts or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—orchard pilots, gravity flips, water-navigation, auditory echoes guiding discovery feels fresh. The relic’s agrarian twist (accelerated growth) smartly ties to the planet’s logic. Discovery-as-resolution is a familiar move that slightly tempers ingenuity at the end. Still, the specific combination reads memorable and coherent.</comment>
