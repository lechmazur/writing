<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s drive (to master her precognition and honor a promise) is clear and coherently embodied in the ritual. Doubt and compulsion coexist on the page, though micro-choices beyond the stone placements are limited. Interiority is vivid but sometimes leans abstract, softening the sense of contradictory impulses under pressure. The final step into the aurora feels motivated, if not hard-costed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative structure is clean: preparation → activation → revelation → step. The closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive act, but the emotional/physical cost at the edge is implied more than pressed. Causal scaffolding (aurora energizes dust; eels amplify) holds without contradictions. Orientation is strong from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>World and micro-setting are richly specific (frictionless sea, aurora’s electromagnetic caress) and meaningfully operative. The environment actively enables the method and charges the final image. Detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s pattern-obsessed lens. Occasional lushness risks saturation but never erases spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (master the curse/find the mentor) are signaled early and deepen when the mandala hums and futures align. Escalation is primarily internal and procedural; external pressure is minimal, so the felt price of stepping through is muted. The one meaningful tightening—activation revealing the mentor—is effective. Some tension dissipates into wonder rather than sharpened trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: control vs surrender to pattern, promise as duty, vision’s cost reweighted into purpose. Recurring images (borrowed dawn, eels, spiral) develop in concert with the arc and re-tone the ending. A few lines verge on stated uplift (“the world after friction’s end felt whole”), slightly flattening the ambiguity. The final image still invites reflection without a stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person is consistent, with a distinct sensory and conceptual palette tied to Elara’s obsessions. Rhythm modulates well, though metaphor density occasionally crowds breath in peak beats. No dialogue needed; focalization remains steady and plausible. The voice feels confident without head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lines are polished and image-forward, with solid propulsion for a lyric mode. However, clusters of modifiers and echoing motifs create mild purple pressure and occasional redundancy. Most sentences do dual work (world + action), and syntax varies. The closure paragraph reads cleanly despite lushness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—frictionless world, eel herding, star-dusted Fibonacci mandala under aurora—feels striking and coherent. The ritual logic grows organically from character and setting. The turn to reunion reads earned, not gimmicked. Minor familiar cadences (“sacred patterns”) slightly temper the singularity.</comment>
