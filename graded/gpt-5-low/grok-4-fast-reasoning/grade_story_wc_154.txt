<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—bridging divides through language—drives concrete micro-choices (wiping the cast, decrypting, transcribing). Interiority is specific and embodied, with the coral talisman revealing worldview. The conflict remains mostly internal with limited contradictory impulses or cost. Still, the final resolve feels earned from her actions.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the deciphering accrues until the ending’s resonant reconfiguration (“ache softening into quiet resolve”). Orientation is clear early: who/where/when and the anesthetic clock are legible. Closure is on-page and coherent, though the cost is quiet and primarily conceptual. The scene maintains a single throughline without fractures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium, shattered skylights, and humidifiers mimic the boy’s coastal fog, weaving environment and theme. The brain coral functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. While atmosphere is rich and purposeful, the setting seldom constrains tactics. Strong sense of place without turning into postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (healing through meaning-sharing), and pressure deepens via deciphering the notes and the anesthetic’s progression. There’s a gentle escalation from smudged fragments to a full familial story. However, options rarely narrow, and visible cost is modest. The turn lands, but tension remains low-grade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motifs—mist, sea, coral, grafting—cohere around shared anxiety and communal healing. The final image reweights prior material without over-explaining. A few lines edge toward on-the-nose (“In this act, she grafted new meaning”), but the piece largely earns its insights via particulars. Emotional aftereffect is tender rather than sentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and character-filtered; diction fits a reflective translator under strain. Rhythm modulates well between observation and action. Minor tics (repetition of “lotus-hearted,” slightly precious phrasing) don’t break control. POV remains clean and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lines are clear and largely efficient, with evocative images (“silvery haze,” “brain coral fragment”) doing double duty. Some redundancies (“fragile lives”/“fragile peace”) and repeated adjectives soften impact. Figurative density skirts purple but stays coherent. Momentum holds through the scene without scaffold detours.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The translator decrypting a child’s cast in a mist-made surrogate homeland is a fresh angle. The coral talisman as cognitive-emotional bridge is memorable. While the war-hospital frame is familiar, the synthesis feels specific and sincere. The quiet reconfiguration avoids cliché through concrete, interleaved detail.</comment>
