<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Leeward’s motivation—to turn obstacles into instruments—is clear and enacted under pressure, especially when he “dubs” the apple tree and planks. Interiority is largely lyric-conceptual rather than conflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses or a meaningful internal trade-off. Competence dominates struggle, trimming the felt cost of his choice. Still, actions align tightly with motive and reveal a distinctive worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build is coherent: storm threat → cloud interpretation → fractal sketching → dubbing → transformed storm. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard’s music absorbs impact and the final image seals the stance. Cost is mostly situational risk rather than a concrete loss, but the pressure chain holds. Orientation is clean from the outset, and no causality breaks appear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard and storm shape tactics and outcome; weather literally pressures choices, and the mallet/tree/driftwood operate as micro-setting constraints. Sensory texture is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Leeward’s musician-prophet attention. World rules (resonance/fractals) are learned through action, not exposition. The final image is charged by setting-elements (mallet lowered; sea calmed) that constrained earlier moves.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the orchard by harmonizing the storm—tightens credibly as the storm breaks. The key turn is Leeward’s dubbing and expansion of fractal resonance across the circle, converting threat into bass line. The price paid is mostly risk/endurance rather than a felt loss, which keeps escalation just shy of peak intensity. Still, agency drives resolution rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting adversity into art emerges organically through concrete acts (sketched resonance; dubbing obstacles into instruments). The final claim—“no barrier endured that couldn't be restrung into symphony”—edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly flattening ambiguity. Subtext hums in image (restless → resolute euphony) and the orchard’s survival as a reweighted rule-set. Resonance lingers, but neatness trims depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently focalized through Leeward’s perceptual idiom; elevated diction feels earned by the mythic register. Rhythms modulate with pressure from anticipatory hush to storm-thickened cadence to release. The single spoken word “Dub” lands as a tonal strike rather than exposition. No head-hopping or stance drift appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images pull multiple duties (soundscape, tactic, theme). A few phrases verge on purple or lightly repetitive (“restless euphony” recurrence), but momentum holds and syntax varies. Information density is high without obscuring cause/effect. The final cadence is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orchard on driftwood, a tide prophet conducting a storm via fractal resonance and “dub” is strikingly fresh and coherent. The imaginative synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight once the mallet and cloud-reading are grounded in action. Risks in lyric-conceptual worldbuilding pay off without confusion. Small familiar notes (“forgotten melody”) don’t dent the singular vision.</comment>
