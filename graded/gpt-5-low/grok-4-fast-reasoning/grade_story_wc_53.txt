<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—salvaging meaning from eroded ambitions—drives concrete choices (scavenging, bargaining) under pressure. Interiority is textured and embodied (“boots splashing through shallow pools”), with credible contradiction between regret and resolve. The renunciation (not reclaiming the wheel but weaving regrets) reads earned. Slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in places prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: debris-gathering → ghost confrontation → negotiation → reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (accepting the lost wheel and choosing a new narrative). Orientation is clear early; the pattern is taught and paid off. Escalation is modest but coherent and sufficient for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and halted carousel are vivid, rule-consistent, and functionally constrain action (suspended droplets, debris as resources). The environment charges the final image and shapes tactics (scavenging fragments that literally float). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s aim. World rules are learned via observation and use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvaging self through regret) is clear, and pressure tightens at the ghost’s accusation. Elara’s tactic shift—offering others’ fragments—narrows options and entails a price (abandoning retrieval of her own device). The conflict remains primarily internal; a sharper external constraint or counter-move might deepen cost. Still, the negotiation beat reads as a meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of ambition’s erosion and the ethics of memory emerges from particulars (ticket whisper, builder’s gear). The final reweighting—choosing to weave regrets rather than recapture lost exposures—lands without moralizing. Subtext in the object and setting avoids heavy-handed allegory. A few explicit lines risk stating the premise, slightly dulling the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical close-third voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature and controlled cadence. Diction suits the surreal setting without breaking POV plausibility. Dialogue, sparse yet pointed, carries subtext (“You threw it away”) and advances the turn. Minor elevations toward abstraction don’t disrupt stance or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, rhythmic, and mostly high-density; images earn their keep. Occasional ornamentation edges toward purple, but the figurative web is coherent with few redundancies. Sentences vary and propel momentum through the negotiation. No major loops or scaffold artifacts blunt the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon–carousel conceit and the “whispers as salvage” tactic feel fresh and integrated. The ghost negotiation via collected fragments is an inventive pressure solution that reconfigures the premise. Risks in tone and worldbuilding pay off with coherence. Slight familiarity in the regret/ambition theme keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
