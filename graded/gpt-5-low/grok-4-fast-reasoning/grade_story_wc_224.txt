<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elowen’s desire to reclaim “the shape of home” opposes her avoidance of pain, creating credible internal friction. Micro-choices (touching the stone with the feather, “seeding” the invocation) align with that motive and escalate under pressure. Embodied emotion and tangible costs (“threatening to erase the present”) keep her change earned. A slight tendency toward lyric abstraction occasionally blurs lived, immediate texture under peak stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: nightly substitutions and decoding build to the final invocation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: illusions shift from escape to bridge, with the cost of integrating painful memory made explicit. Setups (stone/feather/thunder) pay off cleanly at the mountain-core climax. Causality is lyrical but coherent; no critical gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain-spanning labyrinth and cavern core are vivid and integral, shaping movement, mood, and the end image (“the labyrinth her new, expansive home”). Micro-setting objects (stone, feather) function as tools that constrain tactics. Weather and depth (winds, thunder in the mountain’s belly) modulate pressure. A hair shy of perfect because spatial constraint rarely forces a concrete, on-page obstacle choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaim home without erasing the present—is legible early and tightens as thunder/peril intensify. The key turn is Elowen’s decision to “seed the final invocation,” accepting pain to transform the illusions’ function. The cost (loss integrated, present at risk) is explicit and felt. Escalation is primarily internal but reads as earned and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of buried talents, loss vs. longing, and home-as-process emerges through recurring images (stone, feather, thunder) and the final bridge image. The decoded line (“Home is the curve of shadow against light…”) toes the edge of thesis but is grounded by the decoding act and its consequences. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person focalization is steady, with a distinct mythic cadence that modulates as pressure rises. Diction stays coherent to the world and character; no head-hopping or stance slips. Occasional density risks purple, but the voice remains controlled and purposeful. No dialogue needed for this mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with varied rhythm; metaphors are largely coherent (“hidden thunder,” “glass-veined eyes”). Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum holds. A few near-stacked images and intensifiers flirt with overwriting in the middle stretch. The final paragraph lands cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis (mountain-sized labyrinth bookstore, mercury-glass seer, feather-as-tactile decoder) feels fresh and necessary. Risks in image-system and accumulative structure pay off at closure. Turns and objects grow from prior particulars rather than late rule changes. The feather’s tactile language-decoding is especially inventive and character-specific.</comment>
