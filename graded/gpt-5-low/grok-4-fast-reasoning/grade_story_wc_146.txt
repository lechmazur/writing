<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elowen’s motivation to restore “shared balance” is clear and consistent, and her actions (striking and adjusting the fork, speaking riddles) align with it. Interiority remains mostly emblematic rather than conflicted; we don’t see contradictory impulses under pressure. The brief interaction with Thorne adds a glint of social dynamic but not a crucible. The endurance choice reads credible but low-cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: footsteps gather, vibration deepens, bells stir, and the final hush reconfigures into breath. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a charged final image (“before the collapse could claim them”), though cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when taught early). The beat-to-beat progression is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ancient archway, cobblestones, and embedded bells are vivid and functionally integrated; environment and tool constrain tactics (steps on stone, keystone strike). The tuning fork as micro-setting recurs and charges the ending image. Sensory specificity is high, with sound/vibration leading the palette appropriately. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (“revival before collapse”) are signaled early and pressure accumulates as footsteps multiply and bells wake. The tightening is mainly density/cadence-based, not a sharp reversal; visible on-page cost is light. Agency shows in Elowen’s patient guidance and deliberate adjustments. The final beat earns a reweighted stance but stops short of a concrete trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres around communal balance restored through coordinated, purposeful motion; the closing image reframes hush as “living breath.” Recurring motifs (hush, rhythm, bells) deepen meaning without overt moralizing. The riddle and the farmer’s beat strengthen subtext about participation and attunement. The resonance lingers beyond plot specifics.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is stable, textured, and suited to the mythic register; diction and cadence feel deliberate. Occasional heightened phrasing skirts purple but remains legible and coherent. Dialogue is sparse yet purposeful and tonally aligned. Psychic distance control is steady with no head-hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with strong sound-and-rhythm control and layered images that carry multiple jobs. Some repetition (“wild hush,” stacked modifiers) edges toward excess but does not blur sense or stall momentum. Sentences vary and propel the accumulative build. No major loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bell-tuning-through-footsteps mechanic and the “wild hush” tonal thesis feel fresh and organic to the world. The synthesis of object, place, and communal action is memorable and not template-based. Risks in lyric density pay off without obscuring clarity. The final reweighting reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
