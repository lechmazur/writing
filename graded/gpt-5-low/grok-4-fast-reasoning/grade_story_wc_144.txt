<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation and competence are vividly rendered and drive every choice, particularly the tactile diagnosis via refracted warmth. Interiority is concrete without therapy-speak, though internal contradiction is minimal (he rarely falters or doubts). Apprentices add light relational texture without pressure. The final release of the drone aligns with his values and feels earned, if low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Structure is clean under an accumulative lens: setup → ritual method → mend → release. Closure lands (the drone’s clear bearing), but the felt cost is light and the late meta intrusion about word count breaks immersion at the brink of cadence. Causality holds; the water-refraction method gates the repair. The ending image survives but its charge is dulled by that artifact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misted depot and harbor are integrated into tactics (rain basins, refracted light, warmth on skin) rather than mere backdrop. Sensory selection is apt for a blind artisan; sound and heat displace sight. Environment constrains and enables choices, and the final image keys off ship and weather. Proper-noun economy is tight and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around restoring directional feedback before the ship departs; the tightening beat is the inventive diagnostic method under time/atmosphere. Stakes remain intimate and somewhat abstract (aid a lost traveler), with minimal visible cost or trade-off. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than a sharp reversal. Resolution is earned by agency but feels low-risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of repair, perception beyond sight, and stewardship of wanderers emerge organically from action and image. The hummingbird reprise and “magnetic calm” subtly reweight the world’s veiled corners without sermonizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and reflective. The meta line briefly punctures resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person voice with a distinct tactile/sensory signature suits the POV and holds steady. Diction and rhythm are mostly controlled, with occasional purple strain. Dialogue is minimal but functional and deferential, matching status dynamics. The late meta aside jars tone and stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is often elegant and information-dense, but metaphoric stacking edges purple in spots. The bracketed/meta “word count” intrusion in the final lines is a significant artifact that undercuts cadence and image. Otherwise syntax varies and momentum generally holds. Proofing and clarity are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blend of blind craftsmanship, water-refraction diagnosis, and a clockwork hummingbird in a misted rail/harbor world feels fresh and integrated. The repair-as-cartography conceit lands with specificity. Risks are thoughtful and coherent. Only the low-cost resolution and meta scuff keep it from higher.</comment>
