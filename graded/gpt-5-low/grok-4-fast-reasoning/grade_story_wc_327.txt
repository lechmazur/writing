<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motive anchored in Elar’s copper-marked identity and grief over the language’s death; his endurance through the curse yields a credible Earned Stasis. Interiority is specific (veins aching, textures felt), though internal contradiction is relatively light (risk vs. duty is present but not deeply torn). Micro-choices (entering the tunnel, aligning facets, persisting through visions) align with motive. The cost is felt but not transformative to self-concept beyond resolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural structure builds toward a charged closure where the language’s textures become sound in the tunnel—a clean RR/CR on the page. Orientation is strong early; single POV, one dominant stake, and a coherent escalation. Cost is legible (curse visions, diamond dimming) and integrated. A hair more consequence on Elar’s body or options would push this higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: canyon acoustics, bone towers, and the tunnel actively constrain and enable tactics; the diamond operates as a tool-object in that environment. Sensory detail (texture-language, mineral dew humming) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The final image is charged by place: the canyon as archive. World rules are consistently learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve the language) tightens as Elar chooses to risk the curse and channel the flock through the diamond into the tunnel. The meaningful turn is the alignment of facets with flight patterns under pressure, with the curse assailing him at peak. The visible price is endurance through visions and tool dimming; consequences are felt but not devastating. Tension is steady rather than jagged, fitting the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of translation, loss, and the ethics of preservation arises organically through action (textures to tones, birds as grammar). The ending reweights the premise: death into “eternal resonance,” with the cost of entrapment risk and a haunted archive. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers over curse and immortality. Strong image-driven subtext without didactic thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically precise, consistent, and filtered through Elar’s tactile-causal perception. Rhythm modulates with pressure; cadences tighten during the harnessing. No head-hopping; psych distance remains apt. Elevated diction matches the mythic register without drifting into academic abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative choices (“textures became tones”) that carry narrative work. Minor purple edges (“trapped scream,” “kings crumbling to dust”) but they serve pressure rather than clutter it. Minimal loops or scaffolding; syntax varies and momentum holds. Copy is clean and clear at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: tactile language, bone-echo canyon, cursed flawed diamond, and avian grammar cohere into a fresh premise. Turns and images feel inevitable in hindsight given the setup. Risks in concept and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth (grief-transmutation) underpins the worldbuild.</comment>
