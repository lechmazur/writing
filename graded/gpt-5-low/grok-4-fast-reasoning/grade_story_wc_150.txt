<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (to restore faith) drives embodied choices (digging, mapping, rebuilding). Interiority feels particular—longing and trepidation coexist—though contradictions rarely pinch into sharply conflicted in-scene choices. The visible cost is primarily labor and persistence rather than a fraught renunciation. The final renewal reads earned by accumulated work rather than sudden declaration.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: discoveries, interruptions, and work compound toward the rebuilt sundial and renewed belief. Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is coherent and unbroken. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the rebuilt base charges a before/after shift in faith. Cost is present but soft, leaning more conceptual and effort-based than decisively sacrificial.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and integrated—roots among bones, tremor, fog, and tool use keep the environment tactically alive. The sundial base functions as a recurring object that charges the final image. Sensory selection and tone align with the protagonist’s priorities. While constraints are felt, they rarely force a stark tactical compromise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindling faith through excavation) is clear, and pressure modestly tightens via the tremor, delays, and solitary labor. Escalation is more deepening than narrowing; obstacles complicate but do not corner her into a costly trade-off. The decisive act—rebuilding—arises credibly from her agency. Prices paid are primarily time and exertion, not a hard forfeiture.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys, diaspora return, and the sundial’s re-weighted meaning braid into a coherent thematic arc. The ending re-frames continuity as the answer to interruption without overt moralizing, though several lines come close to stating the thesis. The motif set (roots/bones, travelers’ shards) deepens resonance. Complexity is present but comfortable rather than cutting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable close-third voice with a measured, lyrical cadence suits the material; diction and rhythm remain consistent. Recurrent phrasing (“warmly curious,” “purposeful wandering”) edges toward template-y but doesn’t break the spell. Psychic distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs. The voice flexes slightly with pressure (tremor beats) without losing coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-rich, with generally strong line economy. Mild redundancy and adjective stacking create a touch of purple—and repetition of key labels dampens momentum. Syntax varies enough to keep flow, and clarity remains high. The final image is clean and not dulled by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” and sundial-as-journey-clock feel fresh, and diaspora excavation as a faith-restoration ritual is a strong synthesis. The piece risks a quiet, accumulative structure and largely earns it. Emotional truth lands, though the pathway is familiar. It stops short of a startlingly non-obvious turn, but maintains distinctiveness.</comment>
