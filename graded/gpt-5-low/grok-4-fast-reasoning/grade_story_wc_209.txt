<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s quiet obsession is clear and consistent, embodied by repeated dawn returns and tactile handling of the postcards. Her interiority is specific (boots on thinning crust, tears at the window) and avoids therapy-speak. The transformation—grief reweighted into purpose—feels earned, though the conflict resolves a touch neatly. A sharper friction or cost on the page would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn visits, melting snow, and layered glass build toward a conceptual repricing at the window. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when anchored) and the postcards/payoff loop is kept. Closure lands on-page with cost (tears, acceptance, chosen artistic direction). The causal thread is soft but coherent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: amber pavilion, weak sunlight, and etched glass learned through action. The environment actively constrains discovery—the window’s hidden flowers only appear at dawn’s angle. Seasonal thaw shapes texture and time’s feel without bloat. The final image is charged by place and light, not just decorated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (understanding night-blooming flowers as a proxy for grief) and escalate through a deepening pattern rather than reversals. The meaningful tightening arrives when dawn’s angle reveals the hidden etchings and the postcards align as “keys.” The price is felt but subtle—acceptance through tears and a renunciation of avoidance. Momentum never flags, though a more acute trade-off would strengthen the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of hiddenness, grief, and claiming light emerge organically from concrete particulars (postcards, etched window, dawn hush). The concluding insight risks explicitness (“flowers bloomed at night to claim their own light”) but is earned by the tactile buildup. Subtext around the grandmother’s secret loves resonates without sermonizing. The mural choice refracts theme into forward motion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically consistent with a distinct perceptual signature (amber, umbral, thaw), and POV control is steady. Diction is elevated but character-coherent for an artist. Rhythm modulates well between scene and reflection. A few phrases verge on purple yet remain legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean syntax and minimal scaffolding. Some modifier stacking (“umbral tenderness,” “honeyed panes,” “tender gloom”) risks saturation but largely serves mood. Repetition is patterned rather than looped, and cadence varies. No figurative muddle interferes with clarity at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Postcards as keys to a dawn-revealed, etched cathedral window is a fresh synthesis. The night-bloom motif is familiar, but the execution through light mechanics and grief linkage feels singular. The quiet, concept-driven closure risks smallness but lands with integrity. It’s inventive without gimmick.</comment>
