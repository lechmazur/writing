<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (reforging the bond) is clear and her reluctance creates credible internal friction that resolves in an earned choice. Interiority is vivid and embodied (spices, fur, bone-softening). Micro-choices are limited to a single arc from resistance to commitment, but they track. The visible cost—shedding human form—is present though its long-term weight is softened by the “core unchanged” reassurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: grief → orchard → fortune → spices → metamorphosis → conjuration → reunion. The closure lands on the page with a decisive change and felt cost, and the lens remains causal with lyric texture. The fortune risks convenience, but prior lore and carried spices ground motivation. Orientation is early and stable; the single-scene structure holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard and moonlit rules meaningfully enable the ritual (“making such feats possible in this timeless grove”), and the spice-scent charges the final image. Sensory detail is lush and POV-filtered, with a good spread beyond the visual. World logic stays consistent and integrated into action. A few overtly symbolic lines skirt excess but do not break plausibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible, and pressure tightens from discovery to transformation to conjuration. The key trade-off—accept metamorphosis to regain Thorne—reads clearly. Escalation is steady rather than surprising, with no sharp reversal, but agency drives the turn. The cost is present, though its sting is muted by the ease of the reunion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Metamorphosis as acceptance of grief’s change integrates with setting and ritual, avoiding bald moralizing. Recurring images (moonlight, spices, cosmic intimacy) reweight the final moment. The fortune’s line could read didactic, but it’s rebutted by concrete actions and a sealed sensory coda. Resonance lingers without tidy moral summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person voice is distinct and mostly well-controlled, matching the mythic register. However, the meta-editorial intrusion near the end (“But wait, the count exceeds…”) breaks stance and undercuts immersion. Diction remains coherent otherwise with measured psychic distance. No dialogue; internal rhythm generally supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is often strong, with rich images doing multiple jobs, but it veers toward purple in clusters and repeats “paradoxically steady.” Crucially, the bracketed editorial aside in the final lines is a damaging artifact that dulls the closure image. Some intensifiers and stacked modifiers could be trimmed for propulsion. Overall clarity holds, but momentum takes a hit.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blend of fortune cookie, cosmic spices, and a moonlit orchard gives a fresh inflection to a familiar resurrection/metamorphosis arc. The conjuration via scent is a memorable tactic. Risks are taken with tone and imagery; most pay off. The meta glitch and a few familiar beats keep it shy of exceptional.</comment>
