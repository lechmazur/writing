<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—preserving ancestral names after self-forgiveness—is clear and drives each micro-choice at the altar. Interiority is concrete (craft habits, sweat, trembling) but internal contradiction is largely pre-resolved, so on-page tension feels gentler than it could. The professional specificity (lost-wax instincts guiding rope work) individualizes her. The final endurance/repair is earned, though the cost remains primarily emotional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with accumulative pressure: entry → ritual prep → rebraiding → activation → voices restored. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the sanctum speaks and Elara’s stance is reweighted by on-page effect. Causality is clean (card → rope pattern → light → whispers), with a felt conceptual cost tied to guilt and legacy. Stakes are tested through the delicate procedure rather than overt obstacles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, altar, and rope are vivid, sensorial, and purpose-driven, not postcard. Environment and tool constrain tactics (cold, fragility, ancient fibers), and the aurora’s light charges the final image. Details track through action rather than tour-guide listing. Consistency of world-rules is maintained via the rope/aurora mechanism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and the procedure tightens options as the rope is reconfigured, culminating in an irreversible act. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial; the main “cost” is delicacy/time under cold rather than risk of ruin. The lever pull and illumination read as a meaningful turn that reweights options. Additional friction or risk would have sharpened the price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness, lineage, and preservation emerge organically through objects and task, not explained. The final whispers offer a resonant non-literal answer: repaired self allows recovered communal memory. Recurring thaw/light images modulate rather than sermonize. Complexity remains in the sense of loss that cannot be fully undone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close is consistent; diction is elevated yet fits the ritualized, mythic frame. Perceptual signature (craft-based noticing, tactile care) remains coherent under pressure. Slight risk of purple surge, but modulation during the climax is controlled. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are generally clear, rhythmic, and multi-tasking, with clean causality and image management. There’s occasional density/purple tilt (snowmelt ardor repeated, stacked modifiers) that could be pared for thrust. Minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops that obscure the closure. Punctuation and syntax remain tidy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a lost-wax caster using a barrel-organ card to reweave a ceremonial rope under aurora to resurrect names. The mechanism feels specific and non-generic, with emotional stakes woven into the device. The ending turn is inevitable in hindsight given the setup. Boldness is aesthetic rather than structural, but coherent and memorable.</comment>
