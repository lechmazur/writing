<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s drive to decode language’s growth is clear and consistent, and his reticence versus the rush of digitization forms a credible internal tension. Interiority is specific—tactile attention to the crystal and shelves—without therapy-speak. However, on-page micro-choices are limited and low-risk; the pivotal moves (whispering, interpreting, shelving) carry modest visible cost. The endurance/acceptance at the end reads earned but gentle rather than fraught.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and maintained: whispers → crystal echoes → realization → shelving. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“the last dictionary’s end was…a seed”—with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise final image. Orientation is strong from the outset; causality is coherent within the lyric design. The cost is more conceptual than felt, limiting extremity but not clarity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The shadowed dawn library and fallen chandelier crystal are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s scholar’s gaze. The crystal functions as a micro-setting/tool that shapes tactics (he testifies by whispering into it) and charges the final image. Sensory specificity tilts toward visual and aural in character-appropriate fashion. World rules stay legible and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframing language’s future) is clear, with a meaningful deepening as echoes layer and past debates resurface. Pressure accrues texturally but remains low-intensity; options don’t narrow so much as clarify. Resolution is driven by Elias’s stance crystallization rather than a risky trade-off. The price—accepting the end of printed primacy—is evident but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of language as resilient, living echo emerges from crystal-mediated scenes rather than abstract lecture. Recurring images (“suspended hush,” the fallen crystal) reweight meaning at the end. A few lines edge toward overt thesis (“the true lexicon lived in the pauses”), slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical cadence suits the reflective mode. Diction and rhythm feel character-appropriate for a scholar, with measured modulations as intensity rises. No head-hopping, and the patterned elision is taught and paid off. Minor sameness in cadence and favored phrases keeps it just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished and mostly economical, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Some repetition and purple tilt—“suspended hush,” “weathered innocence,” and echo-laden metaphors—create slight density drag. Clarity and sequence remain clean, and the final image lands. Trimming redundancies would heighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sonically reflective crystal as an archival witness to language’s evolution is a fresh, integrated conceit. The post-dictionary era frame and testimony format synthesize into an organic vision. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity; the piece commits to its premise. Slight familiarity in a few concluding assertions prevents a higher mark.</comment>
