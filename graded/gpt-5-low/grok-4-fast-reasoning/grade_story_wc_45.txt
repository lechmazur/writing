<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism versus fierce yearning—are clearly dramatized, culminating in the choice to innovate on ritual despite her doubts. Professional detail (bone setter) grounds her actions and reveals character under pressure. The cost—accepting echoes rather than her daughter—is felt, if a touch tidy. Occasional label-telling (“forgiving skeptic,” “shrewdly innocent”) slightly flattens otherwise strong interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Structure is clean: find the tooth → choose the ritual → receive echoes, not the child → acceptance. The accumulative/textural drive holds, with the garden’s wards and the tooth’s runes cohering causally. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost. A few abstract assertions in the final third temper the otherwise tight cause-and-effect.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The hedge maze and secret garden are vivid and purposive: seclusion permits the ritual; wards align with the tooth, charging the space. Sensory details (nightshade scent, wild roses, fountain) are filtered through Elara’s professional and maternal lens. The final image (maze as constellation of paths) reweights the place with meaning. Constraint is present, though lightly felt rather than sharply limiting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—reclaiming a child or salvaging joy—and escalate through the discovery and use of the tooth. The decisive turn is Elara’s adapted ritual and the outcome that forces acceptance. Cost is legible but gentle, more elegiac than wrenching. Pressure could tighten once more with a concrete risk or trade-off in the ritual itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness, belief, and transforming mistakes into guiding “constellations” emerge organically from object and action. The tooth and bone-setting practice fuse nostalgia with innovation at closure. However, several thesis-like sentences in the final third verge on moralizing, slightly reducing subtext. The resonance is real and lingering, if a bit stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric close third sustains a distinct, steady voice tuned to Elara’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and focalization remains clean. Repeated keywording (“innovation,” “nostalgia”) edges toward thesis cadence but doesn’t break the spell. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, carrying emotional weight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are generally precise and musical, with strong image economy. Minor overwriting and motif repetition in the final third (abstractions like “destiny,” “innovative shape”) slow momentum. Syntax varies well, and information density is high. No major clarity issues or scaffold, just occasional purple tint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Changelings are familiar, but the bone setter’s adapted ritual, the runed tooth as key, and the “mistakes into constellations” frame feel fresh. The synthesis of nostalgia with pragmatic craft is distinctive. The acceptance-not-restoration ending avoids cliché. Risk is thoughtful and coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
