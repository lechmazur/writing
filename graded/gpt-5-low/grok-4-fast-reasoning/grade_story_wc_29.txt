<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and agency are strong and consistent, and her micro-choices at the console arise credibly from her worldview. The status dynamic with Harlan is legible and shifts when her interference undermines him. However, internal contradiction is light; she operates from steady competence more than conflicted desire. The cost to her personally is muted, limiting depth of arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain is clean: Harlan demands a shutdown; Elara counters by injecting subsonics; the crowd and signal respond, producing an altered end-state. Closure lands on-page with a palpable before/after (“first honest silence in weeks”). The cost is more social/ethical than personal but still felt in the uneasy crowd reaction. No major orientation or lens slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radio station, antennas, console, and charts are vivid and purpose-tethered, not decorative. Environment directly enables her tactic (towers and subsonics) and charges the final image of silence. Sensory detail—hum, static, metal walls—fits her professional filter. World rules remain consistent within the piece’s speculative frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are clear: avert cosmic deception and resist Harlan’s exploitation. Escalation arrives when he storms in and presses for public broadcast, forcing her decisive interference. The reversal is earned and outcome-changing, but the on-page price is relatively light, with limited pushback or immediate consequence. Tension sustains, if not maximally sharpened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The human/cosmic mirroring—Harlan’s ambition echoing the tricksters—threads the piece and resonates in the wary, unsentimental ending. “These aren’t gifts” and the honest silence reweight prior images without moralizing. Some theme signals are stated rather than fully subtextual, which blunts the afterglow. Still, the conceptual repricing of “contact” as seduction vs clarity lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled, textured, and consistent with a scientific, haunted sensibility; dialogue is sparse but functional and status-aware. Rhythm modulates under pressure, and focalization stays clean. A few elevated turns of phrase verge on purple but don’t break distance or clarity. The perceptual signature feels particular to Elara.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level is polished and dense, with vivid images (“whispers from the ether grinding against the station’s rusty gears”). Occasional metaphor stacking and adjective weight tilt toward overwriting, slightly softening propulsion. No significant loops or scaffolding; syntax and paragraphing carry momentum. Technical clarity holds through the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blend of campus politics, signal interpretation, and subsonic countermeasures feels fresh and integrated. The trickster-signal premise is not wholly new, but the specific tactic and institutional crucible elevate it. Risks are taken in tone and texture without losing coherence. A deeper, costlier twist could have pushed it higher.</comment>
