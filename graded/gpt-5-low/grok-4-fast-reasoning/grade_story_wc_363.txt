<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (reach the exiled brother) drives concrete choices—venturing, assembling, unweaving. Interiority is present and embodied, if sometimes generalized by lyric diction. The final sacrifice is credibly earned by established devotion to craft and kin. Limited contradiction in her impulses keeps the psychological texture from reaching the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → assembly → vision → sacrifice → release. Closure lands on-page with cost as she unweaves decades of work to power the bead. Orientation is clean from the outset and no causality breaks. The because/therefore chain is modest but coherent and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard and bamboo environment are vividly particular and recur through tactile action (moss underfoot, wind bearing the bead). Objects-as-setting (loom, bead, box) are integrated into choice and final image. The world’s soft rules are learned via use, not exposition. Richness avoids cataloging despite high density.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through the required sacrifice. The puzzle’s promise raises hope, and the price (unweaving the grand tapestry) makes the climax a true trade-off. Pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens. Slightly gentle escalation tempo keeps it just below top-tier intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of love-enduring-as-sacrifice emerges through craft and time motifs, not moralizing. Recurring images (“raveling silence,” loom, bead) reweight meaning at the end into hope charged by cost. The final release offers a resonant, non-literal answer without tying every thread. Ambiguity remains purposeful and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is steady, confident, and sensorially selective. Diction and rhythm suit the meditative cadence and intensify at turns (bead’s warmth, silence “pausing”). Repetition functions as motif rather than filler, though it edges toward lushness. Control holds without head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are musical and mostly economical, with good multi-function images. Some phrase recycling (“raveling silence,” “stoically sparkling,” “recommence”) verges on redundancy and slight purpleing. Momentum remains intact and closure image is clear. Minor pruning could heighten propulsion without dulling texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—loomcraft fueling a star-ward message via a rummage-sale puzzle and amber bead—feels fresh and internally consistent. Specificity of method and setting lifts it above template fable. Risks in tone and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. A bolder contradiction within Elara might have pushed the ingenuity higher.</comment>
