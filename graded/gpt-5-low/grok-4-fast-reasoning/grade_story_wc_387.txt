<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hiroshi’s motives are clear and embodied through small, specific choices (climbing, whisking tea, whistling, descending). His interiority is consistent and character-particular, though internal contradiction is mild and largely thematic rather than pressured on the page. The final stance—ongoing, modest audacity—feels earned by prior behavior. The lack of a sharper internal clash limits the ceiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: actions accrete (whisk → whistle → moon paths → net at river) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early and never slips. Closure lands with a conceptual repricing—honoring hidden effort with ongoing cost implied as dawn disperses the fireflies. The on-page price is subtle rather than forcefully legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The parapet after rain, moss, moonlit stones, and riverbank are vivid and purposeful, with the environment guiding action (slick “moon paths” prompting the descent). Object-as-setting (net, whisk) charges the ending image. Sensory detail is textured and POV-filtered. Minor flourish aside, setting and atmosphere do real work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure is inward and modest; escalation comes as a cadence shift when the whistle gathers fireflies and he commits to the moon paths. Stakes (to truly perceive hidden effort) deepen rather than narrow, with no hard trade-off or visible loss beyond time and dawn’s dispersal. Agency drives the turn at the river but cost stays conceptual. The quiet arc is coherent but not intensely testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of honoring unseen labor is integrated through particulars (mended net, matcha whisk, guided descent), culminating in a resonant acceptance of ongoing effort. A few lines state thesis directly (“true wisdom lay in honoring such unseen efforts”), which slightly blunts subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in a good way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical, steady, and plausibly tied to a contemplative elder; distance stays stable and focused. Elevated diction generally suits the stance. A few ornate constructions approach purple but do not break control. Rhythm modulates well across beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and high information density; images often do double duty. However, metaphor density and stacked modifiers occasionally verge on overwriting (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity” repeats). No major loops or scaffolding drag momentum. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher, tea whisk ritual, and moon-path-guided fireflies give a fresh inflection to a contemplative night-walk. The whistle as a soft summoning is a memorable pivot. The premise isn’t radical, but the synthesis feels specific and coherent. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off.</comment>
