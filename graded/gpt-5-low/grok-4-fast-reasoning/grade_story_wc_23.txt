<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (to transmute loss into a guiding network) are consistent and deepened by contradictory impulses—tethered to the sea yet mapping returns. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (the censer foot, the sticking dial) and lunar fluctuations that credibly degrade cognition. Micro-choices under pressure (persisting through the waning quarter, encoding riddles) reveal values with cost. The relationship to the absent wife stays active via letters, avoiding tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: hydraulics failure → resolve to build a human beacon → repeated midnight calls → doubt under waning moon → tangible payoff as families depart inland. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he remains to signal, costed by solitude and ongoing effort, reweighted by arrivals and the final dialing. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the censer foot and lunar cycle persist into the ending image. The price is felt on the page, not merely asserted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The signal station’s salt-rusted machinery, dead hydraulics, and antique phone shape tactics and constrain choices; the environment is not postcard décor but the problem and the platform. The censer foot functions as charged micro-setting, returning to weight the final image. Sensory specificity (salt, rust, patina, lunar light) is purposeful and POV-filtered. World rules are consistent and learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (building a guiding network) tightens through the stuck dial and wavering clarity under the waning moon, testing resolve. The reversal via the young mother’s call consolidates the network, and the dawn arrivals reweight the effort with consequence. The cost is endurance and solitude; escalation is quiet but legible under the accumulative lens. A slightly sharper on-page trade-off would push it higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: reverse migration as solace refigures loss without erasing it; the censer foot embodies weathered endurance. The final image answers the central question by choosing a sustaining stance, not a cure. Subtext hums in cryptic riddles and the moon-phase cognition, avoiding moralizing. Complexity persists: his solace is raw, contingent, and paid for nightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice aligns with Elias’s perceptual signature (nautical idiom, star-mapping, tactile artifacts). Dialogue snippets are natural and functional, carrying subtext (riddled directions, fragmentary replies). Distance and tense remain stable; compression is purposeful. Rhythm modulates well between hushed accumulation and sharper turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax and varied cadence; images do double duty (setting and psychology). The prose edges toward lush but avoids figurative muddle and keeps momentum. Minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops materially dull the closure. Final lines land with precise nouns and clean verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator, censer foot, and midnight cryptic network render a fresh synthesis of beaconry, migration, and devotion. Risks (lyric accumulation, ritualized calls) pay off coherently. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the moon-phase frame. The originality serves character and theme rather than ornament.</comment>
