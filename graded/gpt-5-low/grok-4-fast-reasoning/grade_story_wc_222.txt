<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and consistent (chivalry, “cautious abandon,” embrace of the unknown), with micro-choices under pressure like the hesitation before swapping the king. Interiority is present but light; we track resolve more than contradiction, though mercy toward the guardians hints at tension. Relationship pressure with Lirra is minimal on-page, mostly framing rather than a crucible. The final earned shift—apprentice into agent—lands but at modest cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal drive is clear: corrupted pieces → timed swaps via the sundial → guardians appear → continued swaps → the king swap resolves the fracture. Orientation is excellent early (who/where/when established within the opening). Closure is a decisive change with the world righting and Lirra’s nod. The cost reads as risk and strain rather than a lasting price, keeping it out of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire, auroras, and the Grand Board are vivid and purposeful, not postcard décor. Objects-as-setting (the Board, the sundial) constrain tactics and timing, charging the action. Sensory details support tone and pressure (cold, suspended ice crystals, spectral cracking). World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible from the start (repair the Veil by amending the Board). Escalation tightens through increasingly significant swaps and the arrival of spectral guardians; the king swap functions as the peak test. Agency drives every turn, guided by the sundial. The on-page price is danger and exertion, not a sharper trade-off or loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of balance, sacred play, and ethical theft emerge through particulars (carved pieces holding “renewal,” mercy toward guardians). The final image reweights earlier motifs without a stated moral. Some explicit declarations (“His motivation burned clear…”) blunt subtlety. Overall resonance is strong but not piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person voice with consistent distance fits the mythic-fantasy register. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (quicker during guardian assaults, steadier in setup). Brief dialogue serves efficiently. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with good propulsion; images like “auroras bled” and “forms cracking like thin ice” are vivid and apt. Occasional purple intensifiers and stacked modifiers approach saturation but don’t obscure action. Minimal redundancy and strong sentence variety. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The Grand Board with hollowed pieces and a sundial-timed ritual feels fresh, and “sacred play” adds a distinct angle to the thief trope. The synthesis reads coherent and character-true. Stakes and method feel specific to this vision rather than generic. It’s inventive without radical risk.</comment>
