<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to prove coincidences have meaning—drives consistent choices from scavenging shards to aligning the prism. Her doubt vs. devotion dynamic is clear, with embodied touches (callused hands, shard’s hush) anchoring feeling. However, many key beats are summarized, limiting on-page micro-choices under pressure. The final choice reads earned but its cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Coherent causal throughline: vision → research → shard hunts → storm pressure → alignment → ignition. Closure lands cleanly with a Decisive Change (beacon rekindled) that reconfigures meaning. Orientation is strong early (tower, pavilion, shard), and the drive lens remains causal to the end. Cost is present but light, mostly toil and risk implied rather than dramatized at peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion, cliff winds, and frost-etched rails create a distinct, lived-in locus. The hum/hush polarity charges the final image and subtly constrains tactics (silence aiding focus, storms threatening progress). Details are purposeful and filtered through Elara’s priorities (star charts, astrolabe). World rules feel consistent and discoverable through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (rekindle the beacon as proof of meaning), and pressure coheres through storms, scarcity, and time’s erosion. Escalation is mostly accumulative via montage rather than discrete, in-scene reversals. Agency drives the turns (charting, aligning, reassembly), with a credible narrowing toward the clear-sky window. The price remains modest; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond the grind and risk of failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motifs (thistles, hum/hush, star paths) braid into the theme of meaning in randomness. The ending reframes coincidence as a “quiet language,” but the explicit articulation leans toward moralizing, reducing subtext. Still, the rekindled light and silence motif provide a resonant, non-literal answer. Greater ambiguity or image-led finish would heighten depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close maintains a stable perceptual signature, with musical diction matching the pavilion’s hum. Rhythm modulates well between summary and focalized beats. No head-hopping or stance drift occurs. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward purple but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry good density—objects, world, and intent often do double duty. Some stacked modifiers and thematic restatements flirt with redundancy (“coincidences… quiet language”), but momentum holds. Syntax varies and images are coherent; no figurative muddle at the peak. Minor tightening could sharpen escalation beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “shard of hush” and retrocognition inflect a post-collapse lighthouse with fresh specificity. The star-path method and hum/silence interplay feel inventive without gimmickry. The core arc is familiar (rekindling a signal), but the execution is distinct and purposeful. A sharper on-page cost or unexpected consequence might elevate it further.</comment>
