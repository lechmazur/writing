<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, character-driven motive (to “give rest a permanent address”) collides with his compulsion to answer the lens’s pleas, producing credible conflict. Interiority is embodied—ache, blood, weariness—and choices under pressure (cutting his palm, staying in the impossible space) reveal values. The stubbornness reads as flaw and engine. A slight limit: no interpersonal crucible to test him further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: package arrives → he investigates → sacrifices blood → occupies impossible space → reforms lens → rests the souls → earns stillness. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/what) and holds. Closure lands on-page with cost and a reconfigured world state (lens becomes beacon, souls archived). The escalation is smooth rather than surprising, but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater library is vivid and functional: impossible alcoves enable the bridge between realms; tomes house the dead; currents carry the package. The lighthouse lens as tool-object charges the final image and constrains tactics. Sensory selection (bioluminescence, brine, barnacles) is purposeful and POV-filtered. World rules are learned through action, not expository dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (quiet vs. the unrest of souls), and pressure tightens when he cuts his palm and chooses to occupy the impossible space. The price (blood, strain, lingering in the split state) reads on the page and narrows options. Resolution results from his agency, not coincidence. Slight limitation: minimal counterforce beyond endurance; no strong reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Resonant themes of rest vs. drift, memory as permanence, and ethical obligation emerge from concrete images (faulty beacons → coherent light; souls inked into books). The final stasis reweights the opening promise without moralizing. The lens’s transformation offers a quiet, earned answer. Complexity is present but not thorny—elegant more than destabilizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person close holds throughout; diction suits the undertaker’s sensibility and the aquatic frame. Rhythm modulates well at peak beats (entry into the impossible space, the reformation). No head-hopping or stance drift. A slight tendency toward purple is kept in check by clear action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs (bioluminescence as mood and navigation; “trapped stars” as stakes). Minimal redundancy, clean syntax, and controlled metaphors with coherent vehicles. A few lush lines risk saturation but do not blur causality or the closure image. Cadence supports momentum into the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Undertaker-in-Atlantis with a broken lighthouse lens that channels distress signals is a striking synthesis. The “impossible spaces” method is fresh and integrated, not gimmicky. The final move—archiving souls into tomes—recasts funerary practice with originality. Not revolutionary, but distinctly memorable and fully committed.</comment>
