<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motives are clear and consistent, and her dual allegiance yields credible choices (quiet planning, encoded graffiti, defensive perimeter). Interiority is present but largely summarized rather than embodied in moment-to-moment micro-choices, limiting lived emotional texture. The juggler scene hints at her shock-absorbing trait in action but is brief. The final choice—pushing incorporation—feels earned by prior moves, though costs are more implied than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean accumulative progression: chip → first graffiti → spread of decoding → tightening pressure with patrols → final clandestine vote. The closure is on the page (incorporating on their terms) with a conceptual cost, and the lens holds. A touch more dramatized confrontation or tangible sacrifice at the end would deepen the price. Transitions across nights are legible and causal rather than list-like.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aquafeste is vivid and specific (barnacle-crusted stone, spiced kelp fritters, neon lanterns), and the raft city meaningfully shapes tactics (graffiti spread, nets/illusions, patrol boats). The foundation chip functions as a charged recurring object that anchors the final image. Sensory selection aligns with Lira’s priorities and the carnival’s rhythm. Occasional lyricism flirts with ornament but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (privatization vs soul), and pressure coheres as patrols approach and alliances are encoded. Escalation is largely accumulative; the decision to incorporate forecloses a path but the visible cost is moderate. The outer-raft defensive perimeter is a solid tightening choice. A single sharp on-page loss or peril beat would have pushed pressure into higher band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme arises organically from actions: honoring a foundation while adapting, unity through coded art, dual allegiances reconciled. Recurrences (chip, murals, phoenix) reweight meaning at the end without didactic moralizing. A couple of direct phrases (“navigate gentrification”) tilt toward overt statement but don’t overwhelm subtext. The final vote offers a resonant, non-literal answer consistent with the imagery.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Lira’s measured temperament. Distance and tense stay stable; compression across nights reads intentional. A few repeated labels and cadences slightly thin distinctiveness under peak beats. No dialogue burden; when present (juggler), it supports subtext and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical with strong verbs and concrete images; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor repetition of conceptual terms (“orderly intuition,” “dual allegiance,” “desperation/hope”) adds a faint echo. Figurative language remains coherent and doesn’t muddy action. Rhythm varies well across sentences and paragraphs, sustaining momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The raft-carnival polity, graffiti-cipher organizing, and foundation chip talisman yield a fresh synthesis. Tactics emerge from premise rather than grafted tropes, and the phoenix mural closure feels earned. The piece risks lyric-accumulative structure and lands it without losing clarity. Further dramatized cost would elevate ingenuity into exceptional territory.</comment>
