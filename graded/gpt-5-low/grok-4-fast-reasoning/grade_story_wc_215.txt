<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—preserve the covenant’s “unspoken words”—is clear and consistent, and his choice to act silently by tracing the seam earns the ending. Interiority is spare but particular, built from attention rather than diagnosis. However, internal contradiction is minimal; he rarely wavers, so tension relies more on atmosphere than competing impulses. The cost of his stance (silence over speech) is conceptually present but not deeply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative drive is clean: ghosts appear → investigation → stained-glass decoding → seam-trace reconfigures the field. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the ghosts straighten and the oasis hum returns. The cost is subtle—maintaining silence to keep the covenant’s gravity—which reads, but lightly. Orientation is clear early and the throughline holds without causal breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The scorched oasis, with skeletal apiaries and cracked earth, is vivid and integrated with the covenant’s erosion. Environmental detail is filtered through Elias’s attention and evolves (shade alcove, central hive tower, sand-buried relic). The stained-glass box functions as a charged micro-setting at closure. While the setting presses meaningfully, it only lightly constrains physical choice on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (untangle the covenant without breaking its silence), and pressure tightens around the box discovery and the refusal to speak. The seam-tracing is a clear escalatory tactic that alters the situation. Still, the conflict remains low-friction; opposition is atmospheric rather than resistant, and the price of the chosen path is implied more than felt. One meaningful deepening occurs, appropriately scaled to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stewardship, covenant, and the ethics of silence emerge organically through image (rusted frames, spectral hands, runed bees) rather than thesis. The final image reweights prior material—silence as preservation rather than absence. Moments like “words would dissipate the covenant’s gravity” risk abstraction, but the scene keeps meaning grounded in action. Thematic aftertaste lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric third-person is controlled and consistent with Elias’s perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates well, with a measured cadence that suits the quiet stakes. A few repeated constructions and heightened diction flirt with purple but stay legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-dense, and mostly economical; lines often do double duty. Some synonym loops and intensifiers recur (“mute eloquence,” “tranquilly perceptive”), edging toward overwriting without obscuring sense. The final beat is clear and uncluttered, preserving momentum. Grammar and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghost beekeepers, a stained-glass covenant, and silence as agency yield a fresh synthesis. The ending act (realigning a glass seam to retune a pact) is non-obvious yet earned by prior particulars. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they largely pay off. Emotional truth reads specific rather than templated.</comment>
