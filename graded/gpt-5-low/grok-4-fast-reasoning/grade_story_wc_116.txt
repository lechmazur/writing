<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—witness change without judgment—and his choices (unfolding/refolding, leaving, ritualizing the burrowing) align. Interiority is textured through tactile detail, though internal contradiction is minimal, limiting complexity. The cost of leaving the collapsing library and bodily effort registers but stays muted. A richer friction between detachment and desire would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: swan → tunnels → refuge → ritualized witnessing, culminating in an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset, and cause-effect is legible. The closure lands via a reweighted final image rather than a decisive turn; cost is present (abandonment, exertion) but soft. One tightening beat suffices, though a sharper on-page price would raise it.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly embodied: damp stone, ivy-choked stacks, subterranean streams, and the obsidian refuge all feel tactile and consequential. The crumbling library presses him outward; the river/refuge shape the final image and his mode of witness. Sensory selection matches the contemplative urgency. Excellent integration without excess world-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving/entering regenerative silence—tightens through the library’s decay and the swan’s route. Escalation is gentle but coherent, with one substantive deepening when the swan shifts from object to method. The price (leaving, bodily strain, renunciation of the old post) is implied more than dramatized. No true reversal; a slightly higher-pressure beat would sharpen consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres around surrender to change and the healing silence that reframes decay; images do the work without sermonizing. The swan’s reprise on the altar and the obsidian chamber translate philosophy into concrete ritual. Ambiguity invites reflection yet stays legible. The resonance is high though not quite transformative in its final turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person filters detail through the keeper’s sensibility; diction and cadence feel controlled. Repetition (“regenerative silence,” “drift of untold seasons”) functions as motif rather than slack. No dialogue is needed or missed. Minor risk of lushness is kept in check by clear focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong—varied syntax, purposeful imagery, and high information density. A few paraphrase echoes and adjective clusters edge toward purple, but clarity holds. Momentum is steady despite lyricism, and the final image is clean. Tightening repeated formulations could further sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Origami as navigational method and “regenerative silence” as a tangible sanctuary give the premise a fresh angle. The obsidian river refuge and archivist-witness figure feel specific and integrated. Risks are taken in a quiet, accumulative mode without obscuring sense. Some elements nod to familiar mythic-quest patterns, but the synthesis reads distinct.</comment>
