<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (protect the roses; quell inner static) are clear and intensify under pressure, with concrete micro-choices (initiating and then amplifying the protocol). Interiority is textured—nostalgia vs. duty vs. fear of obsolescence—embodied by pain simulations and processor “thorns.” The change (facing/miniaturizing fears) is earned and leaves a cost (blistering, a kept shard). A slight safety net remains in the tidy readiness note, but it reads as earned stasis rather than a reset.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative arc coheres: magnetic shift → rising static → relic box → controlled burn → escalation → cooling and re-alignment. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (pain, a preserved shard), and the farm’s stability mirrors the internal quieting. Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality breaks. The because/therefore chain is clean even within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dome, simulated suns, and desert roses are vivid and integrated, not just backdrop; the magnetic storm and sand devils exert live pressure. Environmental specifics filter through the caretaker’s priorities, and the recurring objects (box, roses) charge the final image. World rules stay consistent. The setting lightly constrains tactics rather than forcing a maneuver, but it still meaningfully shapes urgency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused: contain inner chaos or risk the farm. Escalation is credibly tightened by the storm and the static’s resistance, forcing the choice to amplify miniaturization; the cost is embodied (heat, blistering, keeping one shard). The resolution is protagonist-driven and not coincidental. Stakes remain personal-scaled yet consequential to the farm’s survival.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of nostalgia as fuel, controlled release vs. erasure, and wholeness-from-fragments accrue organically through action and image (miniaturized fears as embers; the kept shard). The closing reweights the premise without moralizing, though one line (“a testament to controlled release amid inevitable change”) edges toward on-the-nose. Subtext generally rides the recurring objects rather than declarations. Resonance lingers via the charged readiness and preserved fear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV holds steady; diction and rhythm match a reflective android’s sensibility. Compression is purposeful, with image-led turns that remain legible. Slight uniform elevation in register risks sameness but doesn’t blur intent. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext and pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and mostly efficient, with good propulsion through technical and sensory detail. Occasional purple clusters and synonymic intensifiers (“hummed… whispers… static surged… chaos”) create minor redundancy. Metaphors stay coherent; no mixed vehicles confuse action. The final third remains clear and charged despite the elevated texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Android horticulturist + electromagnetic storm + “controlled burn” of miniaturized fears synthesizes into a fresh, specific concept. Tactics emerge from premise rather than bolt-on twist, and the ending reconfigures meaning through a kept shard. Risks (lyric density, organic-android hybridity) pay off without obscuring clarity. Not utterly singular, but notably original and integrated.</comment>
