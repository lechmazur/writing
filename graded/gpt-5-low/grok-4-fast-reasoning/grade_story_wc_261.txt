<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s drive—to read scars for meaning—governs every choice, from delaying surgery to digging while still aching. Contradictory impulses (pain vs. compulsion; fear vs. inquiry) surface credibly in embodied ways. The final acceptance after the opal’s vision reads earned, not abrupt. A minor convenience tilt remains in how readily guidance appears, but her agency remains primary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: wake → plant whisper → descend → dig → chamber → opal to scar → conceptual shift and hourglass thaw. Closure lands on-page with cost (physical strain, tears) and a decisive reconfiguration of meaning. Orientation is firm within the first lines; the lens stays causal through the end. Slight luck in the chamber’s existence is buffered by prior cues (plants, grounds, heirloom).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tower, dawn hush, garden, and subterranean chamber are vivid and tactically relevant (access to soil, ferns guiding, hourglass charging the final image). Objects-as-setting (hourglass, coffee mug, opal) integrate seamlessly with place and action. The final image is literally charged by setting as time resumes. Sensory texture stays purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (closure) is clear and escalates through the dig to the opal’s revelation. The physical risk post-surgery and the emotional price are legible, culminating in a narrowing choice to confront the scar’s story. Some turns resolve a bit easily (no significant resistance once digging starts), but the tightening still works for this length. Agency, not coincidence, drives the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scars-as-text and “displaced miracle” unify motifs (hourglass, coffee rings, roots, opal) into an earned conceptual repricing at the end. The last beats avoid sermonizing while offering a resonant, non-literal answer: healing through reading the full tale of loss and survival. One or two lines verge on explicitness, but they’re supported by concrete action. The meteor hush motif accrues meaning rather than decoration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third’s lyric texture is steady and character-specific, with controlled rhythm and image patterns. Plant whispers are handled cleanly, without head-hopping or register drift. Psychic distance tightens during pressure and breathes at release. No dialogue demands are shirked; the silence suits the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (setting/character/theme) with minimal scaffold; cadence varies and remains clear under pressure. Figurative language is consistent (meteor hush, roots, sands) without muddle or mixed vehicles. A few lush patches flirt with excess, but momentum never stalls and the closure image is crisp. Mechanics and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Telepathic plants, frozen hourglass, coffee-ring divination, and a subterranean opal synthesize into a distinctive fable of grief and repair. Turns feel earned by seeded logic rather than late-rule convenience. The vision-to-scar gesture freshens a familiar closure quest. It’s bold yet coherent, with no gimmickry overshadowing human stakes.</comment>
