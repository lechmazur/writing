<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s ambition versus her sensory vulnerability creates credible, embodied conflict, culminating in a pressured micro-choice to journal through the stench. The motive to soothe elders and “cultivate serenity within motion” is coherent and escalates under strain. Interiority is specific to her olfactory lens. The closing shift—ambition tempered by earned hush—feels earned, if a touch stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds cleanly from acquisition to cultivation to the bloom’s assault. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes serenity as embrace under cost (tears, nausea). Orientation is clear and the tide-turn provides a crisp hinge. Minor tell at the end doesn’t blunt the on-page closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The treetop village and sensory world are vivid and POV-filtered, with the tide and vertical ecology shaping cadence and event timing. The corpse flower functions as environment-in-action, physically constraining choice. Details are selective and purposeful across senses. The final image is charged by place and object together.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she endure and find calm within motion—tightens decisively at the bloom’s release. The cost is legible and immediate; her tactic (journaling) is a consequential adaptation rather than a handwave. External stakes (elder-soothing potion) remain mostly aspirational, but the internal test resolves. Tension works at beat and sentence levels without requiring extra reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of accepting the wild to access wisdom arise from concrete particulars (stench as teacher, doodles as grounding). The closing realization coheres with prior images, though a few lines tilt toward explicit thesis. Subtext survives via image chains (roots in storm; wildflower hush) more than rhetoric. Effect lingers without simplistic moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is sensually distinct and controlled, with rhythm that swells at crisis and eases in reflection. Diction matches a perceptual herbalist lens. No head-hopping or distance slips. A few lush flourishes flirt with purple but stay character-grounded.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and varied cadence; images usually carry multiple jobs. Occasional motif repetition (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “wildflower hush”) risks redundancy but doesn’t stall momentum. Figurative control holds under pressure, and action order remains clear. Slight overwriting in the last paragraph prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: treetop village, corpse flower as crucible, olfactory sensitivity, and journaling on wrapping paper as a coping method. The tide’s sacred hinge adds distinctive world-logic. Turns feel grown from setup rather than grafted. Not radical, but confidently singular and memorable.</comment>
