<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, urgent motivation (recovering a deleted memory) propels Elias through concrete actions—divination, descent, and exhumation. Interiority is textured and embodied (lantern, trembling, brine, gravity pockets) without therapy-speak. The main softness is limited contradictory impulse on the page; his fear or doubt rarely challenges his drive. The final acceptance (carrying grief with regained joy) feels earned but a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain holds: whale → memory loss → chamber → coffee augury → dig → exhumed memento → flood of memory. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—memories stored in salt, retrieved at cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines. Slight convenience (one try divination instantly guiding to the correct node) trims the sense of struggle and price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber, brine-fed lattices, and fluctuating gravity are vivid and specific, shaping movement (gamble-steps) and tool behavior (lantern tug). Details filter through Elias’s trade and need, with coffee and lantern serving as micro-setting anchors. World rules stay consistent and learned through action. The final image is charged by place (salt hoard returning memory).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve a lost past) is legible and escalates via descent and unstable gravity. A tightening occurs when he commits to digging under fluctuating pressure. However, obstacles yield quickly—the augury points true and the parcel appears without a significant setback. Emotional cost lands, but tactical resistance is minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Memory, grief, and the earth/ocean as keeper of histories cohere through particulars (whale song, salt crystals, flowers). The ending reframes loss as recoverable with cost, avoiding overt moralizing. A slightly expository line (“deleted memories drifted… stored in salt crystals”) edges toward telling. Still, the whale’s role and the salt’s hoard produce a resonant afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person closely held to Elias, with controlled diction and rhythmic variance. The voice sustains “gleaming silence” as motif without monotony, modulating well across beats. No head-hopping or register drift; inference reads as inference. Compression serves pressure rather than explaining what’s already clear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (image, world logic, emotion) with clean syntax and momentum. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent; sensory detail is precise. Minor repetition (“gleaming silence”) functions as motif rather than a loop. No clarity issues or scaffold padding dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a lantern lighter using coffee-ground divination to navigate a gravity-pocketed salt chamber triggered by a whale’s song. The pressed flowers as mnemonic anchor feel particular, not generic. The concept follows implications without retreat, and the closure image feels inevitable in hindsight. Slight neatness in solution keeps it just shy of the 9+ band.</comment>
