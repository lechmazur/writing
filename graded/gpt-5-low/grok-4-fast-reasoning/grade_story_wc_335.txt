<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—combative mentorship versus involuntary backward steps—are embodied and consistent, culminating in her first forward step. Lir is thinner but functional as pressure and mirror to her drive. Actions (tea geometry, annotated shard) align with motive without therapy-speak shortcuts. The cost is mostly internal and quiet but credible at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal flow holds: shadow → ritual → annotation → handoff → loosening → Elara’s shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptually legible cost (risking herself to mentor and re-enter motion). Orientation is clear early; no teleports. The cost is a touch light for 9-band but coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library of shard-mirrors and a shadow trapped in glass isn’t just décor—it channels action, knowledge, and the ending image. Tea, glass, and dust are filtered through Elara’s archivist bias. Rules feel consistent and are learned in-scene. Rich atmosphere serves pressure rather than stalling it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reversing exile by building resilience) is signaled and coheres. Escalation comes via the tea-geometry mapping and the shadow’s pulsing; the tightening is modest but present. Resolution stems from Elara’s guidance and Lir’s assent, not coincidence. The price remains more conceptual than sharply felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of exile, reflection, and resilience arise from objects and acts (mirrors, tea geometry, annotated shard) rather than abstract telling. A few on-the-nose lines (“You think exile defines you?”) slightly flatten subtext. The final step forward reweights the imagery without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the reversible-path motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“soft blade,” “geometry of tea leaves”) stays consistent. Dialogue is spare, pointed, and largely subtextual despite a couple declarative moments. Rhythm modulates well between hush and pressure. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid and largely coherent, with occasional lushness (“whispers from the graves of forgotten dreams”) edging toward purple but not obscuring action. Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum. No loops or scaffold bloat. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shard-mirror archivist + tea-leaf geometry as annotation feels fresh and integrated, not quirky ornament. The reversible exile concept is used tactically, not just thematically. The “combative tenderness” tone distinguishes the mentorship dynamic. Risks pay off without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
