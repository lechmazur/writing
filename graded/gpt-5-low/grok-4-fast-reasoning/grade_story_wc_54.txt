<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is coherent and rooted in professional curiosity and a service ethic, and her choices (using the sextant to re-route flows) align with that. However, internal contradiction and visible emotional cost are minimal; competence largely carries the day. Embodied detail appears (dust, hums, vibrations) but affect remains steadied by a uniform “stoic wonder.” The ending’s change reads earned but low-friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-POV, single-scene causal through-line: find object → infer use → attempt → lights revive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with the lights returning and the sextant reweighted in the final image. Cost is implied (lonely labor, limited power) rather than dramatized, which keeps the turn quiet but intact. Orientation is clear early; the accumulative lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly specific (faded murals, massive vents, carnival detritus) and directly shapes tactics. The sextant-as-tool functions as micro-setting and charges the final image, while vents and conduits constrain choices. World rules feel consistent, filtered through an engineer’s eye. Minor reliance on visual description is offset by tactile and auditory cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive the terminal’s “heart”) is clear, and escalation occurs as attempts lead to a hum, then light. Pressure is modest—few setbacks or trade-offs beyond a wrong turn—and consequences remain primarily conceptual. Agency drives resolution, but the felt price is low, limiting torque. Still, the cadence tightens credibly toward the glow.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of renewal, redirected ambition, and “equations for hope” emerge through action and object usage rather than thesis statements. The final image reweights the sextant’s meaning and aligns personal craft with communal possibility. A few overt lines risk telling (“equations for hope”), but they’re supported by scene work. The resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, gently lyrical third-person close holds throughout; diction coheres with a technically minded yet wonder-tinged focalizer. Rhythm varies and tightens as systems come online. At times the elevated register edges toward generalized lyricism, but control remains. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and mostly propulsive, with purposeful sensory specifics and strong verbs. Some metaphor density (“maze of intentions,” “bath of stoic wonder,” recurrent “hum”) feels repetitive and slightly purple, softening momentum. Clarity stays intact and syntax varies, but trimming a few abstractions would sharpen impact. The final line lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Blending a brass sextant with airflow modeling in a derelict spaceport is a fresh synthesis; the carnival afterimage adds texture. The resurrection via redirected flows rather than brute power is an elegant, character-specific angle. While the revive-the-ruin arc is familiar, execution feels singular to this voice and toolkit. The ending’s object-charged image elevates originality.</comment>
