<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elowen’s motive—collecting “the stories walls have heard”—is clear and consistently enacted through tactile, embodied choices. Her interiority feels particular (ear to plaster, tracing mortar) rather than generic. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she faces little counterforce beyond atmosphere, so the final stance carries limited cost. The closing renunciation (“not to restore the world, but to dream anew”) is conceptually earned but lightly pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens and lands a conceptual repricing: Elowen reframes the quest from repair to a new dreaming. Anchors (who/where/when) are early and stable, and the diaries/tapestry are clean causal links within the lyric mode. The cost is mostly conceptual (acceptance of irreparable displacement), which reads but doesn’t bite deeply. Still, the ending image (tucking the fragment; the library’s sigh) closes the loop with coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vividly particular: rusted grain chutes as shelves, bioluminescent fungi, a fireplace yielding ash-flecked diaries. Details are POV-filtered and thematically consonant without feeling like a tour. While the environment rarely constrains options, it decisively charges the final image (the silo “sighs,” a kinship with the tapestry). Strong atmosphere with selective, purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Conflict is almost entirely internal and investigative; the pressure deepens via discovery rather than tightening stakes. The main turn is the tapestry/diary synthesis that prompts the reframed goal, but no meaningful option is foreclosed on the page beyond a quiet acceptance. The world-scale stakes (axis displacement) remain abstract rather than felt as immediate cost. Tension operates more as hum than ratchet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, custodianship, and irreparable imbalance cohere through recurring images (walls, weave, axis, dragons as mourners). The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: preserve and re-dream rather than restore, fitting the “last dream” world. Subtext accrues through objects and setting rather than moralizing. It’s complex without becoming muddled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive—bronze-toned, patient, and attentive to material textures—and remains controlled and consistent. Lyric register matches Elowen’s sensibility and the accumulative design. No head-hopping or stance drift; distance modulates gently with discovery. A few lush clusters flirt with purple, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered information with strong imagery and clean syntax; rhythm varies and avoids template cadence. Figurative language is rich yet mostly coherent to the world’s logic (bronze quiet, urn-like walls). Some density risks over-saturation, but momentum and clarity persist. Minimal redundancy and no noticeable scaffold loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The conceit of harvesting architecture’s memories post–“last human dream” feels fresh, as do dragons as guardians of equilibrium. The synthesis of object, place, and cosmic tilt is non-obvious and internally coherent. Risks are taken in tone and premise without resorting to gimmickry. The conflict frame is familiar (archival inquiry), but the execution lifts it.</comment>
