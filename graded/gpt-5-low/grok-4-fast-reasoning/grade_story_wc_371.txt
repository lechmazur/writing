<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—seeking holiness in the ordinary to salve a betrayal—drives every action and remains consistent. Interiority is vivid and embodied (bread crumbs on lapel; frost; chamomile steam), with a credible, quiet endurance rather than a neat cure. The internal conflict is present but largely one-directional, with limited contradictory impulses dramatized in-scene. The earned stasis at the end feels honest, though the visible cost remains soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: planting → offering → tea → reflection → charged poise. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a provisional peace amid acknowledged erosion. The cost—fragility of absolution and the world’s forgetting—sits on the page. The throughline is coherent with one meaningful deepening rather than a causal twist.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are tactile and specific, evolving with action (brambles parted, mosaics revealed, brazier warmth). Environment meaningfully shapes tactics (hidden access, frost, weeds, salvaged cushions) and charges the final image. Sensory balance is strong across sight, scent, touch, and temperature. Occasional emblematic phrasing skirts overt symbolism but mostly stays earned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: reclaiming sacredness to counter forgetting and seek absolution. Pressure deepens as acts move from covert planting to ritual bread offering and interior reckoning. The escalation is subtle yet present; the price is ongoing guilt and the knowledge of inevitable re-encroachment. Lack of an external counterforce keeps intensity modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of creeping normality, memory, and sacredness in decay emerge through concrete acts (guerrilla gardening, bread communion) and a nuanced final stance. The ending reweights prior images without moralizing, though one line (“This ritual... transformed the mundane act of eating into something holy”) borders on statement. The vanished bakery and crumbs reprise deepen resonance. Ambiguity lingers in a productive way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, controlled, and sensorially precise, with a distinct perceptual signature. Lyric compression is well managed and never confuses stance or time. Diction matches the reflective mode and holds steady without register slips. No dialogue is needed; the cadence supports the quiet arc.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax and strong verb-noun choices. Occasional purple touches and conceptual echoes (“uncloaking,” “secrets unveiled,” “communion”) flirt with redundancy but don’t stall momentum. Information density stays high; images do multiple jobs. The final image is clean and not obscured by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening as sacrament against urban forgetting is fresh and coherently executed. The bread from a vanished bakery as offering is a distinctive, charged detail. The closure avoids cliché by embracing provisionality. Risks are measured but meaningful, yielding a memorable synthesis.</comment>
