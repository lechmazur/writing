<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s purpose is clear and embodied—his choice to seed the jetty’s “most barren cracks” shows motive aligned with action. Interiority is textured by his past and uncommon skill, but there’s little contradictory impulse or moral friction on the page. The birds’ guidance creates micro-choices, yet no hard trade-off or visible personal cost is confronted. The final stance shift reads earned but gentle rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: arrival → decoding birds → targeted fertilizing → sprouts/harmony return. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the lens stays textural to a clean Charged Poise closure. Cost is more conceptual than felt, which softens the landing slightly. Still, the cadence builds and resolves with on-page consequence (sprouts and concord’s answering).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The jetty’s narrow ribbon, salt-sterilized cracks, and weathered pilings aren’t just scenic; they constrain where and how he acts. Environmental detail is POV-filtered and evolves with the action (roots through decay; birds steering him to wounds). Tone and setting entwine to charge the final image. The world rules and specificity hold without exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure deepens through accumulative pattern: deciphered calls narrow options to the harshest sites; the chorus tightens as he commits. Stakes remain intimate (restoration, concord), and resolution flows from his agency. However, there’s minimal visible price or foreclosed path beyond effort and exposure. The turn is clear but not harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Restoration versus devastation, language as bridge, and reciprocity with the nonhuman are woven through concrete acts rather than sermon. The “submerged concord” reactivating at the end reweights prior images without stating a moral. A hint of tidy wish-fulfillment (sprouts appearing immediately) grazes sentimentality. Still, the closing harmony retains earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with close-third distance on Elias. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, avoiding head-hopping and register drift. Patterned imagery is taught early and sustained. No dialogue is needed; the narrative texture carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful, with strong verbs and layered images doing multiple jobs. A few metaphor stacks flirt with excess but remain coherent and scene-true. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates slow momentum. The final lines land cleanly without verbal haze.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—coachman as gardener-linguist, birds as concord keepers, and reef-song ecology—feels fresh and specific. The method (translating dead languages to parse birds) is non-obvious and integral. The risk is tonal—lyric restoration could tip into cliché—but here it holds its nerve. The final reconfiguration feels both inevitable and newly seen.</comment>
