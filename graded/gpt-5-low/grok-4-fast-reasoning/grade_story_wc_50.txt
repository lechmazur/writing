<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular: a reflective locksmith seeking to rationally preserve wonder and cope with war-borne loss. Interiority is textured (peripheral focus, the cellar of reason) and aligns with his craft. However, on-page struggle is gentle; few pressured micro-choices or contradictory impulses are dramatized beyond methodical adjustments. The final acceptance—storing echoes as diagrams—lands, but its cost is more implied than bodily felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iterative studies of angles lead to the breakthrough and a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Orientation is strong early (who/where/why), and the artifact’s return ties causally to the closure image. The cost (locking away grief as echo) is conceptual and understated, softening impact. Escalation is steady rather than pressured, but the closure cadence is clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The marble cavern’s acoustics and reflective walls actively shape tactics and the final image. Specifics—peripheral amplification, polished slabs, fissure light—are filtered through a locksmith’s gaze. World rules (mirrors, angles, damp corrosion) stay consistent and integrated into action. The environment constrains method rather than serving as mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture/preserve echoes to heal later) is clear, and the methodical trials deepen toward the whirring breakthrough. Pressure rises via pattern and timing shifts, but resistance is mild; setbacks or hard trade-offs are largely absent. The final choice is a stance crystallization, not a forced trade with visible loss. Tension is present but restrained.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres: reason as vessel for wonder, grief metabolized through craft, and the ethics of preservation after war. Recurring images (peripheral light, mirrors, echoes) reweight at the end without moralizing. A slight risk of thesis-forward phrasing (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”) is offset by concrete process. The last image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to peripheral noticing and craft-thinking. Diction and rhythm suit the lyric, reflective mode without head-hopping. Occasional elevated turns flirt with purple but remain voice-motivated. Modulation at the breakthrough is controlled and earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry strong image density, varied cadence, and clean syntax; many sentences do multiple jobs. A few phrases edge toward lushness and repetition (“peripheral,” “lull”), but they serve the motif rather than padding. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum holds through iterative method. The final sentence resolves by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The echo-harvest premise, locksmith craft, and mirror-angled acoustics synthesize into a fresh, specific conceit. Risk-taking is evident in the conceptual closure (diagrams as vessels) and peripheral attention as method. The arc avoids template beats, though opposition remains gentle. The piece reads as a singular vision with coherent implications.</comment>
