<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific—preserve “ancient methods”—and contradictions (guardian vs grave-robber) are dramatized in scene. Embodied interiority (the cog’s teeth biting skin, bioluminescent hush) grounds his abstractions. The final renunciation (keep the cog buried) is earned by prior beats and costs him influence and connection. Minor note: occasional thesis-like lines risk flattening emotion into stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the accumulative structure (digging strata) coheres. The journal discovery tightens pressure and motivates the ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: a decisive refusal with visible conceptual cost, sealed by the wall-etching. The lens remains consistent without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drowned city and sewer-vein are vivid and functional; the environment guides tactics (digging through layers) and yields the journal. The cog functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory specificity is sustained without cataloging. World rules (post-plague, salt-worn brass) are consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—share the relic to fuel a new regime or bury it to preserve old rhythms—is clear early and sharpens with the strata dig. The journal intensifies the conflict, forcing a trade-off with cost. Resolution proceeds from the protagonist’s agency, not coincidence. Stakes remain internal but consequential and legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Competing narratives (celestial lore vs engineered control) are dramatized through object and action rather than pure thesis. The ending reweights meaning: preservation becomes refusal, with cost and dignity. A few overt declarations (“rational rebellion”) brush against didacticism, but the last image holds subtext. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled first-person voice—lyric, briny, and unsentimental—fits a sewer philosopher. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from observational to taut during the dig). No head-hopping or stance drift. Elevated language feels character-justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density and purposeful imagery; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, psyche, stakes). Some phrases flirt with purple (“indifferent drip of eternity,” “abrasive calm” repeated), but clarity and momentum hold. Syntax varies and cadence supports escalation. Minimal scaffold or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-plague sewer philosopher weighing lore vs rebuilt time via a single worn cog—is fresh and cohesive. The sedimentary dig as structural conceit is inventive and thematically apt. Risks in tone and diction largely pay off. The turn to Earned Stasis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
