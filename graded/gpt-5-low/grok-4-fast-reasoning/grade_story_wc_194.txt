<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation to uncover the family truth; micro-choices (winding, listening, searching) align with stakes. Interiority is textured if somewhat serene—few contradictory impulses under pressure. The acceptance of dissolution reads earned but relatively untested on the page. The “eloquent silence” is a strong trait but doesn’t exact much visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is clean; the accumulative pattern (music → intuition → search → diary → resolve) coheres. Closure lands with a concrete cost (dissolving estates, loss of titles) and a reweighted status (dynasty ender). The intuitive leap via “standing waves” skirts convenience but is set up and paid off. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: the sepia room, gramophone, bookshelves, and hidden panel integrate with action. The crank handle and lamp charge the final image and guide choice. Sensory detail balances warmth and haunt well, with objects functioning as micro-setting constraints. A hair’s breadth from 9+; the environment pressures gently rather than sharply.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and escalates through the music-guided discovery to the revelation and resolve. The cost is conceptually strong but the pressure is quiet; obstacles are minimal and resistance largely internal. The meaningful tightening occurs at the diary’s reveal and the resolved renunciation. Tension is effective but subdued.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, illegitimacy, and liberation through truth emerge organically from image and action. Recurring motifs (standing waves, crank handle, golden shadows) reweight meaning in the final cadence. No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant repricing of lineage and power. The subtlety convinces without overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close is consistent and suited to the aristocratic milieu. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with patterned phrasing that feels intentional. A touch of lushness edges toward purple in spots but remains legible and voice-true. POV discipline is steady, with purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong line-level control with dense, evocative prose; images often do double duty. Minor redundancy (sepia/golden/standing waves reiterated) nudges toward overwriting but doesn’t blur sense. Momentum holds through the reflective mode; syntax varies well. The final lines crystallize motif without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gramophone/standing-wave intuition as investigative method is a fresh inflection. The dynastic illegitimacy reveal is familiar but framed with distinctive texture and object-work. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely succeed. The synthesis feels cohesive and memorable, if not radical.</comment>
