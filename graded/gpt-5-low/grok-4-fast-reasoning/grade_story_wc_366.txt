<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and quietly protective instinct motivate clear micro-choices (adjusting the stone stack, opening the letters, pocketing the sea glass, rebuilding the cairn, relighting the lamp). His interiority is consistent and embodied through attention rather than exposition. The internal conflict is present but muted; the “luminescent ache” notes risk slight repetition in place of a sharper contradiction under pressure. The final vow reads earned by what he discovers and does on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-POV, one-night arc with a clean accumulative/textural drive: arrival → eerie climb → discovery of the letter chain → vow → relighting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias assumes guardianship—tethered to a concrete act (rebuilding the stack and lighting the lamp). Causality is coherent (each find prompts the next move), and the cost is conceptual/emotional. Escalation is quiet but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Blackthorn Isle, the storm-slick path, and the haunted lantern room are vivid and work through tactile action (stones skittering, salt-thick air, shattered prisms). The environment directs choices: the trailhead stack draws attention, the lantern room yields letters, and the sea glass becomes an object-charged signal. Weather and architecture meaningfully color mood and tactic. The final image tightly binds place and act (sea glass in a rebuilt stack; lamp relit).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (coastline safety and stewardship of a tradition) are clear early; the pressure deepens as he uncovers the anonymous chain and Harlan’s plea. Escalation is primarily internal; there’s little resistance or reversal beyond eerie atmosphere and disarray. The key tightening is Elias choosing responsibility, with a modest but legible price (embracing solitude and burden). It resolves through his agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of custodianship, anonymity as communal care, and “bottling safety” accrue through objects (stones, letters, sea glass) rather than statement. The letter chain reframes isolation as a lineage, and the final act reweights the motif powerfully. The piece resists moralizing and earns its quiet poignancy. Slight motif echoing (“luminescent ache”) skirts overt signaling but still resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, selective, and credible for a taciturn skipper: action filtered through practiced observation. Rhythmic control supports mood without head-hopping or stance drift. A few elevated phrases recur, but diction feels coherent with a lyric-leaning narrative. No dialogue needed; the silence is functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences are clear, texturally rich, and generally purposeful; images often do double duty. Occasional purple tendencies and repeated constructions (“luminescent ache,” “reticent”) slightly blunt freshness. Momentum holds, with minimal scaffold or loops. The final cadence is clean and image-led.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse ghostliness is familiar, but the anonymous letter chain and stone-message system feel specific and freshly integrated. Sea glass as “bottled light” that becomes a communal signal adds an elegant twist. The risks are tasteful rather than radical, yet the synthesis reads memorable. It’s distinctive in texture and object-work, if not groundbreaking in premise.</comment>
