<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to preserve the shape of hope—is clear and consistently embodied in specific actions (curating footage, coaxing the shadow). Interiority is textured through “luminous regret” and the tactile river stone, though internal contradiction under pressure is mild. Micro-choices exist but are largely procedural rather than fraught. The earned endurance at the end reads credible, if low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual comparison of archival footage intensifies pattern awareness until the shadow reconfigures into a bloom. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a modest cost (momentary victory against an ongoing erosion of hope). Orientation is strong early; the single-scene flow is coherent. Stakes resolve on the page without mechanical explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blooming library above the clouds is vivid, sensorial, and POV-charged, with petals from tomes and cloud-pages shaping mood and image. The river stone anchors body/setting micro-scale effectively. While the environment rarely constrains choice, it charges the final image (the shadow blooming onto a shelf). World rules stay consistent and are learned through observation and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (save/rebind an unanchored hope). Escalation occurs via the footage overlay revealing fracture and drawing the shadow in, but pressure feels gentle and largely uncontested. The resolution is earned through her method rather than a difficult trade-off, with limited on-page price. Tension is mostly atmospheric rather than agonistic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of commodified dreaming and the fragility/preservation of hope emerge through concrete particulars (grainy early footage vs. crystalline viral echoes; Great Fade). The river stone and dusk recur as motifs, reweighted at the end. No overt moralizing; resonance lingers in the cost of “endless dusk.” Slight declarative phrasing around purpose keeps it shy of superb subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A stable, lyrical third-person close holds throughout with a distinct perceptual signature (“sharp-eyed dusk noticer,” “clouds billowed like pages”). Rhythm modulates well between image and action; no head-hopping. Minor purple tendencies are controlled and voice-consistent. No dialogue to test, but narrative certainty stays within POV bounds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and mostly economical for the mode, with layered images doing multiple jobs. Some density of figurative language risks saturation but remains coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy or scaffold; cadence breathes with the scene. Final image is clear and not dulled by metaphor churn.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—shared-dream era, cloud library that blooms, and a conservationist method via silent archival footage—feels fresh and organically tied to theme. The metamorphosing shadow as hope-fragment is a strong, specific conceit. Risks in lyric accumulation pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth rides the imagery rather than generic sentiment.</comment>
