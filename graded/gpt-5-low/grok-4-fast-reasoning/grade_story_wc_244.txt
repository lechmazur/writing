<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s contradiction—elusive helper craving connection—reads specific and drives his choices (joking to gather, then slipping away). Interiority leans summary at times (“bound by reciprocity”), but his quips under pressure show character. The mask-cost is legible when his facade cracks passing the rock. A deeper embodied beat of temptation to stay would have raised the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: rumor → climb → communal sharing → renunciatory exit. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (connection found in sharing) with cost (he still leaves). Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when), and set-ups (rumor, tower) pay off on-page. The note edges toward neatness but doesn’t undercut the earned cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The station and ivy recur as a lived environment, shaping movement (lantern cluster, rusted stairs, tower peak). The moon rock functions as a charged micro-setting object that reconfigures the final image. Sensory detail serves mood and action without museum-tour excess. Constraints are soft (few tactical limits), hence not in the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (loneliness vs connection) and escalate via a clear tightening—rumor catalyzes a group climb and a circle of sharing. The visible price is his departure with the rock and the choice to remain elusive. Pressure is coherent but gentle; no hard test forces a sharp trade-off. Still, agency drives the turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reciprocity as theme is enacted (jokes-for-bonds, hand-to-hand rock, stories exchanged), culminating in the note. A few explicit statements (“cure’s in the sharing,” “bound by reciprocity”) flirt with moralizing, blunting subtext. The moon rock’s demystification yields a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity persists around whether taking the rock is gift or theft, which adds texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains a coherent, lightly lyrical register with a distinct tilt toward wryness that fits Elias. Dialogue is functional and subtextual—his jokes recruit and conceal need. Rhythm modulates nicely at the tower peak and dawn exit. Minor echoes in phrasing (“polite anarchy,” concept labels) keep it from higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are clean, with purposeful imagery (ivy “politely refusing,” stars as “hesitant confessions”). Some repetition and concept-labeling (“reciprocity,” “desperately jocular”) nudge toward tell and faint purple. Momentum remains steady and sentences carry multiple jobs. The final image is crisp and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>“Polite anarchy” as tonal frame, rumor-chain mechanics, and a moon rock as catalyst feel fresh in concert. The logistician’s relief-world lens applied to intimacy is an inventive synthesis. The closure choice (take the rock, leave a note) is non-obvious yet fitting. A bolder cost or sharper constraint could have elevated it further.</comment>
