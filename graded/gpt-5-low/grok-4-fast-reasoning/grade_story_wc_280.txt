<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Eliza’s motive (seeking solace after the troupe’s collapse) is clear and embodied through her synesthetic perceptions and small choices (trespassing, accepting the coin, joining the dance). The relationship dynamic with the ghost applies real pressure and reveals her vulnerability without over-explaining. Contradictory impulses—nostalgia as comfort versus despair’s pull—coexist credibly. The emotional shift away from despair feels earned, if softly priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and the accumulative/textural drive holds. The coin offer and the echo-dance produce a coherent on-page reconfiguration: despair recedes as possibilities flicker. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, with a modest but felt cost (risk, surrender to the uncanny). Causal links are clean even within a lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The orchard within the maze is sensorially rich and POV-filtered, with lanterns, scent, and tactile details that shape tone and final image. The environment meaningfully hosts and colors the climax even if it rarely constrains tactics. World-rules (ghost, coin, echoes) remain consistent and learned through action. Selection is economical and specific rather than tourist-listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on art-as-salvage from despair, tightened by the ghost’s proposition to “intertwine” and the ensuing dance. The escalation is primarily tonal/density-based rather than adversarial, fitting the lens but limiting felt jeopardy. The cost is present but soft; no live option is sharply foreclosed. Still, agency drives the turn and the pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of performance, memory, and healing through shared art emerge organically via coin, echoes, and synesthesia. The ghost’s endless encore desire refracts Eliza’s loss without sermonizing, and the final image reweights nostalgia from corrosive to buoyant. Subtext operates in gesture and image (the echo-dance) rather than explicit thesis. The resonance lingers, if gently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical close-third voice saturated with synesthetic textures remains consistent. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with the ghost’s diction distinct and charged. Rhythm modulates well across beats, supporting the accumulative build. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The prose is polished and musical, with high information density; images do double duty for mood and meaning. Occasionally it edges toward purple (stacked modifiers and intensifiers), but clarity holds and repetition is limited. Syntax varies enough to maintain momentum and avoid drumbeat patterns. Final lines are clean and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The blend of synesthesia, a stage-ghost encore hunger, and echo-weaving to mend fractured time feels fresh and coherent. Specifics (tarot coin hums with color-taste, orchard lanterns) prevent template drift. The closure is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is evident in the lyric accumulative approach without sacrificing legibility.</comment>
