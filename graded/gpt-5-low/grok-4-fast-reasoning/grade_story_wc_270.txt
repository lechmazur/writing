<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is vivid and consistent, and her choices drive every turn. However, she faces little internal contradiction—there’s scarcely a beat where her insurgent impulse collides with fear or doubt. Embodied emotion is present but mostly channeled through mission-forward narration. The final choice feels earned but lacks a visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: plants → kite → decoding → cavern → unsealing → embryo awakening. Orientation is strong and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (defying tradition) more than an on-page price. No major teleports or broken set-ups. Slight deduction as the price of the act remains largely implied.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are sensorially rich and operational: steam, fissures, geothermal preservation, and warming the amber shape action and final image. Details are filtered through Mira’s insurgent/pragmatic lens. The setting constrains paths and empowers tactics. A hair shy of 9+ because environmental constraint never bites hard with risk.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (upend ossified tradition) is clear and escalates through discovery → decoding → unseal. Pressure is coherent but low-friction; success feels comparatively unresisted and risk-light. The “incantation + tap” climax resolves smoothly without a true trade-off on the page. Tension exists more conceptually than viscerally.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of intentional evolution vs. petrified tradition are organically tied to events and images (roots, crust, reconstruction, embryo). Some lines verge on thesis-stating (“evolving tradition with intent”), reducing subtext. The final image reweights prior material credibly. Complexity is present but not deeply contested on the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stable, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (plant-whispers, geothermal lexicon). Diction is elevated yet coherent for Mira’s stature and history. Modulation at the climax remains controlled and legible. Minor flourish excess keeps it short of top-tier.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and efficient for most of the piece, with purposeful imagery that carries action and theme. Occasional purple turns and intensifiers risk redundancy but don’t stall momentum. Rhythm varies well; syntax supports propulsion. No significant loops or figurative muddle at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Insurgent grandmother + plant-telepathy + kite-script + embryo-in-amber is a fresh synthesis that feels of-a-piece. The discovery method and world logic cohere. Emotional ingenuity is solid though the path is a bit frictionless. Strong, memorable turn with distinctive images.</comment>
