<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and character-particular (sacred thresholds, returning after the butterfly effect) and her micro-choices (studying the grain, arranging prisms, whispering codes) align with that drive. Internal contradiction is light; the piece favors devotional focus over contested impulses, so cost and struggle feel muted. Embodied perception via wood veins and prisms grounds her interiority. The closing action is earned but emotionally low-friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is coherent: analysis of the table yields the logbook, whose codes inform the prism alignment that draws her home. Single-POV, one-scene structure with a clean on-page turn supports a Decisive Change at the end. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a causal assist, and it holds. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, which slightly softens the closure’s impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vivid and specific, with tactile wood, refracting light, and spatial thresholds that shape choice. Environmental resources (prisms, edge/void) directly enable the tactic that resolves the story. World rules are learned through action rather than dumped. The atmosphere sustains tone without slipping into generic mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes (finding a way back by honoring thresholds) are signaled early and the discovery/use of the logbook is a meaningful deepening. Pressure accrues gently rather than through sharp opposition; the solution arrives without significant resistance. The narrowing of options is primarily conceptual, not peril-driven. The ending is earned but lacks a palpable on-page price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motif of “necessary distances” threads through maze lore, aviation codes, and the prism tactic, culminating in a reweighting of connection through space. However, lines like “core concept crystallize” and “necessary distances were the quiet architects of meaning” tilt toward explicit thesis. Despite minor on-the-nose moments, the final image re-situates earlier particulars with resonance. The theme arises mostly from images and choices, not mere assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensorially biased to Elara’s way of noticing (grain, prisms, thresholds). Rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful without head-hopping. Occasional elevated abstraction brushes against purple but does not break stance. No dialogue is needed; the lyric POV carries the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean with effective image-work and momentum; information density is respectable. There are minor redundancies (reiterated “featherly determined”; restating thematic claims) and occasional abstract phrasing. Figurative layering remains coherent and does not muddle action. The final cadence lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—corn-maze cartography meeting aviation weather codes on a prism terrace—feels fresh and particular. The “necessary distances” concept is integrated as both theme and tactic, not a pasted-on idea. Risk-taking in worldbuilding and object logic pays off without obscuring clarity. A bit more friction or cost could have elevated the ingenuity’s emotional charge.</comment>
