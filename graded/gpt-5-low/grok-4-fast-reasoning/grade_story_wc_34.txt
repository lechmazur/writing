<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elowen’s motivation—to voice the ghost’s encoded longings—is clear and aligned to her identity as a seldom-heard balladeer. Micro-choices (choosing the walls, using the plate as guide, pressing it to the mural) reflect consistent purpose. However, internal conflict and visible cost are minimal; she faces little resistance or doubt. The arc lands more as fulfillment than struggle, limiting depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-scene flow is coherent: discovery → translation via graffiti → release of the ghost. Closure lands on the page as the ghost emerges; the causal chain holds. The cost is largely conceptual rather than felt, but the before/after is legible. The accumulative/textural lens is steady, with the storm window providing a soft ticking clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, stone walls, cloud-blossoms, and storm create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that shapes tactics (using walls as canvas, storm window as urgency). The object-as-setting (bolt plate) and weather charge the final image. Sensory specificity stays purposeful and filtered through Elowen’s attention. The environment materially participates in the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the ghost—is clear, and escalation occurs via the impending storm and the encoding process. Pressure remains gentle; few options close and there’s little friction or cost for Elowen. The final act derives from her agency, but the path is unimpeded. The urgency reads more lyrical than strenuous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of voice, preservation vs. freedom, and art/tech synthesis emerge organically through action (graffiti as translation, the plate as conduit). The final “beacon” image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext of neglected creators and overlooked voices lingers credibly. Slight neatness in outcome limits the complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is consistent and suited to the material, with deft rhythmic control. Perceptual bias feels character-specific (attention to mist, gears, blooms, code as music). No head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains stable. Occasional flourish edges toward lushness but stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and musical, with strong imagery density and generally clean syntax. Some purple tendencies and adjective stacks risk redundancy, but clarity holds. Momentum is maintained without scaffold loops. Final lines resolve by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of a flower press bolt plate, graffiti encoding, and a code-ghost under “tinkersong wonder” is fresh and coherent. The object’s re-purposing and the storm’s temporal frame feel inventive rather than gimmicky. Emotional truth is quieter than the aesthetic flourish, keeping it just shy of exceptional. Still, it stands out for imaginative synthesis.</comment>
