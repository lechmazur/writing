<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear dual drive (duty vs. brother) informs micro-choices like taking the right fork and using the laser, with embodied perception supporting her “spatially gifted” lens. The crucible with the intruder is restrained but functional, and her final internal shift is earned if a touch tidy. “Sensed no threat” reads a bit convenient under pressure, softening struggle. The renunciation of the brother’s ghost lands but could register more visible cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal through-line is clean: alert → pursuit → encounter → tool use → conceptual reveal → reconfigured stance. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: she reframes security and personal grief via entanglement. The resolution is mostly internal and lightly didactic but coherent for the length. A late meta-artifact sentence breaks immersion but not causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The farm is vividly tactile and luminous; spores, humidity, and glow shape tactics and the final image (deactivate beam, wildfire dims). The laser-as-tool and permeable spore membranes integrate setting with action and theme. Strong sensory selectivity matches POV competence. Slight excess of glow/fire metaphors risks sameness but rarely stalls motion.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure climbs from intrusion alert to confrontation to a risky test of the prototype; the knowledge turn deepens stakes rather than broadens them. The decisive beat is her choice to aim and modulate the laser, enabling the conceptual flip. External risk stays low and the cost is primarily internal, keeping the arc modest. Still, one meaningful tightening occurs and the ending is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The entanglement/letting-go motif is threaded through spores, barriers, and the final dimming image; it meaningfully reweights her grief. Occasional on-the-nose phrasing (“physics of letting go”) and expository lines blunt subtext. The last realization is emotionally credible if slightly summarized. Overall, theme emerges from action more than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Close third is steady with a distinct sensory bias; “quiet wildfire” cadence supports tone. Dialogue is sparse and serviceable, though Dr. Lorne’s line veers toward didactic. A glaring meta-edit intrusion near the end punctures voice control and authority. Otherwise, distance is consistent and suited to the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lines often do double duty and rhythm modulates well, integrating technical detail without sludge. However, a bracketed/meta sentence (“But wait, 815 is over…”) is a significant artifact that breaks immersion and dulls the closure image. Some metaphor repetition (glow/wildfire) and a few explanatory sentences could tighten. Clean mechanics overall but the artifact is costly at this length.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent-farm-as-quantum-network via light-sensitive spores is a fresh synthesis, and tying disentanglement to grief is elegant. The laser pointer as “button” that syncs with spores feels specific and memorable. Expository patches and a safe interpersonal resolution temper daring. Still, the conceptual integration reads inventive and coherent.</comment>
