<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (liberate her sister; turn vulnerability into strength) is clear and embodied in choices (dice, dance, journal). Interiority is vivid if somewhat idealized; we rarely see contradictory impulses or a messy falter under pressure. Her competence reads high with limited on-page cost, softening the crucible with Silas. Still, actions align tightly with motive and culminate credibly in the liberation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Hybrid with a causal backbone: dice → codes → dance → AI persuasion → interface → liberation. Orientation is immediate and stable; the single-scene arc holds cleanly. Closure is a decisive change (sister restored) with some cost implied (risk, alarms) but not intensely felt. No major causality breaks, though resistance resolves a bit easily.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken lab is tactile and operative: water pressure, silted panels, submerged cables, flickering AI, and water-resistant journal affect tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrated into action rather than excursus. The final ascent reframes the sea from oppression to conveyance, charging the closing image. Strong environmental specificity without drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes (freeing Liora) are declared and pursued, with one deepening turn as Silas resists then syncs. Pressure grows, but adversity is mild: alarms “bubble faintly,” persuasion succeeds quickly, and no option is sharply foreclosed. The cost feels primarily emotional and symbolic. Escalation is present but not bracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres—vulnerability encrypted as strength, web motifs reweighted at the end into freedom’s expanse. The dice, dance, and journal braid into a credible metaphor of reclamation without heavy moralizing. A few phrases verge on explicit thesis, but resonance predominates via image and act. The closing embrace and ascent offer a non-literal answer that lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent; imagery and rhythm are distinct without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is sparse but apt; Silas’s line carries tonal charge and subtext. Psychic distance remains steady, and diction matches the piece’s mythic-tech register. Minor repetition does not undercut the voice’s authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are polished with high image density; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional purple edges and repeated motifs (“calm defiance,” spider-web) add a touch of redundancy. Rhythm varies well and sequencing is clear; no major artifact loops. The prose carries momentum without choking on its own figurative weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—underwater heist by dance, hangman’s dice as cipher seeds, poems in binary—feels fresh and coherent. The AI persuasion via embodied choreography is especially inventive. Risks in style and concept land without muddling stakes. Only the smoothness of resolution keeps it from higher.</comment>
