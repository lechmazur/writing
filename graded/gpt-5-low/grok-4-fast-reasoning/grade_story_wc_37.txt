<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (rekindle a dying realm) is clear and her actions—excavating songs, gathering fruit, swaddling the window—align. Interiority is evocative but archetypal; contradictions are minimal beyond trembling and scattered memories aligning. Micro-choices do exist (which songs, turning to the window) but costs feel light and largely aesthetic rather than truly fraught. Strong, but not transformative characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: songs accrue, window is prepared, dawn reweaves the world. Closure lands on-page via the humming window and blooming dawn (RR/CR hybrid), but the explicit cost is muted. The bracketed meta intrusions at the end slightly fracture cadence and dilute the final image. Still coherent single-scene structure with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse, mica window, and alchemical fruit are vivid and integrated; the environment supplies resources and dictates tactics (digging, crushing, swaddling). Sensory specificity and rule-consistency are strong and filtered through Elara’s mission. The window as charged object anchors the final image. World details feel purpose-driven rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and consistent; pressure deepens as songs summon echoes and the fruit-paste swaddling activates the window. Escalation is smooth but low-friction—little resistance or sacrifice beyond effort—and the price paid is largely conceptual. The final act is hers and causally earns the rekindling. Solid tightening without a sharp trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory, restoration, and binding/release emerge organically through the woven dawns and ancestral songs. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Slight sentimentality and the meta-bracketed lines undercut lingering resonance. Still, the orchard-song-window triad carries genuine subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct textural cadence suited to the premise. POV distance is steady and appropriate. However, late meta-editorial brackets break the established voice and puncture immersion. Absent those, this would read cleaner and more controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is often lush and purposeful, but density of figurative language risks purple patches. More significantly, the bracketed meta lines in the final third are overt scaffolding that disrupt momentum and dull the closure image. Minor redundancy exists, though most sentences carry weight. Proofing and cadence otherwise read strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard, mica portal of inverted truths, and woven dawns feel fresh and coherently synthesized. The ritual of swaddling with luminous fruit paste is an inventive turn. Emotional stakes are less novel than the worldbuilding, but the combination feels singular rather than template. Risk-taking is evident without collapsing clarity.</comment>
