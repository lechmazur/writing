<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—transforming accumulated remorse before it breaks her—is clear and drives each choice. Interiority is specific to her palate-based gift and craft. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates once the pavilion appears, which slightly flattens the struggle. Still, her endurance under emotional contagion reads as an earned, character-shaped cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: rain → tidal pools → contagion vision → dig → pavilion → orbs → absorption → dawn. Closure lands on the page with cost through the arduous subsumption and bodily chill. The “dream-logic” discovery skirts convenience but is thematically seeded and paid off. The arc fits a single-scene progression with one meaningful tightening in the pavilion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The desert-after-rain milieu and the coral ice pavilion are vividly rendered and purpose-driven. Weather and terrain constrain action (rain reveals pools; softened sand allows digging) and the pavilion’s cold shapes the ordeal. Sensory detail is lush yet filtered through a chef’s sensibility. The final dawn image is charged by the environment’s transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain/transform remorse) is established early and deepens inside the pavilion. The key tightening is Elara choosing to ingest orbs raw, accepting contagion as cost. Stakes are primarily internal; external peril is minimal, keeping tension contained but coherent. The resolution is earned by her persistence rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres around transmuting communal guilt into nourishment, with foodcraft as bridge and burden. Recurring images (tidal formations, brittle/sturdy, sandpapering) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The pavilion reframes her gift as civic caretaking with cost. Resonance lingers in the shift from haunting to healing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person close maintains a consistent, sensuous register befitting a chef-reading world through taste and pattern. Rhythm modulates well from hush to ordeal. No dialogue, but narrative stance is steady and confident without unearned omniscience. Elevated diction feels voice-motivated rather than generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is rich and mostly precise; images align (sand, tide, ice, taste) without mixed metaphors. A few lines lean purple, but momentum holds and scaffolding is minimal. Sentence variety supports flow, and information density is high. The closing cadence lands cleanly without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—culinary psychometry, tidal divination, an under-dune coral ice reliquary of regret—is striking and cohesive. The concept is not mere ornament; it directs tactics and closure. Risks in imagery and premise pay off with an organic logic. Emotional truth (bearing others’ remorse) grounds the novelty.</comment>
