<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (find truth, transmute bitterness) is clear and her micro-choices—pocketing the arrowhead, activating the phone, embracing the pull—track. Interiority is concrete (soil, cold, obsidian eyes) and character-specific. The turn to acceptance feels swift, with little contradictory resistance in the peak beat, softening the felt price. Thorne functions as a gentle mirror rather than a pressure source.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain is clean: discovery → phone confessions → arrowhead activation → gravity shift → metamorphosis. Orientation is strong early and the closure is an on-page decisive change with a conceptual repricing of “curse” to “invitation.” The cost (leaving prior life) is implied rather than dramatized, modestly reducing weight. Lens reads hybrid leaning causal, held through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underground garden is vividly particular (bioluminescent fungi, frostfern, packed earth walls) and integrated with action. The space materially responds to the harmony (levitating herbs, bowing plants), charging the climax and final image. Object-as-setting (arrowhead, phone) also anchors place-based pressure. Texture stays character-filtered, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. joining) tightens through the phone’s revelations and the arrowhead’s activation, culminating in a clear before/after. Escalation is steady but gentler than optimal; Elara meets little friction in choosing metamorphosis. The external and internal lines interweave, yet the price is felt more conceptually than viscerally. Still, the narrowing is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Loss reframed as invitation and the “cosmic joke” motif recur and reweight the ending image. Subtext largely rides the objects and atmosphere rather than dialogue; Elara’s laughter over “hopeful waters” resonates. A few explicit statements (“The cryptids’ world wasn’t horror…”) verge on thematic telling, shaving subtlety. Overall coherence holds and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled third-limited voice with crisp, icy lyricism suits the piece; rhythm modulates well at the turn. Diction is consistent and character-filtered, avoiding exposition dumps. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful (brother’s voice; Thorne’s line) and subtext-supporting. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with mostly clean, vivid lines; images carry multiple jobs. Occasional lushness (“cosmic joke” reiterated; stacked modifiers) risks purple but does not blur causality. Syntax varies and momentum is maintained without scaffolding loops. Final image lands clearly with charged objects.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—herbalist bunker, bioluminescent hush, an old cordless phone channeling confessions, and “gravitationally playful” wilds—feels fresh and specific. The arrowhead/phone duet is inventive and thematically integrated. Transformation is a known trope but reframed with tonal wit and conceptual reweighting. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity.</comment>
