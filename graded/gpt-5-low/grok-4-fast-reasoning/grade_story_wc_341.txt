<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (prove the sky “remembers” Lena) drives embodied choices under pressure. Grief refracts through meteorological habit in credible, character-specific ways (emotion-tagged clouds, journaling). The risk of hypoxia and the refusal of protocols reveal contradiction without sermonizing. A hair soft on a decisive internal clash beyond endurance, but the cost is palpable.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: the snapped tether initiates a lyric ascent of pressure to a conceptual repricing at dawn (“the proof settle like sediment”). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/CR: he accepts a reweighted world where emptiness archives loss, pays with risk and renunciation of protocol. Orientation is clean early; the auxiliary descent provides a concrete outward beat to balance the inward turn. Slightly on-the-nose declaration of “He had proven it” blunts the final image’s autonomy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: dusty starlight, thin air, stratocumulus “shroud,” and the brass telescope all filter through a meteorologist’s gaze. The gondola and altitude constrain options (hypoxia, vents), charging the ending. Detail selection is economical and character-biased rather than touristy. A strong, unified weather-sky lexicon sustains mood without static cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and coherent: an inner proof under external scarcity. Escalation is a steady tightening (air thinning, “quietly explosive” pressure) toward a vow and descent, with risk as the visible cost. Agency is attention and endurance; the refusal to abandon the method under strain feels earned. The tension is felt, though it never tips into a hard reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Grief-as-archive and “spooled wholeness” braid through objects and actions, then reweight at closure (“threads rewinding the spool”). Subtext mostly rides images and method rather than exposition, though the explicit claim of proof trims mystery. The emotional aftertaste is tender and non-tidy. The concept holds without false symmetry or platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable, close single-POV with a distinct observational idiom—meteorological lexicon bent by grief. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure (oxygen scarcity) without losing control. Repetition of tonal phrases is patterned, not lazy, though one or two lines verge on declarative summary. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are generally tight, multi-tasking description with action and interiority. A few intensifiers and reiterations (“dusty starlight,” explicit “He had proven it”) flirt with purple and reduce the final image’s restraint. Syntax and paragraphing vary with good mouthfeel. No major scaffold or filter-verb stacking; momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: a scientist’s grief ritualized through emotional cloud taxonomy in a free-drifting balloon, anchored by “spooled wholeness.” The recurring tool and tone are integrated rather than ornamental. The conceptual turn reads inevitable from the seeded method. Not radical in form, but confidently singular in sensibility.</comment>
