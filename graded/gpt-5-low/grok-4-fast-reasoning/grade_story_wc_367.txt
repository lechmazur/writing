<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Herald’s motive is clear and consistent—shaping a new dawn—and his interior contradiction (shadowed elation vs. isolation/obsolescence) gives texture. Micro-choices (tilting, steering, tempering the storm, finally extinguishing the wick) align with that motive. However, pressure rarely forces a true trade-off on the page; acceptance of obsolescence reads more as lyric acceptance than a tested decision. The emotional embodiment is vivid but leans conceptual over viscerally felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual → visions → steering → acceptance/extinguishing forms a coherent arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the final extinguishing after the “fading” vision reframes the routine with cost (obsolescence). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the pattern is taught and kept. The cost is present but remains mostly conceptual; no decisive narrowing beyond the chosen ritual slightly limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Emerald Lighthouse, the sea-glass wick, and star-studded night are richly specific and integrated into action (steering via the lantern, TIR, extinguishing). Setting functions as tool and constraint, charging the final image. World rules remain consistent and are learned through use, not exposition dumps. A touch of ornamental flourish occasionally outpaces functional detail, but not enough to blunt clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes—reshape dawn, temper a storm, risk self-obsolescence—are legible and interwoven. Escalation arrives as density/cadence increase and the prophecy of his fading, culminating in a final steering pulse and extinguishing. Still, pressure seldom tightens into a hard trade-off; the storm is gentled without a visible price paid beyond conceptual role loss. The lack of a concrete foreclosed option keeps this below the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres around legacy, renewal from ruin, and the shift from material omens to digital ephemera. Recurring images (wick, shadows, laughter) reweight at the end, offering a non-literal answer: yielding the old role is what enables the new dawn. A few lines verge on declarative thesis (“post-newspaper era”), but image-led beats carry the load. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The elevated lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-suited to the mythic frame. Distance control is stable; no head-hopping or stance drift. Occasional register excess edges toward purple, but rhythm and diction largely support momentum. Purposeful compression and patterned elision are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lines are musical with high information density and purposeful repetitions, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Some figurative stacking and intensifiers create mild purple drift and small redundancy (“ancient shadows,” “otherworldly routine” reiterated). Despite this, syntax varies and images remain coherent, preserving propulsion. Minor trims could sharpen pressure at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—storm-herald guardian using TIR in a post-print world to steer shadow into renewal—is fresh and memorable. The propulsive originality grows from specific mechanics (glass wick, starlight whisper) rather than quirky ornament. Risk is taken in sustaining a ritualized, non-causal frame, and it largely pays off. Emotional stakes could cut deeper on the page to ascend further.</comment>
