<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her actions align with it as she leaves the outpost and follows the mist. Interiority is present but largely linear; contradictory impulses are muted, with little struggle beyond the cold and uncertainty. “Dry‑witted” is not dramatized, and confidence reads as label‑forward rather than costed. The final acceptance/understanding beat is earned but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative finish: condensation pattern → thin ice/vibration → mist line → fissure/source forms a coherent, motivated progression. Orientation is clean from the opening and the single scene holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she finds the origin and reframes it into “the language of the river.” The cost is subtle (leaving the outpost, exposure and renunciation of maps), adequate for this quiet scale.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vivid, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s cartographic eye. Environment constrains and guides choice: thin ice, vibration, and mist line channel her path and charge the final image. The condensation pattern doubling as a map integrates setting with action. Specificity is economical and purposeful across senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a river’s beginning—is clear, and pressure builds in a single tightening from observation to discovery. Escalation is gentle: there’s minimal resistance beyond weather and risk, so cost remains low. The falcon’s return catalyzes but does not complicate. Resolution is earned but lacks a turn that forecloses a more palpable alternative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of origins and translation emerges organically through phrasebook, condensation-as-map, and the river’s “language.” The “singular convergence” motif accrues and reweights in the end without overt moralizing. The final gesture—adding a new entry—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Slight neatness keeps it shy of deeper ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third POV is steady and plausible, with diction aligned to Elara’s professional sensibility. Prose modulates from quiet interiority to focused observation without leakage or head-hopping. No dialogue needed; the narrative voice carries subtext through image. Rhythm remains controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive lines with selective imagery; repetition supports motif rather than padding. Minor redundancy (“worrying tranquility” recurs) but momentum holds. Figurative language is coherent and grounded in physical logic (condensation/veins/map). Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm are sound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The atlas editor + phrasebook + falcon + condensation-as-map synthesis feels fresh and well-integrated. The discovery arc is familiar, but the linguistic reframing and quiet closure add distinction. Risks are restrained but coherent. It stops short of a transformative originality leap due to low on-page cost.</comment>
