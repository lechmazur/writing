<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s guardedness versus grace is clear and embodied in tactile work details and her choice to drop the scrimshaw. Motivation (to embrace her true nature) coheres through the dream and the island. The final renunciation reads earned, with the loss of the scrimshaw and surrender of defenses as cost. Slight neatness to the epiphany keeps it shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: find scrimshaw → dream → whale call → island → barrier → detachment → change. Closure lands on the page with cost (she lets the key sink and loses it to gain access). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single POV never wavers. Stakes remain intimate but coherent through to ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sea, sublittoral fringe, and appearing island feel tactile and charged; the barrier of water/light constrains choice. The scrimshaw as an object‑setting axis ties environment to action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful without touring. Slightly less pressure from weather/terrain on tactics prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom via self‑acceptance) is signaled early and tightens at the barrier, forcing a trade‑off (key vs access). The decisive act of letting go narrows options and exacts a price. External pressure is low, but internal pressure escalates cleanly under the chosen lens. A touch more friction or jeopardy would heighten tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Images (whale call, guarded heart, disappearing island) build a coherent theme of surrender to authentic self. However, the final sentence states the moral outright, undercutting subtextual resonance. The earlier whale‑song and vanishing island already carried the answer without needing articulation. This directness trims the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a distinct marine lexicon fits Elara’s world and stays consistent. Rhythm varies with scene needs, and the voice isn’t over‑explaining. Elevated diction is controlled and character‑apt. Absence of dialogue avoids a potential pitfall and keeps focus tight.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, with purposeful imagery and minimal scaffolding; the scrimshaw beats carry good density. A few abstractions (“freedom… embracing who she truly was”) and the stated moral soften line‑level sharpness near the end. Otherwise, momentum and clarity hold. No major artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The treaty rendering violence impossible, a guarded heart as an on‑page presence, and an island summoned by heart make for a fresh synthesis. The scrimshaw‑as‑key with a whale’s call as method feels specific, not templated. Emotional truth reads intact. Slight conventionality in the explicit moral caps the ceiling.</comment>
