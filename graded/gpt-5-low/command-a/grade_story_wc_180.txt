<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (repairing the vow/bridging wisdom) is clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with objects reveals character. However, contradictory impulses are minimal and the epiphany (“Perhaps the breach wasn’t a failure…”) arrives neatly, with limited on‑page struggle. The “endearingly feisty” trait is mostly told rather than dramatized under pressure. The final choice feels emotionally credible but light on visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning causal: her decision to persist leads to using bag items → altar scroll → blooming tree → vow transformation. Orientation is crisp early; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the ribbon woven into the glowing tree. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized loss, keeping the change persuasive but soft. The chain of actions holds together without major gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral‑orchard is vivid and integrated; light through shattered glass, roots in stone, and the altar compartment ground action and tone. The environment indirectly shapes choices (altar as site, orchard as living metaphor) and charges the final image. While it doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it meaningfully frames the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes (mending the vow/self) are declared, but pressure remains gentle and solutions appear with minimal resistance: the key fits, the petals bloom, the compass points. Escalation is more accumulative texture than constriction, with little foreclosing of options or price paid. The shift is earned but low‑tension. No reversal tests her resolve beyond a single “persist” beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of renewal/repricing the breach is coherent and carried by recurring images (ribbon, orchard, seasonal vows). The line “mending wasn’t about restoring what was lost but about creating something new” states the thesis a bit directly, softening subtext. The final image reweights earlier material with honest, if gentle, resonance. Complexity is modest, with limited counterpressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and plausible, with a clean, lyrical narrative stance matched to Elara’s sensibility. Diction is consistent and avoids head‑hopping; the lone whispered word functions as action. Some phrasing leans familiar, but rhythm is controlled. Voice doesn’t radically modulate under stress, reflecting the low-intensity pressure profile.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and mostly economical, with purposeful images and clean mechanics. Occasional abstractions and thesis lines slightly blunt momentum, and a few sentiments repeat in near‑paraphrase. Figurative density stays within control; no mixed metaphors obstruct sense. Final cadence is crisp and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quartz‑eye mender, deciduous vows, and orchard‑in‑rafters synthesis feels fresh, with tactile magic via mundane tools. The problem‑solving via forgotten bag is familiar but well‑inflected. Resolution trends tidy, limiting the sense of risk. Still, the specific constellation of objects and setting reads memorable and coherent.</comment>
