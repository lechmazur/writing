<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear motive (seek truth via the library) and embodied affect (“cautious exuberance,” the watch’s warmth) create a credible POV. Choices—entering, following the hum, writing, leaving—track with her aims. Internal conflict is mild; fear vs. hope is stated more than dramatized under pressure. The closing acceptance of the conduit role reads earned but carries limited on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mist → archway symbols → hum/cipher → desk → backward watch → writing → departure. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines herself as conduit and exits with the living document. Causality is soft but coherent (the watch’s code guides her path); no orientation debt. The cost is modest (leaving under a closing window), not fully stress‑tested.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The library and mist are vividly rendered through smell, light, and shifting symbols; the watch functions as micro‑setting. Environment constrains choice by guiding her via the hum and imposing a closing window, and it charges the final image (pulsing parchment as the library dims). World rules feel consistent and taught through action. Strong economy with purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the answer) is signaled and progresses to the desk and countdown. The notable tightening is the watch ticking backward and the need to document before the library closes. Opposition is low; pressure remains atmospheric more than adversarial. The price paid is mostly conceptual, so escalation lacks a sharper trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of time’s nonlinearity, voice for the unspoken, and agency as conduit emerge organically from objects and images. The “propagation delays” claim edges toward telling, but the living‑words idea still resonates. The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a calm, lyrical cadence suited to wonder and dread. Diction is controlled, sensory bias is coherent, and no head‑hopping occurs. Rhythm tightens at the desk/countdown without losing clarity. Slight repetition (“cautious exuberance,” symbol descriptors) keeps it just shy of a more distinctive signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythm and efficient sensory layering. Minor redundancy (“cyclically reversed” idea appears twice; “cautious exuberance” repeats) but not momentum‑killing. Figurative language stays legible and avoids purple excess. Information density is solid; nearly every line advances atmosphere or action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The “library of unspoken words” and the sentient cipher/watch synthesis feel fresh within familiar mythic furniture. The backward countdown and living text provide a non‑obvious turn. Emotional stakes skew conceptual rather than personal, limiting singular memorability. Still, the piece commits to its premise with integrity.</comment>
