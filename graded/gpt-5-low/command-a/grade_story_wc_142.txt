<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her role as “culture shock absorber” gives her purposeful agency. However, interior contradiction and embodied emotion are mostly summarized rather than dramatized, limiting depth at decision points. Vorin functions as a flat foil without testing her in scene. The final act (placing the stone) feels earned but low-cost in personal terms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Situational lens fits: looming privatization applies steady pressure, and the Festival of Lights creates a closure beat (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis). Orientation is clean; the causal chain (graffiti → decoding → rally → festival) is coherent. The cost at closure is conceptual more than felt—Vorin’s disruption is noted but not dramatized, softening impact. Still, the final image reconfigures stance credibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city’s “perpetual carnival” atmosphere is vivid and consistent, and the stone chip charges the final image. Environmental detail supports theme and tone, though it rarely constrains on‑page choices tactically. The setting influences stakes (privatization of a floating city) and provides a strong festival frame. More tactile engagement with water, proximity, and barge logistics would elevate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community identity vs privatization) is clear, and pressure coheres toward the festival. Escalation mostly accrues via summary—resistance, Vorin’s opposition, and the rally—without a decisive on‑page test that exacts a price. The tightening beat is the public display becoming a rallying cry. Cost remains largely implied rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, identity, and resistance to gentrification are integrated through the graffiti code and foundation stone. The “dual allegiance” motif is conceptually strong and reframed at the end. Some lines edge into telling (“gentrification wasn’t just about…”) that flattens subtext. The closing image resonates but could carry more ambiguity or price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and controlled; the voice is clear with occasional lyric lift. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with Vorin’s line marking status and conflict. The narrative distance stays consistent and plausible. The voice could be more singular under pressure, but it never leaks or hedges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with good rhythm and economy; images like “jigsaw puzzle of dreams and desperation” are apt. Some summarizing compresses dramatic beats, but lines rarely loop or pad. No figurative muddle in peak moments; diction stays consistent. A few abstractions could be replaced by concrete action to heighten momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating carnival city under threat, decoded graffiti as civic memory, and the foundation chip as talisman offer a fresh synthesis. The premise avoids gimmickry and coheres with the conflict. While the gentrification frame is familiar, the maritime setting and coded art give it distinct texture. Greater on‑page risk would push it into a higher band.</comment>
