<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (answers to dreams; pull toward the grotto) and actions align under pressure. Embodied fear vs duty registers in small beats (crunching boots, metallic scent) but internal contradiction remains modest and resolves neatly. The vow reads earned yet a touch tidy, with limited visible cost beyond acceptance of responsibility. Still, the queen’s micro‑choices (pressing on, calling out, vowing) credibly chart change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean causal flow: warning → ascent → discovery → revelation → vow → descent. Single POV and two‑shard progression stay anchored; the closure is a decisive internal turn plus conceptual repricing of starlight as lifeblood. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening the landing. The lens reads primarily causal with a thematic reveal at the apex.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory work (metallic air, pulsing crystals, waterfall of molten silver) builds atmosphere integral to mood. The grotto’s warmth, height, and labyrinthine geometry influence pacing and resolve. The environment charges the final image (grotto’s sigh), though it rarely constrains tactics beyond the steady climb. Strong specificity without museum‑tour fatigue.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/balance) is signaled early; pressure tightens as the starlight proves alive and exploited. The main turn is knowledge‑driven rather than action‑driven, but it credibly narrows options and forces the vow. Visible cost remains light on the page, making the escalation feel more ethical than perilous. Tension is steady, if not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Responsibility vs extraction emerges coherently through image chains (fireflies vs bleeding starlight). The figure’s line “The truth is a burden” tips into overt thesis, slightly flattening subtext. The ending’s quieter repricing (light kept in her heart, grotto’s sigh) still resonates. Thematic complexity is present but risk‑averse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person with controlled distance; diction and rhythm suit the fable‑like register. Dialogue is brief and clear but leans declarative rather than subtextual. Perceptual signature (lacy menace, ember/cobalt contrasts) maintains coherence. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with varied cadence and strong verbs; imagery is often apt. Occasional purple echoes and phrase repetitions (“lacy menace,” “softly commanding”) nibble at freshness. Minimal scaffold; momentum remains intact. Figurative density stays legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>“Bleeding starlight” and the grotto’s living geometry feel fresh, though the quest‑revelation‑vow arc is familiar. The conceptual turn from mystery to responsibility is sound if unsurprising. World logic coheres without gimmickry. A bolder cost or non‑obvious moral calculus would elevate originality.</comment>
