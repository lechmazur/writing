<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s drive is lucid and consistent, and her decisions (traveling to the cathedral, painting through the night) align with motive. Interiority is textured but skews abstract, with little contradictory impulse under on‑page pressure. The change at the end feels earned but soft, with minimal visible cost beyond effort and solitude. Absence of a relational crucible limits complexity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Structure is clean: pavilion → decision → cathedral immersion → studio completion → realization, cohering under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing (beauty in darkness) connected to the mural’s completion. Causality is modest but consistent; no teleports or broken setups. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it short of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cathedral and stained glass are sensorially vivid and filter through Elara’s priorities, guiding her action (the trip, the hours spent reading the windows). Recurring anchors (amber pavilion, melting winter, etched glass) charge the final image. Detail is purposeful and integrated rather than touristic. The environment meaningfully shapes her method and the ending’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily internal and gentle, with one tightening (choosing to go, then to work through the night). Stakes remain abstract—no meaningful external constraint or trade‑off is forced on the page. The hours spent “reckoning” deepen texture but do not create a decisive reversal. Resolution feels earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motifs (postcards, etched glass, dawn/night‑bloom) braid into a coherent meditation on beauty in darkness and layered history. However, the final paragraph states the thesis explicitly, edging toward moralizing and reducing ambiguity. Earlier images do the thematic work best; the last lines explain what the mural shows. The emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with lyrical diction matching subject and maintaining plausible access. Rhythm is controlled, with repeat images providing cohesion without opacity. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elision is purposeful. Slight tendency toward elevated, abstract phrasing in peak moments keeps it shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly efficient; repeated motifs carry weight. Occasional purple hue and near‑synonym echoes (“dawning hush,” “umbral tenderness”) risk redundancy but don’t obscure sense. Sentence rhythm varies well, and information density is strong. The closing aphorism flattens tension slightly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise (artist seeking a dream’s cathedral hush) isn’t novel, but the etched‑glass/old‑postcard conduit adds a distinctive texture. The seasonal melt as temporal hinge is elegant. The piece favors beauty over risk; no surprising turn or hard cost emerges. Its integrity is consistent, if safe.</comment>
