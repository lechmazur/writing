<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (decoding “the mathematics of emotion”) is clear and consistent, and his contradictory impulses—yearning for connection vs. fear of self‑loss—surface when the empathy flood overwhelms him. Embodied beats (“ragged gasps,” trembling fingers) keep it grounded. The final reorientation (empathy expands boundaries) feels earned by the on‑page ordeal. A slight tilt toward abstract phrasing in key realizations keeps it shy of the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds from ritual work to deliberate disorientation to contact to overwhelm, landing in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on the page with cost (identity edges soften, near‑loss of self, halo dims). Orientation is clean from the start; single scene coherence is strong. The turn is quiet but decisive under this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The Topaz workshop, open ceiling, and star‑to‑dawn transition create a vivid, specific atmosphere filtered through Elias’s craft and obsession. The halo fragment functions as a charged micro‑setting/object that returns meaningfully at the end (its light dimmed). Environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, so it falls short of 9‑band, but integration is rich and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and apt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock empathy without dissolving self) is signaled early and tightens when he chooses disorientation, then contact, triggering the overwhelming flood. The cost is legible and alters stance; he regains ground with a changed understanding. Escalation is more internal than external but coherent and sufficient at this length. A small additional constraint or trade‑off could further sharpen the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of empathy’s boundaries and identity permeability arise from concrete beats (borrowed personalities merging; halo’s “code” embodied as felt flood). The final insight resonates, reweighting the premise with a credible cost. Some lines edge toward thesis (“empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the afterimage is honest and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent close third with controlled lyricism; diction fits Elias’s sensibility (craft + metaphysical curiosity). Rhythm modulates well—from meditative setup to compressed overwhelm—without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional abstraction appears but remains in character and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is clean and propulsive with varied sentence shapes and minimal scaffolding. Imagery (halo as “mathematics of emotion,” “lucid turbulence”) is vivid without becoming muddled. A few near‑redundant statements and elevated abstractions skim the edge of purple but don’t clog momentum. The final line crisply reprises image and theme.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress craft, halo fragment, and transposed empathy—feels fresh and coherent, not a collage of quirks. The central ordeal (becoming a vessel, nearly losing self) yields a specific reframing rather than a generic epiphany. Risks are taken in tone and premise, largely paying off. It stops short of truly startling innovation, but it’s distinct and memorable.</comment>
