<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel”) is clear and consistent, and her tactile choices with the mosaic align with it. The internal contradiction—gentle radicalism with a “warm and cold” heart—registers but is explored more as assertion than dramatized struggle. Micro‑choices (brushing ash, selecting a gleaming tessera, rearranging pieces) are present but face little on‑page pushback. The endurance/change at the end feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story coheres: present action (reworking the mosaic) gathers reflective charge (memories of mercies during the fire) and culminates in a reweighted final image. Orientation is crisp from the opening (plaza, minaret silhouette, ash). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—mercy reframed from aberration to foundation—though the cost is implied rather than pressed. The because/therefore chain is soft, but pattern density and cadence shift do the work.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plaza, skeletal minaret, ash tang, and shattered sky create vivid, selective atmosphere filtered through Elara’s purpose. The mosaic operates as object‑as‑setting, literally guiding her choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are integrated, with tactile specificity in the tesserae handling. Environmental constraint is moderate but meaningful via the mosaic’s materiality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (redefining mercy) is mostly internal and thematic; on‑page pressure rises gently through the act of rebuilding the mosaic. The tightening is present—choosing to act on a small, overlooked tessera as an ethos—but the cost and foreclosed alternatives remain abstract. No antagonist or concrete barrier counters her action, muting escalation. The final “beacon of hope” reweights, but without a tested trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme is coherent and organically tied to image (mosaic as renaming reality), and the closing image resonates with her ethic. However, the piece leans on explicit statement (“aberrant mercy”) and a moralizing turn (“would one day be the norm”), flattening subtext. The most powerful thematic moment is the retrocognitive montage of small mercies, which shows rather than tells. The final cadence lands, but it edges didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled in free indirect close third, with consistent diction and sensory bias. No head‑hopping; psychic distance stays tight, modulating slightly for the retrocognitive passages. Some abstraction and phrase recurrence blur edges but do not break clarity. Rhythm supports the accumulative design without syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with strong image work (“skeletal silhouette,” “acrid tang”) and purposeful verbs in tactile moments. There is some conceptual redundancy around “aberrant mercy” and “renaming,” creating mild loopiness. Figurative language remains coherent and avoids mixed metaphors. Momentum holds for a lyric piece, though a few lines tell what images already imply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of “renaming” as literal mosaic work and moral redefinition feels fresh, as does the “gentle radical” stance. The retrocognitive angle adds texture without gimmickry. While the arc is familiar (hope rebuilt from ruin), specific choices—the gleaming tessera, the methodical reassembly as ethics—give it identity. Risk is moderate; deeper on‑page resistance would elevate originality through consequence.</comment>
