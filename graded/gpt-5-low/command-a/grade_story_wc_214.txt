<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira reads as a distinct, grounded presence with clear curiosity and quiet pride; her choices (lifting the glass, following coordinates, renouncing the lantern at the end) align with that core. Interiority is specific in places (“flourishing stillness” as a paradox she earns via the star‑map), though contradictions under pressure are light. Emotional embodiment leans lyrical rather than tense, so the felt cost of her shift is gentle. Still, the endurance/renunciation at the end is credibly earned by prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the lantern’s glow → constellation map → empathic comprehension → quiet renunciation. Orientation is clean early (who/where/role). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she returns to duty changed, placing the dimmed lantern aside with a cost of letting its guidance go. The causal chain is soft but coherent; pressure is internal and steady rather than sharply turned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The station is vividly etched (“skeletal frame,” “hummed with ancient machinery”) and used functionally (auto‑activated trackers, observation deck). The yellow lantern glass functions as a charged micro‑setting/recurring object, shaping perception and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lira’s bias. While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain options, it meaningfully frames them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain internal and modest: meaning and stance toward work. The primary tightening is the constellation revelation and the lantern heating, culminating in her renunciation when it dims. The cost is subtle (surrendering the talisman’s power and choosing ongoing quiet labor), which keeps tension low. The escalation is coherent but not particularly pressured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of sacrifice, renewal, and “flourishing stillness” arise from image patterns (falling stars, cleaning as devotion) and culminate in the lantern’s dimming. However, the text states its thesis overtly (“The concept of flourishing stillness crystallized…”) which blunts subtext. The final image reweights earlier material effectively. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere rather than piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third‑person close maintains a consistent, lyrical idiom that suits the material. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with modulation at key beats (the glow intensifying, the quiet ending). No head‑hopping or stance slips. The voice feels character‑inflected, not generic cosmic prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with strong nouns and controlled metaphor; images recur purposefully. Occasional abstraction and theme‑naming edge toward purple, but clarity holds and momentum isn’t stalled. Sentence and paragraph rhythm vary naturally. The closing cadence lands without scaffolding clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>“Cosmic janitor” plus a lantern‑key that maps empathy to astronomy is a fresh synthesis. The quiet, devotional ending avoids gimmickry and feels integrated. Some elements (mystic constellation as map, talisman passing strength) are familiar, but the occupational lens and textural build lend originality. Risks are tasteful rather than audacious.</comment>
