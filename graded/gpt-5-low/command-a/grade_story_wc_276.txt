<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (catch the goddess’s echo) and a calm, tactile POV anchor Kael, but the interior contradiction is thin and the success comes with little visible struggle. Micro-choices (closing eyes, mirroring the zigzag, “listening”) are present yet low-cost. The late reveal of the spike as “key” reads earned but pain-free. The cost—accepting only the echo while the goddess departs—lands, but lightly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds (silence/sound, zigzag, rail spike) to a resonant reconfiguration where the garden is retuned and the echo is tethered. Orientation is clean and single-scene coherence is strong. The decisive shift arrives when the goddess appears and charges the spike’s function; cost is implied (presence traded for echo) but not deeply pressed. Escalation is graceful, not gripping.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid and functional, with selective sensory detail (silence with a voice, vibrating air) shaping how Kael acts. The rail spike as micro-setting/object charges the final image and constrains the outcome as a tether. World rules maintain internal consistency learned by observation rather than exposition. Descriptions serve mood and action rather than postcarding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early, and the pressure coheres around pattern disruption and retrieval of the echo. The true tightening is the goddess’s sudden appearance and the spike’s revealed use; Kael’s agency is present but soft, with limited trade-offs dramatized. The cost (accepting echo over presence) is felt but underplayed. Tension operates more as cadence than consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—wildness versus stillness, the music of silence—emerges through concrete images and the final acceptance of an echo rather than the body. The “Then listen” beat reframes the premise effectively, though a few lines veer toward statement over scene. The last image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Resonance is strong but not piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical close-third voice matches the meditative stakes and stays within Kael’s sensory logic. Diction is controlled and consistent; brief dialogue carries subtext and does work. Rhythm modulates well, though a few repeated terms (“transliterated,” “silence”) brush cliché/echo effects. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean with good momentum and purposeful image selection; syntax varies and avoids scaffolding. Occasional abstract phrasing and reiterated motifs risk mild purple (e.g., repeating “transliterated” and “silence” labels). Clarity remains intact at the peak, with no confusing metaphors. Density is solid, if not cutting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “sound wave garden,” sleepwalking constellations, and rail-spike tether feel fresh and internally coherent. The mythic register is personalized through tactile choices and a specific object reweighted at the end. Risk-taking in concept and tone pays off without obscuring closure. Only the soft escalation keeps it shy of the highest tier.</comment>
