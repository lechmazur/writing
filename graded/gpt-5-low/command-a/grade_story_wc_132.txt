<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara’s control-versus-surrender conflict is clear, embodied, and escalates under the storm’s pressure. Interiority is specific (moss, wet earth, the tactile leaf) and choices align with motive as she rearranges space and accepts uncertainty. The final renunciation feels earned with a felt cost (giving up her safety in control). Occasional abstract self‑explanations (“The leaf was a mirror,” “It was about transformation”) blunt the otherwise character‑particular texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm’s cadence and repeated engagements with the leaf intensify toward a Charged Poise ending. Closure is on‑page as she surrenders control and reconfigures her space/self, with cost legible in fear and forfeiture of old tactics. Orientation is solid and the single scene coheres. A touch of symbolic neatness (leaf dissolving) feels convenient but doesn’t break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The nursery in storm season is vivid and filtered through a plant‑minded POV; sensory detail is purposeful (mossy trellis, greenhouse roof drum, damp scent). Environment subtly guides choice—the storm and trellis gate her turn and the rearranged pots concretize the inner shift. It charges the final image though it rarely constrains action in a hard, tactical way. Strong atmosphere without excess cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she relinquish control—tightens through the storm’s intensification and the leaf’s charged handling. The meaningful turn occurs when she presses the leaf to her chest and begins to “reconstruct” by creating space; a path is foreclosed. Cost is emotional and procedural, not external, but it is felt and alters her tactics. Slight softness in external stakes keeps it from higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of surrender and metamorphosis emerge organically via weather, objects, and action, culminating in a resonant acceptance. However, the text sometimes states its thesis (“It was about transformation,” “The leaf was a mirror”), reducing subtext. The final image lands, but a shade of moralizing language dilutes its afterglow. Still, the recurrence of space‑making provides authentic resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical close third is consistent, with a controlled cadence that matches storm tempo and internal pressure. Diction fits a contemplative, plant‑attuned mind without head‑hopping. Minor abstract phrasings intrude at peaks but do not derail the voice. The whisper of “To study plant behaviors” is a good tonal modulator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑driven, and mostly efficient; sensory lines often carry double duty. There is some paraphrase/reiteration around control/transformation and a few generic abstractions that could be cut. Figurative language stays coherent, though the “leaf as mirror” tells what the scene can show. Momentum holds despite a few redundant statements.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The gardener‑in‑a‑storm metamorphosis frame is familiar, but the mossy trellis and hands‑on reconfiguration give it specificity. The leaf’s quasi‑numinous role is not novel yet is earnestly handled. The piece takes a modest risk in committing to a quiet, purely internal climax and largely earns it. Freshness is solid but not striking.</comment>
