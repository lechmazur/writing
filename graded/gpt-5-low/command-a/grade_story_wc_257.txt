<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s grief-driven motive is clear and specific, with credible micro-choices (tracing the stencil, approaching the curtains, pressing the stencil to skin). The internal contradiction—hesitating to ink yet yearning for connection—feels earned. Embodiment is present (scent of blooms, warmth) without therapy-speak. The final recommitment shows cost as acceptance of pain, though the struggle on the peak beat is relatively smooth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterning of stillness → shimmer → illumination → tattoo → renewed purpose. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (she accepts the tattoo) and a felt emotional price. The causality depends on magical selection by the curtains but is coherent within the world’s taught rules. Stakes are contained and resolved without mechanical over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory is vivid and purposeful—glass panes, the disused telescope, and especially the “curtains of intention” actively trigger the turn. Sensory detail (ethereal glow, scent of flowers) is selective and charged to Elara’s priorities. World rules are learned through observation/action rather than exposition dumps. The setting constrains and charges the final image, not mere backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (moving from paralysis to purpose) is clear, and pressure coheres around the illumination forcing a choice. The escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than a series, fitting the length. The price—embracing a permanent mark and the burden of purpose—is implied but not contested at length, keeping the turn slightly soft. Still, agency drives the resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motifs (withering plants, origami coordinates, spiraling vine) converge to articulate resilience and finding life in decay. The final whispered line edges into thematic declaration, reducing subtextive power. Nonetheless, the tattoo’s reweighted meaning and the seed pendant offer a resonant image-based answer. Emotional honesty is steady, if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt; the voice’s lyric register matches the contemplative pressure. Diction is controlled, with patterning that intensifies at the illumination beat without head-hopping. The perceptual signature—maker’s hands, observatory attentiveness, plant-death lexicon—feels character-bound. Modulation at the end toward steadier cadence fits the earned stasis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean and rhythmic with good sentence variety; images carry multiple jobs (world, mood, theme). Occasional purple touches (“air hummed with the weight of centuries”) flirt with excess but don’t blur sense. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter the turns; information density is strong. The final image is precise and unfussy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—mourning jeweler, timeless observatory, intention-charged curtains, botany-as-decay—is fresh and coherent. The activating of a vellum stencil into living tattoo feels distinct without gimmickry. The risk lies in a quiet, one-turn structure; it lands, though the cost remains gentle. Memorable details (origami with coordinates) add texture even if they don’t drive the climax.</comment>
