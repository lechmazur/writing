<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (giving rest a permanent address) is clear and consistent with his undertaker identity, and his “inadvertent stubbornness” plausibly fuels the search. Interiority is present through tactile noticing and fatigue, though internal contradiction is light. His emotional shift at the end is earned, if somewhat tidy. Missing is a moment of genuine hesitation or cost that complicates his drive.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/why), and the causal chain—package → lens/history → fragment hunt → reassembly → signal—reads clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s voice is finally heard and Elias’s role reframes from burial to bearing witness. However, middle beats compress the search into summary, dulling pressure and cost. The end image is clear and on-page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drowned library is textured and specific (seaweed-choked aisles, warped shelves, reinforced windows), and it meaningfully frames the fragment hunt sites (algae waterfall, coral statue, collapsed beam). Details feel filtered through Elias’s vocation and fatigue. The environment charges the final image when the light spreads through the city. Constraint is more implied than dramatized, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (restore the lens, let the city be heard), and there’s a single tightening as the missing fragments are discovered and assembled. Still, obstacles are summarized rather than confronted, and there’s no visible price beyond effort; no credible loss or trade-off forces adaptation. The resolution depends mainly on persistence, not on a pressured choice with cost. Tension stays steady rather than escalating sharply.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of memorialization, witness, and light within darkness cohere and recur through object and setting. The final reweighting—rest achieved by letting voices be heard—resonates. A few lines verge on stating the thesis (“He had given rest to the restless…”) rather than letting image alone carry it. The piece remains emotionally honest but errs slightly toward neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and appropriately close to Elias; diction matches the mood and avoids head-hopping. Rhythm and imagery are controlled with occasional familiar turns. The tone modulates effectively toward lift at the end without sacrificing coherence. Minor conventional phrasing keeps it out of the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and efficient, with strong sensory economy and some vivid lines; summary is used strategically. There are a few conventional phrases and mild purple notes, but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Minimal repetition and solid sentence variety sustain flow. The compressed middle action reads a bit told, limiting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>An undertaker restoring a city’s soul via a lighthouse lens in a drowned library is a fresh synthesis, and the final signal is a strong image. The combination of maritime relic, memorial duty, and “impossible space” feels specific rather than templated. Risk is moderate—execution is elegant but not daringly strange or structurally bold. Still, the premise and object-work feel memorable.</comment>
