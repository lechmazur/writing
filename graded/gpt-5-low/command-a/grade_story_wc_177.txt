<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority leans abstract and declarative, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied emotion shows up (“heart raced”) yet the piece relies on summarizing states (“had learned to see beyond the surface”). The final realization lands as an idea more than a hard-earned, costly choice. Micro‑choices exist (entering, deciphering), but they feel friction‑light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the storm’s approach, wafer pulses, and symbol‑dance build toward a conceptual repricing. Closure arrives with the resonance insight and the wafer dissolving, but the on‑page cost is minimal. Orientation is clean from the outset, single scene maintained. The beat sequence is coherent, though largely inward and pre‑decided.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bunker, vines, and storm create a textured, lived atmosphere and recur through the final image. The wafer as object‑setting hybrid charges the ending. However, the environment seldom constrains action or tactics beyond supplying mood and light urgency. Strong sensory integration, if slightly weighted toward visual and abstract register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (decode to answer the path/walker question), and escalation is a density increase rather than a tightening trade‑off. The storm and the wafer’s intensifying light function as pressure, but they don’t force a costly choice. Resolution arrives via realization, with little legible price or foreclosed option on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme coalesces around resonance vs. fate and connection across systems, with recurring images supporting it. The ending answers the thematic question, but it’s stated directly rather than earned purely through implication. Subtext exists in the bunker/mind mirror, though the piece occasionally lapses into thesis‑like language. The aftereffect is gentle rather than cutting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident in a close third with stable pronouns and stance. Diction is elevated but coherent for the piece’s mode. Some abstraction blunts immediacy, and rhythm clusters toward ornate phrasing under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lines are polished, but purple tendencies and abstract phrasing reduce momentum at peaks. Occasional paraphrase of ideas (“decipher… learned to see beyond the surface”) and intensifier stacking appear. Still, clarity holds and syntax varies acceptably. The final image is legible, if more conceptual than tactile.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “decaying directive” and wafer seal in a rewilded bunker feel fresh and integrated. The central turn (resonance as the answer) isn’t wholly surprising, but it coheres with prior particulars. The piece risks a high‑lyric register and mostly sustains it. Emotional stakes could be sharper to elevate ingenuity beyond concept.</comment>
