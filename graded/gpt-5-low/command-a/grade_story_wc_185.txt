<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but interior conflict is minimal; Lira proceeds competently with little friction or contradictory impulse. Embodied moments (clutching the stone, weariness at the end) hint at cost but never force a fraught trade. Her method reveals character, yet decisions rarely test values against fear or doubt. The guardianship at the end reads earned but emotionally light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and clean; the scene progresses coherently from search to activation. Closure lands on the page (the bloom unfurls; the storm dissipates), though the cost is modest (fatigue more than sacrifice). The drive reads Hybrid leaning Accumulative: density of hum/light motifs crests into a cadence shift at activation. Causal beats connect (ice cracks → path → song), but pressure stays smooth, not tightening into a hard corner.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harmonic caves and ice‑veins are vivid and functional: acoustics, crystalline walls, and ancient ice shape method and mood. The echo chamber stone operates as a tool within place‑logic, and the pedestal chamber clarifies spatial stakes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, privileging hum, light, and cold. The setting actively guides choices rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore harmony) is clear, with one meaningful deepening at the pedestal. Escalation is gentle; the “storm” pressure intensifies atmospherically but produces no hard obstacle or reversal. Agency drives turns (reading cracks, conjuring path, then song), yet the price is light and options rarely foreclosed. The final act resolves decisively without a painful trade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of silence as strength, balance against cacophony, and listening to place emerge through action and image rather than thesis. The bloom’s unfurling reweights prior motifs (hum → hush) with a resonant image. Slight neatness and comforting moral clarity mute complexity; little counter‑pressure or ambiguity remains. Still, the ending invites reflection on costless quiet versus imposed silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person close with controlled rhythm and motif recurrence (hum, light, hush). No head‑hopping; psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak beats. Diction suits the fable‑like texture without register slips. Repetition edges toward sameness in places but stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean syntax, good momentum, and multi‑tasking lines (world, mood, and action at once). Some lexical recycling (“gently luminous,” “hum,” “song”) risks mild monotony but forms a pattern rather than padding. No major figurative muddle or scaffold; prose breathes at turns and tightens at activation. The final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Bloom of hush,” “ripple‑mark mapkeeper,” and ice‑crack cartography feel fresh within a quest frame. The conjured silence as world‑scale solution is conceptually elegant, if narratively safe. The synthesis of sound/stone/ice is distinctive enough to linger. Greater risk or a thornier cost would elevate.</comment>
