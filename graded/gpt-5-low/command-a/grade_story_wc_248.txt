<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear motive and steady agency, but limited internal contradiction or real struggle; the arsonist rarely faces a pressured micro‑choice. “Volcanic tenderness” reads more as a label than an embodied conflict. Competence carries them through a frictionless puzzle‑path. The emotional turn at the scroll lands but at low cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: tapestry → mural → sketches → door → scroll. Orientation is stable and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the promise is reframed as living testament. Cost is light and largely conceptual; no real obstruction tests the drive. Still, the because/therefore sequencing holds through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archive is legible—a maze of chambers, dusted murals, stone floors—but the environment rarely constrains choice or alters tactics. Details are mostly visual; tactile actions (wiping dust) help but feel generic. Recurring objects (tapestry, pedestal) add atmosphere more than pressure. Stronger specificity or constraint would elevate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is stated early, but pressure barely tightens; every clue yields without resistance. The sole meaningful deepening is the near‑invisible door, which opens easily. The final act is a straightforward retrieval and translation with minimal price. Escalation feels smooth rather than testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, love, and preservation accrue, but the final paragraph leans into explanation, dulling subtext. The story tells us the promise’s meaning rather than letting image alone reweight it. The tapestry/portrait/mural motif hints at endurance across media—strong but under‑pressured. Resonance is real, not profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is controlled and consistent; no leakage or unjustified certainty. Diction is smooth but conventional, with repeated abstract tags (“analytically intuitive,” “volcanic tenderness”) that float above concrete sensation. Rhythm is even, seldom modulating under pressure. The voice is competent rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Readable, clean sentences; occasional paraphrase loops and intensifier stacking (“vivid,” “labyrinth,” “secrets”) reduce density. Figurative language is safe and sometimes generic; little sonic or syntactic risk. Momentum is steady but low‑thrum, with minor redundancy around motive and process. The final image is clear but explained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The “lending library arsonist” in a lost‑civilization archive with an art‑trail is a fresh composite, though executed as a familiar clue‑crawl. The twist from arsonist to rescuer hints at moral complexity that the scene underuses. The art‑as‑breadcrumb conceit is elegant but low‑risk on the page. Solid ingenuity without a transformative beat.</comment>
