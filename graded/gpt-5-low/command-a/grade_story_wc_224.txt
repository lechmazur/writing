<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (to understand the shape of home) and tangible micro‑choices (taking the stone, using the feather memory) anchor Elara. The push‑pull between the pain of remembering and the need to recover self registers but remains largely abstract. The epiphany lands a bit too smoothly, with limited visible cost beyond affective strain. Still, interiority is consistent and embodied through the object work enough to feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → activation → spatial reconfiguration → realization, culminating in a reweighted understanding (CR). Orientation is solid early; causality flows from action to internal shift. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional and could be sharper on the page, but the ending image (circle, floating stone, language as map) provides credible closure. Tight single scene, clean throughline.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mountain‑wide labyrinthine bookstore and stained‑glass light are vivid and purposive; the environment responds to her actions and charges the final image (shelves forming a circle, clearing). The lost language stone functions as micro‑setting/object shaping tactic and outcome. Detail is sensory without tour‑guide clutter. The setting meaningfully constrains and reflects the journey rather than serving as wallpaper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (recover language/self/home), and pressure coheres as the stone demands action, the air charges, and the store reconfigures. Escalation is primarily intensification (hidden thunder → roar) rather than narrowing options or a hard trade‑off. The choice to seed via feather texture is the key tightening, but consequences feel largely positive and low‑cost. A single felt loss or foreclosed path would have deepened stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Recurring images (feather, thunder, labyrinth, stone) braid into the theme of home as internal harmony. However, the story states its thesis explicitly (“Home was not a place but a state”), which blunts subtext. The emotional aftertaste is sincere but a touch tidy, minimizing ambiguity or price. Still, the final image reweights earlier material with some resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lucid, lyrical register that fits the sensibility of a “mercury‑glass seer.” Rhythm varies, and the diction suits the numinous mood without head‑hopping. Occasional abstractions (“harmony,” “catalyst”) dilute the otherwise tactile moments. Overall, voice is steady and controlled under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑driven, with strong noun/verb choices in key beats (“shelves forming a circle,” “seed her thoughts”). Some purple drift and conceptual repetition (“pain of remembering,” “buried talents”) sap momentum slightly. Line economy is decent but a hair self‑explanatory at the end. No major syntactic artifacts or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore + lost language stone + feather‑texture conduit offers a fresh synthesis. The arc (pain → reconnection → internalized home) is familiar, but the object mechanics and environmental response feel particular. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they mostly pay off. Greater asymmetry or cost would have elevated ingenuity.</comment>
