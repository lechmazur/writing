<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence and observational bent are clearly dramatized, and his micro‑choices (feeling the glass, reading the stones, opening the compartment) align with his nature. The interior “luminescent ache” gives him texture without melodrama. However, his final conviction arrives a touch tidy, with limited on‑page ambivalence or visible cost. The shift reads earned but soft, more resolution than reckoning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: lamp failure → sea‑glass message → stone code → hidden letters → reframed duty. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (acceptance of guardianship) rather than a decisive act, but it’s legible. The cost is mainly conceptual (burden of duty) and underplayed. Orientation and scene unity are strong throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lighthouse and lantern room feel lived‑in; darkness changes tactics, forcing tactile search and pattern recognition. Objects (sea glass, stones) function as micro‑settings that guide action and charge the ending. Marine atmosphere supports tone without tourist cataloging. The final image of warmed sea glass elegantly fuses place and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres from a technical hiccup to an existential mandate, with one clear tightening via the hidden compartment reveal. Stakes remain focused on safeguarding the beacon, but conflict is largely internal and never tests him against a concrete external limit. The price of choosing guardianship is felt but not stressed. The escalation is steady rather than bracing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of guardianship and safety accrue through images and culminate in a quiet repricing of duty. The explicit sentence “To bottle the feeling of safety…” edges toward thematic on‑the‑nose. Still, the motifs (light, glass, stones) bear the weight more than exposition. The ending resonates but avoids deeper ambiguity or counter‑pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled close third with a calm, briny texture that suits Elias’s mind. Syntax varies enough to sustain momentum and hush. No head‑hopping or register drift; the diction feels plausibly his. Lyric notes are measured and do not obscure causality.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with selective sensory work and minimal scaffolding. A few lines edge toward redundancy (“the stones, the glass, the letters—they were all part of a chain”) but not to drag. Figurative choices cohere; rhythm supports the hush and then dawn’s lift. Line‑level work is professional if not audacious.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse mystery tropes are refreshed by tactile codes (stone stacks) and the sea‑glass motif. The hidden‑compartment turn is familiar yet well staged. Emotional truth lands, though the arc’s resolution is safe rather than risky. Ingenuity shows in object choreography more than in conceptual daring.</comment>
