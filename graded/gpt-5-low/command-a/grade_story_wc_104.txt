<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and sustained (retrieve seeds before the wall seals them), and actions align with that aim under pressure. Interiority is serviceable but leans generic (“eyes burned with a purpose,” “grace staggering”) with limited contradictory impulse on the page. Competence slightly outweighs visible struggle; the chains hinder but rarely force a hard trade‑off. The final shedding of chains reads earned but lightly priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The throughline (decode arrow via piano → locate hatch → descend → grab seeds → escape as wall collapses) is clear and motivated, with enemies’ approach tightening the sequence. Closure lands: the liberator exits with seeds as the wall falls, a decisive change with implied cost. Costs are present but modest; nothing crucial is lost, though the time‑lock and chains shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival is vivid and functional: the piano bench, redemption booth, and labyrinthine layout all constrain or enable choices. Objects (arrow, chains) operate as micro‑setting that charge the final image. Sensory selection fits urgency without bloating. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via two pressures: approaching men and the imminent wall collapse. The meaningful tightening occurs at the descent/ascent window when the wall groans and pursuers close in, narrowing options. On‑page price is mainly risk and encumbrance rather than a concrete loss, keeping the upper band in check. Agency drives the result.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resilience versus control emerges through seeds, chains, and the carnival’s decay; burying the arrow with the seeds is a strong image that reweights journey into stewardship. Occasional explicitness (“gesture of defiance against a dying world”) edges toward telling. Subtext around captivity transforming into chosen burden is present but could cut deeper in the peak beat. Thematic coherence holds without glib moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and apt; the elevated diction mostly suits the mythic frame. Some phrasing registers as stock or recycled (“eyes burned with a purpose,” “staggering grace”), softening the distinctiveness of the perceptual signature. Rhythm remains controlled under pressure, with clean sequencing. No head‑hopping or unjustified elision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive, integrating detail with forward motion. There’s mild purple creep and cliché (“like an old man’s bones,” repeated “grace staggering”), plus some adjective burdening, but not enough to blur causality. Information density is decent; scaffolding is minimal. The final image reads cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The arrow/piano cipher within an abandoned carnival concealing a seed vault feels fresh and specific. The liberator archetype is familiar, but the object‑driven puzzle and agrarian stakes elevate it. Risks are taken in image fusion and world choice without gimmickry. A deeper, less declarative cost at the end could have pushed it higher.</comment>
