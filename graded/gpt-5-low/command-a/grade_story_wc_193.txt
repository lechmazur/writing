<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s choices drive the piece (replying to the texts, stepping through the portal, activating the machine), but her interior conflict is light and largely labeled rather than dramatized. “Virtuously mischievous” surfaces in action once, with minimal cost. The pyramid-scheme backstory flavors motive but seldom pressures on-page decisions. The closing stance shift toward responsibility/hope is credible, if a touch easy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: texts → bolt on mushrooms → portal → machine → diamonds → return with reweighted purpose. Orientation is solid from the farm onward; the single transition to the concept-world is legible. Closure lands (RR/DC hybrid: role adoption as “guardian”), though the cost is soft. Setups (bolt, texts) pay off, and there are no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mushroom farm and the concept-world are vivid and purposeful, with the farm’s glow enabling the portal and the bolt functioning as a tool-object. Sensory texture is balanced and POV-filtered; equations-in-the-sky is memorable. The setting rarely constrains choices beyond the portal enabling, so the charge at the end leans tonal more than tactical. Consistency of world rules holds within this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes escalate from curiosity to executing a reality‑bending machine, but opposition is minimal and success comes without friction or trade‑off. The key tightening is the decision to step through and then engage the machine, yet no choice forecloses a valued path. The “pressure into diamonds” remains literalized more than contested. Ending responsibility implies cost but doesn’t land as price on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of alchemizing past pressure into value is coherent and refracted through objects (bolt, mushrooms) and the future‑self loop. The final charge—guardianship of a “quantum promise”—reweights her past shame toward purpose. Subtext is present but gentle; a few lines edge toward conceptual tag (“quantum promise”) rather than earned image. Still, the survivor-to-steward reframing resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, image‑forward diction; “glitchy texts” and “shifting probabilities” suit the register. Rhythm is varied and legible; elision patterns are clear. Dialogue is minimal but functional. The voice could push deeper into Elara’s idiolect under stress to heighten distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lines are generally tight and purposeful, with few scaffolds or loops. Occasional elevated abstractions (“shadowseam wonder,” “quantum promise”) flirt with conceptual gloss but don’t obscure action. Imagery holds together and avoids mixed metaphors. Momentum is steady across beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—bioluminescent farm, submarine bolt, probability being, future‑self texts—is fresh and coherent. The portal mechanics and “pressure into diamonds” literalization feel inventive, if solved too cleanly. The future‑self reveal is seeded and satisfying without overexplaining. Greater risk in cost or moral calculus could elevate it further.</comment>
