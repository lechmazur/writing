<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and particular—seeking where unused love is stored—and her humility around “crystal gazer” adds specificity. Interiority is embodied (trembling hands, tactile contact with the railing and film) and her decision to take the strip shows agency. However, simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure are lightly sketched rather than dramatized. The cost of the final choice is implied more than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp (vintage movie palace, projection booth, single night), and the pattern of images (still frames/letters) builds to a conceptual turn. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she reconfigures her stance by taking the film with a plan to release its love, with a subtle emotional price. The cost could be sharpened on the page (e.g., a foreclosed alternative), but the cadence shift is clear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theater and booth are vividly evoked (moonlight through a cracked window, dusty reels, hum of the projector), and details track through action rather than static listing. The film strip operates as a charged object anchoring space and mood, and the environment mirrors her interior search without overstatement. While the setting doesn’t overtly constrain tactics, it meaningfully charges the final image. Sensory balance is strong, especially sound and touch.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locating unused love) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as the film reveals goodbye letters merging. The escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than a hard reversal, suited to the chosen lens. The decision to take the strip is an earned tightening, but the felt price remains understated. A clearer foreclosed path or consequence would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the materiality of the letters and Elara’s vocation; the repository of unused love reframes the film and her quest. The final choice refracts the thematic question toward action without a sermonizing moral. A few articulations (“it was a repository”) risk slight on‑the‑nose commentary, but overall the images carry the weight. The ending lingers with charged ambiguity about reclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical without overreach, and aligned with Elara’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well between hush and revelation, and the diction remains coherent with the POV. No head‑hopping or stance drift appears. Minor moments verge on explanatory, but the perceptual signature remains distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with varied sentence rhythms and purposeful imagery (“hushed thunder,” letters overlapping like lyrics). Information density is strong; most lines do multiple jobs (setting, tone, character). There’s slight redundancy in reasserting purpose and repository, but it doesn’t stall momentum. Figurative control is consistent and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of psychometry with film‑as‑letters storing unused love in a decaying movie palace feels fresh and coherent. The merging letters image is an inventive turn that reweights the premise. While the internal conflict could cut deeper to reach rarer air, the conceptual synthesis reads distinctive. Risks are taken in a quiet mode without gimmickry.</comment>
