<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and coherent—Eli’s refusal to automate grounds his goal—but interior contradiction is light, with little friction beyond generic self‑doubt. His key micro‑choice (using the harness to attempt mist walking) aligns with his values but demands minimal personal cost. Emotional texture leans on summary rather than embodied specificity. The closing realization reads earned enough, but the inner conflict never bites.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: quest → trap → tool‑enabled attempt → touch → revaluation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the keystone’s “power” reframed) rather than a decisive external change, and it reads on the page. The cost at closure is modest, thinning the impact. Orientation is solid, the single scene holds, and the drive lens remains consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire and the “lingering luminance” create a coherent, tactile atmosphere that influences tactics (mist, closing walls, anchor point). The harness and outcropping interplay with the physical space credibly. Sensory detail is selective and on‑task, though phrasing occasionally repeats. Environment charges the final image as the luminance brightens on exit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (claim/understand the keystone) is legible, and pressure tightens with the closing walls. The main reversal—using the harness to mist walk—arrives promptly but with little attrition or trade‑off; the solution works on first try. Consequence is primarily conceptual, not lived, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. The escalation is coherent but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Themes of human effort vs automation and “sacred in the simple” are embedded, but the ending over‑articulates them (“power of the human spirit”), tipping into moralizing. Subtext gives way to statement just when resonance should peak. The keystone repricing is a promising vector that would land stronger if shown through concrete consequence. As is, the insight feels told rather than distilled through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited is stable and controlled; the perceptual bias is consistent. Diction sometimes turns abstract (“accommodate impossibilities,” “brilliance dimness”), diluting immediacy. Rhythm holds under pressure without head‑hopping. Voice is competent but not distinctively idiosyncratic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clean mechanics and clear sequencing maintain momentum, but there’s repetition and occasional purple phrasing (“lingering luminance” recurs; “brilliance dimness” jars). Several sentences summarize emotional truths rather than dramatize them, flattening the peak. Figurative economy could tighten; information density is adequate but not sharp. The final paragraph lapses into abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of automated magic with manual spellcasting in a frost‑spire quest feels fresh‑enough, and mist walking via harness is a nice tactile twist. The arc, however, traces a familiar parable about effort triumphing over systems. The conceptual repricing is smart but safe. More surprising costs or an irreversible choice would elevate ingenuity.</comment>
