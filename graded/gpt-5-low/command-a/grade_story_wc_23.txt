<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation and competence are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (to trust the calls, to scavenge and build) align with those traits. Interiority is present but largely summarized; we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. Embodied cues (raw hands, moon-timed work) help but the emotional field stays tidy. The shift from isolation to communal anchor is believable, if achieved with minimal on-page friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: cryptic calls → building → beacon → arrivals → renewed commitment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an ongoing cost (the censer’s waning glow and cyclical labor). Structure stays coherent and anchored in one locus with legible escalation. The price is felt but modest on the page, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The starlit station on a windswept cliff is vivid, and the failed hydraulics and scavenging tie setting to action. The censer foot functions as a charged object that modulates atmosphere and tactics via moon phases. Environmental pressure is present but gentle; weather and cliff peril are more tonal than constraining. Specificity feels purposeful without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (calling back the lost), and the tightening occurs when the device synchronizes and people arrive. Opposition is largely situational; there’s little on-page resistance or trade-off beyond labor and cyclic dimming. The escalation is steady rather than knife-edged. The earned commitment at the end reads as stance crystallization more than a hard-forced choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “geography of loss” and “reverse migration” echo through the beacon/community frame, and the moon’s cycles nuance a theme of endurance over restoration. Some thematic statements are told outright (“Her motivation was clear”), reducing subtextive charge. The final image reweights earlier motifs toward purpose-with-cost. Complexity is present but not deeply contested on the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is steady, lyrical yet controlled, with diction consistent to the world and character. Dialogue is sparse but functional, advancing plot without strain. Rhythm varies enough to maintain momentum. The voice rarely risks surprise cadences at peak beats, but it stays sure‑handed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, mostly concise, and carries multiple jobs per line; images like the patina and moon-sync are effective. Minor exposition and repeated phrasings (“raw solace,” several declaratives of motivation) slightly flatten urgency. No figurative muddle or syntactic monotony that harms clarity. Momentum holds through the final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—signal station, reverse migration, lunar‑keyed relic, cryptic calls—feels fresh and coherent. The beacon-as-community engine is convincing and not a genre cliché as used here. Risk is moderate; it skirts sentimentality but largely avoids it. A sharper, costlier turn could have elevated ingenuity into the top band.</comment>
