<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradictory impulses—duty versus the letter’s allure—are embodied (trembling fingers, breath in the cold) and drive concrete micro‑choices (breaking the seal, descending, initiating the transfer). Her motivation remains clear and consistent, escalating under time pressure. A few on‑the‑nose statements (“Her motivation was clear...”) flatten nuance slightly. The final charged poise shows a credible cost without false neatness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: letter → descent → terminal access → copy under a live clock → exit with cost. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she’s crossed a line and must bear consequences, reweighting the premise on the final snowy image. The cost is felt but largely prospective; no external disruption tests her mid‑task, modestly reducing impact. Orientation is solid early and never wavers.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The echoing, snow‑insulated library and cryogenic stacks create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere that shapes mood and plausibly constrains access to the network. Details are filtered through her professional lens (frosted glass, ancient interface), and the environment charges the final image as witness/judge. Physical constraint is more tonal than tactical; still, the setting integrates tightly with the action. No inconsistent world rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: reveal suppressed truths versus uphold duty. Escalation tightens through the seal break, deeper descent, and a ticking alert window that narrows options. The cost is internalized and credible; however, opposition is largely atmospheric, with no on‑page complication beyond the clock. Resolution derives from her agency and forecloses her prior path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of truth versus order and the cost of bravery emerge through specific images (cold, dormancy, archives as silencers) and her final acceptance of consequence. The library as witness subtly reframes institutional complicity. A few explicit thesis statements (“contraband truths,” “to provoke an unspoken conversation”) compress subtext into declarations. The ending resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third‑limited voice is steady and apt, with a cool, controlled cadence that matches the setting. Diction is consistent; the perceptual signature favors cold, silence, and process. Some repeated phrases feel motif‑like but verge on templated (“echoing library under snow,” “dizzying quiet”). No POV leakage or head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive, with sensory economy and strong verbs anchoring action. Minor redundancy and slogan‑like repetitions (“contraband truths,” “dizzying quiet”) skim toward purple in spots but don’t obscure clarity. Rhythm varies well between contemplative and urgent beats. No major artifacts or logic missteps at the line level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cryogenic archive and “contraband truths” frame a familiar truth‑versus‑order dilemma with a crisp, wintry texture. The letter and dormant network lend a fresh angle, and the institutional hush as judge is a nice inflection. Still, the beats follow a recognizable template without a surprising reweighting of premise. Solid craft over radical novelty.</comment>
