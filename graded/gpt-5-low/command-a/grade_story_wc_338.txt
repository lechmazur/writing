<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and temperament (“interpret silence with empathy,” “shielded openness”) are clear and consistent, and her choices (comparing footage, deciding to dig) align. Interiority leans abstract and declarative, with little on-page contradiction or frayed psychology under pressure. The endurance cost is gestured at (“hours turned into days”) but not felt in the body. Strong competence is shown without much genuine struggle or moral trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Under a causal lens: footage → misalignment → excavation → discovery lands cleanly with a quiet RR closure (reframing the henge and chapel). Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene window holds despite time compression. The cost at closure is light, mostly conceptual reverence and elapsed labor rather than a tightened price. Still, the final image reweights prior material in a legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, frescoes, and henge are vivid and purposefully filtered through Elara’s attention. Setting intersects with action (star alignment, shadows, rain-worn surfaces) and charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it remains more than postcard décor. Sensory selection feels apt and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncover the chapel) is clear, and a meaningful tightening occurs when Elara spots the light discrepancy and commits to excavation. However, pressure remains gentle with minimal resistance or visible trade-offs beyond time and effort. The resolution arrives without a live cost or foreclosed path that bites on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Silence/empathy/reopening recur effectively, and the ending’s reverence offers a resonant if quiet answer. Yet thematic statements are sometimes told outright (“She had not just reopened a forgotten place...”), dulling subtext. The piece leans toward affirmation rather than complexity or tension between competing goods. The final image glows but skirts sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and controlled, with a coherent lyrical register that suits the material. Diction is mostly precise, and the narrative stance avoids head‑hopping or artificial reveal. Some abstraction and elevated phrasing creep in, but not enough to cloud causality. Rhythm is varied with clean sentence mechanics.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑forward with good momentum; information density is decent. Occasional redundancies and thematic restatements slow the line slightly, and a few purple tints surface. The excavation is summarized rather than textured with tactile beats, softening immediacy. Still, clarity holds and there are few scaffolds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—map framer + henge misalignment via decades‑apart silent footage—feels fresh and specific. Discovery of a chapel beneath a henge is familiar but reframed with the “interpret silence” ethos. The risks are modest but coherent, and the final reweighting is earned by prior particulars. Not landmark‑original, yet distinct and memorable.</comment>
