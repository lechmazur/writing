<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to locate “where lost conversations went” to restore Verdania and herself) is clear and consistent, filtered through her craft and its truth‑bound constraint. Interiority is specific—her trembling hands, the leaves’ reaction—though internal contradiction is modest (she hesitates when the words turn dishonest, then presses on). Her actions align with motive and culminate in an earned choice to inscribe despite the bitter revelation. The visible cost is chiefly emotional and ethical rather than relational, but it registers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Causal: workshop investigation → undercity discovery → revelation → inscription → water’s trickle creates an on‑page Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing of Verdania’s history. Orientation is crisp and the throughline holds, but access and resolution feel friction‑light (the chamber opens, the wall speaks, the plate “works” quickly). Cost is legible in the bitter truth and her leaves’ wilt under dishonesty, not in material sacrifice. Closure lands, if a touch convenient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, artificial light, and undercity textures are vivid and filtered through Elara’s craft‑bias. Setting informs stakes (oasis dried, reliance on artificial systems) and steers tactics (map to a hidden chamber). The zinc plate and map function as micro‑settings/tools that charge the final image. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early, and pressure coheres as she follows clues and confronts the chamber’s truths. However, escalation is soft: obstacles are minimal, opposition is mostly atmospheric, and the key turn arrives without resistance. The price paid is mainly conceptual; no significant option is foreclosed beyond a worldview shift. The trickle of water reads as a fast payoff, diminishing the felt risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Truth versus survival is woven through her candor‑bound craft and the city’s engineered systems; the “lost conversations” motif earns a reweighting at the end. Some lines tip into telling (“She understood now… was sacrificed”) rather than letting image and action fully carry the thematic turn. Still, the final pairing of plates and water‑echo yields resonant implication about truth as renewal. Ambiguity remains in the social cost ahead, which helps.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is steady, lyrical without opacity, and modulates with pressure in the undercity sequence. Diction fits the character’s sensibility as an artisan attuned to script and material. No head‑hopping or unjustified elision undermines reliability. Rhythm is controlled, if occasionally a hair ornate.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and propulsive; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, motive, action) with minimal scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked in peak beats. Minor abstraction appears in the explanatory revelation but does not stall momentum. Opening and closing images answer each other effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The fusion of truth‑activated calligraphy, archival archaeology, and a greenhouse city under a toxic sky feels fresh. The undercity wall of pulsating script and the leaves’ candor‑test are memorable specifics. The resolution skirts convenience, constraining surprise. Still, the conceptual synthesis shows integrity and a distinct stance.</comment>
