<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—seeking the unused courage—is clear and embodied in small, credible choices (taking the ferry, ascending, accepting the punch). Interiority is vivid if somewhat streamlined; contradictory impulses are present but mild (hesitation vs. resolve). The ferryman exerts apt, enigmatic pressure without overpowering her agency. The final shift reads earned, though the emotional cost is more implied than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: twilight passage → ridgeway traverse → charged reprise with the punch. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the star now on her being) with a quiet felt cost (leaving the former life, vigil ending). Orientation is strong from the start, and the two‑shard flow stays continuous. The cost could read sharper on the page, but the before/after is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are rich and selective: the salt‑heavy dock, scarred boat, veiled ridgeway, and mist shape mood and movement. The ridgeway’s “guiding” function subtly constrains choice, and the ticket punch as object‑microsetting charges the last image. Sensory detail stays purposeful and filtered through Mara’s quest. Not quite at 9+ because the environment rarely forces a decisive tactical trade‑off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and coherent: will she traverse and claim her courage. Pressure tightens through the ascent and the ferryman’s second appearance, culminating in Mara choosing to “use it.” The price is mostly internal and quiet; escalation is more deepening than narrowing. Strong, if not blistering, under this lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Twilight as vigil, traverse over destination, and the star imprint all braid into a resonant answer about courage as a practice rather than a prize. Subtext lives in image and cadence, though one line (“It’s the traverse.”) edges toward thesis. The ending reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect lingers softly but clearly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a close third on Mara; dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual. Rhythm modulates well, with clean focalization and no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated diction risks softness but remains within the voice’s range. Overall, confident and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with strong images and efficient beats; minimal scaffolding and good sentence variety. A few turns flirt with purple (“scent of salt and secrets,” “shoreline lullaby”), but they don’t occlude sense. Information density is solid and momentum steady. The final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The psychopomp ferry and liminal crossing are familiar, but the ticket punch/star transference is a fresh inflection. The piece synthesizes known tropes into a specific, coherent vision. Risk profile is modest; it favors elegance over surprise. Distinctiveness rests more in execution than premise.</comment>
