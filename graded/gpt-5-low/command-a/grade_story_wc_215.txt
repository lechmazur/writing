<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias is consistent and gently compelling, but his interiority skews declarative over conflicted; he shifts from recluse to guardian with little on‑page resistance. The decisive ritual reads as a given rather than a choice paid for with a visible cost. Embodied noticing is strong (“light through broken glass,” “faint hum of bees”), yet contradictory impulses rarely collide in scene. The closing peace feels earned emotionally but minimally contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: discoveries, symbols, melody, and water accrete toward a ritual that lands on the page. Some conveniences (dream‑opened box, immediate deciphering) soften pressure, but the closure (oasis stirs, ghosts dissolve) is clear with a conceptual cost. Orientation is firm early; the two‑shard feel (discovery → ritual) is coherent. The because/therefore chain is light yet legible under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The oasis is vivid and integrated: scorched wasteland, skeletal gardens, greenhouse glass, and a hidden well that matters in the ritual. Details filter through Elias’s sensibility, aligning tone and world rules without exposition heft. The stained glass box functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image. Environmental constraint is gentle, but the revived landscape reweights the last beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes remain mostly conceptual (“unspoken words”) with few friction points testing resolve; obstacles are discovered rather than contested. The key tightening arrives when ghosts become visible and the ritual is performed, but the price is felt more atmospherically than as a trade‑off. Agency exists yet faces little opposition. The outcome doesn’t demand a difficult sacrifice beyond attention and intention.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motifs (silence, bees, glass, water) cohere around keeping promises to the unspoken. However, the final paragraph partially states the thesis (“He had preserved the weight of unspoken words”) instead of letting the image carry it, shaving subtlety. Still, the transformation of wasteland to oasis provides a resonant answer to the covenant’s breach. Ambiguity lingers pleasantly in the ghosts’ role and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent third‑person close with a calm, lucid lyricism that matches Elias’s perceptual bias. Diction is controlled, with rhythmic variety and clean stance; no head‑hopping or unearned knowledge. Elevated tone is justified by subject. Minor over‑glossing in peak beats doesn’t disrupt clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑rich; lines often carry dual duty (mood and world). Occasional abstractions and thesis‑like statements flatten momentum near the end, and some modifiers repeat tone without new pressure. No significant loops or muddled metaphors. Overall cadence supports a quiet build to closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fusion of a beekeeping oasis, stained glass reliquary, and a covenant about silence feels fresh, if the ritual‑restores‑the‑land arc is familiar. The “mute eloquence” register gives the material a distinct stance. Risks are aesthetic more than structural, and they largely pay off. A bolder on‑page cost or twist of consequence could elevate originality.</comment>
