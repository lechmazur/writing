<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motives are clear (resentful caretaker driven by duty and hope), and her choices under pressure (assembling the map, rescuing the traveler, planting the nut) track cleanly. Interiority is specific enough to feel embodied, though her contradictions could bite harder on the page. The traveler is a prop rather than a crucible, limiting relational pressure. The final stance shift (duty to chosen purpose) lands, with modest felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the nut’s rule leads to map assembly, to rescue, to planting and a bud—a coherent because/therefore chain. Closure arrives via a small but decisive change (the bud) paired with a reconfigured role. The cost is present as risk and ongoing obligation but is light. Orientation is clean from the opening and the single transition is smooth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, salt‑worn pillars, and mechanical birds are vivid and operate as constraints on movement and choice. The nut as object‑as‑setting meaningfully shapes tactics and charges the final image. Weather (night frost) appears as texture and mild clock rather than a primary constraint, but atmosphere remains strong and focused. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (save a traveler; nudge the curse) are set early and tighten when the birds arrive and the map unlocks a viable path. The meaningful deepening is the assembled blueprint that changes options mid‑story. The price is mainly risk and endurance; no major foreclosed option is paid on‑page, keeping the ceiling below elite. Still, escalation reads coherent and protagonist‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of chosen purpose versus inherited duty and beauty born of function emerge through particulars (the birds, the nut’s “offhanded exactness,” the map). The closing line names the thesis a bit directly (“keeper of graceless beauty”), tipping toward statement over resonance. Nonetheless, the bud’s appearance reweights the orchard and her role without sermonizing. Subtext operates in the nut’s behavior and the birds’ aesthetic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with controlled lyricism and clear focalization. Diction suits the world and modulates under stress (“heart pounding,” clipped action during the rescue). No head‑hopping or expository leakage. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts abstraction but doesn’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry good rhythm and economy; images often do double duty (world + theme). Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics keep momentum. A few adjective stacks and reiterated descriptors flirt with over‑ornament but don’t drag. The final image resolves cleanly without purple blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—cursed orchard, mechanical birds, a nut that impresses a shifting blueprint—feels fresh and cohesive. The “offhandedly exact” key mechanism transforms a familiar maze‑rescue into something stranger. Risks are tasteful rather than wild, but the final reconfiguration is earned. Some elements (the frost clock) could be integrated more provocatively to push novelty further.</comment>
