<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Zara’s motives and interiority are clear, embodied by the crumpled photo and the cliffside retrieval. The near‑fall compresses contradictory impulses (fear vs. need to hold on to family) into a credible, physical test. A few abstract terms (“somatic markers,” “anchor optimism in realism”) flirt with therapy‑speak and slightly tidy the epiphany. Still, the final artistic choice reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (arboretum on a cliff; Zara; present goal), and the structure holds to a single, coherent scene with one transition to the bench. Under a Situational lens, the wind‑snatched photo creates external pressure that forces a stance crystallization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she re-enters as artist), with a modest but legible cost. The causal chain is clean if quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff are not decorative; wind, edge, and waves shape the core choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail (salt, jasmine, surf) is purposeful and filtered through her state. Specific botany and micro‑geography could be deepened, but the environment constrains action effectively. The photograph functions as a micro‑setting object charging stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (retrieve the photo without losing it—or herself) is clear and tightens with the slip at the edge. The escalation is believable and character‑driven, and luck doesn’t resolve it; her trained bodily response matters. The price paid is mostly internal; physical cost remains hypothetical, softening the impact slightly. Still, the moment forecloses a passive, grief‑stalled path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of endurance and earned hope are carried by recurring images (lighthouse keeper legacy, photo, ocean) and reweighted at the end. Occasional explicit moralizing (“anchor optimism in realism,” “She wasn’t healed…”) blunts subtext. The “pearl of stillness” motif lands but is named a bit insistently. Resonance lingers through the closing posture more than a stated takeaway.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with controlled rhythm and a credible perceptual filter. Diction sometimes leans abstract/clinical (“somatic markers”), though the body‑based phrasing generally keeps it grounded. Cadence tightens appropriately at the cliff edge and relaxes at the bench. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and mostly efficient, with vivid, concrete lines (“fluttered like a wounded bird”) and clear sequencing. Some stock phrases (“time seemed to stand still,” “weight lift from her shoulders”) and light redundancy soften the edge. Figurative language is controlled and doesn’t muddle action. Line‑level momentum holds through the climax without loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core components (trauma survivor, charged photograph, cliffside arboretum) are familiar but combined with care; the lighthouse‑keeper legacy adds texture. “Somatic markers” as an operative concept is a fresh inflection, if a touch didactic. The final reconfiguration is honest rather than novel. Overall, solid execution over sheer invention.</comment>
