<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s goal (uncover a withheld truth) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (picking up the shard, combining shards) align with it. However, interior contradiction is minimal and she accepts revelations too smoothly, muting felt struggle. Embodied emotion appears (“weight on her shoulders”) but often yields to summary. The guide figure removes pressure that might have revealed more character under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: shard → transport → encounter → instruction → combination → realization. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (guardianhood reweights prior material), though the cost is mostly stated rather than dramatized. Orientation is early and solid; the lens reads Hybrid with causal beats leading to a conceptual end. Expository convenience (the woman explains everything) softens the earned feel of the final turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The repair bay and forest are sensorially vivid (rust/grease vs. lush bloom) and filtered through her map‑maker bias. The shard as recurring object anchors atmosphere and the final image, but the environments seldom constrain choices beyond serving as portals. World rules are consistent within the brief frame. Strong tone/texture without the setting forcing tactical trade‑offs.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn the truth) is signaled early, but escalation is gentle and largely delivered by coincidence and guidance rather than pressure. The key tightening—combining shards—faces no resistance or trade‑off on the page. Cost is anticipated (“heavier than you imagine”) but not paid in scene. Tension stays conceptual more than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of connection, responsibility, and guardianship are coherent and seeded by her vocation. The ending provides a thematic answer (purpose as guardian) but leans on explicit statements (“withheld truth,” “ensure threads remained intact”) over subtext. The orb image has resonance yet risks sentimentality without friction. Complexity is implied rather than felt through contested choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stable close third with a controlled, mildly lyrical texture suits a sensory map maker. Diction is consistent and readable; dialogue is sparse and serviceable. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Some phrasing (“without warning,” “as if”) trends generic but doesn’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level is clean, paced, and mostly economical, with vivid images (“air smelled of rust and old grease”). Occasional scaffold and clichés (“without warning,” “caught in her throat”) and repeated “as if” constructions dull edge. Expository patches in the final third flatten momentum. Still, clarity holds and sentences carry weight without major loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sensory map maker angle offers a fresh inflection on a familiar multiverse/guardian trope. The green/blue shard fusion is neat but not surprising, and the mentor exposition is conventional. Emotional stakes feel safe, limiting memorability. Solid craft over bold risk.</comment>
