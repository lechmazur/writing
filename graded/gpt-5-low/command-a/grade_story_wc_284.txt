<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and internal contradiction (cautious after being “burned” yet compelled to act) are clear and embodied in micro‑choices—following the snow codes, opening the pillbox, choosing not to take the pill. The letter catalyzes a credible internal shift without feeling convenient. Cost is present but subtle, mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. Strong single‑POV interiority avoids stock therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: trek → codes → pillbox/letter → dawn path. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise): she pockets the pill and proceeds with a reweighted stance. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The cost at closure is more inferred than felt, keeping it below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff’s mist, wind, and snow are integrated into action (codes legible in snow; mist lifting to reveal a path). The pillbox functions as a charged micro‑setting object in the closing image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s aims. The environment constrains softly rather than decisively, but it meaningfully charges the final cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover courage to “fix what’s broken”) is clear, with a tightening at the discovery of the letter and the pill decision. Escalation is measured rather than sharp; pressure coheres but the visible price is modest. The choice to proceed without the pill reads as a trade‑off (prudence vs. daring) yet remains low‑risk on the page. Tension works more through cadence shift than direct jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory vs. discovery of courage and rebuilding from remnants emerge organically via the pillbox, codes, and letter. The line “even the burned could ignite again” edges toward statement, but the final image (mist lifting, path revealed) carries resonance. The concept reweights prior images rather than issuing a moral. Quiet, credible aftereffect without forced symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person closely held to Elara maintains consistent diction and distance. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and imagery choices feel voice‑true for this register. No dialogue to test, but the narrative stance stays controlled without head‑hopping. Minor familiar turns of phrase keep it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive lines with selective imagery; repetition is minimal and generally purposeful. A few conventional metaphors and reiterated motifs (“fixing what’s broken,” “unused courage”) slightly blunt the edge. Syntax varies and carries momentum without scaffolding loops. No artifacting that clouds closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “burned spy” redemption arc is familiar, but codes in snow, the pillbox with an unmarked pill, and the letter as a memory‑key lend fresh texture. The mist‑lifting closure avoids gimmickry and feels earned. Risks are moderate and coherent rather than bold. Emotional truth outpaces novelty, yielding solid distinctiveness.</comment>
