<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—quiet mentorship through annotating a trapped shadow—is clear and character‑specific, with embodied quirks (backwards walking, trembling hands). Contradictory impulses (nervousness vs. resolve; fragility vs. “combative tenderness”) are present but rarely force a hard trade‑off. Micro‑choices (brewing oolong, tracing leaves, annotating) reveal her values. The cost of her stance remains subtle, limiting peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is steady: tea‑leaf geometry → annotation → shadow’s shimmer and reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and held. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror reads “portal not prison,” with an earned cadence shift at twilight. Cost is more felt than explicit, keeping it strong but not exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library and shard‑mirror are vividly rendered—dust, damp wood, cracked windows—filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The tea, leaves, and glass integrate setting with action rather than sitting as postcards. Environment tonally pressures the scene (haunting hush), though it seldom constrains choices directly. Rich specificity without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes (free the shadow/enable reversible exile) are legible, but pressure escalates quietly rather than through a decisive narrowing. The main tightening is the moment the leaves’ patterns cohere and the shadow responds. The price of failure/success is implied more than dramatized; conflict remains internal and soft‑edged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of exile/return and resilience emerge from concrete particulars (tea‑leaf annotation, shadow softening). A few overt statements (“to teach the world how to endure without breaking”) tread close to moralizing, but most resonance is image‑led. The final reweighting (portal vs. prison) offers a non‑literal answer about endurance and reclamation. Ambiguity is purposeful, if gentler than the premise invites.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is consistent, tactile, and confident; syntax modulates well from hush to lift. Diction matches the world’s fable‑logic without register slips. No head‑hopping; elision is modest and legible. The “combative tenderness” tonal strand is voiced without breaking POV modesty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑dense with good momentum; most sentences do double duty. A few lines lean purple or repeat a sentiment (the library’s hush is echoed), but clarity holds. Figurative language is mostly coherent; no scaffold or loop artifacts blunt the final image. Rhythm lands cleanly at the twilight cadence shift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Shard‑mirror archivist” and “geometry of tea leaves” reading a captive afternoon shadow feel freshly synthesized. The reversible exile premise is integrated rather than gimmicky. The final reconfiguration is earned by the piece’s own logic. Boldness is aesthetic and thematic, even if the cost isn’t razor‑edged.</comment>
