<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—transmuting grief into craft—is clear and specific, and her micro‑choices (tea, tool selection, tackling the mane) embody it. The internal contradiction (contain the “here and gone”) lives in action rather than summary. A quiet but credible shift to resilience lands. A touch of thematic self‑naming risks mild neatness but doesn’t undercut motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, kettle, tools, and iterative carving accrue toward a charged final image. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with the completed lion and a reweighted stance toward grief. Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost is primarily emotional and understated but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The loft, rain‑beaded skylight, and arranged tools are vivid, POV‑filtered, and used during the act of carving. The kettle and skylight light shape cadence and mood, charging the final image. Details stay economical and tactile. The environment subtly constrains options by keeping her anchored in the ritual workspace.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (can she make meaning without being consumed by grief) are signaled early and deepen at the mane problem, a concrete tightening. Her renewed focus after reflection and tea feels like an earned adaptation. The price is quiet endurance rather than a sharp trade‑off; effective but modest in intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Impermanence and containment arise from particulars—the ash grain, the lion’s closed eyes, the ritual of boiling water—rather than pure assertion. The last image reweights “here and gone” without moralizing. Slight over‑articulation of the concept dampens subtext in places. Still, the piece leaves a resonant aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Close third is steady and confident, with lyrical diction matching Elara’s contemplative state. Rhythm modulates well between action and reflection. Minor repetition of coined phrases (“hauntingly practical,” “crystallized time”) brushes excess but doesn’t break voice. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line craft is clear, sensory, and largely economical; sentences often do multiple jobs. A few near‑synonym loops and motif reiterations verge on purple but retain clarity and momentum. Figurative language stays coherent and grounded in the scene. Final lines land by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow‑carver of a lion tamer’s essence is a fresh inflection on grief ritual, with concrete craft detail. The “here and gone” conceit is familiar but thoughtfully integrated. Risks are modest but coherent, avoiding gimmickry. The ending synthesizes elements in a non‑obvious, earned way.</comment>
