<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to strip away drama and attend to essentials—reads consistent and drives her micro‑choices to experiment. Interiority is grounded in tactile observation (gloves, chill, soil), with a scientist’s bias refracting wonder. Internal contradiction is minimal; awe largely displaces doubt rather than coexisting with it under pressure. The final renunciation toward humility feels earned but light on visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iterative dust patterns deepen from observation to interaction to manifestation. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the causal drift is purposeful rather than plotted. Closure lands on the page with the butterfly’s appearance, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, not materially priced, keeping it just shy of top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The storm‑damaged greenhouse is vivid and lived‑in (shattered glass, brackish soil), filtering her attention and echoing decay. Environment and object (dust) integrate with process rather than serving as postcard backdrop. While the greenhouse doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it charges the final image through ruin‑to‑renewal contrast. Specificity remains selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pressure accrues through pattern density and a cadence shift as the dust “responds,” culminating in coalescence. Dominant stake is internal (meaning/purpose), and escalation is credible under the accumulative lens. However, options never truly narrow nor is a tangible price extracted; conflict remains gentle and unopposed. The ending feels earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of gradual, humbling transformation emerges through particulars (dust, decay, growth) rather than lecture. The final image re‑reads the dust as bridge between micro and cosmic, aligning with her profession. Occasional abstract phrasing (“preprocess reality”) edges toward told insight but mostly remains embodied. Resonance lingers without moralizing despite one overt statement about stripping drama.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single‑POV voice is confident, textural, and consistently filtered through a scientist’s sensibility tempered by awe. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with modulation from clinical observation to lyric reverence at the close. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; inference stays within plausible knowledge. Minor abstraction doesn’t erode the perceptual signature.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with clean syntax and efficient detail; very little scaffold or synonym churn. Figurative language is restrained and coherent; images resolve cleanly at the climax. Some conceptual repetition (“preprocess reality,” “gradual change”) skims near redundancy but functions as motif. Read‑aloud rhythm varies well and supports the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—neutron‑star researcher in a ruined greenhouse using butterfly dust to pattern reality—is fresh and coherent. The metamorphosis trope is renewed through procedural experimentation and cosmological contrast. The final reconfiguration feels earned by prior beats rather than a late rule change. Boldness is quiet but sure‑footed, with distinctive images and stance.</comment>
