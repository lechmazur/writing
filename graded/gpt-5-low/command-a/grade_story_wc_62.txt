<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—transforming collective grief into stone—drives concrete choices (studying the ribbon, altering the carving) with embodied focus. The internal contradiction (seeking a “shape” vs. honoring a “space”) is credible and resolves via a paid renunciation (letting Tomas’s presence fade). Interiority is specific to her craft, though a few lines edge toward abstraction. The final stance feels earned and character‑particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, images and reflections build toward a conceptual repricing: grief as migration rather than a bounded carving. Orientation is clear early (greenhouse at dusk; Elara at work), and the ribbon/butterflies pattern tightens the frame. Closure lands with a felt cost—the mentor’s departure and the shift from monument to journey. The linkage is coherent and clean for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse, glass, and migration saturate the atmosphere and filter perception through a craftsperson’s eye. While the environment doesn’t materially constrain tactics, it charges objects (ribbon, chisel) and final images (butterflies at rest, panes reflecting stars). Sensory selection is purposeful and consistent. Strong integration without crossing into true constraint-driven setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily internal and coheres around a single stake: how to render grief. The meaningful tightening occurs when the ribbon’s pattern reframes the task, compelling a new tactic (etching migration). Cost is subtle but legible (accepting an unfinishable process, mentor fading). Escalation is quiet yet sufficient under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motifs (butterflies, ribbon, stone) evolve to deliver an earned insight that reweights earlier beats. A few thematic sentences verge on statement (“Collective grief... not something to be solved”) but are backed by concrete action. Subtext mainly rides image and craft, not lecture. The final image resonates beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is steady, with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual signature of a carver listening to materials and silence. Quoted mentor line integrates without breaking stance. Minor abstraction lifts in places but doesn’t disrupt coherence. Psychic distance shifts are modest and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied cadence and high information density; images do double duty thematically and atmospherically. A few elevated phrasings (“thundering calm,” “weight of centuries”) flirt with purple but serve tone. Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics. Momentum breathes without sag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone craft, spectral mentorship, greenhouse migration—feels specific and lived. The reframing of grief via pattern and movement is fresh if not entirely unprecedented. Risks are measured and coherent; no gimmicks. The piece’s originality rests in its tactile craft lens and charged objects.</comment>
