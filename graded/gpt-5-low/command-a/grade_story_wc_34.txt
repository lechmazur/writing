<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to free and articulate the ghost—is clear and consistent, and her agency drives the ritual. Interiority is present but not deeply conflicted; she rarely hesitates or pays an acute personal price beyond letting go. Embodied emotion surfaces in tactile actions (tuning, placing the plate, singing) more than in contradictory impulses. The kinship with the ghost is evocative but could sharpen through a harder trade‑off on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: storm window → encoding → manifestation → release. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the bolt plate setup pays off cleanly at closure. The cost is soft but legible (release/solitude and foreclosed connection) with a resonant reconfiguration. A tighter before/after price would elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above the clouds, storm‑charged air, and shifting graffiti create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere that interacts with action. Weather/timeframe presses the ritual and the “micro‑setting” of the bolt plate meaningfully charges the final image. Sensory selection feels character‑filtered and economical. The environment constrains subtly rather than overtly, but it’s integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: free the ghost before the storm’s window closes. Pressure rises through the encoding cadence and the lightning/thunder clock, culminating in manifestation and release. The escalation is steady but lacks a sharp reversal or visible loss beyond the necessary parting. Still, agency drives the turn and the ending is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of giving voice to the unseen and bridging tech/art cohere through concrete images (graffiti code, melody as translation). The final image of release and renewed purpose resonates, but “true power of her gift” borders on explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in the kinship and the cost of letting go, though complexity is smoothed. A touch more ambiguity at the end would deepen the aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled and consistent, fusing mythic and technical registers without leakage. POV remains stable and confident, with diction that suits the world’s hybrid feel. Rhythmic modulation tracks the storm’s pulse. A few elevated assertions flatten nuance, but the perceptual signature holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑rich, and mostly efficient, with strong verb choices and purposeful detail. Occasional purple notes and thematic tell (“true power of her gift”) slightly dull peak intensity. No major loops or scaffold; momentum is maintained. A touch more restraint at climactic lines would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—balladeer‑cryptographer, ghost‑in‑code via graffiti, antique bolt plate as conduit in a cloud‑courtyard—feels fresh and coherent. The resolution through music‑encoding is an elegant, non‑obvious tactic. While not wholly unprecedented conceptually, the particular mix reads singular. Further risk in complicating cost or rule‑set implications could push it higher.</comment>
