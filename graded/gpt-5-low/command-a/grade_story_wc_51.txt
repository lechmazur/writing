<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to bear and measure others’ burdens) is clear, with embodied tells like the tightening grip on the lamp. The encounter forces a credible internal contradiction—duty vs self-preservation—into speech and action. Her final choice to turn the weaving inward reads earned, though the on‑page cost remains more implied than felt. Dialogue reveals status shifts without flattening her complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp early, and the piece holds an accumulative/textural lens to a clean RR/CR closure. The offer of choice and her pivot to self‑understanding provide the decisive cadence shift. Cost is present conceptually (crack in the calcified soul; potential renunciation of role) but not viscerally enacted. The single-scene pressure coheres and resolves without stray threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, damp earth, metallic tang, and lamp are vivid and POV‑filtered, with the lamp returning to charge the final image. Environmental details mirror interior movement (fissure, thaw, hum) without heavy-handed symbolism. While the setting rarely constrains action, it meaningfully frames and deepens the stakes. Sensory selection stays purposeful and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remain the burden-bearer or redirect toward self—tightens through the figure’s questioning and the offered hand. The escalation is a controlled deepening rather than a reversal, congruent with the chosen lens. The choice forecloses a path in principle but the price is underplayed on the page. Tension is steady and sentence-level pressure aligns with the turning point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of purpose-as-trap, the ethics of care, and self-knowledge emerge through image and action, culminating in a reweighted final weave. The “shingled hush” motif earns a reprise with altered meaning. A single direct statement (“Purpose can be a trap”) risks over-spelling but is absorbed by the scene’s subtext. The ending invites reflection without prescribing a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled and distinctive, with a coherent perceptual signature; dialogue carries subtext and shifts power. Diction suits the world and never breaks POV plausibility for this mythic register. Psychic distance modulates well under pressure. No head‑hopping or mechanical dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is polished with high information density and generally varied rhythm; images do double duty. Occasional purple flares (“whalebone reverie,” “boundary-lessly”) flirt with over‑ornament but don’t blur sense. Minimal redundancy and good momentum into the final image. Clarity remains intact at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fractal weaver, burden‑weights, and “shingled hush” synthesize into a fresh mythic micro‑fable. The visitor’s offer is familiar but transformed by the specific imagery and method. Final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in diction and conceit pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
