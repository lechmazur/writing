<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The traveler’s motive—writing obituaries for the living—reads specific and drives her choices, while the elderly woman’s long waiting gives the scene a credible wound. Interiority is steady and embodied through sensory noticing rather than abstract labels. The traveler’s gift of the notebook and the woman’s tears register a cost, though the traveler’s internal contradiction and risk remain low. Relationship pressure is gentle rather than bracing, limiting peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: presence, observation, writing, reading, exchange. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing—an obituary for the waiting self—and a resonant exchange of threads. Cost is felt in the woman’s silent weeping and the traveler relinquishing her notebook, though the price is quiet. Orientation is clear early and structure is clean within a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The autumn garden is sensorially rich—crisp air, woodsmoke, filtered light—and inseparable from the tone. The ship beyond the horizon and the stars as “tiny obituaries” elegantly charge the final image. Environment guides mood more than choice; it rarely constrains tactics. Specificity is strong but operates mainly as atmosphere rather than pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes focus on whether presence and language can reconfigure grief. Escalation is a soft deepening: confession, composition, reading, and the exchange of threads. The cost is emotional release rather than a foreclosed option, which keeps pressure modest. Still, the turning point—memorializing the self who waited—credibly narrows the woman’s future stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of absence, transformation, and memorializing the living emerge through concrete acts. The thread/tapestry motif returns with added charge at the end. A few direct thematic statements (“geography of healing… not about distance”) flirt with over-explication but do not capsize subtext. The final stars-as-obituaries image resonates without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is poised, lyrical, and consistent with a witnessing third-person close. Dialogue is sparse and natural, carrying subtext (“I’ve been waiting for the ship”). Diction remains controlled and coherent; no head-hopping or stance slips. Rhythm supports the quiet intensification.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythm, concrete sensory detail, and purposeful metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward lushness but remains clear and motivated. Minimal scaffold or repetition, and the closure image is crisp. Momentum is maintained despite lyric density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living—feels fresh and is executed with integrity. The thread exchange is a familiar symbol made specific by the palace carpet detail and mirrored reprise. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; they pay off in tone and image. Some metaphors (tapestry, stars) are known, but the synthesis feels authentic.</comment>
