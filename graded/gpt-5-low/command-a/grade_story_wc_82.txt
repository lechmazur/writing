<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael’s motives and contradictions are legible: he tries to outcraft grief while fearing it will consume him, then chooses to face it by unfolding the crane. The embodied work (gem‑polishing, origami) grounds emotion. Lira applies immediate pressure with one pointed intervention. A slight neatness to the final acceptance trims complexity, but the cost reads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: Lira’s nudge → basilica visit → realization → renewed stance forms clean because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as an earned reconfiguration (he foregoes escape to honor grief), with the crane’s unfolding as the decisive act. Stakes stay singular and coherent. Cost is felt through the painful recognition of the “shadow” as his self‑built shield.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and craft bench are vivid and POV‑filtered through a lantern maker’s eye. The basilica and crane charge the final image, not mere postcards. A few overt mirroring lines (“descended while ascending”) skew symbolic, but overall specificity serves action and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to live with grief) is signaled early and tightens when Lira challenges his coping tactic. The meaningful turn occurs at the altar with the reframe of the shadow; he pays a price by relinquishing the protective numbness. No antagonist needed; pressure holds and deepens to a credible choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres—control vs. surrender in grief—through objects (lanterns, cranes) and the basilica’s light. However, Lira’s line “Grief is not meant to be…” edges into on‑the‑nose thesis, dulling subtext. The final act reweights prior images effectively without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with lyrical texture that suits the world and Kael’s craft‑mind. Dialogue is spare and functional, if occasionally declarative. Rhythm modulates well at the climax (crane unfolding), with no head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level is clean, with controlled lyricism and strong verbs; images carry double duty. A few purple edges (“mist…like a lover’s whisper,” “descended while ascending”) risk over-insistence but don’t obscure sense. No loops or scaffold drag momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The blend of dream‑recording lanterns, a glass basilica, and origami‑mediated grief feels fresh and integrated. The emotional arc (from control to honoring pain) is familiar but earned through specific mechanics. The shield/shadow reframe provides a non‑obvious, satisfying turn.</comment>
