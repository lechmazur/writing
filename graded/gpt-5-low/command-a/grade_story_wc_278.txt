<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven motivation is clear and consistent, and the choice to answer the letters “as the child” is a meaningful, revealing action. Interiority is specific (firmware whispers, amber focus) and avoids generic labels. The resolution is a touch tidy, with limited on‑page resistance to the deciding act. Still, the emotional cost of engaging the letters reads credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: lab ambience, firmware pressure, and letters build toward a resonant hush. Closure lands via a felt reconfiguration—the machines fall silent as she accepts listening over silencing. The cost is emotional but legible; causality is soft but coherent. Minor convenience in the firmware’s quick softening keeps it below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The laboratory is vividly particular (glass chambers, humming machines) and the amber object recurs to charge the final image. The environment’s rules (haunted firmware, timefold hum) shape mood and outcome (silence at the end). Sensory selection aligns with Elara’s priorities and the tone. While not strictly constraining tactics, setting meaningfully charges choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing guilt/dissonance—is clear, with pressure tightening through the discovery of letters and the ethically fraught response choice. The internal conflict (soothe vs. impersonate) intersects with the external firmware pressure. Consequences are primarily internal and occur quickly, reducing felt risk. Still, the turn is earned and alters her stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Redemption reframed as listening rather than control develops organically through motifs (firmware cries, infant cries, amber). The final hush reweights the premise with a quiet, resonant answer. A slight explanatory tilt (“not because she had silenced it, but because she had learned to listen”) edges toward stating the moral. Subtext remains strong despite that clarity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual bias (techno-mystic lexicon, star imagery). Rhythm and diction are controlled without head‑hopping; no dialogue needed. Minor moments flirt with purple but remain legible and purposeful. Voice coheres through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image-rich, and largely economical, with motifs doing multi-duty. Occasional density (“language of broken code,” “meteor hush”) risks over-ornament but does not blur sense. Momentum holds through reflective blocks. No notable loops or scaffold, though some lines summarize internal states a touch neatly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, translating baby cries—feels fresh and thematically integrated. The letters device and the lab’s sonic metaphysics avoid cliché and serve the arc. The ending’s repricing via “listening” lands as a non-obvious, earned turn. Not radical in structure, but confidently novel in texture and premise.</comment>
