<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—Elara’s drive to find where deleted files go feeds every action. Interiority skews functional rather than singular, leaning on familiar cues (“heart raced,” “mind racing”) with limited contradictory impulses. The lie adds a flicker of moral tension but isn’t fully mined for cost. Still, actions align with motive and reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: numbers → hidden folder → lockout → lie/bypass → transmission → decision. Orientation is solid from the outset, and the throughline stays single‑POV, single‑stake. Closure arrives as a decisive choice to expose the truth, with implied cost (job/company retaliation) though not concretely dramatized. The lens reads Causal and holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The social network archive and old terminal provide plausible constraints and resources (lockout forces offline workaround). Sensory and spatial texture is serviceable rather than vivid, but the environment does matter to tactics. The patch and console recur as small object‑anchors charging the final image. World rules remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. corporate purge/erasure) is signaled early and tightens with the lockout turn. The lie and the offline bypass are meaningful escalations driven by agency. The price remains largely implied; no concrete loss is paid on the page, tempering impact. Tension builds coherently to a stance‑crystallizing ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memory, absence, and corporate silence interlace with the motif of numbers and song to create a coherent thematic weave. The final decision reframes the void—“sensed absence”—as an ethical imperative, yielding a modest conceptual repricing. Occasional declarative lines edge toward telling. Still, the song/number pattern carries a resonant aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stable third‑person limited with controlled access to knowledge; no head‑hopping or register shocks. Diction is clean if somewhat generic, with few idiosyncratic signatures beyond the investigative focus. Rhythm holds under pressure, with purposeful compression around the lockout and discovery. Absence of dialogue keeps the voice consistent but limits tonal modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and efficient, with minimal scaffolding and logical connectors that track. Some stock phrasing (“no matter the cost,” “heart raced”) and mild repetition don’t significantly dull momentum. Information density is solid; each paragraph advances plot or atmosphere. The final image is clean, if not linguistically distinctive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Corporate archivist + numerological breadcrumb trail + song‑synced pattern is a fresh enough synthesis of familiar SF‑mystery tropes. The coordinates twist is expected, but the social‑archive angle and “deleted files” motive personalize it. Risk‑taking is moderate; the piece commits to its premise without gimmicks. Emotional specificity could push it further from template.</comment>
