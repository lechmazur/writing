<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s opposing drives—feral duty to the library vs. dimensional homesickness—are embodied in micro‑choices (pausing, “interiorizing exteriors,” tightening on the pendant) and culminate in a credible renunciation. Dialogue with the keeper clarifies status and pressure without flattening her interiority. A few abstractions (“make friends with uncertainty”) lean told rather than dramatized, but the final choice feels earned. The visible cost—enduring homesickness—is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: pendant appears → keeper articulates cost → Elara chooses to wait, preserving the library at the expense of relief. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the path home is foreclosed for now with felt cost. Orientation is clean early, and the single scene keeps coherent pressure. The keeper’s timely arrival is convenient but functions as the necessary pressure engine rather than a shortcut.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen, misted garden is vividly rendered and not merely scenic: it births the antagonist figure, houses the key choice, and its potential fading sets the stakes. The pendant functions as a micro‑setting tool, warming and dimming in response to her actions. While the environment doesn’t physically constrain tactics, it charges the final image and the moral calculus. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake—go home using the pendant or protect garden/library—tightens when the cost is named. The reversal is inward but real: she shifts from ache toward chosen endurance. The price is explicit (losing the chance to return now; continued ache) and it reweights the scene’s options. Additional complicating beats could heighten pressure, but what’s here is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of uncertainty, stewardship, and liminality arise from concrete beats (the key, the keeper’s cost, the refusal) and culminate in a resonant identity shift (“a bridge between worlds”). The fog/mist pattern dovetails with conceptual “boundaries of light,” yielding a thoughtful, quiet afterimage. Occasional on‑the‑nose statements (“make friends with uncertainty”) slightly blunt subtext. Still, the ending’s non‑literal answer reads earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is consistent and confident; diction supports the uncanny atmosphere without head‑hopping. Dialogue is lean, goal‑driven, and advances pressure with subtext. A few elevated abstractions risk distance, but cadence and focalization stay controlled. Psychic distance modulates purposefully toward clarity in the final beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑forward, and avoids loops; sentences often carry dual duty (world + emotion). Some high‑register phrasing (“interiorizing exteriors,” “boundaries of light”) veers toward purple but remains legible. Rhythm varies appropriately with pressure, and final lines land with precision. Minor condensation could tighten a couple of explanatory phrases.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “feral library guardian” in a frozen, misted garden with a cultist key feels distinct; the “keeper of boundaries of light” reframes a familiar portal choice with fresh language. The core turn—choosing to wait—leans classic, but the cosmology and tactile pendant work add specificity. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. A bolder complication or idiosyncratic cost could push it higher.</comment>
