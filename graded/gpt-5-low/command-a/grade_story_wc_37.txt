<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s goal (rekindle the realm) is clear and consistently drives her choices, and the memory‑scatter trait provides credible internal resistance. Interiority is present but skews generalized (“her motivation burned brighter”) rather than sharply character‑particular. The shift from searching for “words” to accepting a felt lullaby is a credible micro‑turn but lacks a palpable sacrifice. The ending change reads earned, though the cost stays mostly emotional and light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a primarily causal lens, the beats link cleanly: mica → mirror world → roots/stream threads → elusive final thread → felt lullaby → return and rekindling. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the single transition is legible. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (dawn returns, communities reknit), though the cost is modest. No major teleports or causality slips; pressure is linear but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse/orchard/mirror world are vivid and functionally integrated: the mica as portal, tree roots as lyric source, stream harmonizing. The “endless night” charges the stakes and the final image of dawn reweights the space. Sensory detail is purposeful, though mainly visual. The environment constrains tactics enough to feel indispensable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes (revive a dying realm) are signaled early and deepen as the last thread eludes her, forcing a tactic shift from lexical recall to embodied feeling. The escalation is gentle; external resistance is minimal and largely internal. Closure is earned by her agency (singing), but there’s little visible price or foreclosed alternative on the page. Tension is steady rather than tightening to a sharp pinch.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory, song as social fabric, and reweaving light accrue through specific images (root‑etched lyrics, stream harmonies). The final image reaffirms unity without explicit moralizing, though some lines verge on declarative thesis (“knit the realm together”). Subtext is present in the mirror/parallax of worlds but remains safe rather than ambiguous or cutting. Emotional aftereffect is warm, if predictable.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is consistent and suited to a fable‑like frame; distance and stance remain stable. Elevated diction matches the mythic register without head‑hopping. Compression around key beats reads intentional, with no unmotivated withholding. Some phrasing tends toward generalized uplift, but rhythm is controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and musical, with recurring motifs (mica, dawn, song) doing double duty. Occasional redundancy and abstract intensifiers (“burned brighter,” “purpose fulfilled”) slightly thin density. Figurative language stays coherent and legible; momentum mostly holds through transitions. Sentence variety is adequate, if not strikingly dynamic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The mirror‑orchard/mica/sung‑spell synthesis feels fresh enough, though the “song restores the world” trope is familiar. The retrieval of “threads” from roots and stream offers a distinctive tactile angle. The final reconfiguration is graceful rather than surprising. Risk is moderate: strong atmosphere, safe conflict calculus.</comment>
