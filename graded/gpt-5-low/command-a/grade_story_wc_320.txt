<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (tune the shard; “find the beginning in every ending”), and micro-choices on the console track that aim. However, interior conflict is minimal—competence dominates and contradictory impulses rarely clash on the page. The reversal (misassumption about finite power) is a good character-revealing beat but lands without much embodied cost. Emotional texture leans abstract, reducing individuation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern‑building through sound/silence culminates in a cadence shift as the city “comes alive.” Closure is a conceptual repricing—silence reframed and the city reborn—achieved on the page. The visible cost is light (letting go of assumptions rather than a consequence that bites), but the turn when the shard dims provides a functional tightening. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (crumbling radio towers, gorge, lunar perigee) is filtered through Elara’s task. The environment and tools (tower height, console, moon’s proximity) modestly constrain choices and charge the final image. World rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. A bit more tactile constraint from the precarious tower could have heightened pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible: successfully tune the shard at perigee. The major tightening is the shard dimming after a misassumption, forcing adaptation (discarding the “finite power” belief). Costs remain largely conceptual; no strong trade‑off or lost option is dramatized. Tension is steady but not teethy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Themes of silence-as-potential and beginnings-within-endings are coherent and integrated with image and action. However, the piece states its thesis explicitly—especially in the final movement—dampening subtext and mystery. The epiphany feels somewhat pre‑known rather than earned through friction. Strong motifs; less telling would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lucid, lyrical cadence well matched to the cosmic frame. Rhythm varies and remains legible under pressure; no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated abstractions drift from embodied POV texture in peak beats. Voice confidence is steady, if a bit generic-lyric at times.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line craft is clean and propulsive, with effective sensory economy and few scaffolds. Some purple tendencies and reiterative phrases (“song of beginnings,” overt aphoristic lines) soften edge and urgency. Figurative density edges high but remains coherent; minimal redundancy. Final lines tell what images already show, blunting impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>“Shard of hush,” lunar‑tuned relic, and the suspended radio‑tower city synthesize into a fresh, memorable tableau. The reversal-as-assumption‑discard offers a thoughtful inflection, if familiar as a pattern. Emotional truth is present, though the resolution’s neatness limits surprise. Overall, distinct and integrated without feeling gimmicky.</comment>
