<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael’s motive and vocation are clear and consistent, but internal contradiction is minimal; they read as serenely competent rather than pressured into difficult micro-choices. Embodied perception (hands, arrowhead) works, yet emotions skew declared over conflicted. The final renunciation toward stillness is credible but carries little visible cost. A second, sharper tug-of-war within Kael would deepen character under strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure (“the arrowhead…a compass” leading to inward stillness). Orientation is strong early (Kael, canyon, bone towers), and the flock’s arrival provides the single meaningful tightening. Closure lands conceptually but the cost is soft, registered as a stance shift rather than a pressured sacrifice. The pattern holds coherently through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The canyon of endless echoes and bone towers is vivid and filtered through purpose; “the echoes of the towers guide them” lets environment touch choice. Sensory texture is consistent and evocative without becoming a tourist catalog. World rules (time’s fluidity) are taught through experience. Setting charges the final image, though it rarely constrains options beyond tone and attentional state.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appraise the arrowhead via birds) is clear, with pressure gently tightening when the flock appears and patterns coalesce. Escalation is more meditative density than test; risk, opposition, or loss are almost absent. The turn to “compass” knowledge is a deepening, not a narrowing with price. The cost of choosing stillness remains largely thematic rather than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of stillness-within-motion accrues through recurring images (pulse, dust, echoes) and is reweighted at the end. However, the final paragraphs edge into moralizing (“the greatest journeys were those taken within”), dulling subtext. The arrowhead’s redefinition offers resonance without neat closure, which works. A less declarative last beat would heighten aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close POV with a controlled cadence that suits the meditative mode. Diction matches the mythic register and stays stable; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates modestly at the flock’s intensification. Occasional abstraction slightly distances at peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong image craft (“towers of bone,” “centuries of layered dust”), generally concise for its register. Some concept redundancy and elevated phrasing recur (“pulse,” “stillness”) without adding pressure, lightly damping momentum. Syntax varies and the read-aloud rhythm holds. No major figurative muddle, though the density could be trimmed in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of bone towers, harmonic stone skimming, and divination via flock patterns feels fresh and coherent. Repricing the arrowhead as a compass to states of being is a non-obvious turn that fits the world. The piece risks quiet, inward stakes with lyric texture. Greater on-page cost or a sharper constraint from the environment would push it higher.</comment>
