<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserve and document before terraforming—reads clean, and the mentor tie-in individualizes her. The micro‑choices (ignoring comms, scanning the message, staying through dawn) align with a curious, dutiful persona. Internal friction (protocol vs. preservation) is present but lightly contested; the cost is mostly implied. Embodied details (glove on pouch, breath fogging visor) ground emotion without deep contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-scene structure with clear anchors and a steady because/therefore chain: arrival → hidden message → decision to “outlast” → dawn photo. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she endures until dawn despite pressure. The cost is modest (disobeying urgency rather than a concrete penalty), so the ending resonates more quietly than decisively. Lens reads Situational with a textural deepening as dawn approaches, held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lunar environment is vivid and professionally filtered (regolith crunch, dulled module skin, horizon dawn). The setting and tools (drone, scanner, helmet) affect choices—night conditions reveal the message; dawn becomes the decisive clock. The hourglass grain as micro‑setting object charges the final image. A touch more constraint (environmental risk or equipment limits) could have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation vs. impending alteration—is established early and tightened by the timed message and mission control’s urgency. The meaningful turn is her choice to stay until dawn, fulfilling “Outlast the dawn.” The price is felt but soft; consequence remains largely emotional and procedural rather than materially costly. Tension is steady, if not acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Preservation vs. progress and impermanence are articulated through particular images (chemical glow message, final dawn shot, hourglass grain). The ending answers with a quiet endurance rather than a moral; resonance lingers without confusion. A few lines edge toward sentimentality (“a testament to humanity’s reach for the stars”). Subtext mainly rides object recurrence and the mentor’s unseen defiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident, with a measured lyric register suited to the scene’s hush. Diction reflects a technical yet elegiac sensibility (scanner readouts next to sensory moonlight). No dialogue, but the internal voice remains coherent under mild pressure. Some familiar turns of phrase slightly dilute distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clean syntax and momentum; descriptive lines usually do more than one job. Occasional clichés/purple tints (“silvery glow,” “footprints of giants,” “reach for the stars”) and minor redundancy soften the edge. Rhythm varies well, and sequencing is clear. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The timed chemical message on a historic lunar artifact is a fresh spark within a familiar preservation frame. The hourglass grain and “outlast the dawn” motif synthesize into a distinctive, if gentle, closure. Emotional calculus is honest but safe, with low-risk stakes. Solid craft with a tasteful twist rather than bold reinvention.</comment>
