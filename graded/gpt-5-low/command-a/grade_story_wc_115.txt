<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent: Mara seeks to test and possibly redeem her father’s “ghost shift” tales. Her skepticism wavers under pressure, and she makes micro‑choices (following the clank, inserting the wheel) that align with her goal. Emotional texture is mostly embodied through tactile detail (glass, cold air), though the inner conflict resolves a touch neatly. The cost is primarily emotional rather than materially painful.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: interpreting the father’s calls → locating the valve wheel → following noise → activating the machine to release the ghosts. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a before/after state (ghost shift ends, Mara’s peace). Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost at closure is modest but legible (risk, renunciation of disbelief, emotional reckoning).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (damp earth, rust, glass, cold air) supports mood and action. The beaded valve wheel functions as a charged object that constrains the final choice. Spatial coherence is maintained from tunnel to chamber with environmental pressure (darkness, whispers, lunging shadows). World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (truth/closure vs. fear and supernatural threat), with one meaningful tightening as whispers become screams and shadows lunge. The decisive turn—choosing to insert and turn the wheel—resolves the conflict. However, the price paid feels relatively light; danger is felt but not deeply exacting. Tension rises but doesn’t force a hard trade‑off beyond pressing through fear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of belief vs. skepticism and inherited stories emerge organically from action and objects. The final image reweights the father’s “madness” as a truth with emotional consequences for Mara. Some lines verge on tidy affirmation (“She had found her truth”), limiting lingering ambiguity. Subtext exists but is not especially layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and controlled; free indirect texture holds with no head‑hopping. Diction is mostly apt, though a few phrases lean generic or familiar (“shadows that danced like spectral figures”). Rhythm modulates with pressure without artifacting. No dialogue, but the narrative voice remains coherent and character‑filtered.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean and purposeful with solid sensory economy. Minor clichés and explanatory scaffold in the backstory passages slightly dull edge and momentum. Syntax varies and carries the scene without loops or muddled metaphors. The final line is serviceable but not texturally surprising.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The “haunted machinery freed by a key” frame is familiar, but the beaded valve wheel and talk‑radio‑psychic breadcrumbing add some specificity. The tunnel atmosphere and tactile engagement freshen the trope modestly. The resolution lands cleanly but safely. Overall, competent rather than truly inventive.</comment>
