<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The guardian’s motive is clear and consistent, and their tactic—silent attention and shutter‑weaving—aligns with it. Interiority remains sparse; the guardian’s inner contradictions and felt costs are implied rather than dramatized. The stranger’s confession supplies emotional texture, but their specificity is limited. The closing nod and lightened shoulders suggest an earned, quiet shift without deepened complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the patterned shutter work builds to a constellation image that reweights the scene. Orientation is clear early (dock, rain, twilight, two characters), and the single scene stays coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (hope flicker via mirror), though cost is gentle rather than sharp. Beat sequence tightens from approach → listening → confession → completed pattern → release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dock after rain, the shutters, and the dental mirror are tactile and purposeful, feeding tone and the final image. Environmental tools (shutters) genuinely shape method and outcome, not mere backdrop. Sensory detail is selective and cohesive, especially the damp wood and faint glow. The closing constellation pattern reads as place‑charged rather than generic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but legible: can the guardian transmute the stranger’s darkness into a flicker of light. Escalation is a steady density increase—motion of shutters, the stranger’s approach and confession—culminating in the completed pattern. The price is understated (guardian’s self‑effacement and labor toward a modest change); no hard foreclosed path is articulated. Still, the cadence shift at the final shutter click qualifies.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motifs (mirror, shutters, stars/darkness) earn resonance in a non‑didactic final image. The explicit statement of purpose (“teach darkness the value of stars”) edges toward thesis, but the ending shows rather than tells. Subtext in silence and arrangement does the thematic work. The piece resists neat moralizing while offering a quiet answer: pattern and attention can reweight despair.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the observant distance of the guardian. Dialogue is minimal but natural and subtextual. Diction stays coherent; image patterns are taught and maintained. No head‑hopping or stance slippage undermines legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and musical, with strong image economy and few redundancies. A few phrases flirt with purple (“spiralingly calm,” “stillwater tension”), but they don’t obscure sense or momentum. Sentences vary and carry scene and mood concurrently. The final image is crisp and unblurred by over‑stacked metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The guardian’s craft—quietly weaving light with shutters, using a dental mirror as moral instrument—is fresh and memorable. The synthesis feels organic rather than gimmicky. While the emotional arc is familiar (despair to hope), its delivery system is distinctive. Risk is modest but coherent and well executed.</comment>
