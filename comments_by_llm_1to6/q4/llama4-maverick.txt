  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (resilience, transformation) using symbolism (bee pin), but relies heavily on stating emotions ("Emma felt...") rather than showing them. The central conflict is purely internal and resolved too neatly. The jarring timeframe element significantly undermines the overall craft.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story effectively uses the cameo as a symbol for individuality against conformity, establishing a clear theme. Imagery related to the miniature world is present. However, the 'cracks in the façade' concept remains abstract and isn't fully explored or integrated. The emotional impact relies heavily on stated reverence rather than deeply earned feeling, and the overall craft feels competent but not exceptional or particularly memorable.

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=4.2)
    While attempting symbolism (key, maps) and a theme of redemption, the execution relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion ("felt an unshakeable sense of purpose"). The central conflict is present but resolved too neatly, and the potentially intriguing "luminous doubt" concept is poorly articulated, limiting deeper impact.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story demonstrates competent descriptive writing and imagery ("tangling branches," "moon paths"). However, it lacks significant emotional impact or subtext. The central conflict is vague ("cosmic deception"), tension is minimal, and the ending is unsatisfying. The writing occasionally leans towards ornate phrasing ("dour amusement") without sufficient payoff.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story heavily relies on telling ("hopes evolving," "fearsome demeanor softening," "felt pride") rather than showing. Repetitive phrasing, particularly around "evolving hopes," undermines stylistic quality. The theme of unity is delivered explicitly, lacking subtlety or subtext. The overall impact is superficial, failing to evoke genuine emotion or deep thought.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central metaphor (unraveling net = unraveling fears) is overly explicit and lacks subtlety. While attempting symbolism, the execution feels superficial. The story relies heavily on stating emotions ("felt a strange sense of calm," "felt a sense of triumph") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought. The ending provides resolution but feels unearned and simplistic.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (beauty in regret, transformation) and uses symbolism (knocker, reflection, pattern). However, the execution relies on telling emotions ("he felt a sense of peace") and the central epiphany lacks sufficient grounding, lessening the overall impact. Language sometimes borders on melodrama ("joyful agony," "thousand sorrows").

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=2.9)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a jolt," "sense of purpose," "felt a sense of peace") rather than showing. Symbolism is present but underdeveloped. The core theme ('midnight only lasts so long') is explicitly stated, lacking subtlety. The ending feels unearned due to the narrative shortcuts (diary exposition). Central conflict resolution feels external and convenient, lacking impact.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (chest, recipes) and theme (forgiveness, redemption), but the execution is heavy-handed, relying on telling ("began to see parallels," "thoughts turned to the true enemy") rather than showing. Emotional impact is limited as the internal change feels asserted, not earned. The central conflict is stated rather than dramatized effectively.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions and motivations ("I felt an inexplicable connection," "I realized"). Literary devices like 'bitter honey' and 'insect symphony hall' are overused. The theme of finding purpose feels underdeveloped and the resolution unearned. The central conflict with the saboteur appears abruptly and resolves too neatly.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story attempts subtext with the contrast between calming the crowd and the "coy malevolence," creating some tension. Literary devices ("tapestry of fate") are employed, but verge on cliché. The central conflict is clear but resolved somewhat simplistically. The story 'tells' more than it 'shows,' particularly regarding the character's internal state and the rationale behind the method.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotions ("sullen," "spark of zest," "sense of borrowed valor," "sense of hope"). Metaphors (stamps, quilt) are central but explicitly explained, lacking subtlety. The theme of transformation via forgotten objects is clear but delivered heavy-handedly. The overall impact is diminished by the lack of nuanced emotional development and reliance on stating the intended meaning.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story attempts symbolism (mitten, altars) but lacks subtlety. Emotional impact is diminished by telling ("felt an unusual warmth") rather than showing. The central conflict (internal shift) is underdeveloped. While a theme of connection/creativity emerges, it feels imposed upon the narrative rather than organically arising from it. The craft suffers from generic phrasing and a lack of evocative detail.

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts symbolism (patch, unity), but the execution lacks depth and subtext. Emotional impact is muted due to reliance on stating feelings ("serene anger," "pride") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought. The central conflict is internal but lacks significant tension.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story presents a unique juxtaposition of elements (assassin, clocks, eulogies) and uses some decent imagery. However, it relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotions and motivations ("finding solace," "conflicted nature"). The central conflict is purely internal and lacks tension. The theme of finding purpose through craft is present but not explored with significant depth or nuance. The ending feels abrupt rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism ("seeds of vigilance," snowflake) but applies it heavy-handedly, repeatedly stating themes rather than showing them. Emotional impact is limited due to the abrupt character shift and stated emotions ("mournful elation"). The central conflict is weak, and the resolution feels unearned. Relies heavily on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=2.5)
    Over-reliance on stating abstract emotions and concepts ("sense of purpose," "exultant grief") weakens impact; lacks stylistic distinction and employs a clichéd central metaphor, failing to 'show' effectively.

  * grade_story_113.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (healing collective trauma, fragility of time) and uses symbolism (plush, tapestry). However, the execution relies heavily on stating emotions and intentions ('she felt,' 'she hoped,' 'she knew') rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal monologue, limiting the overall impact and subtextual richness.

  * grade_story_115.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (reconciliation, hope), but relies too much on explicitly stating these themes and the character's feelings ("reminder that even...", "sense of hope and trepidation"). The symbolism of the mask is overt. While competently written, the craft lacks subtlety and fails to evoke strong emotional resonance primarily through showing. The central conflict is present but lacks sharp definition and impactful development within the word count.

  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (frames, grinder, river), but the abstract connections and underdeveloped logic prevent significant emotional resonance or subtext. It relies heavily on telling ("apathy seemed to dissipate," "enthusiasm grew") rather than showing. The central conflict's resolution feels simplistic and unearned.

  * grade_story_116.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (memory, order vs. chaos) and uses symbolism (watch band, map). However, the impact is lessened by telling rather than showing emotion and motivation. The central conflict is internal but lacks sharp tension. While crafted, it doesn't achieve significant emotional resonance or leave a truly memorable impression.

  * grade_story_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    Attempts symbolism (charger, wax) but feels somewhat superficial. The unique perspective (hive-mind therapist) isn't leveraged effectively. The theme of past/present connection is stated but lacks depth. The client's transformation feels told ("eyes grew brighter") rather than shown convincingly. The central conflict resolution is too neat and lacks emotional weight.

  * grade_story_117.txt (grade=3.2)
    The writing style suffers from repetitive, slightly pretentious phrasing ("wisely foolish," "earnest absurdity," "mosaic realities"). The central theme of self-expression is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically from the narrative. Relies heavily on telling over showing, particularly regarding the character's internal state and the significance of events.

  * grade_story_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    Relies heavily on abstract pronouncements ('language of the soul', 'uncharted territories of the human heart') rather than showing. Metaphors are often familiar ('lapping waves', 'wove a tapestry'). The central conflict is internal and resolved too easily via a sudden realization. Lacks subtext.

  * grade_story_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding trauma and coping, utilizing symbolism (lure, nest). However, the impact is diluted by the inconsistent tone and setting. While showing potential for subtext, the execution relies too heavily on stating emotions and motivations ("baptize my nightmares in acceptance"). The central conflict is internal but lacks sharp focus due to external inconsistencies.

  * grade_story_119.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions and motivations ("My motivation was clear," "I felt a sense of peace") rather than showing them through action or specific detail. Literary devices are present but unremarkable. The central conflict (processing the revelation) lacks specificity and tension, resulting in limited emotional impact or thematic depth beyond surface statements.

  * grade_story_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story attempts thematic depth (failure, redemption, beauty in the overlooked) and uses symbolism (microscope, drive-in). However, it relies heavily on stating emotions ("anguished joy," "spark of hope") rather than showing them through action or nuanced description. The writing style occasionally becomes overwrought ("crucible for his quest"), hindering genuine emotional impact. The central conflict is internal but lacks sharp definition.

  * grade_story_122.txt (grade=4.8)
    While there's some evocative imagery (prism rainbow, light dancing), the story relies heavily on telling emotions ("euphoric agitation grew") rather than showing them. The theme ('mirage of safety') is explicitly stated multiple times, lacking subtlety and subtext. The central conflict is clear but resolved somewhat predictably.

  * grade_story_13.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (journey as wisdom) and uses some imagery (poems etching path), but the overall impact is muted by a predictable theme and a lack of deep subtext. The central conflict (finding the garden) is clear but resolved simply. It leans more towards telling emotions ("solemn," "mild fervor") than showing them effectively.

  * grade_story_126.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (churn, poster, tree) and explores existential themes, but the impact is significantly weakened by the implausible ascension mechanism. It relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt an overwhelming urge," "thrilled and terrified," "felt an aloof passion") rather than showing them through concrete actions or sensory details. The central conflict's resolution feels arbitrary due to the flawed method.

  * grade_story_129.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth ("arc of empathy") but relies heavily on telling rather than showing. The central conflict is split between the abstract generational curses and the sudden, physical threat of the torpedo, diluting focus. The ending feels abrupt, offering possibility without sufficient narrative grounding.

  * grade_story_128.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story heavily relies on telling rather than showing, repeatedly stating the theme ("power of storytelling") instead of demonstrating it subtly. While symbolism (fading photo, recipe) is attempted, its execution is overt. The central conflict is internal and vague, lacking tension. The ending feels more like a statement of theme than a satisfying narrative resolution.

  * grade_story_124.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (loom, shoes) but lacks subtlety. The writing relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt an incremental sense of calm") rather than showing. The central conflict is internal but resolved too easily via mystical means. The theme of reconnection is present but delivered without nuance. Use of "rustic refinement" is repetitive.

  * grade_story_125.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("excitement grew," "felt a sense of purpose") rather than showing them through nuanced action or description. While symbolism (doll head) is present, it lacks depth. The central conflict (internal limitation) is overshadowed by the external plot mechanics, weakening the overall impact and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions ("felt an overwhelming urge," "felt a sense of resolve") rather than consistently showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The gauntlet as a symbol is clear but lacks subtlety. While a theme of reconciliation exists, its exploration is surface-level due to the abrupt character shift and lack of detail regarding the past betrayal. The central conflict's resolution feels unearned.

  * grade_story_123.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story aims for thematic resonance (renewal, rediscovery) but achieves limited emotional impact due to thin characterization and reliance on telling. Literary devices like "starlit conversations" are used but feel underdeveloped and slightly forced. The central conflict (brewer vs. decay/lost knowledge) lacks significant tension. The ending provides closure but feels predictable. The craft suffers from repetitive phrasing and a lack of subtext.

  * grade_story_133.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies heavily on telling ("delightfully menacing," "drawn to her demure audacity") rather than showing. Symbolism (gloves, throne) is present but lacks subtlety. The central conflict emerges abruptly and the resolution (alliance) feels unearned. The overall impact is diminished by weak character logic and plot convenience.

  * grade_story_132.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., "felt a sense of resolve"). Symbolism (ticket stub) is present but somewhat heavy-handed.

Overall impact is minimal.

  * grade_story_130.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (nest, blooming) and thematic depth (journey, self-acceptance), but the execution lacks subtlety. Emotional impact relies heavily on stated feelings ("felt their sense of disconnection," "heart full of hope") rather than showing. The central conflict is purely internal and resolved too neatly via the external device (phone). The writing style occasionally uses strong imagery ("sails billowing like a cosmic cloak") but also dips into cliché ("bud bursting into bloom," "stars twinkled like diamonds").

  * grade_story_134.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story uses some standard fantasy imagery (river of fire, crystals like eyes) and builds tension towards the ending. The internal conflict (allure vs. danger) is present but relies heavily on stating emotions ("exhilarating and terrifying") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal monologue. The theme of dangerous knowledge is clear but lacks subtlety or a unique perspective.

  * grade_story_131.txt (grade=3.5)
    Relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the character's emotional shift. The central metaphor (cleaning = emotional sorting) is obvious and lacks subtlety. The resolution feels unearned and predictable.

  * grade_story_136.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on explicitly stating emotions ('felt a surge of painful joy') rather than evoking them through nuanced action, subtext, or sensory detail. While atmospheric, the central conflict remains vague, and the overall craft lacks the sharpness and depth required for high-impact storytelling.

  * grade_story_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a consistent mood and uses evocative imagery ('mist-shrouded sanctuary', 'tendrils curling'). The central theme of rediscovering connection is clear. However, the emotional impact relies partly on stated feelings ('mix of sorrow and joy') rather than purely showing, and the conflict resolution feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_138.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story heavily relies on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating the motivation, the theme's relevance, the character's resolve). Symbolism (drone as candor) is asserted rather than earned. The central theme ("candor in small moments") is repeatedly hammered home explicitly, lacking subtlety or subtext. The ending provides a sense of resolution for the character, but it feels unearned because the process (reassembling stubs) lacks demonstrated significance.

  * grade_story_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    Attempts symbolism (tides, candle) and explores themes of fate/chance, but relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt the weight," "felt a sense of resolve") rather than showing. The "laughing tears" concept is intriguing but underdeveloped. The central conflict is internal and somewhat vague. Writing style borders on overwrought ("oblivion that seemed to beckon him").

  * grade_story_141.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story aims for depth (transcendence, wisdom) but achieves little emotional resonance or subtext due to telling over showing ("Emilia felt," "Emilia knew"). Literary devices are present (symbols, notebook as talisman) but lack originality. The ending declares a transformation rather than illustrating it convincingly. The central conflict is internal but remains underdeveloped. The theme of "women's wisdom" is named but unexplored.

  * grade_story_135.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story effectively uses symbolism (straw, caravans) and establishes a clear theme of cultural/linguistic preservation. However, the impact is lessened by the weak character arc and minimal plot tension. The craft is competent, but lacks the narrative drive and emotional resonance expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_140.txt (grade=4.5)
    Relies heavily on the doll as an overt symbol. The theme of confronting the unknown is explicitly stated rather than subtly woven. Emotional impact is lessened by the rapid, somewhat unearned resolution. Shows potential with imagery but hampered by telling over showing emotional states.

  * grade_story_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies heavily on stating internal states ("turmoil within me," "felt a strange sense of clarity") rather than showing them. Imagery is present but often cliché (legacy as weight, peak as clarity). The central conflict is internal but lacks nuance. The ending feels unearned and overly neat ("reborn").

  * grade_story_139.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story relies heavily on stating abstract concepts ("harvesting the past," "dark reflection") rather than showing them through concrete action or believable internal processing. The central conflict is vague, and the method for resolution (flute analysis) lacks credibility, hindering emotional impact and subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_143.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (keys, regrowth, lavender) but relies heavily on explicitly stating the theme and emotions ('fearful joy', 'hope', 'renewal') rather than evoking them through nuanced action or subtext ('show, don't tell' principle is weak). The ending provides closure but lacks profound impact or lingering questions.

  * grade_story_145.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts literary craft (metaphors like pipes as veins, symbolism of the rosebud) but often states themes ('kindle empathy') rather than showing them. The central conflict is internal and vague. The ending feels unearned and abrupt. The 'fantasy practicality' tone appears only as a label at the very end, not woven throughout. Subtext is attempted but remains murky due to the disjointed plot logic.

  * grade_story_144.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (food as peace, log flume as connection), but the execution is heavy-handed. The central conflict (interdimensional war) remains distant and abstract. While aiming for emotional impact (hope), it relies more on stating outcomes ("newfound determination") than showing the process. The theme is clear but lacks nuance.

  * grade_story_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    Relies heavily on abstract concepts ("glimmering transitions," "expectant energy") and telling rather than showing ("filled them with a sense of delight"). Symbolism (the flower) is overt. The central conflict is internal and vaguely defined, lacking immediate tension.

  * grade_story_147.txt (grade=3.5)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a sense of pride") rather than showing. Imagery is present but often generic ("ghostly presence"). The central conflict (explorer vs. secrets/past failures) is clear but resolved too easily. Lacks significant subtext or memorable impact.

  * grade_story_150.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (fate vs. free will) but relies excessively on telling ("he felt," "he knew") rather than showing. Literary devices are present but sometimes feel forced (e.g., "saturated ambivalence"). The central conflict is introduced but resolved too neatly ("In that moment, the poet knew..."). The ending declares significance rather than earning it through preceding narrative weight.

  * grade_story_148.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating the metaphors (tapestry=turmoil, carousel=self-restoration). The symbolism is overt and lacks subtlety. The central conflict feels manufactured, and the resolution arrives too neatly without sufficient development. The theme of inner strength and rediscovery is clear but presented without nuance.

  * grade_story_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story touches on themes of truth and uncertainty, prompting mild reflection. Some literary devices are used ("labyrinthine repository," "gemstone"), but the overall craft lacks depth. The central conflict is internal and resolved somewhat predictably. The ending provides thematic closure but lacks strong emotional impact. 'Peaceful anger' is told, not shown, weakening its effect.

  * grade_story_151.txt (grade=3.5)
    Symbolism (snowflake, veil, idol) is heavily employed but feels overt rather than subtle. The central conflict's resolution is abstract and lacks impact because the mechanism is unbelievable. While aiming for a theme of rational hope, the story primarily tells rather than shows, and the lack of credible plot mechanics prevents deeper meaning or resonance.

  * grade_story_15.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story uses symbolism effectively (forge as hope/resistance) and evokes a gentle, hopeful mood. However, the theme of "defying the gods" feels overstated compared to the narrative's focus. Emotional impact relies more on stated feelings than deeply shown experiences. The craft is competent but lacks exceptional flair or subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_152.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (juggler as preserver, cultural bridges), but the execution is heavy-handed. The language often strains for lyricism ("mesmerizing dance," "rich tapestry") without achieving genuine depth or subtext. The central conflict resolution feels overly convenient.

  * grade_story_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (rebirth, hidden meanings) but relies heavily on abstract, repeated phrases ("colors of the unforeseen," "fractal sorrow") that diminish impact and feel like stylistic tics. Literary devices are present but lack subtlety. The central conflict is vague (internal/metaphysical struggle to decipher/initiate). The ending provides closure to the immediate scene but lacks significant emotional resonance due to the abstract execution and underdeveloped character.

  * grade_story_154.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism with the "strands of courage" and the ink pot, but the execution is heavy-handed. Emotional impact is significantly weakened by relying on explicitly stating feelings ("felt fear", "felt belonging") rather than showing them through action, internal monologue, or subtle description ('show, don't tell' principle violated). The theme of community connection is present but presented superficially. The central conflict lacks compelling tension.

  * grade_story_155.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling ("I felt the power coursing through me") rather than showing. Literary devices feel forced and overly reliant on abstract concepts ('fabric of reality', 'potent elixir'). The central conflict is ill-defined beyond wanting power. The ending feels like a statement of intent rather than a resolution or impactful culmination. Lacks subtext.

  * grade_story_156.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (birds, key), but relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the abstract concepts ('counterpoint of hearts', 'evolutionary wisdom') and emotions. The central conflict is internal confusion, resolved too neatly by an unearned epiphany. Repetitive phrasing ('joyfully tragic', 'counterpoint of hearts') undermines the craft and impact.

  * grade_story_160.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies heavily on stating themes ("wilderness wisdom," "defy finality") rather than showing them emerge organically; symbolism (goggles) is explicitly declared, reducing impact; lacks subtext and genuine emotional resonance beyond surface-level curiosity.

  * grade_story_157.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story suffers from repetitive phrasing ("absurd solemnity," "seeds of curiosity," "plain ring") which diminishes impact and suggests a lack of stylistic finesse.

  * grade_story_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (harmony vs. chaos, shared secrets) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Literary devices are present but not exceptionally striking. The central conflict (deciphering the blueprint) resolves neatly, but the emotional impact is muted due to underdeveloped characterisation and motivation.

  * grade_story_16.txt (grade=3.0)
    Impact is mild, primarily atmospheric. Craft is competent but relies heavily on description over compelling narrative action or character insight.

  * grade_story_153.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (headlamp) and thematic depth (knowledge vs. darkness), but the execution is often heavy-handed ("mundanely glorious," "detached devotion" stated repeatedly). Emotional impact is minimal due to the detached tone and lack of showing vs. telling. The ending feels abrupt rather than purposefully resonant. Central conflict is internal and lacks urgency.

  * grade_story_161.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions ("I felt...") rather than showing them. Symbolism (seal, patterns) is present but lacks depth. The central conflict remains ill-defined, diminishing the impact of its supposed resolution and the intended theme of overcoming tragedy.

  * grade_story_159.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story attempts symbolism (kaleidoscope, labyrinth) but lacks depth and subtext. The central conflict (solving the labyrinth, overcoming betrayal) is stated but lacks tension or meaningful development. The ending is unsatisfying as the "answer" remains abstract.

The craft shows potential in imagery but falters in narrative cohesion and emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_163.txt (grade=3.0)
    Relies heavily on telling ("she felt," "determination growing") rather than showing. Metaphors (clouds, celestial bodies) are present but feel somewhat overwrought and obvious. The central theme of unification is stated repeatedly but lacks subtext or emotional depth earned through character experience.

  * grade_story_165.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions ('joyful terror coursed', 'knew that their search for justice had been fulfilled') rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought. Symbolism (butterfly, garden) is present but conventional. The theme of 'justice' is asserted rather than explored, lacking subtext or depth. The writing craft is functional but lacks a distinctive voice or impactful literary devices beyond basic imagery.

  * grade_story_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story uses imagery and symbolism effectively around the core concept, but the impact is lessened by inconsistent character tone and underdeveloped magical mechanics. The theme is clear but execution lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (coil, well, "unspoken heart") but relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt trepidation," "felt compelled," "felt a sense of resolution") rather than showing.

  * grade_story_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts emotional resonance and uses symbolism (sewing kit = mending self), but the impact is weakened by cliché phrasing ("hollow echoes of shame," "symphony of healing") and telling rather than showing emotion ("Luna felt a sense of peace"). The central conflict (internal doubt/shame) is resolved too easily via the vaguely described 'wisdom' in the letters. The theme of ancestral healing is present but lacks depth due to the narrative's superficial treatment of the core problem.

  * grade_story_169.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts a unique perspective but struggles with impact. The core concept (persuasion via hidden stories) is stated repeatedly but not effectively shown through compelling narrative or character interaction. Literary devices feel somewhat superficial, and the lack of concrete conflict or stakes prevents emotional resonance. The theme of uncovering hidden truths is present but underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks significant emotional impact or intellectual depth. While imagery is present, the central theme ("weaving fate") is underdeveloped and relies on telling rather than showing.

The writing style is competent but repetitive ("gentle chaos," "solemnly silly," "weaving through fate") and lacks a strong authorial voice or subtext.

  * grade_story_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story introduces potentially interesting concepts ("watcher's burden," "polite anarchy") but explores them superficially through summary rather than showing them through interaction or internal thought.

  * grade_story_171.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (connection vs. obsession, hidden beauty) and uses symbolism (garnet, sign), but relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("Ezra felt an instant connection," "their bond grew stronger," "felt a sense of bold vulnerability"). The central conflict shifts from an external/internal quest (garnet/magic) to an interpersonal connection, resolved too neatly. Lacks significant subtext or emotional resonance achieved through craft.

  * grade_story_17.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions and the significance of symbols (the bowl) rather than showing them through action or nuanced description, significantly weakening its impact. While a theme of self-forgiveness is present, the craft lacks subtlety and subtext within the narrative itself (despite mentioning subtext in eulogies). The central conflict is internal but resolved too neatly and explicitly.

  * grade_story_172.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_18.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (statue as truth-seeker, hair tie as connection, light as recognition), but relies heavily on explicitly stating themes and emotions ("tragically joyful," "testament to the power of truth") rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The central conflict is internal and lacks dynamism, resulting in limited emotional impact.

  * grade_story_174.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story states its themes (ephemeral beauty, correcting regret) rather than exploring them with subtlety. Literary devices are present (frost as canvas) but often feel explained rather than integrated. Emotional impact is minimal due to telling ("felt a sense of satisfaction") rather than showing. The central conflict (internal regret) is resolved too easily via the convenient book discovery, lacking satisfying tension or depth.

  * grade_story_178.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (stamps as catalysts) but lacks subtlety. Emotional impact relies on stating feelings ("felt a sense of dissonant calm," "felt her burden lifting") rather than showing. The central conflict (disease) is introduced too late to build effective tension within the word count. The ending declares transformation rather than demonstrating it convincingly.

  * grade_story_180.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions ("I felt remorse," "I felt a sense of purpose") rather than showing them.

  * grade_story_177.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (art vs. oppression) and uses literary devices (symbolism of the mask), but relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion and significance ("I knew," "I felt"). The style often veers into purple prose, hindering impact. The ending feels rushed and overly declarative, lacking subtlety and satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_175.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story effectively uses symbolism (sign, birdcage) to explore the theme of transience and crumbling illusions, prompting some reflection. However, the impact is diminished by repetitive phrasing and a lack of narrative tension. The central conflict (minstrel's hidden motive vs. village's ignorance) is present but underdeveloped. The ending feels somewhat predictable (minstrel moves on). Showing is often replaced by telling (e.g., stating the minstrel's motivation, the villagers' entrancement).

  * grade_story_181.txt (grade=1.5)
    The story relies heavily on stating significance ("life-changing," "weight of history," "undying creativity") rather than showing it.

The ending resolves the immediate scene but ignores the narrative disruption caused by the unexplained kiss.

  * grade_story_176.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story attempts thematic depth (transformation, compassion) and uses symbolism (map, garden), but the impact is diluted by telling rather than showing emotion and by the abrupt, unearned character shift.

The 'flippant solemnity' tone feels more asserted than achieved, resulting in slightly overwrought prose rather than genuine impact.

  * grade_story_191.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (spectacles, seeds, broken pieces) and explores themes of renewal, but relies too much on stating emotions ("felt a sense of clarity," "felt a sense of stillness") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal monologue. The 'corroded rapture' concept is intriguing but underdeveloped in the prose.

  * grade_story_187.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts subtext regarding truth and ritual ("necessary lies"), but it remains underdeveloped. Imagery ("serpent trail") is present, but the overall impact is muted by slightly overwritten prose ("brash tenderness") and a lack of profound emotional resonance or a truly satisfying resolution to the introduced tension.

  * grade_story_190.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding empathy but relies heavily on telling the reader about the narrator's internal shift ("I felt a shift," "I began to realize") rather than showing it through nuanced action or reflection.

Symbolism (butterfly) is present but lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_194.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (ossuary = transformation) but executes it heavy-handedly. Literary devices feel sparse or forced.

The ending feels unearned.

  * grade_story_198.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("felt the weight... lifting," stating the wheel is a "testament"). Symbolism (wheel, veil, sun trails) is overt and lacks subtlety. The central conflict resolves too neatly via the symbolic action. While a theme of truth/perseverance is clear, it's stated explicitly rather than emerging organically. The writing style is hampered by repetition, preventing significant impact or subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_197.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts evocative imagery (Yggdrasil, dancing words) and hints at subtext regarding hidden fears, but the overall impact is muted by the underdeveloped character and plot logic. The central conflict (completing the lullaby) is clear but lacks significant tension. The ending provides closure but feels somewhat unearned due to the narrative's thinness.

  * grade_story_199.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts mystery and wonder but relies on explicitly stating emotions ("surge of excitement," "trepidation and anticipation") rather than showing them effectively. The notebook gaining energy is a standard trope. While there's a clear conflict (uncovering the secret), the resolution feels abrupt and the "journey begins" ending lacks impact. Subtext is minimal; the theme of hidden magic is presented straightforwardly.

  * grade_story_20.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on the central metaphor ('bridge of regret') but struggles with execution. Much of the emotional journey is told rather than shown ("felt a sense of resolve wash over them"). The ending feels overly neat and declarative ("knew that they had finally found a way..."). While there's a clear conflict (internal regret), its resolution lacks nuance and impact. The theme of transformation is present but handled superficially.

  * grade_story_2.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (scent, horseshoe) but lacks subtlety and clear meaning, particularly the scent element. It relies heavily on stating emotions ("I felt...") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought, weakening the impact. The central conflict (skepticism vs. belief) is resolved instantly and unconvincingly. The ending feels predictable and unearned given the weak development.

  * grade_story_200.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies heavily on telling ("felt," "began to dawn," "gave way to determination") rather than showing. Literary devices are present but often feel overwrought ("symphony of discovery"). The central conflict resolves too easily, and the intended subtext about hope/ruin lacks depth. Impact is muted by cliché phrasing.

  * grade_story_202.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story struggles to evoke a strong emotional response or intellectual engagement due to the opaque motivation and underdeveloped character. Literary devices are used (similes like 'shard of starlight'), but repetition of phrases like 'edges of gravity' and 'code of instinct' diminishes their impact. The central conflict lacks clear stakes, and the ending feels abrupt and unsatisfyingly ambiguous, mistaking vagueness for profundity. The theme is indiscernible. There's more telling ('felt the edges of gravity growing more defined') than showing.

  * grade_story_203.txt (grade=4.8)
    While containing some evocative imagery ("graveyard of steel," "defiant hush"), the story relies heavily on stating emotions and themes ("inheritance of lies," "newfound sense of purpose") rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The central conflict is present but resolved superficially.

  * grade_story_201.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions ("felt an overwhelming urge," "felt a sense of purpose," "felt the emotional inheritance... begin to shift") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought. The central conflict resolution feels unearned due to the vague mechanism. While some imagery is used, the overall impact is weakened by telling over showing and a lack of subtext.

  * grade_story_205.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating determination, cynicism, confidence). While there's imagery, the overall impact is weakened by a lack of subtext and underdeveloped themes. The central conflict (safeguarding the secret) is clear but resolved predictably. The "peaceful frenzy" tone is asserted more than achieved.

  * grade_story_210.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (lore/dreams) and uses imagery, but the execution lacks subtlety. The central conflict (deciphering the code) resolves predictably. The language sometimes veers into cliché ("fabric of reality," "maelstrom of sound").

  * grade_story_207.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies heavily on symbolism (flowers representing fragmented past/forgiveness), but this feels somewhat overt. It explicitly states the character's emotions ("felt a sense of joyful loneliness," "heart swelled") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal monologue ('telling' over 'showing'). The central conflict (the oath) remains too abstract to generate significant tension. The theme of redemption is clear but handled superficially; the ending feels abrupt and emotionally unearned.

  * grade_story_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling the reader the theme ("the price of revenge was not just blood, but the erosion of identity") rather than showing it through compelling action or character arc. Symbolism (tassel) is present but overt. The central conflict remains abstract and internal, lacking tangible stakes or development within the narrative.

  * grade_story_204.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt nervousness," "sense of peace") rather than showing them through action or subtle detail. Symbolism (hangar=decay, punch=past) is present but overly direct and lacks subtlety. The central conflict is clear but resolved too neatly, diminishing impact. The theme of overcoming prejudice is evident but handled superficially.

  * grade_story_209.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion ("despairing cheer," "excitement mixed with trepidation," "sadness and hope"). Literary devices are sparse and lack subtlety (e.g., the hairbrush symbolism is explicitly stated). The central conflict is minimal (task completion), and the potentially deeper themes (buried stories, honesty) are mentioned but not explored with any nuance or subtext, resulting in low overall impact.

  * grade_story_212.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story attempts symbolism (seeds, boundaries, messages) but applies it heavily and repetitively ("song of boundaries"). It relies more on stating emotions ("spirit soared") than showing them. The central conflict (internal resilience against past oppression) is present but lacks depth. The theme of self-definition is clear but delivered without subtlety. Repetitive phrasing ("testament to," "raw solace") weakens the craft.

  * grade_story_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (regret, time, absurdity) but relies heavily on stating these themes ("backlash of regrets," "cosmic absurdity," "joyful despair") rather than evoking them subtly. Literary devices are present (pen as symbol) but lack originality. The central conflict is internal but resolved too quickly and neatly. The ending feels somewhat unearned, lacking profound impact despite gesturing towards it. Showing is often replaced by telling.

  * grade_story_206.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("ardent scorn," "unyielding spirit," "blazed with triumph") rather than showing them through nuanced action or description. Symbolism (candy, locket) is present but lacks subtlety. The ending feels abrupt, resolving multiple large conflicts (regime crumbling, vendetta sated, continent found) too rapidly and conveniently.

  * grade_story_211.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts symbolism (diary, schoolhouse) and uses some evocative phrases ("gravity of hopelessness," "cheerful despair"). However, the impact is significantly weakened by the illogical plot progression and reliance on telling rather than showing (e.g., sensing corruption, faces etched with hardship). The central conflict (corruption of power) is introduced but never meaningfully addressed or resolved by the character's actions. The ending feels unearned.

  * grade_story_213.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (clip = past, sunrise = future) and explores the theme of stories shaping reality. However, it relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt an overwhelming urge," "felt a surge of determination") rather than showing. The central conflict emerges, but its resolution via the public destruction feels unearned and performative. The writing style includes some awkward or clichéd phrasing ("delightfully strange significance," "primal sophistication").

  * grade_story_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (knife, stone heart) but relies heavily on stating the theme ('art of adaptation') and emotional shifts ('heart... fluttered') rather than showing them through nuanced action or interaction. The ending provides closure but lacks profound impact due to the underdeveloped transformation. Central conflict is internal and resolution feels asserted.

  * grade_story_214.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on stating abstract concepts ("black hole of doubt," "upside of loss") rather than showing them through nuanced action or feeling. Literary devices are present but often heavy-handed ("silence was silently audible" is awkward) or cliché ("stars twinkled like diamonds"). Lacks significant emotional resonance or unique perspective.

  * grade_story_218.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions and themes ("felt an unexpected sense of belonging," "gift of belonging") rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. Symbolism (ticket, tower) is present but overly explicit. The central conflict's resolution feels simplistic.

  * grade_story_216.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts subtext regarding identity and uses some literary devices (metaphor, symbolism of the washer), but the impact is muted by underdeveloped character motivation and world-building. The central conflict feels primarily internal and abstract, lacking concrete stakes or resolution.

  * grade_story_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (power of stories, transformation) and uses metaphor effectively (labyrinth). However, it relies too heavily on telling rather than showing the protagonist's internal change and the story's emotional impact, weakening its overall resonance.

  * grade_story_215.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions and concepts ("rattled exorcist," "coy aggression," "sense of triumph") rather than showing them. The central conflict (solving the puzzle) is straightforward but lacks significant tension or stakes. The theme of 'entwining science and wonder' is declared but not deeply explored. Use of literary devices is minimal, and the ending feels abrupt and overly declarative.

  * grade_story_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies heavily on abstract metaphors (maze, topography, lotus) and stated emotions rather than showing them through concrete action or nuanced reaction. While aiming for depth and symbolism (husk, swan), the impact is muted by overly ornate language and a lack of tangible conflict or stakes. The theme of self-discovery is present but conveyed didactically.

  * grade_story_221.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story uses symbolism (amber) effectively and evokes a melancholic mood. However, the emotional impact is lessened by explicitly stating feelings ("thawing of my own heart," "joyfully melancholic nature stirred") rather than purely showing them. The central conflict is internal and resolved somewhat predictably. The writing craft shows competence but lacks the exceptional quality or subtext expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_222.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding the character's supposed compassion and the "calculated dreams" atmosphere.

The theme of compassion is stated but unexplored.

  * grade_story_225.txt (grade=4.2)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions ("eyes red", "excitement and trepidation", "deep sadness") rather than showing. Symbolism (butterflies = hope/love) is overt and explicitly stated, diminishing impact. The central conflict (war/internal struggle) remains underdeveloped background noise.

  * grade_story_22.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("She was perfectly flawed," "felt the weight of her ambition"). The central theme about flawed legends is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically. Emotional impact is minimal, and the ending feels like a premise for a longer work, lacking immediate satisfaction or profound subtext.

  * grade_story_224.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (ladle, meteorite) but relies heavily on telling emotions and states ("He felt," "He yearned," "He knew") rather than showing. Repeated phrases ("affirmed by silence," "gentle turmoil") weaken the craft. The central conflict is internal and resolved too easily via a simple touch, lacking depth.

  * grade_story_229.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding connection and memory, using symbolism (box, rain, graveyard). However, it relies heavily on stating emotions ("Tears mingled...", "I felt...") rather than showing them subtly. The central conflict (uncovering the past) is clear but resolved via a weak mechanism (rain patterns). The theme emerges but lacks nuanced delivery.

  * grade_story_223.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (orchid, mirror) but relies heavily on stating emotions and themes ('felt a surge of nostalgic defiance', 'wanted to know the truth') rather than showing them through action or nuanced description.

  * grade_story_226.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions and concepts ('craftsman's pride', 'haggard awe', 'sense of wonder') rather than showing them through action or subtext. Literary devices are present but lack subtlety (skull as symbol). The ending provides resolution but feels unearned due to the shallow exploration of conflict and character.

  * grade_story_230.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a sense of clarity," "felt a sense of excitement") rather than showing. The central conflict (opening the locket) is resolved, but the impact is lessened by the bizarre method and setting. Phrases like "hopeful brutality" and "precisely messy" feel like attempts at literary flair that land awkwardly and lack substantiation.

  * grade_story_232.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story attempts symbolism (cutlass, ancient vs. modern), but it feels somewhat heavy-handed. Literary devices are present but not exceptionally crafted. The central conflict is clear, but the resolution method (coffee grounds) undermines its seriousness. The theme of 'revisiting unfinished tales' is explicitly stated rather than subtly woven. It lacks significant subtext or emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_228.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions and significance (e.g., stating the clothespin is a symbol, stating her feelings). Symbolism is present but lacks subtlety.

Symbolism (hairpin, palace) is present but lacks subtlety. The central conflict is clear but resolved simplistically within the narrative scope. The theme of chaos/revolution is explicitly stated rather than explored with nuance. Overall impact is diminished by cliché phrasing ("shake the foundations," "course of history").

  * grade_story_23.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("she felt the universal systems begin to stir," "she knew that she was on the right path"). Emotional impact is muted due to abstract stakes and stated feelings. Literary devices are used ("trees like sentinels") but don't elevate the prose significantly. The central conflict (decay vs. renewal) is too vast and abstract for the small scale of the action presented.

  * grade_story_227.txt (grade=4.2)
    Relies heavily on stating emotions and intentions ("excitement grew," "sense of purpose") rather than showing them. Symbolism (timer, uprising) is clear but lacks subtlety. The central conflict is underdeveloped, and the ending feels abrupt rather than earned. Lacks significant subtext.

  * grade_story_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Attempts at symbolism (matchbox, universe in hand) feel heavy-handed. The central conflict is internal and resolved too easily via a convenient discovery. The theme of late blooming is explicitly stated rather than subtly explored, diminishing potential impact. Relies more on telling emotion ("felt a sense of peace") than showing.

  * grade_story_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (flowers, meteors, threads) and aims for subtext regarding connection. However, the impact is diluted by the logical flaw at its core. The central tension is minimal, relying on observation rather than conflict. 'Showing' is inconsistent; key concepts like 'distant intimacy' and motivation are often told directly.

  * grade_story_236.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (forge/heartbreak, dictionary/secrets) but lacks subtlety. The central conflict (the bargain) remains underdeveloped and lacks tension. Emotional impact is hampered by telling ("luminous regret") rather than showing. The theme of using pain as fuel is present but not explored with significant depth or nuance.

  * grade_story_233.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth ('seeds of understanding') but relies heavily on telling rather than showing ('summoner grasped the true nature'). Imagery is present but often generic ('ethereal light'). The central conflict (seeking knowledge) is clear but resolved too easily through the humming ritual, lacking significant tension or struggle. The ending provides closure but feels unearned given the shallow exploration.

  * grade_story_237.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (dice/destiny) and explores a theme of finding meaning in adversity. However, the emotional impact is muted due to reliance on stating emotions ("alarm bells of heartbreak," "strange sense of peace") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought. The writing craft is competent but lacks a distinctive voice or truly memorable imagery. The central conflict remains largely internal and lacks compelling external stakes within this snapshot.

  * grade_story_24.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on stating effects ("hearts beating," "succeeded in stirring") rather than showing them through nuanced action or description. While the core idea has potential, the craft suffers from underdeveloped symbolism and a lack of subtext.

  * grade_story_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding connection and narrative power, but relies too heavily on stating abstract concepts ("radiant shifts," "hidden patterns") rather than showing them organically. Literary devices are used, but the overall impact is hampered by a slightly overwrought style and a lack of genuine emotional resonance beyond surface-level descriptions of shared experience. The ending feels somewhat predictable for this type of narrative.

  * grade_story_238.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts symbolic depth ("transient realities," light/dark), but the execution feels heavy-handed and the central conflict remains murky. While atmospheric, the narrative impact is weakened by underdeveloped character motivation and a reliance on telling ("his motivation was clear") rather than showing. The ending feels abrupt and unearned.

  * grade_story_240.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding ambition and creation, using imagery related to the forest and the hammer. However, the writing style frequently slips into overly ornate language ("purple prose") that obscures rather than enhances meaning (e.g., "cadence that wove the very fabric of reality"). Emotional impact is hampered by telling ("awe and trepidation") rather than showing, and the vagueness of the central miracle prevents a truly satisfying or impactful conclusion.

  * grade_story_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ('felt a sense of calm,' 'blissful agony') rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. While some imagery is present, the overall craft lacks subtlety.

The theme is hinted at but underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_242.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story attempts thematic depth (connection, past/future) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Literary devices are present but sometimes feel ornate ("tangled skein," "subtle yet powerful spell").

  * grade_story_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story establishes tension and a clear conflict. The mural analysis provides some subtext about corruption. However, the writing relies heavily on stating emotions ("heart racing," "shivers down spine") rather than showing them, and the stated tone ("clear complexity") isn't reflected in the prose, which remains fairly straightforward.

  * grade_story_244.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("determination grew," "guilt lifting") rather than showing. While there's an attempt at symbolism (mask), the overall impact is muted, lacking significant emotional resonance or subtext. The central conflict is established but not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_248.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts symbolism (bird, fate) but struggles with emotional impact; "cheerless ecstasy" feels particularly forced and unclear.

The ending provides closure for the scene but lacks profound resonance.

  * grade_story_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (compact, bonsai, flows) but lacks subtlety, often stating the intended meaning directly ('felt a sense of clarity', 'knew that they had been given a gift'). The central conflict is internal and vague. While aiming for depth ('sacred flows'), the impact is muted by weak plot/character and reliance on telling over showing emotion. The 'joyful dread' tone is asserted but not convincingly evoked.

  * grade_story_245.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (chopstick, tea leaves) but lacks subtlety and depth. Literary devices feel self-conscious ("abstractly physical," "biting sincerity").

  * grade_story_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story uses polymerization as an interesting metaphor for transformation and breaking free, offering some subtext.

The central conflict is clear but its resolution feels underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts whimsy but lacks significant impact due to weak plot execution and underdeveloped conflict. While imagery exists (fountains, drill), the theme of 'resilience' is explicitly stated rather than shown through compelling struggle or character arc.

  * grade_story_25.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story aims for thematic depth regarding freedom but largely states its message rather than exploring it through compelling action or character development ('showing vs. telling' issue). Literary devices are present but lack subtlety, and the ending feels abrupt and unearned, diminishing overall impact.

  * grade_story_255.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (rain/truth) but lacks subtlety. The central conflict resolution (decryption via scent) is unconvincing, hindering impact.

  * grade_story_251.txt (grade=5.0)
    The central metaphor of defragmentation (puzzle/marbles) is the story's strongest aspect, offering some subtext about order and chaos. However, the narrative relies too much on stating emotions ("happily sad intensity") rather than showing them, and the grandiosity of the "final oath" feels unearned within the brief scope, limiting emotional impact and leaving the ending feeling abrupt.

  * grade_story_250.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions ("felt enthusiastically cautious," "heart quickened with anxious elation") rather than showing them through action or nuanced description. While the central conflict is clear, the resolution feels abrupt and the claimed "exhilarating and terrifying" nature of the solution isn't substantiated. Literary devices are present but lack subtlety or significant impact. Subtext is minimal.

  * grade_story_252.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story uses symbolism (block, crack, petals) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion ("penitent," "sense of peace"). The central conflict (mending the crack) is present but lacks immediacy due to the abstract method. While aiming for depth (redemption), the execution feels surface-level within the word count. The writing style sometimes leans towards cliché ("fabric of existence," "sands of time").

  * grade_story_256.txt (grade=2.5)
    While attempting literary devices (symbolism of the spoon, horizon), the execution is often heavy-handed or unclear (e.g., "frothy despair," "worshiped the soft edges of time").

The ending offers no satisfying resolution or impactful insight.

  * grade_story_257.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt an urge," "felt a sense," "felt wonder," "felt pride") rather than showing them through action or subtext.

The writing style leans towards slightly ornate but ultimately unimpactful prose.

  * grade_story_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (inkwell, star), but it feels heavy-handed. Emotional impact is limited by telling ("he felt") rather than showing.

Phrases like "maddening dance" and "unraveling tapestry" border on purple prose, hindering rather than enhancing impact.

  * grade_story_253.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (vulnerability, new paths) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("proud humility," "surge of determination"). Literary devices often feel forced or unclear (harp guiding past).

Lacks significant emotional impact or subtextual richness.

  * grade_story_258.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts ambitious imagery and symbolism (dancing trees, storm), but the execution is often heavy-handed ("weaving a spell of preservation"). The central conflict is abstract ("storm of secrets," internal turmoil), and the resolution ("she knew that she had succeeded") feels unearned and told rather than shown. Impact is hampered by conceptual vagueness.

  * grade_story_259.txt (grade=4.0)

It relies heavily on telling rather than showing, and the central tension feels underdeveloped, leading to an unsatisfying, abrupt ending.

  * grade_story_26.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_262.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (puzzle tile) and uses some effective imagery, aiming for emotional impact ('fierce tenderness').

The central conflict's resolution via music lacks depth and specificity.

  * grade_story_261.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (earbud cover, patterns), but it's overtly explained rather than shown, diminishing impact. The central conflict (decay vs. restoration) is clear but lacks compelling execution due to the weak premise. The theme of finding purpose through restoration is present but feels tacked on rather than organically emerging. The writing relies more on stating emotions ("chuckled bitterly," "felt a sense of purpose") than evoking them through action or subtext.

  * grade_story_264.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts to evoke wonder but relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotions ("filled the onlookers with a sense of infinite caution," "their initial cynicism disarmed").

  * grade_story_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (morality, narrative power) and uses symbolism (plush), but the impact is muted. The central conflict is purely internal and lacks urgency. It leans more towards telling emotions ("felt a sense of satisfaction") than showing them effectively. The ending provides closure but feels slight. The craft is competent but lacks the spark or subtext expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (truth vs. illusion) but relies heavily on telling the reader the poetry's effect rather than demonstrating it through character reaction or nuanced description.

The central conflict (dismantling illusions) resolves too easily and without shown impact, limiting emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_267.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story suffers significantly from telling over showing. Concepts like 'poetically bland,' 'savage bliss,' and the rejection of dichotomy are explicitly stated rather than demonstrated through action, subtle characterization, or atmosphere.

The theme is present but delivered didactically.

  * grade_story_265.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts symbolism and evokes a mystical mood, but relies heavily on telling ("testament to," "symbol of," "witnessed something profound") rather than showing. The central conflict is internal and lacks significant tension. Repetitive phrasing ("testament to," "pure grace," "uncharted echoes") detracts from the craft. The ending feels abrupt and the theme of hidden connections is stated rather than subtly woven.

  * grade_story_268.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story uses evocative imagery (mirror, distortions) and establishes tension. However, the central concept of 'Kato' and 'flattering the fates' lacks sufficient explanation to ground the narrative's impact. The theme of transformation is present but handled superficially. Showing vs. telling leans towards telling, especially regarding the character's internal state and the art's function.

  * grade_story_27.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts subtext with the 'tapestry of fate' concept and metaphorical 'petrification'. However, the impact is lessened by a tendency to state emotions ('sense of satisfaction') rather than evoke them through action or nuanced description. The central conflict resolves too neatly and abstractly, lacking visceral resonance. Literary devices are present but not exceptionally sharp.

  * grade_story_270.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding isolation, using symbolism (globe, lighthouse). However, the writing style leans towards telling emotions ("felt an affinity," "felt the isolation") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal monologue. The language is often overly ornate ("hush of a borrowed century," "deep and abiding connection"), bordering on purple prose, which slightly undermines impact.

  * grade_story_344.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions and epiphanies ("realized that the healing touch...", "felt a sense of peace") rather than showing them through nuanced action or interaction. The central theme of connection is stated directly, lacking subtext. Literary devices (metaphor of healing touch, symbolism of jam) are present but handled obviously. Impact is minimal due to predictability and lack of genuine conflict/tension.

  * grade_story_343.txt (grade=5.5)

The craft is competent but lacks depth or memorable impact.

  * grade_story_349.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (hope vs. despair), but relies heavily on telling emotions and repeating key phrases ("charred serenity," "hush before," "horizons of mercy").

  * grade_story_347.txt (grade=4.8)

    The story attempts symbolism (silent bell) and explores themes of loss and progress, but the execution lacks subtlety. The stated "poignant levity" fails to materialize convincingly in the prose, leaning heavily on poignant sorrow. Showing is often replaced by telling (e.g., stating his demeanor, stating the levity). The central conflict is internal but lacks sharp focus.

  * grade_story_362.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (terrarium, dog tags) but explains it too explicitly ("a poignant reminder," "once a symbol of neglect, now seemed to flourish").

The central conflict is purely internal and resolved too neatly.

  * grade_story_369.txt (grade=4.2)

    The story relies heavily on stating emotions ('reluctant awe') and plot significance ('would change everything') rather than showing them.

  * grade_story_382.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth around paradox ('gleeful sorrow') and uses relevant symbolism (rose petals, red streak/gray sky). However, it relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt excitement," "felt satisfaction") rather than showing them. The central conflict is purely internal and resolved too easily into inspiration.

    The story establishes mood effectively but struggles with deeper impact. Literary devices are present but sometimes feel heavy-handed (e.g., thunder as direct manifestation).

The central tension is abstract, and the ending feels more like a cessation than a resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_39.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating the theme 'grit of endurance', stating hope). Literary devices are present but not particularly striking.

The ending feels predictable and overly neat.

  * grade_story_392.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_4.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts a mystical mood and theme (divine/mundane fusion), but relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., the 'flickering vision' is stated, not experienced).

  * grade_story_402.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_407.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_408.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story demonstrates competent craft with evocative imagery and attempts at symbolism (nail, web), creating some subtext about hidden tensions. However, the central conflict remains vague, and the emotional impact is muted by a somewhat detached observational stance and stated feelings.

  * grade_story_414.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding art and consciousness, using the scrimshaw symbolically. However, it relies heavily on stating emotions and insights ("I felt," "I realized," "I knew") rather than showing them through action or nuanced internal monologue. The "gentle sharpness" tone is present but inconsistently maintained. The central conflict resolves too neatly.

  * grade_story_412.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (key cover) and internal conflict, but relies heavily on stating emotions ('mournful elation', 'frazzled nerves') rather than showing them through nuanced action or deeper internal monologue.

  * grade_story_417.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding vulnerability and uses symbolism (bottle cap, setting), but the impact is lessened by telling emotions ("shaken yet strangely liberated") rather than consistently showing them.

  * grade_story_415.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_418.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story uses symbolism effectively (box, glitter, blossoms representing past beauty and renewed hope). It evokes a sense of melancholy hope. However, the central action's description ("feminize the twisted, mutated trees") is jarring and lacks clarity or justification, hindering impact. The theme of bringing beauty/hope to desolation is clear, but the secondary theme of confession feels underdeveloped and tacked on. Showing vs. telling is inconsistent; emotional states and the resolution of the confession are often told directly.

  * grade_story_425.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story relies heavily on explicitly telling emotions and themes (hope, purpose, change) rather than showing them through nuanced action or description; the central symbolism (needle) is overt and lacks subtlety, diminishing potential impact.

  * grade_story_422.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts a theme of expanding connection ('redefining family'), using the overheard call and coffee sleeve symbolically. However, the impact is diluted by the illogical premise (weather archiving) and a tendency towards telling emotions ("felt a sense of purpose," "euphoric agitation") rather than showing them subtly. The central conflict is weak, relying on Luna's internal state rather than external tension. Uniqueness exists in the premise, but craft falters in execution.

  * grade_story_420.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story employs symbolism effectively (ring, bark, light), creating some subtext around creativity and overcoming blocks. However, the emotional impact relies heavily on stated feelings ("felt excitement," "felt an urge") rather than consistently showing them through action or deeper internal monologue. The central conflict is clear but resolved predictably.

  * grade_story_42.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_421.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating emotions ("anguished joy," "heart swelled") and significance ("subtle yet profound changes") instead of evoking them through action or imagery. Symbolism (mariner's wheel) is overt. The central conflict's resolution lacks clarity and impact due to the vagueness of the dreamer's actions.

  * grade_story_427.txt (grade=2.8)
    Relies heavily on abstract jargon ("shifting equilibria," "tangibly abstract") rather than showing concepts through action or concrete imagery. Symbolism (sock, lighthouse) is present but heavy-handed. The story tells rather than shows (e.g., stating the duel was fierce, stating Kael's ambition). The ending is abrupt and unearned. Lacks emotional resonance or subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_429.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (scale = independence, lights = celebration/transcendence), but relies heavily on explicitly stating emotions and themes ("felt shackled," "breaking chains," "felt a sense of hushed euphoria," "sense of pride"). The central conflict is internal and resolved too neatly through symbolic action. It lacks subtext and nuanced 'showing' over 'telling', diminishing its potential impact.

  * grade_story_424.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story heavily relies on telling the reader the themes (sacrifice, legacy) rather than showing them through action or nuanced character experience. While symbolism is present (money as history), the execution lacks subtlety. There is minimal conflict or tension, resulting in low narrative impact despite attempts at evocative language.

  * grade_story_426.txt (grade=3.8)

The central conflict (hacking for clues) is clear but lacks depth. Symbolism (teapot) is explicitly stated, reducing impact. The theme of preservation is present but underdeveloped due to the awkward combination of elements.

  * grade_story_428.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (chains, ink blotter, stars) but relies heavily on explicitly stating emotions and themes ("felt a surge of determination," "weight lifting").

  * grade_story_423.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts symbolic depth (map, stars, light/dark) and evokes a mood, but relies heavily on stating emotions and concepts ('felt the weight', 'canvas of life') rather than showing them through action or nuanced observation. The central theme of rekindling hope is clear but executed with limited subtlety.

  * grade_story_43.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies heavily on stated emotion ("felt unsettling calm," "felt my courage stir") rather than showing. Imagery (neon, fireflies, CD) is present but symbolism (CD=fractured soul/hope) is overt and lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_432.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (bookmark, ice) but relies heavily on telling emotions ("I felt a sense of peace") rather than showing. The central conflict (death wish vs. finding purpose) resolves too neatly. The core concept lacks subtext, presenting a surface-level transformation. The writing craft is functional but lacks the nuance and depth expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_433.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (melting ice, prophecies), but the execution feels superficial. The central conflict (internal struggle over power/solace) is resolved too quickly and neatly.

It tells more than it shows, especially regarding the character's transformation.

  * grade_story_436.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story attempts emotional resonance ("sorrowful heart," "painful joy," "tears of joy") but often relies on explicitly stating these emotions rather than purely showing them through action or subtext.

  * grade_story_439.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story successfully evokes a mood of wonder and mystery, utilizing imagery (comet, patterns). However, the emotional impact is hampered by explicitly stating feelings ("felt an overwhelming desire," "felt his mind expanding") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought. Subtext exists regarding escape, but the central conflict is minimal, resolved by passive acceptance. The theme is clear but lacks profound exploration within this scope.

  * grade_story_430.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (generational patterns, lost innocence) and uses symbolism (stars, kiss, patterns), but the execution lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_434.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts evocative imagery ("dark honey," "dancing flame"), but the central mechanism (zero-g flame) is so illogical it prevents meaningful impact or subtext.

The craft is hampered by the failure to integrate core elements believably, resulting in minimal emotional resonance or intellectual engagement.

  * grade_story_438.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling the reader the character's beliefs and the connections between elements ("had come to believe," "held the key," "inextricably linked") rather than showing them through action or discovery. Symbolism (compass, genetics) is present but feels forced and overly explained. There is no discernible conflict or tension within the scene itself. The ending restates the theme without providing narrative resolution or satisfying development.

  * grade_story_435.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating the facility's purpose, the character's determination). Literary devices are present but not particularly striking or original. The central conflict (understanding the facility/impersonator) is introduced, but the resolution feels rushed and overly simplistic ('I had been brought here for a purpose'). There's little subtext; the theme of revolution and rewriting laws is stated explicitly rather than emerging organically. Emotional impact is minimal.

  * grade_story_44.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("Luna felt a sense of purpose," "Luna felt a sense of peace"). Emotional impact is minimal due to shallow characterization and stated themes. Literary devices are sparse and unremarkable ("flowing like a liquid"). The central conflict is weak – simple curiosity resolved easily. The theme of preserving the past/redemption is explicitly stated multiple times, lacking subtlety or subtext. The ending feels neat but unearned and predictable.

  * grade_story_442.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story successfully evokes a mood of dread and futility through atmosphere and imagery (e.g., rain-blurred painting). Symbolism (flyer, candle, void) is present but somewhat heavy-handed. The central conflict (survival against the void) provides tension. However, the narrative lacks significant emotional depth beyond stated pessimism, and the ending feels abrupt rather than purposefully resonant. The craft shows potential, but lacks subtlety and deeper subtext.

  * grade_story_441.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_444.txt (grade=6.0)

Significant reliance on 'telling' feelings and realizations weakens the craft.

  * grade_story_443.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_458.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts literary flair with phrases like 'fractal sorrow' and 'morbid perfume,' but these often feel overwrought ('purple prose') rather than impactful.

  * grade_story_459.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (transience, letting go) using symbolism (crown, sandcastles), but relies too heavily on explicitly stating the themes and the character's feelings ("I realized," "I felt," "I knew"). It leans more towards telling than showing, weakening the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_498.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (seeds, gardens) but relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a sense of resolve," "felt a surge") rather than showing. The central conflict (internal resolve against external hostility) is present but underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_499.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story employs symbolism (sandals, fungus) and establishes a clear theme of control versus hidden existence. However, the emotional impact is muted, relying more on stating the character's feelings or intentions ("I felt the words begin to flow," "determined to gain control") rather than purely showing them through nuanced action or deeper subtext.

  * grade_story_50.txt (grade=5.5)

    The story attempts symbolism (pencil sharpener) and aims for emotional connection, but the execution feels superficial and overly reliant on telling rather than showing ("felt a sense of connection").

  * grade_story_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth with symbolism (price tag, allies), but the execution lacks subtlety. The central conflict resolution (Max's internal shift) feels unearned. Phrases like "energetically lethargic" and "gentle harshness" are awkward rather than insightful.

  * grade_story_54.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts evocative imagery (Ferris wheel silhouette) and establishes a specific tone ("elegant chaos").

Showing vs. telling could be stronger, particularly regarding the alchemist's internal state.

  * grade_story_68.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    Symbolism (starfish, marionette) is employed, but the execution lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_8.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies heavily on stating themes (rebellion, creativity) rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext.

  * grade_story_81.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (empathy across time) and uses symbolism (coin, driftwood, rust), but the impact is muted by overly explicit statements of theme and emotion ('rising empathy', 'felt a pang').
