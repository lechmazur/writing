== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 ==
  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (knots = phobias/lore) but executes it heavily and vaguely. Literary devices feel forced, and the language is often overwrought ("riddled silence," "mundanely spiritual endurance"). It relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion or development. The central conflict (internal phobias) lacks compelling dramatization, and the theme remains murky due to repetitive but undefined concepts like "echoes in the dark."

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=2.8)
    Relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Symbolism (lamp) is overt and repetitive. Literary devices feel forced, particularly the constant repetition of key phrases ("evolving hopes," "forgotten promises"). The central conflict lacks immediacy and tension. While a theme of hope/unity is present, it's conveyed through assertion, diminishing its impact and leaving little room for subtext.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (flaws, forgiveness, redemption) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Abstract concepts and overwrought language ("elasticize his destiny," "poignant convergence") obscure emotional impact. The central conflict's resolution via "culinary experiments" feels contrived and lacks credibility.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth ('weathered hearts', 'reimagine endings') and uses symbolism (relics), but the execution is heavy-handed, relying on telling rather than showing. Phrases explicitly state the concepts instead of allowing them to emerge organically. The central conflict is internal but underdeveloped. The writing style is overly ornate, hindering genuine emotional impact.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding character traits and motivation. Literary devices are present but often feel overwrought or repetitive (e.g., constant use of "enigmatic," "cosmic"). The central conflict is stated but lacks tension or development. The prose is dense and adjective-heavy, hindering impact rather than enhancing it. The ending offers no satisfying resolution or meaningful shift.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=3.5)
    Attempts literary devices ('bitter honey', symbolism) but often feels heavy-handed. Emotional impact is stated ('regret', 'resolve', 'determination') rather than evoked through showing. The theme of overturning fate is present but explicitly declared, lacking subtlety. Central conflict shifts abruptly with the stranger's arrival.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story attempts symbolism (quilt, stamps, repairs = renewal) but executes it with heavy-handedness and excessive telling ("symbolized the eradication," "physical manifesto," "transformed despair"). Literary devices are present but often feel ornate or clichéd ("cascading hope"). The language is frequently abstract and overwrought ("objectively biased limitations," "artful reforms carved ripples"). The central conflict is internal but lacks nuance. The theme of renewal is clear but delivered without subtlety. Emotional impact is stated rather than earned.

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing ("luminous doubt," "uncharted horizons," "grandly trivial," "forgotten trails," "hush after...") which undermines its literary craft. While symbolism (key, maps) is attempted, the reliance on telling emotions and the repetitive language severely limits impact and subtext.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (regret, choice, redemption) but relies heavily on abstract pronouncements and repetitive phrasing ("impossible choices," "joyful agony," "mirrored reflection"). Literary devices are present but lack subtlety. Emotional impact is hampered by telling ("heart burdened") instead of showing nuanced feeling. The central conflict feels vague and internal without sufficient external manifestation.

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (unity, legacy, art/reason) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("serene anger," "fierce love"). Literary devices are used (symbolism of patch/maps), but the impact is muted by somewhat abstract language and a lack of palpable conflict or emotional resonance. The ending offers resolve but lacks satisfying narrative closure. The central conflict is primarily internal and lacks sharp definition or stakes.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts depth through symbolism (cameo, cracks) and theme (authenticity vs. conformity), but the execution is heavy-handed. The language is overly elaborate ("honestly rare beauty," "lullaby of conformity," "velvet darkness"), hindering emotional impact rather than enhancing it (verging on purple prose). The conflict remains abstract and lacks tension. It tells more than it shows, relying on declarations ("hope prevailed") instead of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("frantic peace," "hope and despair") rather than showing. Literary devices like "mirror of the soul" are overused and lack subtlety. The central conflict and theme (finding truth, overcoming darkness) are present but handled superficially. The ending offers resolution but feels unearned due to the narrative's weaknesses.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story aims for depth through symbolism (mitten, altars) and internal conflict (duty vs. passion), but the execution is heavy-handed and relies excessively on telling rather than showing ("His mission was intricately linked," "duality that both baffled and inspired him"). Literary devices feel self-conscious ("brushstroke of his inner transformation painted a close-distance portrait"). The central conflict is stated but lacks dramatic tension. While the *idea* of combining these elements is unusual, the craft falters, resulting in limited emotional impact and a sense of conceptual overload rather than earned subtext or a satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (heritage, preservation) and uses symbolism (handkerchief), but the craft is marred by overwrought language ("spectral aroma," "eerie commingling") and relies heavily on telling emotions ("mournful elation") rather than showing them effectively. The central conflict feels manufactured due to the weak plot logic.

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=4.2)
    Attempts literary depth with symbolism (pond rings, ribbon) but suffers from overwriting ("effervescent flame," "sublime melancholy," repeated "exultant grief"). Emotion is heavily stated rather than shown, diminishing impact. The central conflict (faith vs. science) is present but lacks sharp focus or development.

  * grade_story_113.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("heart quivered," "profound sorrow") rather than showing them through action or nuanced description. Literary devices are present but often feel overwrought ("tapestry woven from sorrow," "dance on the precipice of oblivion") or clichéd. The central theme of time's fragility is stated repeatedly rather than emerging organically. The ending is abrupt and lacks satisfying resonance. Significant purple prose detracts from impact.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("vexed," "burdened," "resolve grew"). While rich in imagery ("tapestry of fate," "falling stars"), the literary devices often feel ornate rather than purposeful, bordering on purple prose. The central conflict (internal sorrow vs. external chaos) is present but resolved too neatly and abruptly ("legacy solidified"). The theme of art defying destiny is stated explicitly rather than emerging organically from the narrative.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story demonstrates strong craft through evocative imagery and symbolism (clocks, time, repair). It successfully evokes a melancholic, contemplative mood and explores themes of guilt and redemption. However, it relies heavily on stating emotions and the central tone ("despairing humor") rather than consistently showing them, and the narrative impact is limited by the static plot.

  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth but suffers from overwrought prose and excessive telling over showing ("his every gesture radiated quiet determination"). Literary devices are present but often feel heavy-handed or unoriginal. The central conflict (apathy vs. purpose/rebuilding) is stated rather than dramatized, weakening its impact. The ending feels abrupt, lacking earned emotional resonance due to underdeveloped character and plot.

    Storytelling craft is severely hampered by excessive repetition of key phrases, which reads as mechanical and undermines potential subtext or impact. Relies more on telling ("brazen calm," "unwavering resolve") than showing.

  * grade_story_183.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story aims for profundity and uses symbolism (hat box, rift), but the impact is diminished by overly ornate language and telling rather than showing emotion/significance. The theme (ordinary unlocking wonder) is clear but delivered heavy-handedly. Lacks genuine tension.

  * grade_story_184.txt (grade=2.8)
    Relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating motivations, feelings, the quest's nature). Literary devices are present but often feel forced or contribute to the repetitive, overly ornate style. The central conflict remains internal and abstract, lacking concrete stakes or tension. The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically.

  * grade_story_186.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story excels in imagery and atmosphere, creating a unique blend of fantasy, steampunk, and environmental commentary. Symbolism is present (contraptions as heartbeats, decay). However, the emotional impact is muted due to the underdeveloped character and lack of narrative tension. The theme of confronting mortality via environmental decay is present but handled intellectually rather than viscerally. The writing style, while often evocative, occasionally slips into overly ornate phrasing ("purple prose"), hindering clarity and impact. It shows more than tells atmosphere, but tells more than shows character and plot.

  * grade_story_193.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (hope vs. despair, finding connection) and uses symbolism (relic, storm). However, the impact is weakened by a tendency to explicitly state emotions and themes ("heart heavy," "ache of loneliness," "beacon of resilience") rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The writing style is ornate but often veers into cliché ("fabric of destiny," "shattered spirit"), diminishing its effectiveness. The central conflict (internal loneliness) is clear but resolved too neatly via external affirmation and a symbolic ritual.

  * grade_story_192.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story struggles to evoke genuine emotion due to abstract language and stated, rather than shown, feelings. Literary devices often feel heavy-handed or unclear (e.g., "symphony of ruthlessness and kindness").

The ending discovery (fresco) feels abrupt and overly convenient as a symbol. The writing style is overwrought, hindering impact rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_19.txt (grade=2.2)
    Relies heavily on abstract nouns ("destiny," "uncertainty," "chaos," "order," "truth") and tells rather than shows. Symbolism (scale, dandelions) is overt and lacks subtlety.

The central conflict remains vague and internal without compelling external manifestation.

  * grade_story_194.txt (grade=1.5)

The writing style, while ambitious, sometimes obscures rather than enhances meaning.

  * grade_story_20.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts impact through heavy-handed symbolism (waterfall, comb, bridge) and overtly stated themes ("destiny quietly whispered," "whispering ancient secrets," "reflected his innermost conflicts"). Literary devices are present but often feel forced or clichéd ("bridge of regret," "chasm of forgotten aspirations").

  * grade_story_191.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts evocative language and atmosphere, but relies heavily on telling ("His mission, driven by...") rather than showing. The central conflict is nebulous, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_201.txt (grade=3.0)

Conflict is internal and resolved simplistically.

  * grade_story_200.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts profundity through heavy symbolism (compass, footsteps, chamber) and dense, image-laden prose. However, it relies excessively on telling the reader about Elias's state ("hesitant," "haunted," "torn") and the atmosphere ("savage serenity") rather than showing these through action or nuanced description. The central conflict is purely internal and lacks immediacy. The ending offers a sense of resolve but feels unearned due to the preceding passivity.

  * grade_story_203.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (truth vs. lies, confronting the past) and uses literary devices (metaphor, symbolism), but the execution is often heavy-handed and repetitive ("inheritance of lies," "key turning"). Emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing ("Seething," "dread and hope surging") and by the abstract nature of the conflict resolution. The ending states transformation rather than demonstrating it convincingly. Subtext is present but overshadowed by explicit statement.

  * grade_story_206.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story attempts symbolism (sculptures as counterattack/dialogue), but the execution is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    The writing style is overly ornate and laden with abstract concepts ('cosmic absurdity', 'vibrant irony', 'joyful despair'), often telling rather than showing emotion and theme.

The central conflict is internal and atmospheric rather than tangible, leading to low tension. The writing style aims for lyricism but occasionally becomes overwrought ("reinterpreted every storm... grand design"). It relies more on telling emotions ("longed", "found solace") than showing them through compelling action or interaction.

  * grade_story_9.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story uses symbolism (box, billboards) and metaphor effectively, creating subtext about hope and environmentalism. However, the writing style is overly dense and relies heavily on telling ("He believed," "his fervor magnified") rather than showing, which dampens the emotional impact and overall craft despite the unique premise.

  * grade_story_92.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("he resolved," "Determined to justify"). Repetitive phrasing ("loud silence," "stand where fear dares not tread," "silent agreements") diminishes impact. While attempting thematic depth, the execution lacks subtlety and emotional resonance, resulting in a murky central conflict and an unsatisfying, declarative ending.

  * grade_story_95.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (knowledge, transcendence) and uses literary devices (symbolism, imagery), but the impact is significantly weakened by overly ornate language ("purple prose") and abstraction. The central conflict is internal and atmospheric, but the resolution feels unearned. It tells more than it shows regarding the process and its significance.

  * grade_story_94.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies heavily on ornate language and imagery ("surreal mosaic," "enigmatic hum," "time-twisted marvels"), creating atmosphere but often sacrificing clarity and emotional resonance for stylistic flourish (bordering on purple prose). The central theme of liberation from fate/desire is clear but delivered more through assertion than compelling narrative action. Subtext exists, but the impact is muted by the overly embellished style and lack of concrete character engagement. Showing is often replaced by telling.

  * grade_story_96.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts rich literary craft with symbolism (map, cup) and evocative language, but often tips into overly ornate prose ("disinterested passion belied an inner tempest"). It evokes a mood but struggles with emotional depth, relying on stating feelings/concepts ("potent dreams and latent sorrows," "unwavering desire"). The central conflict is purely internal and lacks compelling development. The theme of fate vs. choice is present but handled somewhat heavy-handedly.

  * grade_story_93.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (order vs. chaos, past influencing present) and uses symbolism (labyrinth, patterns), but the execution is heavy-handed and relies excessively on telling rather than showing. The language is often ornate ("electrifying moment," "clandestine forums") without commensurate substance. The central conflict remains vague (internal crisis, shadowy pursuers), and the ending offers a summary of intent rather than a satisfying resolution or impactful resonance.

  * grade_story_97.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story suffers significantly from overwriting and excessive reliance on abstract nouns and telling ("silent sorrow," "radiant hope," "nuanced compassion"). While aiming for depth, the execution lacks subtlety and emotional resonance, prioritizing ornate language over impactful storytelling and showing character development.

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=3.2)
    Overwrought prose and excessive reliance on adjectives/adverbs ('purple prose') obscure impact. Theme ('price of knowledge') is repeatedly stated rather than subtly explored. Showing is sacrificed for telling, limiting emotional resonance and subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_98.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story attempts symbolism (ruler, pool) but executes it with a heavy hand. The writing style is overwrought ("purple prose") and laden with clichés ("whispering secrets," "dance of shadows and light"), hindering genuine impact. The central conflict is internal but static, and the theme ("illusion of security," "wisdom beyond measures") is explicitly stated rather than subtly explored. It relies heavily on telling emotions and significance.

    Vivid metaphors (mending through relics) work, but emotional resonance is conceptual rather than visceral. Ending states themes rather than embodies them.

  * grade_story_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    Surface-level emotional appeals through heavy-handed declarations of "fearful joy" and "hope" undercut potential subtlety; some effective metaphors ("clattering symphony of keys") but often dissolves into poetic abstraction without concrete emotional grounding.

  * grade_story_155.txt (grade=10.0)
    Story evokes powerful impressions through relentless metaphor and poetic excess. The writing style itself acts as the primary narrative device, creating a dreamlike, emotionally resonant experience despite minimal plot. Literary devices like cosmic nostalgia and paradoxical longing elevate the text into a meditation on yearning and temporal dislocation that lingers in the mind after reading.

  * grade_story_159.txt (grade=8.1)

    Excessively ornamental prose distracts from thematic depth; poetic style lacks emotional resonance; repetitive metaphors undermine literary impact
