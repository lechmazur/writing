== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 ==
  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (lamp) and thematic exploration (fear to friendship), but relies heavily on explicitly stating concepts ("evolving hopes," "mocking intentions") rather than showing them through action or subtext. The resolution feels abrupt and overly simplistic, lacking emotional resonance or memorable impact.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=2.8)
    The central symbolism (knots = anxiety) is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("heart pounding," "felt a small triumph," "serene sense of triumph") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal monologue. The ending provides a neat resolution but feels unearned and emotionally shallow.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies heavily on stating abstract emotional concepts ("joyful agony," "impossible choices," "calm resolve") rather than demonstrating them through action or subtle characterization ('telling' over 'showing'). While symbolism (knocker, reflections) is present, the overall impact is diminished by the direct explanation of the theme.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding conformity vs. authenticity, using the cameo symbolically. However, the theme is often stated directly ("She believed that true art...") rather than emerging purely through subtext. The writing craft is competent, but lacks a truly distinctive style or profound emotional impact. The central conflict is clear but resolved predictably.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (chest = past/transformation) but relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a surge of clarity," "heart lightened") rather than showing. The central conflict is internal but resolved too neatly and quickly. Repetitive phrasing ("bittersweet reckoning," "fatal flaw") and a somewhat overwrought style detract from the impact. The theme of forgiveness feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=1.5)
    Relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating "weathered hearts," "manic clarity," "resilience"). Symbolism (bee pin) is over-explained and lacks subtlety. Repetitive phrasing ("weathered hearts," "cryptically obvious," "manic clarity," "adapt," "reimagine endings") severely weakens the craft. The central conflict (internal fear vs. external chaos) is resolved superficially. Theme is hammered home rather than emerging organically.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., "felt the weight," "felt their presence guiding," "felt the cosmic deception begin to unravel"). Symbolism (pennies, statues) is present but lacks subtlety. The central conflict resolution feels abrupt and unearned, diminishing overall impact.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts subtext regarding control and manipulation, and uses imagery ("tapestry of fate"), but the execution lacks subtlety. The central conflict is underdeveloped, relying on telling ("underlying madness") rather than showing. The writing style, while aiming for atmosphere, often becomes overwrought, hindering emotional impact and clarity. The theme of hidden control is present but superficially explored.

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=2.0)
    The story suffers critically from excessive repetition of assigned elements ("serene anger," "lasting legacy," "throughout practice," etc.), which undermines craft and impact. It relies heavily on telling emotions rather than showing, and lacks subtext or memorable literary devices beyond basic symbolism.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=3.9)
    Relies heavily on telling ("felt a frantic peace," "realized that...") rather than showing. Symbolism (mirroring, seashell) is overt and lacks subtlety. The central theme of self-discovery is present but explored superficially. The writing lacks a distinctive style or strong emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (typewriter, library, symphony) but it feels overt and insufficiently integrated. The theme of connection is explicitly stated rather than emerging subtly. Significant reliance on 'telling' over 'showing' diminishes emotional impact and subtext.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (lantern, clocks) but often resorts to telling rather than showing (e.g., stating motivation, emotional responses). The central conflict arrives late and resolves too quickly, diminishing impact. Subtext is minimal; themes are stated directly rather than emerging organically. The writing style has moments of evocative imagery but lacks a consistently strong, unique voice.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story relies heavily on overt symbolism (quilt, stamps, station) at the expense of narrative credibility. It explicitly tells the reader about themes ("erasing boundaries," "unity," "resilience") rather than showing them through believable actions or nuanced character development. The impact is weakened by the implausibility of the core events.

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling ("Elias, a spineless mercenary," "Elias realized") rather than showing, limiting emotional impact and subtext. Symbolism (key, horizons) is present but lacks subtlety. The central theme of overcoming fear is explicitly stated, missing opportunities for nuanced exploration. The writing style aims for evocative but occasionally falls into repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding faith and dreams, using symbolism (ribbon, ripples). However, the execution is heavy-handed, explicitly stating themes and emotional states ('exultant grief,' 'symbolizing hope'). It relies excessively on telling over showing, diminishing emotional impact and subtext. The repetitive phrasing ('oblivion,' 'exultant grief,' 'brewing') significantly weakens the craft.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (mitten, altars) but lacks subtlety. The theme of integrating passion into structured life is stated explicitly rather than emerging organically through nuanced action or characterization ('show, don't tell' principle is violated). The narrative leans heavily on telling the reader about Cedric's transformation and its impact, rather than demonstrating it convincingly. The central conflict is internal but resolved too easily, diminishing its impact. The ending feels like a moral summary, lacking resonance.

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story attempts emotional depth and uses symbolism (handkerchief, fire), but the impact is lessened by reliance on stating emotions ("mournful elation," "weight of responsibility") rather than purely showing them. The central theme of vigilance and preservation is clear but hammered home repetitively. The hopscotch board symbolism feels weak and underdeveloped. The writing style is lyrical but occasionally borders on overwrought, slightly hindering impact.

  * grade_story_118.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating themes ('anchor the ephemeral') and character feelings ('merry bitterness'). While the core concept has potential uniqueness, the execution lacks subtlety, subtext, and genuine emotional resonance. Literary devices feel overtly stated.

  * grade_story_113.txt (grade=2.5)
    Relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating the character felt "ironic awe," stating the theme of time's fragility). Symbolism (plush, tapestry) is overt and lacks subtlety. The central conflict's resolution feels unearned and simplistic. The theme is hammered home through repetition instead of emerging organically.

  * grade_story_115.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story uses clear symbolism (mask, bridge), but it borders on the overly explicit. The central conflict is present and resolved neatly, but the emotional impact relies heavily on telling ("hopeful determination," "sincerity") rather than showing through nuanced action or subtext. It lacks memorable literary craft or deep thematic exploration beyond the surface narrative of reconciliation.

  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (grinder, frames) and explores a theme of renewal. However, the impact is weakened by inconsistent showing vs. telling (e.g., stating the character's resolve despite apathy). The central conflict is vague, and the overall execution lacks the depth and subtext expected for top-tier literary fiction. The prose is functional but rarely rises to exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_117.txt (grade=3.0)
    Over-reliance on stating abstract themes ('mosaic realities', 'fragmented self') rather than showing them subtly. Symbolism (cracked lens) is heavy-handed. Prose is often ornate ('symphony of fragmented realities harmonizing') without adding significant depth, bordering on purple prose.

  * grade_story_119.txt (grade=2.9)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions ("unyielding compassion," "heart raced") rather than showing. Symbolism (key) is overt and lacks subtlety. Literary devices are sparse or cliché. The central conflict is weak, resolved too easily. The theme of compassion is stated but not explored with depth. "Practiced spontaneity" is an awkward, contradictory descriptor that undermines craft.

    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating the dishes are metaphors, asserting the tone). While attempting symbolism (ossuary, healing food), the execution is superficial, lacking subtext and emotional resonance. The central conflict feels contrived and resolved too neatly, diminishing impact.

  * grade_story_195.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (thread, moon trails) and explores a theme of renewal, but its impact is severely weakened by excessive telling ("His hardened exterior had softened," "His legacy was a tapestry..."). The internal conflict is resolved too easily, lacking subtext and genuine emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_200.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story successfully evokes a mystical mood through strong imagery ("refracted fears," "celestial melody") and establishes a clear theme of transforming fear. The central conflict is present and resolved. However, the reliance on stating abstract concepts ("cosmic lullaby," "pristine chaos") slightly overshadows deeper emotional resonance or subtext.

  * grade_story_198.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (spinning wheel, sun trails, tapestry), but the heavy repetition undermines its impact, making it feel forced. The central conflict (escape/transition) is clear but resolved too neatly without sufficient tension or exploration of the stakes ("mangle" reality). It struggles to 'show' effectively, relying heavily on stating the character's motivation, the object's quality ("oddly faithful"), and the desired tone ("fragile ferocity"). The ending feels abrupt rather than earned.

  * grade_story_191.txt (grade=3.5)
    Relies heavily on telling over showing (e.g., stating the boundary blurs, stating secrets are revealed). Excessive repetition of core phrases ('hushed pleas', 'boisterously quiet', 'antique ink well', etc.) hinders impact and feels artificial. Symbolism (ink well, lighthouse) is present but lacks subtlety. The central conflict is abstract and resolution feels asserted.

  * grade_story_2.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (mists, horseshoe), but the execution lacks subtlety. The internal conflict (skepticism vs. belief) is resolved too easily, weakening the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_199.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (legacy, order/chaos, past/present), and uses symbolism (notebook, orchard). However, the impact is lessened by telling over showing (Eliot's emotions, the orchard's shifts) and a somewhat predictable, neat ending. The central conflict resolution lacks significant tension buildup.

  * grade_story_201.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts symbolism but lacks depth and relies significantly on telling emotions and themes ('emotional inheritance') rather than showing; the neat resolution undermines potential impact.

  * grade_story_20.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies heavily on explicit statements of theme and emotion ("symbolizing his desire," "realized that...") rather than showing.

The central conflict's resolution feels too abrupt.

  * grade_story_202.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story attempts complexity but fails to deliver impact due to its disjointed nature. The central conflict is muddled (authentication vs. gravity test), and the theme is obscure. It relies heavily on telling ("code of instinct guided," "gravity seemed to waver") rather than showing, diminishing narrative craft.

  * grade_story_203.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (overcoming legacy/fear) and uses symbolism (flowers, key), but the execution is hampered by overwrought language ("ashes of 'never'," "inheritance of lies," "defiant hush") that borders on purple prose. The central conflict is clear and resolved, but the emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing and a lack of stylistic subtlety.

  * grade_story_205.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling ("stirring a newfound hope," "realized her mission") rather than showing, limiting emotional impact and subtext. While basic symbolism is present, the craft lacks the nuance, depth, and evocative language required for top-tier literary work. The theme is presented explicitly, lacking subtlety.

  * grade_story_204.txt (grade=2.8)
    Symbolism (ticket punch, hangar) is overly explicit and heavy-handed. The theme of overcoming unspoken rules is repeatedly stated, lacking subtlety or subtext. The writing relies on telling ("felt a deep-seated prejudice...begin to dissolve," "felt the weight of her prejudice lift") rather than showing. Emotional impact is minimal due to underdeveloped characterization and abstract conflict.

  * grade_story_206.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating emotions like 'scorn', 'turmoil', 'hope'). While the core concept has potential, the execution lacks subtlety and emotional resonance. Literary devices are present but not seamlessly integrated. The theme of art/kindness is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically. The ending summarizes rather than resolves, lacking impact.

  * grade_story_207.txt (grade=1.5)
    The story suffers significantly from telling over showing, particularly regarding emotions ("felt a profound sense") and character traits. Excessive repetition of key phrases ("redemption's path," "secret song," "joyful loneliness," "meekly assertive") creates a monotonous style and hinders emotional impact. Symbolism (flowers) is overt. The central conflict is internal and lacks tension or urgency. The theme is stated explicitly rather than emerging organically.

  * grade_story_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    While employing symbolism (hairbrush, garden, echoes), the narrative relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion ("haunted," "despair," "solace"). The prose is overwrought with adjectives, and the central theme of 'freed by honesty' is stated explicitly rather than emerging organically from nuanced character action or subtext.

  * grade_story_21.txt (grade=3.2)

The language often strives for lyricism but occasionally tips into cliché or abstraction ("forgotten patterns," "tapes of his existence").

  * grade_story_210.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story attempts symbolism but lacks subtlety, repeatedly stating themes ("humble rebellion," "fuse ancient lore...") instead of letting them emerge.

The ending feels unearned and overly optimistic given the vagueness of the action.

  * grade_story_214.txt (grade=3.2)

The ending offers closure but feels unearned given the abstract nature of the resolution.

  * grade_story_215.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story relies heavily on telling ("Her motivation was clear," "masked her anxiety") rather than showing.

  * grade_story_222.txt (grade=1.5)
    The story heavily relies on telling instead of showing, particularly regarding the character's "layers of compassion," which are stated multiple times rather than demonstrated.

The central conflict is resolved too neatly and instantly, diminishing emotional impact and subtext.

  * grade_story_228.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (clothespin, storm) but executes it heavy-handedly. Emotional impact is muted due to telling ("she felt the weight lift") rather than showing.

  * grade_story_230.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (magic/strategy, hope/brutality) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating themes and emotional impact instead of evoking them. Literary devices often feel like buzzwords ('precisely messy journey', 'hopeful brutality') rather than organic expressions. The ending summarizes impact rather than providing a resonant conclusion. Central conflict is present but resolved through a contrived mechanism.

  * grade_story_227.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story uses imagery and symbolism effectively (graveyard, rain, box) to create atmosphere. However, the writing style frequently slips into purple prose ("ethereal light that spoke of cosmic intimacy," "harmonious symphony"), and relies heavily on telling emotions ("silent awe," "unspoken emotions") rather than showing.

It relies more on stating emotions ("Excitement surged") than showing them effectively.

  * grade_story_233.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating character growth ("seeds of understanding blossoming") and themes (balance).

  * grade_story_231.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (order vs. chaos, nature of justice) but delivers it through explicit pronouncements rather than subtle exploration. Symbolism (hairpin, ship) is heavy-handed. The central conflict (Elior's ideas vs. established norms) is introduced but resolved too easily. The writing lacks significant subtext, and the impact is diminished by its didacticism and lack of emotional resonance shown through character action/reaction.

  * grade_story_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (matchbox, sundial) but lacks subtlety and depth. The central conflict is internal and abstract, lacking immediate tension.

It relies more on telling than showing emotion and meaning.

  * grade_story_235.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts subtext (unspoken connections) but leans heavily on explicitly stating themes ("intertwined fates," "connection and destiny"). Literary devices (symbolism) are obvious. Impact is muted due to lack of concrete stakes or emotional resonance shown through action. The central conflict is absent; it's a description of a state rather than a narrative arc with tension. Over-reliance on telling hinders craft.

  * grade_story_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story successfully evokes a melancholic mood and presents a unique concept using symbolism (dictionary, flame).

  * grade_story_240.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (hammer, song) and explores a clear theme of balance vs. ambition.

  * grade_story_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (vest) and thematic exploration (partnership, silence) but relies heavily on telling ('Their motivation was clear,' 'Each moment was filled with blissful agony') instead of showing.

  * grade_story_242.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story aims for thematic depth (connection, unity) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing. Symbolism (herbs, phone booth) is present but lacks subtlety.

The ending states success rather than demonstrating it, limiting emotional impact and leaving little subtext.

  * grade_story_243.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotions ("rising tension," "confidence began to falter") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal monologue.

The central conflict is resolved too neatly.

  * grade_story_245.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story uses symbolism (pencil box, petrification) and presents a clear conflict/resolution. However, the impact is lessened by somewhat functional dialogue and a reliance on stating emotions ("felt a flicker of determination," "felt a sense of fulfillment") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought.

  * grade_story_271.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling the reader the theme (defying norms, cosmic punchline) and the character's feelings, rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. Symbolism (ruler, juggling) is overt. While attempting depth, the impact is lessened by the lack of subtlety and a somewhat predictable, self-explained narrative arc. The central conflict is internal and abstract, lacking immediate tension.

  * grade_story_273.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story presents a unique, potentially thought-provoking concept, but the craft is weak. Repetitive phrasing ("rustic yarn swift," "humble defiance," "honest," "murky," "emerging authority") dulls the impact. It relies heavily on telling ("he plotted," "his honest words pierced") rather than showing. The central conflict is abstract, and the ending merely restates the ongoing action without resolution or resonance.

  * grade_story_270.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story attempts thematic depth concerning isolation and connection across time, using the globe and lighthouse symbolically. However, the execution relies heavily on telling ("shared isolation dissolved", "emptiness in its wake") rather than showing nuanced emotional shifts. The prose aims for literary effect but frequently tips into overwritten territory ("ephemeral whispers," "intangible echoes," "symphony of intertwined destinies"). The central conflict (Alaric vs. time/solitude) is present, but its resolution feels more like a philosophical statement than an earned narrative conclusion.

  * grade_story_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies heavily on stating its themes ("mindful choices," "rebellion against abandonment," "resilience") rather than allowing them to emerge organically through action and subtext. Literary devices are used, but the prose tends towards the ornate ("ethereal energy," "symphony of growth"), hindering impact. The central conflict is resolved predictably, lacking significant tension or surprise.

  * grade_story_274.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story presents a unique perspective (sentient plant) and uses some symbolism effectively (bookmark, manuscripts). However, its impact is diminished by a tendency to state emotions and concepts ("apathetically devoted," "scalding ambivalence," "sensed the importance") rather than showing them through nuanced action or deeper internal experience. The ending feels conceptually neat but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_272.txt (grade=4.2)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions and states ("He was socially awkward," "Restless acceptance weighed on him") rather than showing. Metaphors ("tree of regret," "maze of his own creation") are present but feel somewhat generic. The central conflict is clear, but its resolution lacks significant emotional impact due to superficial exploration.

  * grade_story_278.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (glasses, webs) but lacks subtlety. The central conflict is clear, but the resolution via dust-vanishing feels like a deus ex machina, undermining the tension built through the sculpting. Emotional impact is muted due to reliance on stated feelings ("murky tenderness") rather than showing nuanced emotion. The theme of escape through art is present but underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_276.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (redemption, patterns, inner/outer mirroring) but relies too heavily on explicitly stating these themes and the character's emotional state ("Her motivation was clear," "realized that her search... was also a journey..."). Metaphors (debris, coathanger) are present but lack subtlety. The central conflict is internal and resolved too tidily via the postcard revelation. It shows potential but lacks the sophisticated craft ('show, don't tell') required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_277.txt (grade=4.9)
    Relies heavily on stated themes and symbolism (purse, sparks, mirror) rather than subtle subtext. The language aims for literary effect but occasionally becomes overwrought, hindering impact. Showing vs. telling is imbalanced.

  * grade_story_28.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("Evelyn felt a surge of accomplishment," "desperate optimism held strong"). Literary devices are present but lack subtlety (the fork is explicitly a key and symbol). The theme of preserving heritage is obvious but lacks depth or subtext. The overall impact is minimal due to shallow emotional exploration and predictable resolution.

  * grade_story_281.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (dummy as bridge, lighthouse as sanctuary) but relies too heavily on explicitly stating the theme ('transformation was not merely an act but a sustained journey'). Emotional impact is muted by telling rather than showing, and the central conflict's resolution feels abrupt and overly neat.

  * grade_story_279.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (paperclip, library), but the impact is weakened by repetitive language and telling rather than showing ("driven by desperation," "felt a profound connection"). The climate change theme is present but lacks subtextual depth. The ending provides closure but feels abrupt and unearned due to shallow execution.

  * grade_story_280.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (cups, tracks) and explores themes (solitude, mastery), but the execution lacks subtlety. The concept of "mixed blessings" is stated explicitly rather than effectively shown. While some imagery is evocative ("hush of distant galaxies"), the overall impact is hampered by the narrative's logical inconsistencies and the somewhat forced thematic pronouncements. The ending feels too neat and unearned.

  * grade_story_282.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly the community's sudden transformation. Symbolism (medal, nautilus) is overt and lacks subtlety. While aiming for emotional impact (warmth, unity), the execution feels superficial due to the magical resolution and underdeveloped character depth. The writing style occasionally strains for literary effect, bordering on purple prose ("detonate a spark of reciprocity").

  * grade_story_283.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating Ember's dedication, the whip's transformation, the emergence of patterns). While the premise is unusual, the execution lacks emotional resonance and subtext. The symbolism of the whip is overt. The central conflict is weak, merely hinted at ("challenges arose"). The theme of unconventional methods succeeding is present but delivered without subtlety.

  * grade_story_286.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (vinyl, apologies) but lays it on too thick, sacrificing subtlety for explicit statement ("symbolized the fragmented laws," "bridge between past chaos and present order"). Literary devices are present but often feel overwrought ("symphony of restored authenticity"). While the premise has unique elements, the execution is hampered by repetition and a lack of compelling conflict or tension.

The theme of authenticity is stated repeatedly but not effectively explored through character action or plot development.

  * grade_story_288.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling the reader about themes (freedom, resilience, cost) and emotions rather than showing them through action or subtext. Symbolism (flag, sculpture) is overt and lacks subtlety. The central conflict feels manufactured for thematic convenience.

  * grade_story_287.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_285.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotion and character traits. Symbolism (postcard, hermit crabs) is overt and lacks subtlety. While a theme of harmony through nature exists, its delivery is didactic and lacks depth. The overall impact is diminished by predictability and a rushed resolution.

  * grade_story_289.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating themes ('strength in weakness', 'beauty in impermanence') and the significance of symbols (doll). Literary devices are present (symbolism, imagery) but lack subtlety. There's minimal subtext or emotional depth evoked; the impact is hampered by didacticism and a lack of compelling conflict or tension. The ending merely summarizes the already stated themes.

  * grade_story_284.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies excessively on stating emotions and abstract concepts ('untamed sincerity', 'pompous humility', 'uncharted emotional depths') rather than showing them through action or nuanced description. Symbolism (plane, map, bees) is heavy-handed. The repeated 'gasp' feels melodramatic. Lacks subtext and genuine emotional resonance due to telling over showing.

  * grade_story_290.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("Her rare talents awakened," "alliances formed," "plans had triumphed beautifully"), sacrificing impact for expediency. Symbolism (the figurine) is overt and lacks subtlety. The central conflict's resolution feels unearned and happens largely off-page or through vague descriptions ("orchestrated disruptions," "dismantle the old power structures"). The narrative lacks subtext and fails to evoke genuine emotional resonance or provoke deep thought.

  * grade_story_292.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story heavily relies on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating themes ('art of storytelling', 'map of unity') and the function of symbols (the mug). Repetitive phrasing hinders impact, and the central conflict's resolution feels simplistic and lacks emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_294.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (prism, cloak) but leans heavily on explicitly stating the theme ('reconstruct his true self', 'liberation from... doubt', 'overcoming internal barriers') instead of showing it through nuanced action or subtext. The central conflict (bard vs. doubt) is clear but resolved too easily via the ritualistic device. Emotional impact is muted by telling ('felt the weight... dissipate') rather than showing. The writing style, while aiming for atmosphere, sometimes obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_293.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_300.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., "His motivations were clear," "Marcus felt"). Repetitive use of the "shimmer of possibility" concept acts more as a tic than effective symbolism or theme development. The central conflict lacks tension, and the ending feels abrupt rather than satisfyingly purposeful. Impact is minimal.

  * grade_story_30.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (tapestry, tree planting) but lacks subtlety. It relies heavily on telling emotions and significance ("flames of determination burned," "resonating with the promise"). The central conflict is resolved too neatly and quickly. The theme of preserving heritage is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically from the narrative.

  * grade_story_298.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth concerning art, truth, and memory, using the dress and light/shadow as symbols. However, the impact is diminished by repetitive phrasing and a tendency to explicitly state emotions and themes ("weave emotional honesty," "anxious serenity," "healed the silent wounds") rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The central conflict's resolution (solving mysteries) is asserted rather than demonstrated, leaving the ending feeling unearned and intellectually unsatisfying.

  * grade_story_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on stating themes ('reinventing tradition') and character feelings ('Determined', 'felt closer') rather than showing them through action or subtext. Literary devices (metaphor, symbolism) are employed but often feel obvious or heavy-handed (tattoos as maps, satchel as bridge). The central conflict (internal doubt, external quest) is introduced but lacks immediacy or tension within the scene itself. Impact is limited by the expository nature and lack of narrative dynamism.

  * grade_story_296.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies heavily on overt symbolism (chopsticks) and explicitly states its theme ("beauty could emerge from disorder") rather than conveying it with subtlety. Lacks significant subtext or emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_303.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions ('mourned,' 'soothing her grief') rather than showing. Repeated thematic phrases ('dignified chaos,' 'natural peculiarity,' 'whispers of a reprieve') become crutches rather than effective literary devices. The central conflict feels underdeveloped, and the ending offers a neat resolution without sufficient emotional weight or subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_301.txt (grade=3.9)
    Relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("His colleagues dismissed...", "His motivation remained clear...", "He realized..."). Symbolism (gloves, knitting) is overt and lacks subtlety. The central conflict (man vs. unknown/ethical boundaries) is stated but lacks demonstrated stakes or nuance. The theme of breaking boundaries is clear but presented declaratively. The language aims for profundity but often lands as generic mystical description ("fabric of time thin," "cosmic frequencies").

Literary devices are present but sometimes feel forced or cliché ("kiss its horizon," "symphony of controlled chaos").

  * grade_story_3.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (order/chaos) and uses symbolism (yarn, knots), but relies heavily on telling abstract concepts ("dignified chaos," "silent symphony") rather than showing them through concrete action or nuanced observation.

The conflict is present but resolved too conveniently to be truly impactful.

  * grade_story_308.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth ("price of ambition") but relies more on stating concepts than showing them through nuanced action or characterization.

  * grade_story_307.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story successfully evokes a mood and uses symbolism (lights vs. cynicism, scratched DVD). However, the impact is lessened by overly stated themes ("Her motivation was clear," "tapestry of hope") rather than purely showing them.

  * grade_story_310.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story introduces potentially interesting themes (silence vs. connection), but relies heavily on telling ("Mira realized," "feeling accomplished yet wistful") rather than showing. The central conflict resolves too neatly, and the "bittersweet" impact feels muted due to underdeveloped emotional depth.

  * grade_story_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story attempts depth through symbolism (kaleidoscope, card, paintings), but the execution lacks subtlety, often explicitly stating the connections (e.g., kaleidoscope mirroring shattered confidence).

  * grade_story_313.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (tape dispenser = hollow victories), but states it too explicitly, diminishing its power.

The central conflict's resolution feels unearned.

  * grade_story_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt a shiver," "felt a connection") rather than showing. Imagery is present but often generic ("otherworldly light," "pulsated with energy").

The central conflict is clear but resolved too neatly and abstractly. The writing style, while aiming for lyricism, sometimes becomes overwrought, hindering rather than enhancing impact. Subtext exists but feels secondary to the explicitly stated theme.

The central conflict's resolution is too swift and lacks nuance, diminishing the overall impact.

  * grade_story_317.txt (grade=2.0)
    Storytelling craft is weak, relying heavily on telling ("he felt," "he knew") rather than showing.

Symbolism (telescope, dawn) is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth around forgiveness, using symbolism (ribbon, hourglass).

The central conflict is internal but resolved too neatly via the hourglass device.

  * grade_story_32.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts symbolism (pamphlet, dawn, melodies as bridge) and explores themes of memory and reality. However, the impact is significantly diminished by heavy repetition of key phrases ("weight of remembering," "torn pamphlet," "melodies") and a tendency to state emotions ("felt the weight," "propelled him forward with hope") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal thought.

    The story relies heavily on overt symbolism (mask, leaf, reflections) rather than subtle integration. While imagery is present, the central conflict is internal and resolved through assertion rather than compelling action.

  * grade_story_337.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating themes (hope, reclamation, imperfection) and emotional impact ("became a beacon," "felt a surge of hope") instead of evoking them through subtle craft. Symbolism is obvious rather than layered.

  * grade_story_349.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (hope, connection) and uses symbolism (herbs, observatory), but the execution is often explicit rather than shown ("symbolizing their desire," "showcasing the universality"). The central conflict's resolution feels unearned and overly convenient, weakening the overall impact and subtext.

  * grade_story_344.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (healing, connection) but relies heavily on stating these themes rather than purely showing them through nuanced interaction. Literary devices are present (jam as portal/trigger) but feel somewhat overt. The core conflict is internal and observational, lacking immediacy. The ending provides personal closure for Marina but feels slightly unearned given the limited development. Dialogue is minimal. The 'showing vs. telling' balance leans too heavily towards telling, particularly regarding emotions and the concept's efficacy.

  * grade_story_347.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story relies heavily on stating themes (faith, harmony) and emotions ("resolve tightened," "trust reaffirmed") rather than showing them through action or nuanced internal thought. Symbolism (shoelace, constriction) is obvious and lacks subtlety. The repetitive use of key phrases ("singularly multiple," "graceless beauty," "faith") significantly weakens the craft and impact. The ending feels abrupt and unearned.

  * grade_story_348.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating humility, fulfillment, curiosity). While there's potential symbolism with the light/knowledge, the execution lacks subtlety. There is no discernible central conflict or tension beyond simple exploration, limiting emotional impact and depth.

  * grade_story_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story evokes a wistful, melancholic mood through strong imagery (vanishing stars, falling leaves). The perspective is unique. Subtext regarding preservation and ephemerality exists but is somewhat thin. The ending is atmospheric but lacks impact. The writing style is lyrical but occasionally repetitive ('effortlessly complicated'). Tension is present (loss of music) but very subdued. The theme of preservation is clear but relies heavily on stated intent rather than demonstrated struggle or transformation. 'Showing vs. telling' is inconsistent, particularly regarding the character's 'blithe discontent'.

  * grade_story_35.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on stating emotional shifts ("felt a surge of clarity," "serene understanding") rather than showing them through nuanced action or internal monologue.

  * grade_story_356.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding time and escape, using symbolism (chalk, phone). However, the impact is muted by somewhat awkward prose ("gently harsh resolve") and reliance on stating concepts rather than evoking them. The central conflict is internal but resolved through a mechanism that feels more conceptual than emotionally resonant. Lacks significant subtext or memorable perspective.

  * grade_story_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding memory and the past, using symbolism (sundial, ivy). However, the impact is lessened by somewhat predictable emotional beats and language that occasionally veers into cliché ("tapestry of time," "whispered secrets"). The central conflict (unlocking the past) resolves neatly but lacks significant tension or surprise.

  * grade_story_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on overt, somewhat clumsy symbolism (stamps as notes, tears as vows) and abstract concepts ("symphonies of truth") rather than subtle subtext. Literary devices feel forced. The central conflict is metaphysical and lacks tangible stakes. The ending provides closure but feels unearned due to the weak plot mechanics. The writing style strains for lyricism but often becomes overwrought, hindering impact. It tells more than it shows.

  * grade_story_357.txt (grade=3.9)

The stated tone ('earnest flippancy') is not effectively demonstrated.

  * grade_story_346.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story uses interesting metaphors (nest/mind, lint/debris) and explores perception, but relies heavily on abstract concepts ('undercurrent of clarity') and telling rather than showing the transformation. Impact is more intellectual than emotional; lacks deep subtext.

  * grade_story_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., asserting "daring compassion," "elegant chaos"). Literary devices feel overwrought ("tapestry of daring compassion," "symphony of light") and contribute to purple prose. There's minimal subtext; the theme is explicitly stated multiple times. Conflict is absent; Aria seems to effortlessly harmonize everything, lowering stakes and impact. The ending feels like a summary rather than a culmination.

  * grade_story_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    Symbolism (flowers, bread) is present but heavy-handed. The story attempts subtext but often resorts to telling ('messages of hope', 'essence of rebellion'). The central conflict is clear, but its resolution feels unearned within the narrative constraints. Lacks genuine emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_355.txt (grade=6.0)

The ending offers no satisfaction or sense of purpose.

  * grade_story_359.txt (grade=3.8)

The ending feels overly sentimental and predictable, lacking lasting impact.

  * grade_story_363.txt (grade=4.2)

The craft relies on stating outcomes ("dreams manifested into reality") rather than immersing the reader in the process.

  * grade_story_362.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies heavily on the terrarium as a central symbol, which works reasonably well. However, it leans more towards telling than showing, particularly regarding the character's traits and the nature of her deceit.

The central conflict is weak, more of a task than a struggle. The ending feels overly declarative and neat, lacking resonance.

  * grade_story_366.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_375.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story achieves a consistent mood and utilizes symbolism (flashlight, mannequins, city). The central theme of finding beauty/strength in imperfection is clearly presented, perhaps too explicitly stated rather than purely shown.

The ending provides closure on the immediate action but lacks deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_373.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (challenging perceptions, transcending boundaries) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("Her work... had successfully challenged...", "Her journey illustrated..."). Literary devices like the coral imagery and bucket symbolism are present but lack subtlety. The central conflict is abstract (Elara vs. taboo/limits) and resolved through assertion rather than demonstrated struggle or breakthrough. Emotional impact is minimal due to the detached, declarative style.

  * grade_story_367.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding the price of perfection, using symbolism (bellows, goose). However, the execution relies heavily on stating concepts ('fervent indifference', 'price of perfection', 'perfection demanded surrender') rather than showing them through action or subtle implication.

  * grade_story_369.txt (grade=2.8)

    The story attempts thematic depth (love vs. duty, surveillance) but relies heavily on telling emotions and themes ("heart ached," "torn between love and duty"). Literary devices like 'reflections' and 'avalanche' are used, but verge on cliché within the genre. The central conflict is clear but resolved predictably (momentary escape). Showing is weak; emotional impact is muted due to stated feelings and somewhat overwrought prose.

  * grade_story_371.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (hatpin as hope, marbles as chaos) but executes it heavy-handedly. The theme of finding kindness/hope is explicit rather than subtly woven. While the premise has potential, the impact is diminished by telling over showing ("Determined to shelter kindness," "His motivation remained steadfast," "realized that...").

The central conflict (internal despair, external indifference) is resolved too easily via the magical hatpin, lacking genuine struggle or depth.

  * grade_story_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story uses symbolism (plants, whispers) and presents a clear theme of finding peace through expression.

The ending provides closure but lacks significant resonance.

  * grade_story_381.txt (grade=1.5)
    The story suffers severely from telling over showing, particularly regarding the character's 'resolve'.

  * grade_story_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies heavily on stating concepts ("silently expressive," "drowsy enthusiasm," "unpardonable silence") rather than showing them through nuanced action or description.

  * grade_story_386.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies heavily on stated emotion ("heart filled with hope") and overt symbolism (tablecloth, lighthouse).

The ending feels unearned, and the story fails to evoke significant emotional response or subtext due to the weak foundational logic.

  * grade_story_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    Symbolism (butterfly, coin) is present but handled somewhat obviously. The story achieves resolution, but the impact is lessened by functional prose and a lack of subtext.

  * grade_story_39.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_40.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("echo her guilt's haunting echo," "felt the echoes of guilt begin to fade"). Symbolism (soldier, storm) is obvious rather than subtle.

  * grade_story_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts unique imagery (DJing gods, thread vision) and symbolism (pencil case), but these lack resonant depth. The central conflict (deciphering the vision/mapping) is clear but resolved too neatly. Emotional impact is minimal; satisfaction is stated, not evoked. The writing 'tells' more than it 'shows' the sacredness or the character's playful nature. Subtext is largely absent.

  * grade_story_412.txt (grade=3.1)

    The story explicitly states its themes (art's impact on consciousness/memory, art as shield) rather than allowing them to emerge organically through action and subtext. While imagery is used (dance as tapestry), the reliance on telling over showing weakens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_409.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_410.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth regarding isolation and resourcefulness, using symbolism (elevator, scissors). However, the impact is significantly weakened by the implausible central mechanism and a tendency to explicitly state emotions and themes ("Elara realized that her isolation... had birthed the ingenuity") rather than showing them subtly. The craft is functional but lacks sophistication.

  * grade_story_408.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story introduces potentially interesting symbols (nail, shadowbirds) but fails to develop them with sufficient depth or subtlety.

The central conflict shifts abruptly, and the ending feels overly neat and unearned.

  * grade_story_418.txt (grade=3.8)

Excessive telling ('Their lives intertwined', 'Their bond... symbolized') replaces showing, resulting in a superficial narrative impact.

  * grade_story_417.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (bottle cap, jungle) but relies heavily on stating the character's transformation ("a surge of clarity washed over him," "uncharted strength emerge") rather than showing it through nuanced action or internal monologue.

  * grade_story_420.txt (grade=4.5)
    Symbolism (ring, bones) is clear but heavy-handed. The theme of transformation is obvious but lacks subtext. The writing relies heavily on telling emotions ("felt an innate sense," "felt a surge") and uses overly elaborate language that hinders impact. The "excited boredom" tone is jarringly inserted and unsupported.

  * grade_story_432.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth (fate, sacrifice, continuity) and uses symbolism (bookmark, ice sculpture, waterfall). However, the impact is diluted by a lack of clarity in the ritual's mechanics and the character's ultimate fate/fulfillment.

Symbolism (whistle, whale, dance, lighthouse) is employed extensively but remains opaque and heavy-handed, failing to create resonant subtext. The theme of preserving heritage is explicitly stated multiple times, lacking subtlety. There is minimal conflict or tension, and the overall impact is one of confusion rather than emotional or intellectual engagement.

  * grade_story_49.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story attempts symbolism (doormat corner) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating resolve deepened, future free from fear achieved). The central conflict is clear but resolved too neatly, lacking subtext or lingering emotional resonance. The writing style is functional but lacks distinctiveness or depth.

  * grade_story_493.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, explicitly stating character traits, motivations, and thematic points ("Cedric realized...", "His prudence ensured..."). Symbolism (ring as key) is present but lacks subtlety. The narrative arc is too neat, resolving the central mystery and character motivation without lingering depth or ambiguity. It fails to evoke significant emotional response or offer memorable insights.

  * grade_story_481.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on abstract pronouncements and telling rather than showing (e.g., "weight of unspoken sorrows," "corruption of innocence"). Symbolism (dragonfly, forge) is present but feels heavy-handed. The language borders on purple prose, hindering emotional impact rather than enhancing it. The central conflict's resolution is facile.

  * grade_story_496.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (overcoming silence/fear) but relies on telling rather than showing the transformation. The central conflict's resolution lacks plausibility, undermining emotional impact. Literary devices are present but sometimes feel ornate ('cosmic verse') or fail to compensate for the weak plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    Symbolism (fork, butterflies, desert) is prominent but heavy-handed. The writing style aims for lyricism but often becomes overwrought ("symphony of alone intimacy"), hindering emotional impact. While there's an attempt at subtext regarding faith and doubt, the resolution feels stated rather than earned, lacking profound resonance.

  * grade_story_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts atmosphere and symbolism (scarf, stars), but the impact is diluted by overwrought language ("vibrations of intent resonated," "elegant chaos") and a lack of genuine emotional depth beyond stated regret (the letter). The central conflict (preserving tradition) is clear but lacks compelling execution within the narrative framework. It relies more on telling the reader about the character's state and motivations than showing them through convincing action or internal conflict.

  * grade_story_498.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (seeds/hope) but lacks subtlety. The central conflict (individual vs. xenophobic society) is clear but resolved simplistically. The repeated phrase "fragile ferocity" feels heavy-handed, and the narrative relies more on stating themes than evoking them through nuanced action or subtext.

  * grade_story_53.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (solitude, connection, cosmos) and uses symbolism (postcards, fortress). However, the impact is weakened by overly abstract language ("mystical reality," "universal uniqueness," "dawn of awareness") and a tendency to state emotions and epiphanies directly rather than showing them through concrete action or nuanced internal monologue. The central conflict is purely internal and resolved too neatly through the chance encounter.

  * grade_story_497.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story attempts thematic depth (compassion, science/heart) but relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., "hearts touched," "became a sanctuary of inspiration"). Symbolism (satellite, scuffs) is present but heavy-handed. The ending feels abrupt and overly sentimental, lacking nuance or earned emotional impact. The writing style, while aiming for lyricism, often uses abstract nouns that dilute the impact.

  * grade_story_51.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., "began to understand the true meaning of resilience," "learned that resilience wasn't..."). Symbolism (crate slat, static) is present but overly explicit and lacks subtlety. The emotional arc is stated rather than evoked, diminishing its impact. The theme of resilience is delivered didactically. The central conflict resolution feels too neat and rapid.

  * grade_story_494.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story attempts symbolism (tapestry, song) but applies it heavy-handedly, explicitly stating meanings ("tapestry fragment now a symbol of his unshackled potential"). Emotional impact is limited because the character's transformation is asserted rather than demonstrated through compelling action or interaction. Subtext is minimal; themes are stated directly. Relies heavily on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_55.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (keys, star, bell), but the execution is heavy-handed. The central conflict (loss of craft/tradition) is clear but resolved too neatly. Emotional impact is muted due to telling rather than showing ("Aria found solace," "heartache"). The writing style suffers from repetition ("raucously silent," "forgotten revelry," "echo of the bell") and occasional purple prose ("creativity blossomed under the looming birth of a new star"). Subtext is minimal; the themes of preservation and legacy are stated explicitly rather than emerging organically.

  * grade_story_52.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (sharpener, hourglass) but executes it with excessive obviousness. It relies heavily on telling emotions ("heart brimmed," "raw emotion," "genuine contentment") rather than showing them through nuanced action or description. The central conflict (internal secret vs. desire for connection) is resolved predictably via the performance trope. The language frequently dips into purple prose ("seared her very soul," "whispers of time," "undying hope"), hindering genuine impact and subtext.

  * grade_story_499.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story uses symbolism (sandals, orchard, corrosion) effectively, but the overall impact is hampered by telling rather than showing ("Eliot's motivation was clear"). The central conflict is present but resolved too neatly. While atmospheric, it lacks deep emotional resonance or subtext beyond the surface theme of seeking autonomy. The writing style is descriptive but occasionally borders on overwrought ("symphony of chaotic organization").

  * grade_story_56.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story suffers significantly from telling over showing ("Jack felt the magnetize pull," "sensing the deeper motive," "realized... orchestrated"). Symbolism (tag, orchard) is heavy-handed. The repeated use of assigned keywords ("magnetize," "invisible allies," "gentle harshness," "energetically lethargic") feels unnatural and hinders stylistic flow. The central conflict resolves too quickly and neatly, lacking emotional depth or subtext.

  * grade_story_59.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (self-discovery, acceptance of the past) and uses symbolism (collar, stars, nothingness). However, the execution relies heavily on telling ("intimate detachment allowed him," "felt the weight... lifting") rather than showing. The language often veers into overly poetic abstraction ("heartbeat of nothingness," "constellations of his own experiences"), hindering genuine emotional impact. The central conflict is clear but resolved too neatly.

  * grade_story_61.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story attempts symbolism (chimes, orchard) but suffers from heavy-handed repetition of key phrases ('echo of sacrifice', 'organized disorder', 'luminescent'), which undermines subtlety and impact. It tells more than it shows, particularly regarding the queen's emotions and the significance of the 'cosmic hush'. The theme of sacrifice for balance is clear but delivered without nuance. The ending feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_60.txt (grade=5.5)
    Symbolism (ribbon, objects) is present, but the story relies heavily on stating the character's indifference rather than showing it, limiting emotional impact and subtext; the central conflict resolution feels slightly underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_58.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating "sanctified dread," "fierce loyalty," "messages of resilience"). Symbolism (moths, journal) is overt and lacks subtlety. The central conflict's resolution via coded comedy feels unearned and superficial, limiting emotional impact and thematic depth.

  * grade_story_62.txt (grade=3.5)
    Relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., explicitly stating the cup's symbolism, the character's deceit). While attempting thematic depth (mundane, truth/illusion), the execution is hampered by repetition and lack of narrative momentum. Symbolism is overt. The central conflict is internal and passively described. Ends weakly without resonance.

  * grade_story_63.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story explicitly states its theme (preservation, ripple effect) multiple times, sacrificing subtlety for clarity. Symbolism (cuffs, ripples) is obvious. There's a lack of compelling conflict or tension. The craft suffers from excessive 'telling' ("humbly proud," "poignant levity") instead of 'showing,' weakening the overall impact and emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_6.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story lacks significant emotional impact or subtext. The conflict resolution is simplistic and unsatisfying. While some imagery is present (dragon scale, steam vent), the craft relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating character traits, hope, awe). The central theme of rivalry/ingenuity is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_75.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (bookmark) and explores themes (past vs. present, community), but the execution lacks subtlety. The central conflict feels underdeveloped, resolved too easily by the decryption. Literary devices are present but not particularly fresh ("symphony of angry peace," "wave of understanding"). The narrative relies heavily on telling emotions and transformations rather than showing them, limiting its impact and depth.

  * grade_story_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    Symbolism (bulb, greenhouse) is employed, but the emotional impact is hampered by telling ("felt the weight... lessen") rather than showing the transformation's depth. The central theme is clear but executed superficially.

  * grade_story_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing emotions and thematic weight (e.g., stating the 'price of immortality' rather than demonstrating it through nuanced conflict). The central conflict's external element (the judge) is vague, diminishing tension and impact. Literary devices feel somewhat overt.

  * grade_story_66.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story heavily relies on explicit statements of theme and symbolism (mirror, masks, carbonization = transformation), lacking subtlety. It tells rather than shows emotional states and character development ("He realized...", "symbolized..."). While aiming for depth through metaphor, the execution is overt, diminishing potential impact. The ending feels overly neat and declarative, resolving the internal conflict too easily.

  * grade_story_76.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story attempts thematic depth (beauty in decay, power of memory/dreams) and uses some evocative imagery (dancing carousel horses, projected memories). However, it relies heavily on stating themes and emotions ("Eli realized that the true beauty lay...", "felt a profound sense of accomplishment") rather than showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The central conflict is internal and atmospheric, lacking sharp tension.

  * grade_story_68.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth ("humanizing the monster," history's malleability) but states these ideas rather than exploring them through nuanced action or subtext. Literary devices are present but often feel cliché ("golden hues," "enigmatic quest"). The central conflict resolves too neatly, lacking significant tension or lasting impact. Relies heavily on telling over showing.

  * grade_story_67.txt (grade=4.2)
    Relies heavily on explicit statements of theme ("human condition," "resilience") and symbolism (earring, metronome, train) rather than subtle evocation. Emotional impact is muted due to telling over showing. The central conflict is internal but lacks compelling dramatization.

  * grade_story_71.txt (grade=4.0)
    Symbolism (fan, lines) is present but heavy-handed. The story attempts subtext regarding duty and emotionlessness, but relies heavily on telling ("felt nothing," "indifferent facade") rather than showing, limiting emotional impact. The central conflict is resolved too simply. The theme of detached duty is clear but lacks depth or exploration.

  * grade_story_77.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., stating empathy's effect, the marionette's symbolism). Symbolism is overt and lacks subtlety. The theme of empathy is clear but presented without nuance. The central conflict (rebuilding the marionette) is resolved too easily, and its impact on the community feels unearned within the word count. Lacks significant subtext.

  * grade_story_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story employs literary devices (symbolism, personification) and presents a clear theme (tradition vs. individual will). However, the writing style frequently slips into overly ornate language ("purple prose"), and relies too heavily on stating emotions ("melancholic glee," "fear") rather than consistently showing them through nuanced action or subtext. The ending feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_73.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (preserving the past, bridging worlds) but relies on telling rather than showing. Literary devices like the "raucous silence" paradox feel overwrought. The central conflict is present but resolved too neatly and without significant tension. Emotional impact is muted due to stated feelings ("felt a responsibility," "found peace") instead of nuanced portrayal.

  * grade_story_78.txt (grade=2.5)
    Relies heavily on telling emotions ("gravity of loss," "inner turmoil") rather than showing. Key phrases ("dissect the architecture of cosmic balance," "reluctant awe") are repeated to the point of losing impact, feeling like forced insertions rather than effective literary devices. The theme is clear but presented without subtlety or depth. Lacks subtext.

  * grade_story_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    Uses standard literary devices (symbolism, imagery) adequately, but the theme is presented unsubtly. The story relies heavily on telling emotions ('felt anxious', 'rising empathy', 'profound sense') instead of showing, limiting genuine impact. Lacks significant subtext.

  * grade_story_80.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (doorknob, erosion) but relies heavily on telling emotions and significance ("obsession intensified," "restored balance") rather than showing. The central conflict is present but resolved too neatly and suddenly. While aiming for depth, the narrative feels surface-level due to underdeveloped concepts and rushed execution. The writing style leans towards melodrama rather than impactful craft.

  * grade_story_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts thematic depth (tradition vs. rebellion, logic vs. madness) but relies heavily on telling and abstract pronouncements ("cosmic dance," "harmonious discord") rather than showing through concrete detail or nuanced action. Literary devices are present but often feel overwrought. The central conflict is internal and lacks compelling external manifestation or development.

  * grade_story_72.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (starlight, paper trails, leaves) but lacks subtlety and depth, feeling more stated than earned. Literary devices are present but often feel overwrought ("furiously tranquil sky"). The central conflict is internal and lacks significant tension. The theme of destiny/knowledge is asserted rather than explored, limiting emotional impact and subtext.

  * grade_story_79.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies heavily on telling emotions ("determination," "triumph") rather than showing them; symbolism (chain, note) is present but lacks subtlety, and the central conflict's resolution feels predictable.

  * grade_story_7.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling ("His motivation was clear," "Ethereal grit defined...") rather than showing. Excessive repetition of key phrases ("chorus of healing," "ethereal grit," "twisted carnival cane") undermines literary craft. While aiming for subtext, the lack of concrete detail makes deeper meaning elusive. No discernible conflict or tension is present.

  * grade_story_87.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (stickers as healing) but relies heavily on telling emotions ("conflicted heart," "enduring pain") rather than showing. The constant repetition of assigned elements ("hyperactively serene," "savage grace," "hush of a memory reclaimed," "throb," "forgotten mixtapes") undermines literary craft, feeling like mandated inclusions rather than natural language. The "hollow victory" concept is stated but the ending suggests a more complete, albeit fragile, peace, creating thematic inconsistency. Subtext is minimal.

  * grade_story_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, especially regarding the character's internal change and emotional state ("felt a sudden surge of compassion," "transformed him"). The central conflict with the vague 'omnipotent foe' lacks specificity and tension. While aiming for a theme of kindness, its delivery is didactic and lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_82.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly emotions ("gleeful sorrow" is stated repeatedly). Literary devices are used superficially. The central conflict is low-stakes and lacks urgency. While a theme exists (past/future, knowledge/sorrow), it's conveyed overtly rather than through subtext. The writing style is marred by repetition and lacks a distinctive voice, limiting overall impact.

  * grade_story_85.txt (grade=2.5)
    Heavy reliance on telling ("he perceived," "he realized," "he rejoiced silently") over showing weakens impact. The constant, overt repetition of assigned phrases ("lucidly confusing," "silent celebrations," "interconnected patterns," "fleeting moment") feels didactic and unnatural, undermining subtext and craft. The central conflict (internal enlightenment) lacks tension.

  * grade_story_74.txt (grade=3.1)
    Relies heavily on telling ("He felt," "Elias knew") rather than showing. Symbolism (joker) is overly explicit. The resolution is abrupt and unearned, lacking emotional resonance or intellectual depth. Central conflict is resolved vaguely. Theme is present but explored superficially.

  * grade_story_86.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story attempts symbolism (candle, archery) but executes it heavy-handedly, repeatedly stating the theme ('cycles of compassion') instead of showing it. The central conflict resolution (incantation fixing lies) lacks sophistication and impact. While using literary devices, the overall craft feels unrefined, leaning heavily on telling. The ending provides closure but feels unearned and overly simplistic. Deeper meaning is asserted rather than evoked.

  * grade_story_69.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story suffers significantly from telling over showing. Key concepts, emotions, and conflicts are stated repeatedly rather than evoked through action or subtext. Excessive repetition of core phrases ("forge beauty from anarchy," "lethargic excitement," etc.) undermines the craft and impact. While symbolism is attempted (tin, holograms), it lacks subtlety. The central conflict is present but stagnant.

  * grade_story_88.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story attempts symbolism (lanterns as enlightenment) and presents a unique concept (toaster archivist). However, the execution lacks depth. The central conflict is weak, resolved without palpable struggle. Key concepts like 'mathematically poetic' are told, not shown. The language often strives for lyricism ("whispering echoes," "ethereal light") but feels overly declared rather than earned through evocative description. The ending provides closure but lacks significant emotional or intellectual resonance.

  * grade_story_83.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing ("Her heart raced," "she felt a connection," "felt empowered"). The theme of harmony is stated directly rather than emerging organically.

  * grade_story_89.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (nail, stars, disintegration = change) but executes it with heavy-handed repetition, lacking subtlety or subtext. It tells rather than shows ('releasing a profound energy', 'igniting hearts'). The central conflict (implied oppression vs. 'silent revolution') is vague and resolved magically via the nail's disintegration, offering little tension or satisfying resolution. The theme of 'materially spiritual' power is stated but not explored with depth, resulting in minimal emotional or intellectual impact.

  * grade_story_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (yarn, kindness, monocle) but applies it heavily, lacking subtlety. The core conflict (inner turmoil + external usurper) is present, but its resolution feels simplistic and rushed. The narrative relies more on telling ("felt the weight of his guilt lift") than showing nuanced emotional shifts. The language occasionally dips into cliché ("beacon of hope," "etched into his soul").

  * grade_story_91.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts thematic depth (nature vs. technology, quiet change) but fails due to the implausibility of the central mechanism. It relies heavily on telling ("Gradually, the community embraced...") rather than showing. Symbolism (fedora) is present but superficial. The central conflict is abstract and lacks tangible stakes or tension. The ending feels overly neat and unconvincing.

  * grade_story_9.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies too heavily on stating emotions ('mildly panicked', 'desperation') and motivations rather than showing them through action or nuanced internal thought. While imagery is present, the symbolism (puzzle box = hope) is somewhat heavy-handed, and the overly neat resolution limits thematic depth and impact.

  * grade_story_94.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts thematic depth using symbolism (earrings, pool, clouds), but the execution is heavy-handed, particularly the repetitive insistence on the 'gravity of desires'.

While imagery is used, the overall impact is diminished by a lack of subtlety and reliance on stating emotions and themes directly.

  * grade_story_93.txt (grade=4.2)
    Heavy reliance on telling rather than showing ("Elara realized that...", "symbolizing a facet...", "became a living testament..."). Symbolism is overt and lacks subtlety. While a theme emerges, its delivery is didactic. The central conflict is internal but resolved too neatly via epiphany without sufficient preceding struggle shown.

  * grade_story_97.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story suffers significantly from telling over showing, relying on abstract nouns ("empathy," "understanding," "essence") and stated emotions. Repetitive phrasing ("recompose," "forgotten places," "path to empathy," "brass compass") dulls impact.

  * grade_story_98.txt (grade=3.5)
    Relies heavily on telling ("He realized," "he felt") rather than showing. Symbolism (tapestry, ruler) is overt and lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_92.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story attempts subtext regarding fear and connection but relies too heavily on explicitly stating themes ('silent agreements', 'shared fears').

  * grade_story_96.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story attempts symbolism (torn map) but relies excessively on telling emotions and significance ("He felt a brimming cup," "witch... was moved").

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on telling rather than showing (e.g., "Elias felt the weight of knowledge grow," "realized that the true price..."). Symbolism (wrapper) is present but overt. The theme (price of knowledge) is explicitly stated rather than subtly explored, diminishing impact.

  * grade_story_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts symbolism (buttons as puzzle pieces) but lacks subtlety. Literary devices are present but often feel cliché (storm/inner turmoil) or vague ("forgotten dance of languages").

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Metaphors ("key resonated with celestial patterns") and symbolic transformation have potential but are undermined by heavy-handed exposition. Ending lacks emotional resonance despite thematic attempts.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=5.0)
    Relies heavily on abstract symbolism (lamp as hope, monster as fear) without visceral emotional grounding; literary devices (e.g., "symphony of trust") feel generic, and the saccharine ending undermines tension; themes of unity are stated rather than demonstrated through nuanced narrative.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Employes effective literary devices (e.g., transforming mirrors as emotional realization) but struggles with balancing introspective abstraction against narrative concreteness; ending achieves thematic unity but falls short of profound emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    Surface-level symbolism and predictable themes; underdeveloped conflict and uneven emotional impact reduce literary impact.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=2.6)
    Overreliance on clichéd metaphors ("stitched fragments of his soul") and didactic themes about "unity" without narrative embodiment. Ending offers ersatz catharsis through abstract pronouncements rather than earned emotional resonance. Writing style oscillates between purple prose ("fiery zest ignite within him") and clinical exposition, undermining immersive impact. Conflicts exist only metaphorically, lacking tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pretty prose struggles to anchor metaphysical themes in emotional reality; cosmic deception concept lacks specificity that would make its "unraveling" feel earned, with ending functioning more as poetic image than narrative culmination.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=4.8)
    Limited emotional resonance; metaphors (knots = anxiety) are overt but lack subtlety or subtext; ending feels artificially tidy rather than earned, weakening thematic impact.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of authenticity vs conformity stated overtly but inconsistently enacted. Some effective metaphors ("cracks in façade") overshadowed by didacticism. Ending feels preordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of wisdom and connection are stated more than substantiated through craft. Literary devices like metaphor are occasionally striking (e.g., "bitter honey") but unevenly applied across the narrative.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of resilience are present but diluted by clichéd phrases; emotional impact is undercut by over-explanation rather than subtext.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of control and hidden influence resonate, but emotional impact is diluted by abstraction; metaphors (tapestry of fate, fog as manipulation tool) are conceptually rich but inconsistently developed; ending lacks resolution, feeling more like a vague dispersal than closure.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Relies on symbolism (mirroring, midnight) without emotional grounding; ending lacks resonance; prose occasionally evokes mood but struggles with "telling" over showing.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=4.5)
    Relies excessively on metaphor overkill (decaying chest = decaying psyche) and explicit emotional telling. Thematic coherence undermined by disjointed subtext; ending attempts profundity but reads as checklist of inspirational poster slogans.

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of legacy/unification feel clichéd. Over-reliance on "telling" emotions (e.g., "serene anger") rather than demonstrating them through action. Ending lacks earned catharsis.

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong metaphors undercut by repetitive thematic statements; ending lacks earned emotional payoff or narrative payoff despite lyrical language.

  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of renewal are stated more than shown, relying on metaphoric shorthand (e.g., coffee grinder = transformation) without emotional subtext; the ending satisfies superficially but lacks narrative teeth or lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=7.1)

    Creative motifs (feather perception, ember as metaphor) are conceptually intriguing but remain underexplored. The narrative leans on symbolic shorthand rather than developing genuine emotional stakes or thematic complexity through character-driven actions.

  * grade_story_459.txt (grade=8.8)
    Symbolism (withering crown, sand castles) and metaphorical silence resonate emotionally. The ending’s thematic closure is poignant, though the central conflict between Marcus and the spectral realm could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_464.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong metaphors (camera capturing balance) and theme of chaos/order interplay elevate impact, though ending feels more triumphant than earned, diluting emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_471.txt (grade=6.1)
    Attempts at lyrical prose (e.g., "atomize the layers of history") occasionally elevate the story but often veer into purple prose.

  * grade_story_469.txt (grade=5.0)
    Heavy on stated themes about balance, light on actual emotional engagement; symbolism (key, gallery) hints at deeper meaning but isn't fully realized through character actions.

  * grade_story_47.txt (grade=6.0)

    Themes of connection are hinted at but lack emotional depth; metaphors are serviceable but predictable, with inconsistent showing vs. telling.

    Themes explicitly stated rather than organically revealed; emotional resonance undercut by abstraction.

  * grade_story_478.txt (grade=5.0)
    Relies heavily on familiar imagery (witch-like healer, moonlit transformations) that evokes vague mysticism without emotional penetration. While the cyclical structure demonstrates craft, the conclusion delivers little resonance beyond stating a completed arc rather than earning it through transformative moments.

  * grade_story_480.txt (grade=7.0)
    Impressive poetic imagery but shallow impact. Subtext about digital vs. real connection is hinted at but unexplored. The ending is ethereal yet unsatisfying; the prose style occasionally elevates the narrative but prioritizes tone over emotional resonance.

    Poetic symbolism (hat, puddles) and thematic cohesion elevate impact, but emotional resonance leans on lyrical abstraction over visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_481.txt (grade=7.0)

The ending's triumphant transformation feels artificially uncomplicated, diluting potential thematic depth about systemic change and emotional resilience.

  * grade_story_487.txt (grade=6.5)
    Metaphors ("mud of reality," "symphony of the labyrinth") offer thematic consistency; ending's "harmonious resurgence" lacks emotional immediacy; central conflict (myth vs. reality) is conceptually clear but human nuance deficient.

  * grade_story_488.txt (grade=6.6)
    Metaphors (beacon of light, shimmering map) carry thematic weight, but emotional impact relies heavily on stated concepts ("relentless drive for personal evolution") rather than subtextual exploration.

  * grade_story_498.txt (grade=6.2)
    Central conflict exists but remains abstract - change happens too easily. Powerful symbols (seed pods as hope) undermined by surface-level treatment of community dynamics.

  * grade_story_499.txt (grade=6.8)

    Metaphor-laden prose achieves hauntingly dissociated commentary on cosmic sacrifice; subtext about purposeless permanence resonates

  * grade_story_68.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    The poetic prose demonstrates craftsmanship but lacks emotional impact or thematic resonance. Literary devices like "timidly loud resonance" and "tapestry of fairy tale references" are atmospheric but underutilized for deeper meaning.
