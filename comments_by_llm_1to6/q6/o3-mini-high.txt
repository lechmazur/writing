  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story struggles under the weight of its assigned elements, particularly the timeframe and tone, feeling more like an exercise in incorporating prompts than an organic narrative. The overly ambitious, dense prose hinders clarity and impact within the brief format. Cohesion is significantly compromised by poorly integrated elements.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the core elements (paramedic, lure, tunnel, loop) are combined creatively, the story struggles under the weight of its overly elaborate style and abstract concepts. Some assigned elements feel forced ("privately public," "excited boredom," the specific motivation phrasing), hindering overall cohesion and clarity despite the evocative atmosphere.

  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=3.2)

The brief length highlights the lack of organic development rather than feeling like a deliberate choice.

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story struggles significantly with cohesion; the assigned elements feel awkwardly stitched together rather than forming an organic whole.
