  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=3.2)

The brief length highlights the lack of organic development rather than feeling like a deliberate choice.

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story struggles significantly with cohesion; the assigned elements feel awkwardly stitched together rather than forming an organic whole. The "strictly casual" attribute and the chopstick wrapper's symbolic weight feel particularly imposed.
