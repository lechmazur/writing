However, phrases like "practiced indifference," "outward calm," and "quiet, understated grace" feel somewhat repetitive in establishing the character's demeanor. The emotional arc follows a predictable pattern of resistance-discovery-transformation. While the prose avoids being purple, some descriptions like "ethereal luminescence" and "otherworldly glow" rely on familiar fantasy descriptors. The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks a truly distinctive style.

  * grade_story_93.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the premise is intriguing, the writing occasionally slips into overly ornate phrasing ("a silent plea lingering between them") and relies on telling rather than showing emotional states. The labyrinth-as-living-entity revelation feels like a convenient solution rather than an earned insight. The story avoids major clichés but doesn't fully transcend familiar tropes of mystical architecture.

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the premise is intriguing, the writing occasionally slips into overly formal, abstract language that creates emotional distance. Phrases like "subtle grandeur" and "tapestry of forgotten wisdom" feel somewhat generic and lack the specificity that would make them truly original. The story's philosophical revelations, while thoughtful, follow a somewhat predictable pattern of epiphany common in AI-generated narratives.

  * grade_story_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the story avoids many AI hallmarks, certain phrases like "intimately distant" feel somewhat forced rather than organic to the narrative. The writing occasionally relies on telling rather than showing, particularly regarding Elias's emotional states. Some descriptions, while evocative, lean toward generic mysticism rather than specific, unique details that would ground the experience. The transformation follows a somewhat predictable arc without surprising twists in how knowledge is acquired or what it reveals.

The compassionate-pursuer interaction feels like a familiar trope without sufficient subversion. Emotional nuance is lacking; empathy feels asserted rather than demonstrated subtly.

  * grade_story_118.txt (grade=4.5)
    While avoiding obvious AI tells like abrupt shifts, the prose contains some overly ornate and potentially cliché phrases ("flickering merrily yet bitterly," "whispering secrets of past regrets," "merry bitterness").

The prose occasionally dips into slightly purple territory ("black velvet sky-lounge").

  * grade_story_121.txt (grade=3.5)
    The piece exhibits signs of formulaic construction, particularly the convenient arrival of the symbolic caravan. Phrasing like "traditionally spontaneous" is awkward and unnatural.

Character reasoning is thin ("juggling resonates"). Emotion is often stated directly. The combination of elements feels somewhat forced, lacking the seamless integration and unique voice expected of top-tier literary fiction.

  * grade_story_153.txt (grade=6.0)
    The combination of elements is somewhat original, but the repetitive use of key phrases ("detached devotion," "mundanely glorious") feels formulaic and imposed. While fitting the tone, the emotional landscape remains surface-level, and the final shift lacks nuanced portrayal.

  * grade_story_154.txt (grade=3.5)
    The writing exhibits traits often found in less refined or potentially AI-generated text: reliance on stated emotion ("felt strongly weak"), somewhat generic descriptions, and paradoxical phrases ("jubilant despair") used insistently without full embodiment.

Lacks a distinctive authorial voice.

  * grade_story_158.txt (grade=3.2)
    Repetitive phrasing ("politely chaotic," "fractal sorrow") and reliance on high-concept terms ("quantum entanglement") without deeper exploration lend a somewhat formulaic feel.

The confetti method, while quirky, feels more like a contrived element than an organic expression of originality.

  * grade_story_163.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story leans heavily on repeating assigned phrases ('reckless precision', 'bitterly optimistic'), giving it a formulaic feel. The 'lost heiress' is a generic trope, poorly integrated.

While the prose isn't overly flowery, the repetition and somewhat predictable arc lack originality and a distinct authorial voice.

  * grade_story_169.txt (grade=5.0)
    The core concept is original, but the execution includes slightly stilted or overly descriptive phrases ("practiced patience and grandiose modesty," "weirdly static").

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids overt clichés with specific details, but some phrases and motifs (e.g., "joyful agony") lean into familiar poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=5.9)
    Formulaic metaphors and repetitive phraseology ("cryptically obvious," "weathered hearts") suggest templated writing; character interactions lack psychological nuance.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=5.0)
    Blends fresh elements ("flying carpet garage") with clichéd tropes (hidden diaries in public restrooms). Purple prose ("cool embrace of night sky") and repetitive phrasing ("strangely trustworthy") suggest formulaic tendencies. Attempts at thematic depth ("midnight's temporality") are undercut by predictable emotional beats and lack of subversion.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=5.9)
    High-concept elements (elastic sword via family recipes) show invention but execution strays into purple prose ("bittersweet reckoning," "tide of sorrow") and clichéd emotional shorthand. The fusion of organic decay with sci-fi tropes lacks cohesive logic, suggesting disjointed idea-stitching.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Avoids overt clichés with unique symbols (net, envelope), but prose occasionally veers into overwritten phrases ("dancing on the edge of madness") and predictable emotional cues.

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids overt clichés but some descriptors (e.g., "luminous doubt") verge on pretension; character logic occasionally feels schematic despite lyrical prose.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids major clichés and machine-like repetition; some ornate phrasing detracts from impact but overall demonstrates purposeful style with distinct voice and fresh thematic interpretation.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=6.0)
    Illuminated apple tree and moon-path imagery avoid cliché, but plot mechanics (statues as guardians, self-confrontation) follow predictable mystical narrative templates despite polished prose.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=5.2)
    The concept of using AI's "forgotten promises" to reprogram it leans on familiar tropes without offering fresh subversion. Phrases like "analytically creative mind" and "chaotic algorithms" verge on jargon. The abrupt emotional shift in Leviathan (from fragmented to decisive) feels calculated rather than earned, and the sheepish spy's agency contradicts his repeatedly stated timidity without satisfactory resolution.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Avoids major clichés through inventive metaphor combinations, but some descriptors (e.g., "borrowed valor," "patchwork quilt") flirt with abstraction that dilutes human nuance.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=3.8)
    Relies on stranded-island, redemption, and crystal-ball tropes without subversion. The saboteur reveal follows predictable patterns. Overly ornate phrasing ("insect orchestra reached its crescendo") distracts from authentic tension.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on AI-flavored abstractions ("coy malevolence"). Metaphors are occasionally fresh but undercut by generic adjectives and a reliance on ornate phrasing. Emotional beats are stated rather than shown, weakening authenticity.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=5.9)

  * grade_story_113.txt (grade=5.9)
    Originality diluted by familiar 'dream-walking' tropes and overly ornate phrasing ('shyly loud,' 'ironic awe'). The plush as a childhood relic avoids cliché, but the dream-hopping device feels generative rather than inventively contextualized. Emotional depth leans more on description than nuanced realization.

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Originality in conceptual elements (e.g., hopscotch cipher) undercut by formulaic melancholic tone and overly ornate descriptors; moments of fresh imagery outweigh clichés like "seeds of vigilance";

    Lyrical prose occasionally veers into ornate abstraction; emotional subtext is hinted at but could be more subtly "shown" rather than stated.

  * grade_story_117.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_12.txt (grade=6.3)
    Unique conceptual framework weakened by sentimentalized reunion trope. Occasionally stilted phrasing ("eager resignation") betrays contrived quality.

  * grade_story_115.txt (grade=6.1)

  * grade_story_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    Blends ecological collapse with sci-fi surrealism, avoiding clichés in premise but lapsing into poetic abstraction (e.g., "rebellious sparks") that risks generic gravitas. Sensory details are specific but occasionally ornate; tone remains consistent, though character psychology feels algorithmically schematic.

  * grade_story_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    Originality emerges in the trauma-healing loop, but "quantum tunnel" and "nest" lean on abstract phrasing. Avoids clichés in metaphor but occasionally succumbs to poetic over-explanation ("baptize nightmares").

  * grade_story_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Occasional purple prose, but the central metaphor combining memory/loom/dance demonstrates ingenuity. Character interiority occasionally simplistic.

  * grade_story_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    Unsettlingly precise sensory details (e.g., 'brass gleaming softly') undercut by clunky abstractions ('fleeting nature of second chances'); occasional purple prose ('ephemeral glow illuminating empty roads'); human motivations occasionally flattened into thematic scaffolding.

  * grade_story_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    Steampunk and coral elements avoid clichés but flirt with aesthetic-over-substance. The gauntlet's dual function as relic and plot device is fresh but thinly explained.

  * grade_story_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Original premise executed with vivid imagery, but contains occasionally overwritten phrases ("patiently frantic," "euphoric agitation") that risk feeling more stylized than organic to the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_119.txt (grade=3.7)

  * grade_story_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Unconventional setting elements resist genre tropes but the throne lineage concept regurgitates archetypal fantasy structures.

  * grade_story_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the interstellar orchard ship and cordless phone introduce original conceits, certain phrases (“promise of changing winds,” “tapestry of self-understanding”) verge on cliché. The narrative avoids overt formulaic plotting but leans on familiar redemption arcs and archetypal mentor dynamics without subverting them. Sensory details are sparsely deployed but evocative when present (e.g., “twig and fiber placed with instinctive grace”), balancing poetic resonance against occasional over-ornamentation.

  * grade_story_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    While mystical elements avoid obvious tropes, the "chosen one" framework feels derivative. Some descriptions border on poetic excess without deeper subtext. The innovative ticket stub concept elevates the narrative above formulaic patterns.

  * grade_story_137.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_140.txt (grade=6.3)
    Overuse of melancholic tropes (abandoned circus, haunted protector) without reinvention.

  * grade_story_149.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_156.txt (grade=3.2)
    Purple prose abounds ("joyfully tragic world," "melancholy shadows"). Predictable archetypes (wise elder, enlightenment-seeking outsider) and forced symbolism (spare computer key as disconnectedness) evoke algorithmic tropes rather than original artistic vision.

  * grade_story_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids clichés with inventive premise; no detectable AI patterns, but occasional abstract phrasing risks vagueness over emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_158.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_160.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_162.txt (grade=5.9)
    Relies on tropes: genius inventor, noble missing friend, “unfinished journey” cliché. Sensory details (dusty shelves, twirling blueprint) are generic. Marcus’s voice slips into motivational poster platitudes. Similes and symbols (blueprint as legacy) lack freshness. Emotional arcs lean on stated feelings (“surge of determination”) over subtlety, with abrupt shifts in tone.

  * grade_story_165.txt (grade=9.8)

  * grade_story_163.txt (grade=2.7)
    Drenched in algorithmic writing tics: formulaic alliterative phrases ("bitterly optimistic", "reckless precision"), overused "fragmented reality" shorthand, storm-as-enlightenment cliché. Emotional states telegraphed through blunt adverbs rather than nuanced characterization. Generic sci-fi trappings suggest template-driven content rather than authorial vision.

  * grade_story_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Original concept strained by repetitive phrasing ("solomnly silly") and occasional disconnect between high-flown language and Eldrin's ethereal nature; avoids major tropes but lacks narrative confidence.

  * grade_story_167.txt (grade=6.6)
    Occasionally poetic but borders on formulaic. Tropes of forbidden love and secret confessions executed without fresh perspective.

  * grade_story_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Original premise with fresh metaphoric connections (soul-brokering as real estate, reversed labels as key). Some poetic overwriting ("hauntingly beautiful harmonies") but inventive use of ethereal physics redeems.

    Relies on "nature heals trauma" trope without subversion; writing avoids purple prose but lacks stylistic distinctness or surprising emotional nuance.

  * grade_story_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Blends clichés ("witch's chamber") with unique elements (genealogical guilt).

Character reasoning contains emotional logic over pure calculation.

  * grade_story_168.txt (grade=5.7)
    Lyrical prose occasionally veers into cliché ("whispers of stones") and overly ornate phrasing undermines nuance; while avoiding genre tropes, characterizations like "polite anarchy" ring contrived rather than authentically human.

  * grade_story_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Avoids overt clichés in core conceits (obituaries for living, morphing mask) but stumbles with genre defaults (heroic sacrifice, storming strongholds); language mostly restrained but occasionally curdles into ornate abstraction ("lucid frenzy").

  * grade_story_175.txt (grade=5.6)
    Repetitive ornate prose ("melody of feral elegance," "symphony of revelation") veers into purple territory; while atmospheric, the narrative relies on familiar fantasy tropes (ancient trees, forbidden knowledge) without substantial subversion.

  * grade_story_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Originality shines in combining steampunk aesthetics with metaphysical elements, avoiding genre clichés. While metaphors like ink flow are fresh, other phrases ("gently flow of sincerity") risk overuse. The integration of assigned elements feels purposeful rather than formulaic, though occasional flourishes (e.g., "joyful sorrow") border on poetic excess. Emotional progression feels earned rather than algorithmically imposed.

  * grade_story_183.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_176.txt (grade=6.3)
    Some overly familiar archetypes (enchanted mushrooms, melancholic fool) undercut originality. Lyrical passages ("laughter illuminating dark corners") risk poetic excess without sufficient narrative consequence. Character psychology follows internal logic but occasionally feels constructed through aesthetic juxtapositions (apathy/compassion) rather than nuanced human contradiction. The "hum of insight" teeters between original motif and vague abstraction.

  * grade_story_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    Strengths: Attempts to subvert clichéd "lost civilization" tropes through personal connection. Weaknesses: Overreliance on sentimental metaphors ("world pause", "sanctuary's breath"); flat emotional beats (explicitly stated vulnerability/purpose rather than embodied); generic descriptors ("inventive", "compassionate") overshadow specific characterization.

  * grade_story_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    Some fresh ideas (ink well as multigenerational key, liminal timeframe) undercut by formulaic beats: clichéd “visions revealing truth” climax, dream analysis as contrived exposition. Language occasionally veers into overwrought abstraction (“boisterously quiet”) rather than precise detail. Emotional arcs are stated, not shown.

  * grade_story_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the ossuary-restaurant setting is inventive, the "letter from the future" and "healing traditions" border on trope; stylistic flourishes (e.g., "harsh tenderness") occasionally tip into forced lyricism, betraying mechanical phrasing.

  * grade_story_192.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar supernatural tropes (poltergeists, sudden chill, hidden alcove) without subversion. Phrases like "fleeting glimpses" and "ruthless kindness" border on flowery abstraction. Emotional nuance is overshadowed by explicit statements of theme.

  * grade_story_193.txt (grade=6.3)
    Relies on archetype-driven storytelling (tortured prince, wandering healer) with predictable emotional beats. Some fresh moments (mortar's symbolic use) undercut by overly familiar device-driven plotting. Prose leans on elegant simplicity but occasionally feels generic.

  * grade_story_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Originality in combining mythic scale with mundane objects (sticky notes, fabric) avoids total cliché, but phrases like “unravel the fragile tapestry” and “echo through eternity” verge on overused symbolism. The method (sticky notes) feels contrived rather than organic to the character’s process, and tone occasionally sacrifices specificity for atmospheric abstraction.

  * grade_story_195.txt (grade=5.3)
    Occasional lyrical passages undermined by formulaic expressions ("calloused palm," "laughter and dreams"). Overused moon metaphors border on sentimental; emotional transitions suggest algorithmic smoothing rather than organic character nuance.

    Vivid meteor-path concept and atmospheric setting avoid clichés; protagonist's naivety and apathy occasionally feel contrived. Language remains focused but lacks distinctive voice.

  * grade_story_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    While avoiding obvious clichés, the story occasionally employs genre-standard elements (mysterious echoes, dying dreams). Some lush descriptions border on purple prose ("fluctuating between solidity and mist"), yet moments of originality emerge through conceptual integration of "chaotic organization" in both plot and theme.

  * grade_story_2.txt (grade=4.9)
    Over-reliance on mystical tropes (runes, ancient wisdom) and florid descriptions ("iridescent cave") suggests formulaic writing; lacks innovative voice or emotional nuance.

  * grade_story_20.txt (grade=5.9)
    Weakness: Combines magical realism (fresh) with redemption arc tropes (predictable); celestial dance and passionate disinterest contrast shows ingenuity but execution leans on familiar emotional milestones typical of AI-generated character arcs.

  * grade_story_200.txt (grade=8.0)

Emotional inheritance is primarily told rather than shown, with limited nuanced character introspection.

  * grade_story_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids obvious tropes through space-exorcism fusion, yet emotional beats occasionally border on sentimentalized; metaphors like orbital debris could be more inventive.

  * grade_story_202.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids most AI-writing traps through specific imagery (tarnished initials, splintered stall wood) but contains traces of formulaic structure - rebellion arc follows predictable revolutionary tropes. Emotional cues occasionally default to explicit labeling ("burning desire") rather than nuanced subtext. Candy-sculpting as resistance method adds sufficient originality.

  * grade_story_205.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_209.txt (grade=6.0)

    Over-reliance on maritime/gothic tropes with only moderate subversion; stylistic flourishes occasionally border on pretentiousness without sufficient narrative payoff.

  * grade_story_220.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overuse of abstract, grandiose phrasing ("innovative nostalgia," "reclaimed strength of stories") veers into purple prose.

  * grade_story_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Original concept executed with fresh metaphors (synthetic melancholy, resonance as preservation), but some tropes (lonely craftsman, mystical skull) lean on familiar archetypes without sufficient subversion; avoids overt formulaicity but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction.

    Mixed originality with some clichéd execution; overly precise descriptors undermine authenticity in key moments of emotional revelation.

  * grade_story_339.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    Unique object-use but inherits temple mystery tropes. Avoids overwrought prose but gown message feels overly literal. Emotional resonance mostly shown through sensory work, though puppeteer connection could offer more narrative ingenuity.

  * grade_story_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Original fantasy elements subvert religious redemption tropes, but jogging and snow patterns verge on arbitrary; prose is evocative without crossing into excessive ornamentation.

  * grade_story_346.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally resorts to familiar symbolic patterns (compass, dawn); prose is evocative without veering into excessive ornamentation, though subtextual nuance is occasionally sacrificed for lyricism.

  * grade_story_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rich descriptive passages avoid cliché but occasionally tip into ornate phrasing ("quiet brilliance hidden within humble things"). Character reasoning lacks complexity; the narrative avoids genre tropes through mystical elements but relies on familiar exploratory tropes ("heart quickening," "pulse resonating").

  * grade_story_349.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_352.txt (grade=7.3)

    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally dips into elevated abstraction that veers toward stylistic ornamentation; emotional restraint is effective but borders on detachment that could undermine resonance.

  * grade_story_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    The frost giant trope and "game mirroring life" mechanic border on clichéd, though the "alpha predator despair" framing offers a fresh twist. The writing avoids excessive ornamentation but occasionally defaults to predictable phrases ("tangled threads of thoughts," "quiet rebellion"). The "earnest flippancy" of the invitation and tone feels underdeveloped as a narrative voice. Emotional beats (Elias's vulnerability) are mostly shown, but the black rose's symbolic heft risks overexplaining.

  * grade_story_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    Occasional purple prose ("gnarled fingers traced ancient patterns") and reliance on gothic tropes; some originality in merging deception with artifact symbolism but risks feeling archetypal.

  * grade_story_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Some overused tropes (orphan quest, mystical temple) undercut originality, though reversed patterns concept shows ingenuity.

  * grade_story_37.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    Quantum setting offers novelty, but transformation arc follows predictable 'awakening' tropes; overly poetic phrasing ("drift of desert sands") risks vagueness; emotional subtext remains surface-level.

  * grade_story_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids outright clichés through imaginative combinations (e.g., minstrels in a techno-futurist setting), yet occasionally veers into lyrical abstraction that feels mannered.

The narrative voice maintains consistency without fully transcending genre conventions.

  * grade_story_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    Blends cyberpunk tropes (neon, dystopia) with swashbuckler archaism in ways occasionally fresh but often frictionless. Marbles-as-guidance leans on mystical abstraction without subversion.

  * grade_story_379.txt (grade=5.0)

Avoids clichés in concept yet risks over-poeticized cosmic imagery becoming self-parody. Subtext (existential confrontation through humor) feels authentically human despite fantastical framework.

  * grade_story_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Conceptual originality in framing self-discovery through paradoxical logic, but risks over-aestheticization through repetitive use of "whispers," "gleams," and "ruins"; emotional nuances present but occasionally obscured by stylized prose choices

    Educated prose occasionally veers into ornateness but avoids overt clichés; character reasoning is introspective but constrained by high-concept premise; subverts archival tropes with personal stakes.

  * grade_story_39.txt (grade=4.9)
    Formulaic phrases ("whispered secrets," "thriving sanctuary") and overuse of adjectives undermine originality. Character logic is overly rational (e.g., colonists’ seamless adoption of blueprints). Metaphors are stale, emotional nuance sparse, with tone shifts feeling abrupt rather than deliberate.

    Mix of original premise with occasionally ornate prose; avoids overt tropes but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction without deeper narrative purpose.

  * grade_story_401.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overused phrases like "manic clarity" and "guiltily innocent" ring formulaic; decoding diaries via crochet knots is inventive but explained via convenient, unearned epiphany; emotional beats rely on stated rather than embodied reactions.

  * grade_story_407.txt (grade=6.7)
    Avoids overt clichés in lizard city premise, but emotional beats follow somewhat formulaic trajectories; "verbal sparring" device works yet feels familiar, with redemption arc lacking subversive grit; language remains stylistically consistent albeit occasionally ornate.

    Avoids genre tropes through unique underground ecosystem and "truthful lies" concept; occasional flowery descriptors ("eerie luminescence") and emotional transitions verge on formulaic but generally maintain stylistic control; grief portrayal avoids AI-style clichés through tactile symbolism.

Emotional beats are shown through actions (silence, shared work) rather than stated outright.

  * grade_story_416.txt (grade=5.3)
    Relied on fantasy tropes (luminous quest relics, “fated meeting”) with minimal subversion. Purple prose crept in (“lambent glow,” “academically rebellious”). Emotional beats stated (e.g., “quiet thrill”) rather than dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_413.txt (grade=5.1)
    Contains generic fantasy tropes (haunted mazes, symbolic scarves) without fresh recontextualization. Overly polished prose with mannered descriptions ("drifted through rustling stalks").

  * grade_story_418.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_420.txt (grade=6.7)
    Phrases like "whisper stories" and "implose the barriers" lean into formulaic lyricism.

The writing avoids cliché in execution but occasionally sacrifices precision for poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_422.txt (grade=5.7)

    Avoids major clichés but occasionally lapses into expected resolutions. The magical element is imaginative yet slightly formulaic.

  * grade_story_449.txt (grade=4.9)
