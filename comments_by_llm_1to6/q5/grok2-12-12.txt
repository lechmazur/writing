  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=2.0)
    The narrative follows a highly predictable redemption template. Phrases like "newfound resolve" and the rapid shedding of "spineless nature" feel formulaic and emotionally unconvincing. The combination of elements doesn't yield significant originality; the magical dollhouse trope is common. The writing lacks a distinctive voice or style, feeling generic.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=1.8)
    Suffers significantly from repetitive, formulaic phrasing ("impossible choices," "joyful agony," "hush the final cry," "grudgingly sweet"). Emotions are stated baldly ("joyful agony") without nuance. The puzzle element appears conveniently without organic integration. Descriptions are generic ("weatherbeaten knight," "jagged reef"). The narrative feels like an assembly of prompts rather than an original work with a distinct style or fresh perspective.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    Over-reliance on archetypal tropes (mentor, hero’s journey) and ornate language weakens originality and emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=4.5)
    Relies on redemption/redemption clichés with minimal subversion. Stilted phrasing ("earnest mockery") and inconsistent tone. Setting/detail choices feel generic rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=4.3)
    Relies on tropes like "found object inspiration." Purple prose ("borrowed valor," "zest for life") and generic sensory details ("vibrant colors," "echoes of a bygone era") undermine originality. Stamps/quilt metaphors feel forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stilted phrasing ("grudgingly sweet disposition") and mechanical repetition ("impossible choices") suggest formulaic construction. Tension between despair and hope remains superficial, with no subversive surprises.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=5.9)
    Overreliance on lyrical abstraction (“weathered hearts,” “manic clarity”) borders on cliché; avoids major AI artifacts but leans on poetic vagueness; atmospheric consistency maintained but lacks narrative surprises.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=6.3)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar fantasy tropes (e.g., mystical objects, self-discovery quests) without subversion. Language is occasionally poetic but verges on purple prose ("air jolted with electric anticipation"). Nuanced emotion is missing—traits and feelings are often named, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=4.9)
    Riddled with genre tropes (forgotten library, hero’s journey) and overly abstract metaphors; repetitive phrases ("echoes in the dark," "mundanely spiritual") suggest formulaic writing. Uninspired language weakens authenticity.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=4.7)
    Relies on genre tropes (guardian of secrets, coded messages, rebellion against conformity) without subverting them. Some lush imagery contrasts with flat, declarative sentences about "cracks in the façade." Tropes like "cynical warmth" feel forced, undermining originality.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=5.5)
    Overreliance on castaway/sacred-knowledge tropes. "Insect symphony" and "bitter honey" offer freshness, but sudden illness and sabotage feel mechanical. Writing alternates between poetically dense (“charismatic figure on television”) and schematic – inconsistent voice undermines authenticity.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    The spaceport and mutated recipes avoid clichés, but duelist traits and forgiveness arc lean familiar; some phrases ("threads of a tapestry") verge on overused, though the fusion of family legacy with sci-fi remains inventive.

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=9.8)
    Original premise with specific technical vocabulary resists clichés; avoids most AI patterns despite occasional abstractions ("serene anger") feeling contrived.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overreliance on sentimental tropes (lost child's item, knight's redemption); purple prose patches and inconsistent integration of 'secret agent' elements weaken originality.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    Lacks distinctive voice; overly poetic phrases alternate with flat prose; emotional nuance remains superficial.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=4.9)
    Exhibits AI-generated tendencies: repetitive adjectives ("ethereal light"), abrupt tonal shifts, and generic conceptualization. Cosmic deception trope lacks originality. The "rationally mischievous" attribute feels artificially imposed. Sensory details are conceptually appropriate but thin.

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Some lyrical passages contrast with overly abstract phrases ("exultant grief"). Emotional states are often named rather than embodied. While avoiding overt formulaic patterns, metaphors remain conventional rather than revelatory. Sensory details occasionally verge on generic.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=4.9)
    Relies on AI-style tropes: "beauty in decay," "killer with a heart of gold." Overly ornate phrases ("whispering echoes of forgotten hours") clutter otherwise vivid imagery. Emotional nuance is stated ("guilt," "comfort") rather than shown through subtext. Predictable redemption arc undermines originality.

Emotional resonance is stated rather than shown.

  * grade_story_259.txt (grade=5.9)
    Some fresh ideas (myth-hunting via telescope in a factory) undermined by predictable tropes: mysterious stranger inspiring jaded worker; "written legacy" as default family heirloom trope. Dialogue veers into exposition ("I collect myths"). Descriptions occasionally slip into vague adverbial crutches ("comforting unease," "unseen stories"). Character logic (worker’s abrupt fascination) feels schematic rather than human.

  * grade_story_262.txt (grade=4.0)
    Purple prose ("haunting reverberation of a lonely church organ"), repetitive phrases, and abstract descriptors suggest formulaic writing. Emotional nuance sacrificed for lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_324.txt (grade=5.6)
    Relies on AI-prone clichés (brain-in-jar trope, identity crisis sci-fi motifs) without subversion. Overly ornate descriptors ("simmering future," "cryptic notes") dilute impact.

    Relies heavily on abstract phraseology ("tapestry of hidden hours," "tides of compromise") that gestures toward profundity without delivering specificity.

Emotional beats feel algorithmically triggered rather than organic.

  * grade_story_342.txt (grade=3.3)
    The story follows a checklist template for "literary fantasy" without genuine invention. Repeated abstract phrases ("resigned exuberance") suggest algorithmic substitution attempts.

    Repetitive phrases ("endearingly feisty," "weight of responsibility") and tropes (forbidden knowledge, redemption arc) dilute originality. The grimoire-closure-youthification dynamic is inventive, but generic descriptors ("mystical symbols") and abrupt shifts (timeskip handwaving) suggest formulaic tendencies.

  * grade_story_373.txt (grade=2.4)
    Formulaic phrases (“kaleidoscopic coral,” “cybernetic limbs glinted”), generic sensory details, and predictable cyberpunk tropes (mad scientist, dystopian remnants) suggest algorithmic defaults.

  * grade_story_374.txt (grade=5.5)
    Genre-blending setting shows potential but feels artificial rather than inspired. Predictable philosophical revelations and vague symbolism undermine perceived originality.

The story’s originality is undercut by recurring clichés of solitary heroism and mystical artifacts.

  * grade_story_39.txt (grade=4.9)
    Phrases like “grit of endurance” and “ephemeral cameo appearances” echo clichéd resilience tropes. The prose oscillates between vague lyricism and mechanical recapitulation of concepts. “Cautious abandon” and “bookshop mysteries” are surface-level flourishes without subversive depth.

  * grade_story_419.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dollhouse and empathic blacksmith concept are original, but clichéd phrasing ("heart of humanity still beats") and overly ornate descriptions (e.g., "spectral inhabitants, calming their eternal unrest") hint at formulaic writing.

The doomsday prepper profession exists as a superficial label rather than integral trait.

  * grade_story_52.txt (grade=5.4)
    Originality in the hourglass setting and karaoke duet is undercut by formulaic emotional beats (“twinkling eyes,” “weight lifted”) and overused metaphors (sands of time). Writing occasionally veers into melodrama.

  * grade_story_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    The mythical scale/immortality trope receives minimal subversion. Floating marketplace feels like generic steampunk-inspired fantasy rather than purposefully designed environment.

  * grade_story_8.txt (grade=6.3)
    Attempts freshness with “sound garden” and “wed logic and madness” but falls into florid descriptors (“haunting melody,” “strange beauty”) that veil emotional vagueness. Some phrases (“empirically rebellious”) feel contrived rather than organically conceived. Subtext on cultural inheritance is thin, relying on clichés of lone geniuses challenging norms. The fusion of method and theme avoids formulae but doesn’t transcend genre archetypes enough to feel revolutionary.

  * grade_story_86.txt (grade=2.3)
    Overloaded with shopworn contrasts (digital/analog, light/shadow) and mystical vagueness. The hot-air balloon stranger reeks of cliché.

  * grade_story_95.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_9.txt (grade=6.1)
    Some imaginative elements (e.g., neon desert) offset by clichéd phrases ("molten sarcasm"). The water-ring method feels artificial, and emotional states are often stated rather than shown, suggesting formulaic writing.

  * grade_story_83.txt (grade=5.7)
    Relies on familiar sci-fi horror frameworks (sympathetic lab experiment) without deconstructing tropes. Writing style balances clarity with occasional purple prose ("ethereal beauty and sorrow"), while inconsistent sensory detail ("crunching underfoot") betrays AI-like formulaic choices. Dialogue-free narrative avoids stilted exchanges but sacrifices character nuance. Predictable arc (rescue mission) offers no surprises, leaning on genre conventions without reinvention.

  * grade_story_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids outright clichés (e.g., unique use of a magnifying glass), but relies on familiar "spiritual bridge" tropes without deeper philosophical exploration.

  * grade_story_89.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mixes fresh cosmic imagery with clichéd revolution tropes. Time capsule concept feels derivative rather than inventive. Language occasionally slips into poetic abstraction that dilutes impact. Contains moments of originality but insufficient subversion of expectations.

  * grade_story_90.txt (grade=6.1)
    Originality exists in the unique setting and tattoos-as-control concept, but the redemption arc follows predictable patterns. Some phrases ("weary from years of battle") border on cliché.

  * grade_story_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    "Disinterested passion" and "statically unique" feel conceptually forced; "brimming cup" underexplored beyond surface-level metaphor; avoids major clichés but occasionally drifts into ornate abstractions that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_98.txt (grade=5.7)
    Relies on archetypal imagery (secret societies, ancient tapestries) without subverting them; the plastic ruler’s novelty is underleveraged, bordering on gimmickry.

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=5.0)
    Relies on tropes (wise mentor, abandoned spaces) with minimal subversion. The chopstick wrapper adds novelty but risks feeling contrived. Phrases like "echoes of forgotten voices" border on cliché, while the "strictly casual" detail lacks organic integration.
