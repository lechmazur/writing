  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    Overused phrases ("weathered hearts") and formulaic transitions, but the bee pin’s symbolism offers minor originality.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    Unconventional pairing of spaceport and family recipes avoids cliché, but some phrases ("precisely innovative") feel stilted. Fatal flaws and forgiveness explore human themes but lack visceral specificity common in AI writing. Style balances clarity and poeticism with minor purple prose.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetitive adverbial crutches ("gently sharp", "enthusiastically lazy") and disconnected metaphor clusters suggest formulaic phrase recycling.

  * grade_story_118.txt (grade=2.4)

  * grade_story_123.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_12.txt (grade=1.2)

  * grade_story_119.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stilted phrases ('tracking the sun shadows,' 'practiced spontaneity') sound artificial. Relies heavily on clichéd contrasts (decay vs. light, fear vs. hope) without subversion.

  * grade_story_124.txt (grade=2.7)
    AI-generated fingerprints everywhere: repetitive loom/grace/ballet terminology, faux-profound vagueness, clichéd "power within" resolution; no linguistic idiosyncrasy or risk-taking; would fit any new-age self-help parable with setting labels randomly swapped.

  * grade_story_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Relies on AI-default imagery ("trapped animal," "march of time"). Surreal caravans and "mineralize" concept ring formulaic; fails to subvert genre expectations or develop unique voice.

  * grade_story_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    Generic descriptors ("ethereal light," "treasure trove") and formulaic tropes (ancient mirror revealing inner truth) suggest clichéd thinking.

  * grade_story_130.txt (grade=5.3)
    Phrases like "static-laden confessions" verge on purple prose; device-driven structure avoids common tropes but relies excessively on abstract, floating imagery without visceral grounding.

  * grade_story_129.txt (grade=2.6)
    Repetitive cadences and overused literary mannerisms suggest algorithmic embellishment; excessive reliance on thematic keywords ("cryptic", "hushed", "transformation") creates mechanical rhythm; surreal imagery follows predictable symbolic patterns rather than startling originality; emotional beats often proclaimed rather than revealed through crafted progression; the troubadour's journey mirrors archetypal templates without subverting them; ornamental language frequently substitutes for genuine narrative insight.

  * grade_story_126.txt (grade=5.3)
    Heavy reliance on poetic abstraction over organic storytelling. Recurring phrases ("aloof passion") feel performative rather than essential. Some inventive combinations (butter churn in space), but the conceptual scaffolding occasionally resembles philosophical scaffolding more suited to a parable than lived narrative.

  * grade_story_127.txt (grade=5.0)
    Repetitive phrase "rustred knight's gauntlet" (6x) creates mechanical rhythm. Clichéd emotional beats ("raw emotion," "weight of past") and abrupt time shifts typical of AI-generated text. Attempts subvert tropes (adversary bond) but execution feels predetermined

  * grade_story_13.txt (grade=3.7)
    Relys on fantasy tropes (cryptic puzzles, secret gardens) without subversion; "trail of poems" feels generic and predictable.

  * grade_story_133.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_134.txt (grade=5.0)
    Formulaic elements (mischievous sprite, "chaos into harmony") undermine originality; cardboard box and laundry cycles verge on arbitrary, suggesting checklist-driven plotting.

  * grade_story_137.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_136.txt (grade=5.6)
    Originality is undercut by clichéd resolutions (e.g., race against time to fix a balance) and generic descriptors (e.g., "breathtaking network"). The VR device as a method feels anachronistic and formulaic, though the core concept of rebirth has subtle potential.

  * grade_story_144.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conceptual skeleton visible beneath overwritten surface; interdimensional chefs and broken music boxes feel like genre trope assembly rather than fresh invention, with emotional beats telegraphed rather than organically developed.

  * grade_story_135.txt (grade=1.2)
    Algorithmic repetition ("frozen harbor" appears 7x) and identical sentence structures betray AI-generated patterns; clichéd "lone scholar preserving culture" trope; stilted phrasing ("peculiar faith driving her through icy expanse") undermines originality.

  * grade_story_140.txt (grade=2.9)
    Overuses melodramatic phrasing and predictable tropes; repetitive descriptors and disjointed tonal shifts suggest algorithmic default patterns rather than intentional artistry.

  * grade_story_149.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose alternates between florid ("twilight's embrace") and clichéd ("unyielding spirit"); reliance on abstract binaries (rebellion/convention, ordinary/extraordinary) suggests algorithmic pattern recycling rather than authentic thematic interrogation.

  * grade_story_138.txt (grade=2.9)
    Rampant repetition of phrases ("hollow recklessness," "candor in small moments"), formulaic descriptors ("electric tension," "lullaby of forgotten dreams"), and abrupt tonal shifts suggest algorithmic default patterns; lacks subversive freshness.

  * grade_story_145.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_139.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_147.txt (grade=3.5)
    Relies on fantasy tropes (mystic relics, puppet masters) without subverting them. Overuse of adverbs ("undeterred," "whisper") and clichéd imagery (symphony of forgotten dreams) suggests formulaic writing. Theme feels borrowed, not explored.

  * grade_story_155.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose alternates between clichéd phrases ("siren's song of forgotten dreams") and overly ornate descriptions ("unprobable power").

Metaphors (mirrors as time portals) are unoriginal and underexplored.

  * grade_story_158.txt (grade=2.4)
    Relies on clichéd "chosen one" arc and poetic vagueness. Phrases like "politely chaotic" and "fractal sorrow" recur as empty incantations, while the quantum watch's potential is wasted. Writing feels algorithmically inclined toward ornate but hollow lyricism.

    Avoids overt clichés; “mundanely glorious” grounds the surreal. Prose is purposeful, with lean metaphors (“gifted burden”) and restraint in exposition. Character logic feels human (Elara’s detachment isn’t overexplained). No formulaic transitions; tone remains consistent despite abstraction.

  * grade_story_159.txt (grade=1.2)
    Excessive ornate phrasing ("whispering tales of forgotten grandeur") creates clichéd tone. Sudden narrative pivots (weddings/betrayal) suggest formulaic structure. Character motivation and tone shift arbitrarily without humanistic nuance.

  * grade_story_186.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose borders on "purple," with repetitive phrases ("oddly truthful," "whimsical tinkerer") and strained lyricism. The carnival’s sudden appearance and the box’s reveal lean on trope-heavy setups. Subtext feels intentional but undercooked, while character nuance is lost to abstraction.

  * grade_story_181.txt (grade=2.3)
    Riddled with formulaic phrasing ("tapestry of colors," "soothing symphony") and predictable romantic tropes. The narrative suffers from abrupt tonal shifts (from contemplative to romantic) and artificial emotional beats rather than organic character interactions. Descriptions rely on generic adjectives instead of specific, vivid imagery.

Excessive telling over showing undermines engagement.

Elara's emotions are often stated ("hopeful melancholy") rather than embodied through nuanced reactions.

  * grade_story_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Some lyrical passages contrast with overly familiar tropes (wise old mentor figure). Purple prose tendency ("whispered secrets," "echo on the wind") suggests formulaic reflexes. Emotional beats often told rather than shown through specific behavior.

  * grade_story_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Originality lies in juxtaposing the compact’s artificiality with the natural bonsai labyrinth. Avoids clichés by framing "sacred flows" through maps rather than mysticism. No significant purple prose, though "joyful dread" and "lines of energy" flirt with abstraction. Sensory details are specific but occasionally generic (e.g., "hum of life").

The piece demonstrates procedural assembly rather than organic creation, with no discernible authorial voice beyond templated structure.

  * grade_story_40.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_438.txt (grade=9.8)
    While lush descriptions occasionally verge on ornate, the narrative avoids clichés through striking juxtapositions (mariner's compass in lab) and unexpected metaphors ("beacon of hope" in sterile environment). Emotional truth emerges through implication rather than explication.

  * grade_story_431.txt (grade=3.1)
    Exhibits AI writing hallmarks: formulaic repetitions at paragraph boundaries, excessive "This was my sanctuary" statements, generic cosmic wonder tropes. Same concept expressed 10+ times with different adjectives. Flowery descriptions ("forgotten echoes") compensate for lack of concrete action. Nuanced emotions exist only as labels, not demonstrated reactions

  * grade_story_447.txt (grade=3.7)
    Formulaic phrases ("tapestry of whispers," "amber prison") and repetitive structure (chronological summary sentences) suggest algorithmic patterning. The future bulletins are a forced speculative element in an otherwise realistic setting. The rebellion trope is conventional, with no subversion.

  * grade_story_448.txt (grade=5.9)
    Some clichéd phrasing ("forgotten knowledge," "heart raced") and overreliance on passive voice. The seashell method feels arbitrarily chosen rather than logically tied to the world, and "rebelliously docile" leans on paradox as a substitute for complexity.

  * grade_story_449.txt (grade=2.3)
    Excessive reliance on vague, lofty descriptors suggests AI-generated obfuscation where "unique" becomes "contradictory" and "benediction" substitutes for meaning. Recurring phrases like "quiet benedictions" and "individually general" mutate meaninglessly. Atmosphere feels like decorative mist rather than purposeful worldbuilding, with transitions between elements feeling mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_452.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids complete trope recycling through juxtapositions like organic planetariums in cyberpunk settings. The belt buckle's symbolic elevation shows some inventiveness but remains conceptually murky. Writing avoids purple prose but occasionally succumbs to atmospheric clichés.

Character reasoning prioritizes thematic boxes over human inconsistency, suggesting formulaic structuring rather than organic growth.

  * grade_story_455.txt (grade=9.8)
    The narrative avoids clichés in its existential take on wish mythology. While "scars" and "ghosts" are archetypal, their intersection with foreign coins and the secret route shows ingenuity. Stylistically, the balance between lyricism and clarity is mostly maintained, with only occasional overuse of adjectives marring otherwise vivid prose.

  * grade_story_458.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrase patterns and occasionally ornate descriptions ("fractal sorrow") suggest formulaic writing. The coffee stain divination feels contrived rather than organically developed. Emotional expressions often remain on conceptual level.

  * grade_story_473.txt (grade=7.2)
    Avoids overt tropes but occasionally defaults to predictable contrasts (urban vs. natural, secrecy vs. openness).

  * grade_story_460.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose exhibits mechanical repetition ("lethargically energetic spirit", multiple "embers of choice") suggesting formulaic expansion. Similes ("wisdom cradled in rough hands") are unoriginal. Subtext about choice/rebirth feels imposed rather than earned through character action.

  * grade_story_463.txt (grade=2.9)
    Relies heavily on genre tropes (haunted lighthouse, ghostly dancers) without subversion.

  * grade_story_467.txt (grade=3.2)
    Predictable tropes (magic artifact guiding hero) dominate. Phrases like “treacherous waters” and “wisdom seeped into her soul” are derivative.

Tone defaults to inspirational platitudes instead of earned resonance.

  * grade_story_457.txt (grade=1.7)
    Conspicuous formulaic repetitions ("forge new paths," "rebellion and freedom") suggest algorithmic phrasing; overuse of adjectives/adverbs ("meticulously," "vastness of the universe") dilutes impact; narrative jumps (e.g., "influence grew") rely on summaries, not scenes; emotional arc feels imposed rather than organically developed.

  * grade_story_461.txt (grade=5.8)
    Blends archetypal fantasy tropes with fresh atmospheric details. Avoids pure clichés through sardonic-to-harmonic tonal shift but relies on familiar magical object narrative patterns.

  * grade_story_476.txt (grade=3.3)
    Clichéd phrasing ("dance of purpose," "intense nonchalance") and checklist-driven structure betray algorithmic construction; shallow engagement with themes.

  * grade_story_466.txt (grade=2.9)
    Overly ornate, derivative phrasing ("xerograph," "symphony of life") veers into purple prose. Predictable tropes (forgotten seeds, destiny map) and stated emotions undermine originality or psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_479.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stilted prose ("jubilant remorse," "digital ether") and inconsistent tone suggest artificial construction. Overreliance on poetic abstraction fails to make emotional stakes tangible; feels like decorative scaffolding over hollow core.

  * grade_story_472.txt (grade=1.2)
    Extreme "purple prose": 18 instances of flowery phrases per paragraph. Generic descriptors ("labyrinth", "ethereal") repeated. Predictable "cosmic quest" cliché with no twists. Dialogue absent, character reasoning simplistic. Writing style indistinguishable from AI algorithmic output.

    Repeated formal clichés (“whispered secrets,” “dissonant calm”) and generic mystical-midwife tropes undermine originality. Style leans into ornate vagueness over precision.

  * grade_story_468.txt (grade=5.9)
    Originality in vanishing footprints, singing spirits concept. Overused mystical elements ("heart of labyrinth") and adjectival overloading ("enchanted place"). Mortician-bracelet connection feels mechanical. "Polite anarchy" and "loudly serene" read as superficially clever rather than meaningful contradictions.

  * grade_story_465.txt (grade=6.0)
    Blends familiar fantasy tropes (unicorns, phoenixes) with unique touches (airship setting). Some purple prose and formulaic transitions reduce originality.

  * grade_story_470.txt (grade=1.6)
    Pervasive clichés (arcane guardians, chosen one narrative) and repetitive phrasing suggest algorithmic pattern-following; fails to subvert genre tropes or explore fresh ideas.

    Relies heavily on abstract, slightly clichéd phrasing ("graceless beauty," "fearless laugh") and predictable structure; metaphors lack freshness; character psychology feels algorithmically inferred rather than nuanced through idiosyncratic behavior or dialogue.

  * grade_story_475.txt (grade=6.0)
    Original core concepts (coded lullabies, analog/digital portal) show promise but intermingle with clichéd dystopian elements; prose occasionally veers into ornamental similes without sustained stylistic distinction.

    Stilted duality phrases ("flippant solemnity," "uniquely generic") showcase formulaic thinking. Protest element reads like an afterthought. Overly precise descriptors ("0.1 to 10.0 scale") suggest algorithmic pattern-following rather than organic worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_480.txt (grade=2.3)
    Riddled with AI-generated formulaics: perfunctory similes ("whisper among echoes"), repetitive descriptors ("unfamiliar," "raw edge"), and predictable narrative switches between locations without earned transitions; theme of exorcism never connects to emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_477.txt (grade=5.8)
    Originality exists in combining disparate elements (swordsman/scientific innovation), but execution relies on generic descriptors ("graceful," "vibrant") and formulaic transitions between plot points. Phrases like "whispers of the universe" border on cliché, while "lucid frenzy" feels arbitrarily inserted rather than organically developed.

  * grade_story_485.txt (grade=5.9)
    Contains atmospheric originality but undermined by formulaic descriptors ("haunting reminder of past glories," "flame of innovation flickered"); characterizations adhere to archetypal template without subverting genre expectations; emotional beats explicitly named rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_483.txt (grade=4.5)

    Poetic imagery marred by occasional purple prose. Original concept diluted by fantasy tropes like light-vs-dark dichotomy.

  * grade_story_492.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_488.txt (grade=4.8)
    Relies on mystic-quest tropes (summoners, haunted reflections) without subversion. Repetitive adjectives ('shimmered', 'crackled') and hollow metaphors ('corroded rapture'). Lacks stylistic coherence, veering between poetic and incoherent.

  * grade_story_491.txt (grade=3.1)
    Relying on "ancient texts" and "art of illusion" tropes without subversion; repetitive descriptors ("sanctuary," "shimmering") and artificial syntax ("grudging admiration") suggest formulaic phrasing; emotional beats (awe, understanding) are told, not dramatized; lacks stylistic distinctness or narrative ingenuity.

  * grade_story_490.txt (grade=5.9)
    Writing avoids overt formulaic patterns but contains overwrought phrases ("enthusiacic apathy"). Sensory details are purposeful albeit generic. The fusion of "methodical randomness" with archaeological fervor shows ingenuity, yet some literary devices border on pretentiousness.

  * grade_story_493.txt (grade=4.5)
    Secret-lineage trope dominates with minimal subversion. Flowery phrasing ("cryptic patterns concealed within secondhand letters") masks narrative shortcuts. Character logic (e.g., sudden chamber discovery) prioritizes plot convenience over verisimilitude.

    Purple prose dominates ("terrified of the cosmic verse he yearned to pen on mortal skin"), with clichéd juxtapositions (cosmic vs. mortal) and artificial rhythm. Metaphors recycle predictable tropes rather than subverting them.

  * grade_story_495.txt (grade=3.5)
    Relies on tropes: reluctant hero, mystical object, epiphany via exotic locale. The paddle's sigils and spacetime framing feel like decorative placeholders rather than integral innovations. Language occasionally veers into overwritten vagueness ("dangerously friendly" lacks specificity).

  * grade_story_5.txt (grade=4.5)
    Derivative structure (scholar discovers ancient artifact's secrets) relies on familiar fantasy tropes. "Hum of humility" feels like abstract New Age phrasing rather than organic thematic material.

  * grade_story_499.txt (grade=4.9)
    Repetitive sentence structures and overused descriptors ("worn leather sandals," "poetically rational") suggest formulaic pacing. Metaphors (orchestra tuning, fungal glow) feel decorative rather than integral. Nuanced emotions and subtext are scarce; tone veers between overly ornate and vague.

  * grade_story_54.txt (grade=3.9)

  * grade_story_51.txt (grade=4.3)
    Redemption arc formulaic; museums as catalysts feel arbitrary rather than integral to Leo's growth. Phrases like "quiet intensity" lean on adjectives over demonstration. Emotional stakes declared rather than earned through specific incidents or layered conflicts.

  * grade_story_50.txt (grade=2.6)
    Predictable blend of mystical quest tropes (lonely seeker, transformative relic) without subversion. Overused metaphors ("dancing through the air"). Emotions explicitly stated rather than shown. Sudden temporal shifts ("days turned into weeks") typical of AI-generated pacing. Sensory details feel culled from thesauruses rather than organic observation.

  * grade_story_58.txt (grade=3.8)
    Repetitive phrasing and cliché-ridden passages ("storms within," "dance in the rain") indicate formulaic tendencies; overly conceptual writing without grounded characterization; predictable narrative arc; metaphors lack freshness; tone shifts feel artificial.

  * grade_story_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Some phrases ("whispering secrets," "ghost in the machine") feel overused. The "romantically doomed" bard and bell-as-memory-tool lean on tropes without subverting them. The prose occasionally becomes ornate ("gravity of a star"), sacrificing nuance for lyrical abstraction.

    Avoids extreme clichés but occasionally lapses into ornate phrasing ("haunting symphony") and predictable spiritual odyssey tropes.

  * grade_story_6.txt (grade=5.8)

Emotional beats lack human nuance in favor of overt declarations.

  * grade_story_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar "disenchanted ruler" and "lost innocence" tropes; language occasionally verges on ornate without distinctive authorial voice to elevate it above formulaic phrasing.

  * grade_story_52.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overly reliant on redemptive trope clichés; inconsistent tonal shifts from blithe discontent to maudlin sentiment; flowery descriptions (e.g., "tastefully offensive relic") verge on purple prose without adding depth.

  * grade_story_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    Attempts inventiveness with setting and invisible allies subvert post-apocalyptic tropes, but character dynamics and plot mechanics (swindler + scientist, meet-cute) feel formulaic. Descriptions occasionally drift into poetic abstraction ("gentle harshness") without precise anchoring to ground the surreal elements.

  * grade_story_64.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mixed originality—the floating market is inventive, but "forest trails to immortality" and alchemist tropes lean formulaic; purple prose ("centuries-old marble floor") occasionally distracts.

  * grade_story_62.txt (grade=4.5)
    Overt self-consciousness about "philosophy" feels clichéd; metaphors (branches as seats, sewer as existential space) verge on pretentiousness; sensory details often generic ("thick with scent"); some AI-like repetition ("candid deceit," "truth/lie binaries"); tone lacks idiosyncratic edge.

  * grade_story_60.txt (grade=4.9)
    Language veers into ornate abstraction ("mystic simplicity," "seal covenants") without concrete justification. Relies on generic tropes (relics, catacomb-bound artisans). Contrived structure mimics AI-generated cadence; lacks visceral originality.

    Relies on "haunted hacker" trope; bottle cap symbolism and rake handle discovery feel algorithmically generated rather than narratively essential.

  * grade_story_7.txt (grade=5.1)
    Moments of inventive imagery are undercut by reliance on vague, ornate phrasing ("ethereal grit") and genre tropes (labyrinthine facility, ancient chorus) that feel derivative rather than transcendent.

  * grade_story_74.txt (grade=5.6)
    Ideas feel conceptually familiar; combines elements without fully subverting AI-escape tropes or achieving distinctive metaphorical freshness that avoids genre conventions.

  * grade_story_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    Some originality in combining alchemy and science motifs, but phrases like "quiet transformation" and "bellow of triumph" feel conventionally dramatic rather than uniquely rendered

  * grade_story_80.txt (grade=3.9)
    Exhibits AI-writing tendencies: formulaic phrases ("whispering secrets of the past"), inconsistently vivid/vague descriptors ("ghostly hues" vs. generic "cryptic symbols"), and reliance on haunted trope trappings without fresh subversion. The riddle concept lacks innovative execution.

  * grade_story_8.txt (grade=2.4)

  * grade_story_79.txt (grade=3.2)
    Writing displays AI-assisted tendencies: overuse of similar sentence structures, repetitive phrasing ('echo of quiet' 3×, 'ghostly resolve' 2×), excessive adjectives, and overly precise poetic abstractions. The 'tarnished silver chain' transformation scene follows a predictable fantastical template. Emotional states are frequently stated rather than shown through specific actions. Metaphors ('chain as map', 'verses as stars') lean toward conventional comparisons rather than idiosyncratic invention. The prose prioritizes poetic texture over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_84.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_81.txt (grade=3.7)
    Relies on overwrought descriptive patterns ("centuries-old coin nestled within grain," "living testament") and explicitly stated emotions; lacks stylistic idiosyncrasy or subversive handling of time-manipulation tropes.

    Abundant formulaic phrasing ("timeless mission," "sacred duty"). Overused descriptors ("humility," "essence"). Character motivation (archiving stories) portrayed algorithmically without human nuance. Story follows template rather than unique vision.

  * grade_story_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Predictable tropes dominate (redemptive antihero, mystical object, hidden message) without subversion. Overuse of ornate adjectives ("tranquility," "hypnotically rigid") and formulaic transitions (e.g., "Together, they...") betray mechanical construction. Little emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=3.5)
    Formulaic transitions between timelines; reliance on carnival nostalgia and destiny tropes; repetitive "fragments of legends" phrasing; telekinetic powers introduced as arbitrary ability rather than story-mechanism; psychological complexity sacrificed for plot efficiency.

  * grade_story_91.txt (grade=4.3)
    Overused metaphors ("delicate balance," "quiet revolution"); formulaic descriptions (ozone smell, shadows); lacks stylistic risk-taking.

  * grade_story_92.txt (grade=2.0)

    Relies on fantasy tropes (magic objects, poet-protagonists) without subversion; repetitive "wonder" language; overly formal diction ("cacophony of creatures") feels artificial; sudden character shifts suggest algorithmic progression rather than organic motivation.

  * grade_story_98.txt (grade=6.3)
    Uses genre conventions (secret societies, arcane quests) without subversion. Metaphors like "tapestry whispering secrets" border on cliché. Emotional nuance is thin—courage is asserted rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior. Language occasionally veers into pretentious abstraction without deepening meaning.

  * grade_story_97.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive descriptive phrasing ("shimmered with an otherworldly glow," "fractured souls") and overly ornate abstractions ("optimistic desperation") suggest formulaic writing; metaphors lack freshness, though the "heartbreak-induced visions" concept briefly subverts fantasy tropes.
