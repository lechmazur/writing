  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative relies on familiar tropes (rogue AI, unconventional hero saving the day) without significant subversion.

The overall execution feels formulaic and lacks a distinctive authorial style or originality.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=3.2)

== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B ==
  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=5.9)
    Originality undermined by clichéd metaphors ("nebula dew") and formulaic emotional conclusions; mixes genres with uneven nuance.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=2.3)
    Repetitive phrase structures ("echoes in the dark," "dance on the edge of madness") suggest formulaic writing; relies on overused tropes (haunted protagonist confronting fears in ancient ruins) without subversion; metaphors feel derivative rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story avoids overt clichés but employs familiar tropes (healing objects, timeless settings) without subverting them. Some phrases ("manic clarity," "weathered heart") verge on conceptual redundancy. The prose balances clarity and lyricism but occasionally leans on descriptive shorthand rather than vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    AUTHENTICITY & ORIGINALITY: Avoids overt clichés but has moments of overwrought phrasing ("cosmic webs") and predictable emotional beats. The penny/moon path metaphor is fresh, but the statues' sudden smile feels rushed. Lacks deep subtext and nuanced emotional showing, relying partly on stated introspection rather than crafted atmosphere.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids overt clichés through niche settings (miniature museums, bird-cameos) but relies on vague "intelligence service" tropes; prose is purposeful but occasionally over-descriptive ("lullaby of conformity").

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    Relies on genre tropes (mentor, hero's journey) without subversion; metaphors and prophecy phrasing are unoriginal; avoids excessive ornamentation but sacrifices specificity; pacing and character logic suggest rushed human execution rather than AI.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    Attempts originality with underwater-festival juxtaposition but relies on redemption-through-discovery trope; description of "quilt" stamp is vivid yet familiar; avoids overt clichés but lacks transformative execution.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=5.5)
    Relies heavily on genre tropes (haunted knight, magical prison); overly ornate descriptions and predictable character motivations

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=6.6)
    Avoids major formulaic pitfalls but exhibits occasional ornate description excesses. Flying carpet mechanic feels borrowed rather than reimagined. Emotional beats telegraphed rather than discovered organically.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    Quirky elements (spy gadget pen, cursed tradition) show creativity, but execution leans on tropes: the "forbidden object" test, redemption arc. Purple prose in metaphors ("tapestry of fate"), generic descriptors ("madness," "malevolence"). Lacks fresh language to transcend genre conventions.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar contrasts (coldness vs. warmth). Language is purposeful but occasionally veers into generic descriptors (e.g., "frosty"). The secret agent center with family altars is inventive but underexplored. Subtext is present but not layered. No glaring AI artifacts, but nuance is uneven.

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids overt clichés but treads familiar ground (secret societies, misunderstood genius). Sensory details are occasionally generic ("crumbling walls"), though the method of decoding paintings offers mild originality. Nuanced emotion is partially undercut by didactic lines like "serene anger."

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=2.5)
    Routine metaphors (“bitter honey,” “gentle overturn”) and a reliance on clichéd character arcs (fallen celeb finds salvation) suggest formulaic writing. The narrative exhibits uneven tone shifts, abrupt emotional declarations, and a lack of linguistic originality.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery occasionally veers into overwrought descriptors ("quietly flamboyant"); premise subverts assassin tropes but leans on familiar "masterpiece murder" clichés.

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    Blends archetypal elements with surreal modernism but occasionally lapses into romanticized abstractions that feel formulaic rather than freshly imagined.

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Persistent clichés (e.g., "hopscotch board holding secrets") and abstract descriptors ("layers of history and possibility") verge on formulaic. While the metaphor of recipes-as-culture is strong, the narrative leans on familiar tropes of lonely travelers rediscovering purpose.

  * grade_story_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    Original premise elements (nano-city, interconnected wishes) avoid cliché but execution leans on familiar melancholic tinkerer archetypes; some sensory details ("hum of isolation") feel generic; emotional subtext relies excessively on exposition ("too simple to be true"); prose style purposeful but occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction

  * grade_story_113.txt (grade=4.1)
    Repetitive flowery prose ("thunderclap in the dark," "tapestry of sorrow"), generic emotional cues, and overly precise descriptors suggest algorithmic tendencies; the dream-hopping method feels like a rehashed "escape from reality" trope without innovation.

  * grade_story_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    Some tropes (isolated artist, haunted by time) recur without subversion, and vague phrases like "garden secrets" border on cliché; originality emerges in the city’s defiance of time boundaries.

  * grade_story_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls like sudden tonal shifts or repetitive phrasing, though some descriptions verge on generic ("hauntingly beautiful"). The "mosaic realities" concept offers slight novelty but falls into fantasy trope territory without deeper philosophical implications. Emotional complexity remains surface-level, with character reasoning favoring narrative expediency over psychological realism.

  * grade_story_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Blends cyberpunk elements with spiritual introspection, offering moderate freshness. Over-relies on established tropes (digital vs real world conflict, lightning-harnessing tech). Language occasionally veers toward purple prose ("patently frantic energy"), while character psychology remains more logical than humanly nuanced.

  * grade_story_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive-in concept fresh but execution leans on nostalgia tropes. Circus vanishing act feels artificial. Language occasionally overwrought; inconsistent emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Some fresh concepts undermined by occasionally ornate descriptions ("whispers of hindsight") and underdeveloped emotional nuance; the wax code system borders on mystical rather than logically integrated; metaphors feel more decorative than thematically essential.

  * grade_story_119.txt (grade=4.9)
    Relies on genre tropes (haunted carnival, family heirloom) without subversion. Overwrought phrases (“twisted metal beast”) and explicitly stated emotions weaken authenticity. Astral projection’s potential as a unique lens is underexplored.

  * grade_story_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stylized melancholy borders on formulaic; kayaking motif feels imposed rather than organic. Metaphors maintain freshness, yet character reasoning follows sentimental templates without humanistic unpredictability.

  * grade_story_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    Relies on timeworn tropes (time loops, quantum metaphysics) without subversion. Purple prose ("time folded in on itself like a Möbius strip") clashes with underdeveloped emotional authenticity—despair is stated rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_138.txt (grade=3.1)
    Formulaic contrasts (ancient noble/modern tech) feel like checklist AI generation. Overused descriptors ("pulsating", "unblinking eye") and inconsistent logic (how does a drone analyze ticket stubs?). Stated emotions replace nuanced reactions.

    Original premise weakened by formulaic execution. The "power of music/food to unite" trope appears with minimal subversion. Phrases like "symphony of understanding" lean into predictable abstraction. Some sensory details (e.g., moonlit log flume) feel generic rather than specific. The street fair's sudden appearance risks narrative contrivance.

  * grade_story_143.txt (grade=5.9)
    Relies on environmental-apocalypse tropes with minimal subversion; key element feels tacked on rather than organically tied to plot. Language occasionally veers into mild purple prose but avoids AI-like repetition or overly complex syntax.

  * grade_story_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    Predictable template of hero's journey (elder guide, magical artifact) diminishes perceived originality despite Celtic-tech fusion. Purple prose threatens at moments ("strands of courage woven into the village's very soul").

    Combines espionage and magic tropes without fresh subversion; melodramatic phrasing ("whispered secrets," "shadowed tunnel") borders on cliché; abrupt shifts between magical and mechanical concepts suggest structural inauthenticity.

  * grade_story_236.txt (grade=3.9)
    Relies on "unfinished bargain" fantasy trope without subversion; overuse of poetic descriptors ("luminous regret") veers into purple prose while underdeveloping narrative logic.

  * grade_story_233.txt (grade=5.7)
    Concepts flirt with originality (virtual artifacts, lullaby as magic) but lean on clichés (secret societies, chosen-one arc). Language is functional but occasionally stiff ("seeds of understanding," "burning desire"). The vault’s abrupt transition feels algorithmically abrupt rather than organic. Nuanced emotion is scarce despite "distant warmth" motif.

  * grade_story_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids overt clichés (Game Master as glitch) but contains AI-like flourishes ("chaotic symphony of color"). Subverts necromancer trope by sidelining magic. Sensory details (moonlight on fishhook) are specific but occasionally overdetermined. Nuanced theme balances on-the-nose vs. subtle.

  * grade_story_241.txt (grade=4.8)
    Writing displays formulaic tendencies; numerous descriptive passages feel artificial ("blissful agony," "silent scream," "soft-voiced guide"); relies on fantasy tropes without subverting them; sensory details are inconsistently specific and sometimes generic; tone remains superficial rather than being consistently maintained; metaphors follow predictable patterns rather than offering fresh perspectives; lacks genuine emotional nuance in character portrayal.

  * grade_story_242.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids overt clichés but employs familiar "corrupt establishment vs. rebels" framework; herbs offer modest originality within genre tropes.

  * grade_story_246.txt (grade=2.4)
    Relies on trope-heavy AI patterns: generational curses, mystical heirlooms, and electromagnetic hocus-pocus; prose veers between purple and sterile; character reasoning feels algorithmically logical rather than authentic.

  * grade_story_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Original setting contrasts with generic character/template-like plot. Avoids overt clichés but employs familiar tropes (music-as-harmony) without subversion. Language occasionally leans into florid abstraction.

  * grade_story_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    Originality in ultraviolet forest and theatre conceits exists but risks gimmickry. Prose occasionally becomes purple (“cold intensity unyielding,” “stormy waters that had defined him”). Logical gaps in how the audience physically relates to Elias’s journey suggest formulaic narrative stitching.

  * grade_story_239.txt (grade=6.0)
    The premise is original but undermined by occasional clichés (e.g., "labyrinthine patterns") and vague descriptors; some narrative choices feel formulaic, lacking a distinct authorial voice.

  * grade_story_247.txt (grade=6.5)
    Avoids overt clichés but hinges on familiar magical-realist tropes (messy prophet, mystical map). The compact is inventive; however, the sacred flows concept lacks fresh perspective. Language is purposeful but occasionally overadorned ("ethereal warmth"). Emotional nuances are hinted at but rarely shown.

  * grade_story_238.txt (grade=5.2)
    Relies on tropes (melancholic custodian, sentient machines); some phrasing feels formulaic ("mechanical vulture"), while the wallet-as-memory device lacks fresh contextualization.

  * grade_story_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    Combination of tea rituals with sci-fi decay is conceptually fresh, but phrases like "biting sincerity" and "abstractly physical" lean on vague poeticism rather than organic character observation; metaphors feel more decorative than revelatory.

  * grade_story_244.txt (grade=5.0)
    Relies on genre conventions (questing warrior, mystical artifacts) without subversion. Descriptions avoid ornamentation but lack specificity for true originality. Plot mechanics feel purposeful yet familiar, with resolution following predictable narrative patterns.

  * grade_story_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on poetic abstraction ("hidden whimsy") that feels contrived rather than earned. The "whirring willie" revelation is inventive, but sensory details (e.g., rain, harmonies) verge on generic. Character reasoning lacks nuance—Harper's willingness to part with the drill is unexplored.

  * grade_story_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    Relies heavily on genre tropes (loner hero, prophetic quest) without subversion. The "reassembling letters" method has potential but feels contrived rather than organic to worldbuilding. Purple prose tendencies ("cheerless ecstasy of discovery") undermine authenticity. Emotional beats are told rather than shown, with generic character reasoning.

  * grade_story_240.txt (grade=4.9)

  * grade_story_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    Combines unusual elements (ticker in temple) with some originality but leans on predictable tropes (ailing sibling, chosen-one arc) without sufficient subversion.

  * grade_story_253.txt (grade=6.0)
    Setting is original, but character reactions to the time-manipulation concept feel overly logical; the "distorted notes" motif occasionally succumbs to cliché, and some phrasing leans toward overelaborate description without purpose.

  * grade_story_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Some phrases ("icy warmth of potential redemption") border on poetic formula; the block’s symbolic revelation feels overly convenient. While the memory thief trope is handled with creativity, the emotional arc follows predictable redemption structures without subverting expectations or adding human complexity.

  * grade_story_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    Originality resides in poetic concepts (bottling starlight) but clichéd elements (haunted heirlooms, solitary dreamers) dilute freshness. Prose is occasionally flowery (“hush of time’s unraveling tapestry”) without deepening stakes or emotion.

  * grade_story_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    Formulaic genre elements (abandoned tower, relic, rain-as-metaphor) lack subversion. Purple prose in sensorial descriptions ("mix of hope and decay"). Motivation framed through exposition rather than character psychology. Over-reliance on analytical terminology feels artificial, not organic to voice.

  * grade_story_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids clichés with the DNA-brass bell concept, but some descriptors (e.g., “tech-kissed fireflies”) feel overwrought; emotional subtext is implied through symbolism, though introspection remains surface-level.

  * grade_story_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Avoids major clichés in concept but relies on familiar underdog trope; writing style remains purposeful without excessive adornment; character reasoning shows nuance despite occasionally idealized transformation

  * grade_story_261.txt (grade=5.3)
    Worldbuilding feels intentional but execution shows AI-like abstraction; some fresh combinations diluted by formulaic emotional shorthand.

    Worldbuilding elements feel conceptually intriguing yet execution veers toward cliché; some atmospheric details lack specificity.

  * grade_story_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Relies on sci-fi tropes (alien savior, educational transformation) with minimal subversion. The "lonely church organ" and puzzle tile are conceptually fresh but occasionally veer into purple prose. Nuanced emotional beats are replaced with declarations like "fierce tenderness."

  * grade_story_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Originality shines in combining cybernetics with oral tradition, but occasional phrases like "pulsating heart" lean on familiar machinery-as-living-metaphors; the telescope's symbolism avoids cliché, as does the nuanced handling of "unease" rather than outright dread.

  * grade_story_258.txt (grade=4.2)
    Reliance on archetype-heavy phrasing ("ancient oaks," "storm of secrets") suggests algorithmic tropes rather than fresh conceptualization. Emotional beats are often stated rather than dramatized. The "jaded wonder" tone remains abstract, never manifesting through concrete character behavior or ironic juxtaposition.

  * grade_story_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    Uncommon elements like twist-tie/bee connection avoid clichés but veer toward gimmickry; prose avoids purple patches but lacks distinctive voice.

  * grade_story_260.txt (grade=5.0)
    Contains formulaic elements (sanctuaries for lost souls, keys as metaphors) without fresh subversion. Over-reliance on explanatory phrases like "yearning for peace" rather than evocative showing. Some AI-like patterns appear in transitions between physical action and metaphysical effect.

  * grade_story_256.txt (grade=4.9)
    Originality in blending mundane guard life with surreal cafe exists, but phrases like "soft edges of time" and "frothy despair" risk poetic abstraction as a crutch. Sensory details (patina on spoon, cloud-like ground) are specific but occasionally overtaken by ornate syntax. Emotional resonance is mixed—transitions between worlds feel organic, yet character psychology remains stylized rather than deeply human.

  * grade_story_264.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stylized prose risks purple prose ("hauntingly cheerful light," "unyielding pursuit of wonder"). Tropes (eccentric genius, cynic-to-believer arc) remain unchallenged. Mechanical transitions ("As the ninth inning began") suggest imposed structure rather than organic progression.

  * grade_story_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Avoids clichés through unconventional pairings (floating yoga studio, jagged generosity). Emotional states are shown rather than told, with minimal purple prose and consistent tonal integrity.

  * grade_story_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    Some tropes (haunted location, redemption arc) are used conventionally. Language avoids overt purple prose but occasionally leans on predictable descriptors (“layered tranquility”). Emotional beats rely on exposition rather than subtext; originality is stifled by formulaic transitions.

  * grade_story_267.txt (grade=2.9)
    Blacksmith's anvil in space resort strains credibility without explanation. "Savage bliss" recycles phrase rather than creating tonal contradictions. Overused descriptors ("twisted," "intricately carved") alongside sudden tonal whiplash (bike rides to existential rebellion). Emotional revelations feel telegraphed rather than organically witnessed.

  * grade_story_268.txt (grade=9.8)
    Vigilante paradigm subverted by methodical, nonviolent tracking; wooden bead's simplicity contrasts with magical realism elements. Avoids noir tropes through Eli's introspective restraint and economic metaphors of corruption.

  * grade_story_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strength: Avoids most tropes through unique astronomical globe concept and melancholic tone. Weakness: 'Humble arrogance' phrasing borders on cliché oxymoron; certain descriptors ('ephemeral') read as concept-heavy rather than organically developed.

  * grade_story_276.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central conceit of "branches of redemption" is refreshingly unorthodox, but occasional abstract phrasing (“cosmic ballet”) and the lone-scholar-in-space trope lean on familiar literary rhythms, slightly diminishing originality.

  * grade_story_269.txt (grade=6.3)
    Relies on steampunk and parallel worlds clichés without subverting them; prose avoids purple patches but occasionally defaults to formulaic imagery.

  * grade_story_272.txt (grade=4.5)
    Uninspired phrasing ("whirlwind of cynicism"), predictable tropes (lonely inventor), and strained symbolism undermine originality; avoids overt AI flaws but lacks stylistic boldness.

  * grade_story_271.txt (grade=6.0)
    Original premise undermined by tropes ("hidden compartment epiphany") and occasionally artificial diction ("consistent strangeness"); character psychology occasionally simplifies to binary oppositions rather than nuanced evolution.

  * grade_story_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Avoids overt clichés but uses familiar "quest for hidden knowledge" tropes. Writing style is lyrical without descending into purple prose, though Harold's perspective lacks distinctive voice or subversive nuance.

  * grade_story_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The use of vintage wine bottles and a yarn swift avoids cliché, but other elements veer into familiar tropes (the humble hero, the isolated fortress). The prose occasionally becomes ornate ('glass echoing laughter of the past') without adding substantive depth, risking purple prose.

  * grade_story_277.txt (grade=6.0)
    Avoids overt clichés but relies on predictable arcs (small character's self-discovery). Some phrasing ("whispered there was more") veers into poetic abstraction without fresh imagery. Tonal consistency wavers in transitions between Eliot's interiority and external plot.

    Originality in concept clashes with formulaic elements (e.g., "burning comet" as generic portent); metaphors are occasionally cliché.

  * grade_story_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Avoids overt purple prose but contains generic descriptors ("murky tenderness," "dance of dust") that feel imposed rather than organically rendered.

  * grade_story_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids genre tropes through eccentric combinations (beekeeping + quasars), but some phrasing ('star-snow,' 'celestial beasts') verges on excessive poeticism; emotional stakes are hinted at rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_279.txt (grade=5.7)
    Occasional purple prose ("living rhythm of the desert") and generic descriptors ("monumental," "antiquated"). The "bent paperclip" spark feels contrived. Subtext about human vs. nature is shallow, lacking subversive insight.

  * grade_story_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    Contains tropes (abandoned carnival, crossroad demons) with minimal subversion. Some forced language ("desperate optimism") and uneven emotional showing vs. telling. Attempts subtext about cultural erosion but lacks originality.

  * grade_story_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    Relies on haunted-dummy tropes and predictable redemption arcs. The dummy’s “shifting expressions” and “scorching poise” lean on clichéd phrasing. Overuse of portentous adjectives/adverbs (“hollow, in the hold”) weakens originality. Tension between literal/metaphorical sustenance feels derivative.

  * grade_story_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids overt clichés but relies on mystical "essence of life" tropes. Some phrases ("fragments of radio," "metronome heartbeat") verge on pretentious. Emotional nuance is mostly stated rather than shown; character reasoning occasionally feels mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_286.txt (grade=6.7)
    "Echoes of authenticity" becomes abstracted; overly reliant on atmospheric descriptions rather than concrete evidence of character transformation

  * grade_story_282.txt (grade=3.8)
    Repetitive descriptors ("fiery hair," "fiery temper"), formulaic "found object with hidden meaning" trope, and overwrought metaphors ("dancing dust chamber") suggest lack of originality; tone shifts unnaturally between gritty realism and poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    Overly generic descriptors ("delicate balance between worlds," "rancor that shattered worlds") suggest trope recycling. The hermit crab analogy feels imposed rather than organically connected to the plot. Emotional beats are explicitly stated rather than embedded in action. World-building skews toward checklist-based originality rather than cohesive mythology.

  * grade_story_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ambiguous balance between originality (voicemails as relics) and familiar fantasy tropes (magic prisms). Language occasionally indulges in redundant poetics ("kaleidoscope of colors") but avoids overt formulism. Emotional beats feel authentic if predictable.

  * grade_story_288.txt (grade=3.2)
    Overly ornate phrases ("meekness of craftsmanship") and forced elements like pandemic-era quarantine tropes feel formulaic; emotional resonance remains surface-level.

  * grade_story_289.txt (grade=5.8)
    Excessive florid description ("dance of awkward elegance") borders on purple prose. Recurring metaphor about fragility/strength lacks subversive dimension. Character logic feels simplified, particularly societal impact mechanics.

  * grade_story_290.txt (grade=5.0)

    Some clichéd phrases ("cheerful gloom," "interconnected paths") and predictable conflict resolution; avoids overt formulaic writing but lacks subversive originality.

  * grade_story_298.txt (grade=4.9)
    Heavy reliance on decay tropes and dramatic irony ("stage actor solving mysteries") betray algorithmic pattern recognition. Sensory details veer between specificity and vagueness; emotional honesty concept feels imported rather than earned through tangible conflict.

  * grade_story_287.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overreliance on gothic tropes (overgrown library, ancient tome) with minimal subversion. Descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("careful wildness"). Character reasoning simplistic—optimism never challenged.

  * grade_story_29.txt (grade=3.1)
    Overloaded with archetypal tropes (knight, machine, magic object) and purple prose. The "machine that cycles regrets" borrows from speculative fiction without innovation, while descriptions like "dark heartbeat" demonstrate algorithmic repetition of gothic motifs.

  * grade_story_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story avoids formulaic AI traps but relies on well-worn fantasy motifs (lost cities, mystical artisans) without subverting them. Sensory details (scent of leather/ink) are fresh, but phrases like “sanctuary for the eccentric and the dreamers” veer toward cliché. The stranger’s desperation and Kael’s rebellion lack idiosyncratic nuance, occasionally feeling like archetypes rather than vivid individuals.

  * grade_story_292.txt (grade=2.3)
    Relies heavily on clichés ("heart of gold," "tapestry of stories") and generic archetypes; metaphors feel familiar rather than freshly observed or subversive.

  * grade_story_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    While avoiding overt tropes, the narrative leans on familiar "enlightenment through nature" frameworks. Descriptions often prioritize ornate phrasing over precision, and the internal conflict lacks nuanced psychological depth.

  * grade_story_303.txt (grade=3.9)
    Riddled with AI-generated fingerprints: repetitive poeticisms ("dignified chaos"), overused cosmic imagery, characters as symbolic placeholders rather than people; world-building follows expected multiverse tropes without subversion

  * grade_story_301.txt (grade=4.9)
    Trope-heavy (obsessed scholar trope), clichéd metaphors. Overly ornate descriptors ("whirlwind of thoughts") feel formulaic. Human-cost consequences treated abstractly. Writing style shows little distinctive authorial fingerprint.

  * grade_story_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Idea of riddles as cosmic dialogue is fresh but execution relies on trope; natural descriptions avoid cliché while "market wisdom" feels generic; language remains purposeful without excess ornamentation.

  * grade_story_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids AI clichés in metaphors like "tinderbox clutched in his hand" as existential threat, but descriptors like "brazen humility" occasionally border on abstract affectation without concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overreliance on familiar tropes (lone antiheroine, relic hunt) with minimal reinvention. Prose alternates between artificial grandiosity ("whispered secrets of the cosmos") and stiff exposition. Emotional beats are stated rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_305.txt (grade=5.7)
    Relies on clichéd "ancient artifact" tropes without subversion. Prose occasionally drifts into melodrama ("gathering of echoes") while underutilizing unique combinations (technical mischief). Emotional responses are stated rather than shown.

  * grade_story_296.txt (grade=5.8)
    Chopsticks and spiritual mapping lean on familiar esoteric tropes; the submarine setting avoids cliché but feels disconnected from the story’s metaphysical focus, creating tonal dissonance.

  * grade_story_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Avoids extreme tropes (mad genius) with fresh elements (vibration chamber, etched glass), but the "empty treasure" twist is somewhat predictable; prose is purposeful but occasionally generic.

  * grade_story_304.txt (grade=5.0)
    Overreliance on elaborate metaphors borders on purple prose. The assassin’s arc follows familiar “hitman with a heart” tropes, and the philosopher’s passive acceptance feels contrived. Sensory details occasionally sacrifice specificity for grandeur.

  * grade_story_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Avoids overt clichés but contains traces of AI-patterned phrasing ("whirling virtual windstorm"); Mira's tech prowess occasionally feels contrived (e.g., easily repairing decades-old VR device strains suspension of disbelief).

  * grade_story_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids major tropes through specific historical-artistic fusion but relies on overwrought descriptors ("ethereal glow") and predictable redemption arc structure.

  * grade_story_307.txt (grade=5.7)
    Moments of fresh concept (neon signs as rebellion) contrast with predictable tropes (cynical city redeemed). Writing avoids excessive ornamentation but occasionally leans on familiar emotional beats ("spark of belief reigniting"). Subtext and tension between old and new lack the layered complexity needed for high literary distinction.

  * grade_story_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar motifs (haunted detective, sentimental keepsakes); prose occasionally veers into ornate description without deeper purpose.

  * grade_story_317.txt (grade=4.7)

  * grade_story_308.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_316.txt (grade=4.7)
    Blends original settings but often defaults to romanticized clichés ("seraphic," "reimagined") without subverting expectations; transitions (e.g., temple to arcade) feel algorithmically generated rather than organically motivated.

  * grade_story_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Original premise subverts genre expectations by merging mysticism with quantum theory, but contains occasional clichés in Eamon's "redemption" arc and uneven emotional nuance.

  * grade_story_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids most tropes but occasionally succumbs to ornate abstraction ("catacomb of crystals"); character psychology feels partially externalized rather than deeply interior.

  * grade_story_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    Attempts freshness with the "abrasive calm" tone and cosmic silence concept, but the infernal setting and hourglass verge on cliché. Prose occasionally drifts into ornate description ("swirling pattern of regret") that detracts from immediacy. Emotional stakes are stated more than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escaping via melodies defies tropes, but coin toss origin feels contrived. Avoids formulaic phrasing; prose balances introspection and lyricism. Predictability of simulation escape mitigated by haunting atmosphere.

  * grade_story_320.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conceptually intriguing but relies on genre tropes (cosmic imbalance, timelines); social media feels jarringly anachronistic.

  * grade_story_313.txt (grade=5.4)
    Ideas like "taunt the jaws of defeat" are phrase-heavy rather than conceptually fresh. Ghost trope follows predictable redemption arc. Writing avoids purple prose but leans on familiar dystopian motifs (oppressive overseers, propaganda broadcasts) without subversion.

  * grade_story_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose veers into overwritten phrases ("songs of the wind," "whispering dunes") and predictable contrasts between confinement and freedom. The "rhythm of the rain" concept is original but explained abstractly, bordering on mystical. Emotional beats often told rather than shown (e.g., "eager resignation").

  * grade_story_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mix of fresh ideas (bulletin board hijacking) and well-worn tropes (orphaned mentor figure). Prose avoids overt purple patches but occasionally favors elegant phrases over precision ("methodically chaotic magic"). Emotional beats signaled rather than earned through subtext.

  * grade_story_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Some predictable tropes (brain-in-jar) and generic descriptors ("eerie light") undermine originality. Tension between "clearly ambiguous" and narrative coherence feels unresolved.

  * grade_story_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    Elements like "cosmic blink" and "braided bitterness" border on overwritten abstraction. While the mask’s role feels organic, the office’s transformation reads predictably, with generic descriptors ("bitterness," "chaos") overshadowing fresh subtext or narrative surprises.

  * grade_story_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids overt clichés but relies on familiar "lonely guardian" archetypes. The "overheard stories" method verges on contrivance—their sudden usefulness strains credibility. Strongest originality lies in merging corporate dystopia with lunar isolation; weakest is the photograph trope's predictable sentimentalism.

  * grade_story_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    Contains moments of fresh imagination (quantum garden/withering trade-off) but relies on familiar tropes (sacrificing paradise for knowledge). The "honestly dishonest" descriptor becomes overly literal rather than nuanced. Prose occasionally veers excessive ("fluid reality") but avoids systemic purple prose or algorithmic repetition.

  * grade_story_325.txt (grade=2.9)
    Clichéd mad scientist archetype recycled without meaningful subversion. Overeager pile-up of tropes (storm as metaphor, ancestral films, carnivorous plants as quasi-horrific) produces narrative whiplash. Purple prose affects descriptions of phenomena. Character psychology reduced to simplistic binary. Tension between science and mysticism remains superficially gestural.

  * grade_story_323.txt (grade=5.3)
    Relies on familiar whimsical-AI tropes (eccentric characters, overly ornate phrasing) with minimal subversion; metaphors like “knots as wishes” lack freshness, and emotional nuance feels curated rather than organic.

  * grade_story_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    Originality in conceit (haggling with reality) contrasts with formulaic mentor/student dynamics; avoids overt clichés but sometimes veers into poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    Original premise diluted by intermittently ornate phrasing ("spaces between borrowed books") and predictable emotional beats in revival.

  * grade_story_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar tropes (haunted academia, lost rituals) without sufficient subversion. Prose is mostly clear but occasionally drifts into formulaic phrasing ("pounding heart," "whispers of the past"). Character motivations lack nuanced emotional layering.

  * grade_story_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Originality is uneven—some concepts (pendulum-as-metaphor) are fresh, while others (traveling salesman with hidden quest) lean on tropes; prose occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing but maintains a distinct voice.

  * grade_story_339.txt (grade=5.3)
    Generic sensory phrases and formulaic metaphors ("prismatic lake," "squeaking seesaw") undercut originality; tone shifts lack cohesion.

  * grade_story_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mixed originality. Hydroponic noodles vs. chess grandmaster combine inventively, but tropes (suspicious locals, puzzle quests) feel algorithmically recycled. Purple prose ("agonizing bliss") mars clarity.

  * grade_story_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    Overly formulaic fantasy elements; stilted transitions between modern and ancient; emotional beats explicitly stated; lacks stylistic individuality; resolution feels algorithmically predictable.

  * grade_story_319.txt (grade=6.3)
    Contains fresh conceptual elements (alchemy phial connection to earth/sea) but relies on predictable narrative patterns (magic catalyst enabling self-actualization). Occasional over-ornamentation ("moth to flame") slightly diminishes emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids overt clichés but shows minor AI patterning (repetitive "dance hall" descriptors); prose balances ornamentation with clarity.

  * grade_story_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Originality diluted by steampunk clichés and overly poetic phrasing; character reasoning occasionally feels algorithmically logical rather than human.

  * grade_story_34.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overreliance on abstract, occasionally cliché phrasing ("tides of compromise," "hammered shapes") borders on purple prose. The sentinel-in-an-airport concept is intriguing but executed through formulaic emotional beats and sudden, unearned tonal shifts.

  * grade_story_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids major clichés; unique premise elevated by subtle twists on "mundane beauty," though occasional generic phrasing mars originality.

  * grade_story_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally strains credibility (e.g., sentinel archetype’s self-awareness); metaphors feel fresh but occasionally overwhelming (e.g., “thunder from gods of mediocrity”); emotional beats lean on symbolic resonance over human-scale specificity; style remains distinctive despite occasional over-decorated sentences.

  * grade_story_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Worldbuilding leans on familiar dystopian-artistic decay tropes; amber/spider concept borders on mystical cliché; occasional purple prose ("echo of a prayer") undermines subtlety; pacing avoids formulaicity but lacks distinct voice.

  * grade_story_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    Originality undermined by exorcist/grimoire tropes. Overly ornate phrases (“symphony of wildlife”) clog momentum. Emotional shifts are told rather than shown, and the “clock skipping a beat” trope feels lazy. The twist avoids predictability but strains logic.

  * grade_story_342.txt (grade=6.7)
    Original concept obscured by familiar archetypes; some purple prose but glove's organic connection to memories feels novel.

  * grade_story_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids most clichés through unique elements like desert glass sculpture, but exhibits trace AI-flavored generality in phrases like "ordered disarray" and "vibrant colors." The archivist's sudden shift from observer to leader contains logical gaps that strain human nuance, while avoiding excessive purple prose maintains stylistic clarity.

  * grade_story_344.txt (grade=5.3)
    Relies on stock tropes (magic heirlooms, tragic strangers) without subversion. Overuse of adverbs (“lightly heavyhearted,” “quietly bold”) and abstract emotion labels (“sorrow and regret”) leans AI-generic. The jam-tasting conceit borders on absurdity.

  * grade_story_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Avoids tropes through unconventional elements like a wasp nest prison and "lint-filled pocket." Some phrasing (e.g., "intimately impersonal hum") veers into cliché, but the wire-cutting method as a symbolic act is inventive.

  * grade_story_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    While avoiding genre clichés, descriptions occasionally veer into self-conscious lyricism ("whispers into silence," "dance of shadows") that feels algorithmically generated rather than organically observed.

  * grade_story_351.txt (grade=2.4)
    Generative fingerprints are visible: repetitive descriptors like "ivy-covered" and "shadowy fingers," overused phrases ("decaying grandeur"), and a static plot that feels algorithmically paced.

  * grade_story_35.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_361.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_412.txt (grade=5.4)
    Originality is diluted by genre tropes (haunted assassin, coded relic) and predictable psychological shorthand (nightmares as "keys to secrets").

  * grade_story_428.txt (grade=4.9)
