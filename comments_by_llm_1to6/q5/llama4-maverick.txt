    The narrative exhibits signs of formulaic construction: a predictable quest arc, reliance on stated emotions, generic descriptions, and somewhat clunky or repetitive phrasing (e.g., 'oddly seldom,' 'cracked leather case'). The combination of elements feels more like prompt fulfillment than organic storytelling, lacking originality and nuanced execution.

  * grade_story_83.txt (grade=2.2)
    The narrative employs several clich√©s ("labyrinth of broken mirrors," "thick with the scent of decay," "fateful encounters," "sowing seeds of a better tomorrow") without fresh perspective. The integration of disparate elements feels formulaic, like ticking boxes. Character reasoning (candle wick revealing complex research) lacks nuance. The tone shifts awkwardly with the introduction of "mischievous wisdom." Language is functional but lacks a unique style.

  * grade_story_87.txt (grade=2.5)
    The writing exhibits signs of formulaic construction. The repetitive "she felt..." structure for conveying emotion is a significant weakness, suggesting a lack of stylistic nuance. Phrases like "weight lifting from her shoulders" and "sense of closure washing over her" are clich√©s. The combination of disparate elements (steampunk, mixtapes, stickers, specific emotional states like "hyperactively serene" and "savage grace") feels somewhat arbitrary and potentially prompt-driven, rather than organically arising from a unique vision. Emotional handling is superficial and stated.

  * grade_story_86.txt (grade=2.5)
    The piece exhibits formulaic phrasing ("neon lights danced," "steeled herself") and relies on clich√©s (pit of lies, generic cyberpunk). The combination of disparate elements, particularly the hot air balloon festival memory, feels artificial and suggests adherence to prompts over organic storytelling, a common AI tell. Emotional portrayal is superficial and stated. Lacks a distinctive voice or originality.

  * grade_story_89.txt (grade=1.2)
    Excessive repetition of key phrases ("confusing certainty," "whispers," "rusted nail," "materially spiritual," "buried time capsules," "disintegrate") creates a formulaic, almost machine-like feel. Concepts are introduced and then repeatedly mentioned without development. The narrative follows a predictable pattern of stating belief and resolve without nuance or originality.

  * grade_story_9.txt (grade=3.1)
    Relies on some clich√©d phrasing ("fate hung precariously," "world burns"). While the combination of elements is somewhat unusual, the narrative progression and emotional expression feel formulaic. Emotions are often stated directly rather than conveyed through nuanced action or subtext.

  * grade_story_91.txt (grade=3.5)
    Relies on tropes (bullet-holed fedora, lone figure vs. sterile world) without significant subversion. Phrases like 'monolith to the mechanical world' and 'bastion of mechanization' feel somewhat clich√©. The cloud shadow mechanism feels contrived, and emotions are often explicitly stated rather than evoked.

  * grade_story_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the core premise is original, the execution includes some generic phrasing associated with AI characters ("circuits thrumming," "digital soul," "newfound sense of purpose"). The central artifact (tin type) feels incongruous rather than cleverly subversive. Emotional nuance is limited, often stated directly ("felt the weight"). The writing avoids excessive purple prose but lacks a truly distinctive, individual style.

  * grade_story_92.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies heavily on gothic tropes (haunted mansion, mysterious wealthy owner, eerie silence) without significant subversion. Some phrasing feels overly ornate ("color that had bled from day into night seemed to seep into my very being"). The core conflict and character motivation lack nuanced originality.

  * grade_story_95.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative exhibits signs of formulaic writing: repetitive phrases, reliance on the clich√© of an external storm mirroring internal struggle, and stated emotions ("felt a sense of pride"). The setting's integration feels artificial. The prose occasionally dips into slightly purple territory ("timidly loud passion," "secrets pouring forth like a river"). The resolution is predictable and lacks human nuance, feeling more like a logical endpoint than an earned emotional beat. The combination of elements feels forced rather than original.

  * grade_story_98.txt (grade=4.5)
    While avoiding overt AI tells, the prose contains slightly ornate or generic phrasing ("intimately distant," "weaving a hypnotic spell," "heavy with the weight of tradition"). The concept isn't strikingly original, and the emotional portrayal lacks nuance. The dog walking element feels like an arbitrary inclusion rather than an organic story component.

  * grade_story_94.txt (grade=3.5)
    The writing exhibits signs of formulaic construction, particularly the jarring inclusion of 'tracking cloud trails' and the underutilized 'time travel' element, suggesting elements forced into a template. Phrases like 'gravity of desires' and 'cage of illusions' are repeated but lack fresh execution. Emotional states are often declared rather than evoked through nuanced action or description.

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=2.5)
    The writing suffers from purple prose ("morbidly fascinating aroma," "grandiose subtlety") and relies on familiar tropes (mystic quest, abandoned places, glowing eyes) without fresh perspective. The contradiction between the "strictly casual" attribute and the described intensity feels like a significant flaw, potentially indicative of formulaic construction unable to handle nuance. Emotional depth is stated, not earned.

  * grade_story_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the combination of elements has potential originality, the rapid transformation via external kindness follows a somewhat predictable therapeutic trope. Phrases like "beacon of hope" and the neat unraveling metaphor verge on clich√©. The character's swift change lacks the messy nuance of genuine psychological shifts, hinting at a formulaic approach to resolution.

  * grade_story_96.txt (grade=1.0)
    The story exhibits strong signs of formulaic writing, particularly the excessive and unnatural repetition of assigned keywords ("statically unique," "unplanned," "disinterested passion," "brimming cup," "encore," "seize"). Phrases like "statically unique" and "disinterested passion" are inherently awkward and feel machine-generated or poorly prompted. Metaphors are generic and repeated. Emotion is stated rather than evoked. The narrative lacks a distinct authorial voice and feels templated around fulfilling constraints, sacrificing authenticity and originality.

  * grade_story_97.txt (grade=3.0)
    The prose leans towards purple, with phrases like "whispered minute" and "optimistic desperation" feeling overly ornate and somewhat generic within this style. Emotion is frequently stated ("heart ached," "felt the weight...lifting") rather than shown with nuance. The combination of "fact-minded" and the mystical journey feels inconsistent. Relies on the trope of a symbolic journey without significant subversion.

  * grade_story_93.txt (grade=1.9)
    The story exhibits several signs of formulaic writing: reliance on clich√©s ("bore down like a physical force," "flooding back," "crushing reality," "newfound sense of determination"), stated emotions, and somewhat generic descriptions. The combination of disparate elements feels artificial, and the narrative progression towards a sudden 'understanding' is predictable. Metaphors are scarce and unremarkable. Lacks a unique style or nuanced emotional portrayal.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    Avoids overt clich√©s but leans on fantasy tropes (sentient statues, enchanted settings) without subverting them. Language is occasionally ornate, bordering on purple prose. The cosmic deception idea lacks novelty, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=3.9)
    Excessive reliance on contradictory descriptors ('cheerless duelist,' 'elasticizing perspective') creates dissonance. Recurrent 'magoty/chest' and 'humming servers' imagery lacks evolution. Prose oscillates between purple pretension ('bittersweet reckoning') and clinical abstraction, undercutting emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=3.0)
    Relys on generic "haunted protagonist finds redemption" trope; repetitive phrases ("echoes in the dark," "numb fascination") and exaggerated emotional shifts suggest mechanical writing patterns.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    Relies on mystical clich√©s ('gifts of the fog') and inconsistent metaphors. The spy gadget pen is unique but poorly contextualized‚Äîwhy would a minstrel carry it?

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Original premise undermined by occasional overwrought descriptions ("dark, quietly flamboyant world") and slightly formulaic juxtaposition of violence with artistic introspection.

  * grade_story_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Attempts to subvert tropes (e.g., troubadour‚Äôs unconventional method) are undermined by predictable structures (singer faces danger, survives through unique power).

  * grade_story_127.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_134.txt (grade=5.9)
    Unusual combination of elements (salt chamber, cardboard box) avoids clich√© but leans on overused mystical motifs (ancient groves, prophetic warnings); descriptive flourishes border on purple prose without fully innovating genre tropes.

    Creative amalgamation of dream-logic and industrial ruin avoids genre tropes. Some phrases ("whispers of the past") feel cliched. Sentences occasionally over-embellish, but rhythmic flow maintains momentum. Nuanced emotional beats sacrificed for poetic cadence.

  * grade_story_81.txt (grade=4.7)
    Overuse of abstract adjectives and recursive metaphors ("otherworldly thread," "intricate patterns") verges on purple prose; originality obscured by stylistic excess.

  * grade_story_84.txt (grade=4.9)
    Formulaic structure (hero vs. omnipotent foe, riddles-to-power trope) dominates with minimal subversion. Overly precise descriptors ("ancient stone streets," "frenzied tranquility") feel checklist-driven rather than authentically atmospheric. The protagonist's reasoning is logically consistent but emotionally flat, with emotional stakes primarily told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_82.txt (grade=3.0)
    Clich√©d descriptions ("twisted roots," "forgotten farmhouse") and predictive narrative structure suggest algorithmic tropes rather than genuine literary voice

  * grade_story_86.txt (grade=2.7)
    Relies heavily on purple prose and overwrought phrasing ("across bones of ancient timeline"). Predictable contrasts between light/dark. Symbolism feels algorithmically generated rather than deliberately constructed. Emotional beats are surface-level.

  * grade_story_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overtly ornate prose ("tapestries of memories") and mechanical poetic structure undermine nuance; premise innovative but execution occasionally veers into AI-generated cadence.

  * grade_story_83.txt (grade=4.9)
    Relies on well-worn tropes: abandoned labs, forgotten experiments, solitary investigator. Repetitive phrasing like "truth...secrets...sowing seeds" feels formulaic. Overuse of adverbs ("frantically," "hastily") and emotionally vague descriptors ("excitement and trepidation"). No meaningful subversion of genre expectations.

  * grade_story_9.txt (grade=5.7)
    Avoids overt clich√©s but slips into overwritten flourishes (e.g., "molten sarcasm") and predictable despair-to-hope transitions.

  * grade_story_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    Unique elements (floating spa) undercut by redemption clich√©s; character reactions occasionally feel overdetermined rather than organic.

  * grade_story_93.txt (grade=4.5)
    Attempts originality with esoteric concepts, but over-reliance on clich√©d "desperation" tropes and vague subtext suggest formulaic underpinnings.

  * grade_story_89.txt (grade=2.9)
    Derivative phrasing ("chains of oppression," "whispers of ancient legends") and circular logic suggest formulaic structure; metaphors are generic, and tone shifts feel unearned rather than intentional.

  * grade_story_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Avoids overt clich√©s in atmosphere but relies on predictable Gothic tropes; blood drive subplot feels contrived. Language occasionally veers into ornate phrasing without subverting expectations.

  * grade_story_85.txt (grade=2.9)
    Relies on trope-laden fantasy conventions; flowery abstraction and lack of subtext suggest formulaic AI patterning rather than deliberate craft.

  * grade_story_95.txt (grade=2.9)
    Chekhov's Gun absent‚Äîstorm HQ, eons of silent wonder, and "timidly loud" feel extrinsic; repetitive phrasing ("enrich his understanding") and formulaic emotional arcs suggest AI-generated patterns.

  * grade_story_91.txt (grade=3.0)
    Riddled with generic phrases ("pang of longing," "whispers of the old world") and predictable tropes (lab experiment seeking belonging). The "quiet tuning" concept reads as empty jargon. Sensory details are overgeneralized, and the conflict lacks original stakes.

  * grade_story_87.txt (grade=3.8)
    Exhibits formulaic phrasing ("hollow victory," "festering wound") and tonal whiplash between "savage grace" and serene librarian tropes. Steampunk and sticker-sheet elements feel contrived; metaphors lack originality. Emotional beats are explicitly stated rather than implied. Writing style vacillates between purple prose and flat exposition.

  * grade_story_96.txt (grade=2.0)
    Riddled with clich√©d imagery ("wily crone," "twinkled like stars") and formulaic phrasing; repetitive use of "unplanned" and "statically unique" suggests algorithmic scaffolding; excessive ornate abstractions without concrete grounding; zero tension between language and narrative.

  * grade_story_97.txt (grade=2.9)
    Prose veers between florid clich√©s and disorienting surrealism; struggles to balance originality against derivative emotional shorthand.

  * grade_story_94.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stylized prose occasionally veers into abstraction-as-substance; time travel and cloud-tracking concepts feel more conceptually forced than organically explored; metaphors occasionally compensate for narrative thinness.

  * grade_story_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids overt clich√©s but flirts with pseudo-profound motifs. Similes/mix of registers (e.g., ‚Äúchopstick wrapper‚Äù vs. ‚Äútapestry of lost legends‚Äù) add uniqueness, but prose occasionally slips into formulaic mysticism without humanizing nuance.

  * grade_story_98.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwrought phrases ("hypnotic spell," "complex web of symbols") tip into purple prose. Predictable secret society tropes and inconsistent emotional nuance suggest algorithmic defaults over authentic reinvention.
