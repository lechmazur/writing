  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose contains several clichés ("sanctuary for artists," "weathered hearts," "swirl of creativity") and stated emotions that feel formulaic. The "manic clarity" tone is asserted but not convincingly rendered. The illogical timeframe insertion feels like a significant flaw often seen in less sophisticated generation.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=2.2)
    The narrative feels highly formulaic, like disparate elements forced together. Phrases like "shiver down my spine," "edge of madness," "wash over me" are clichés. The "mundanely spiritual aura" is an awkward, potentially AI-like construction. The resolution is psychologically simplistic and predictable. The combination of elements feels artificial rather than organically original.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=1.9)
    Exhibits clear signs of formulaic writing: repetitive phrases ("evolving hopes," "analytically creative mind"), stated emotions, generic descriptions ("dimly lit," "warm, golden light"), and a predictable plot trajectory. The assigned tone ("earnest mockery") is ignored, suggesting a failure to handle nuance. The rapid, simplistic resolution feels artificial and lacks human complexity.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=3.0)
    While the combination of elements is somewhat novel, the prose contains awkward ("precisely innovative," "elasticizing their perspective") and repetitive phrasing. Emotional states and thematic connections are explicitly stated, lacking nuance and subtext, which can feel formulaic or AI-like. Sensory details beyond the initial setup are sparse.

== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B ==
  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on fantasy tropes (sentient statues, enchanted settings) without subverting them. Language is occasionally ornate, bordering on purple prose. The cosmic deception idea lacks novelty, and emotional nuance feels stated rather than shown.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=3.9)
    Excessive reliance on contradictory descriptors ('cheerless duelist,' 'elasticizing perspective') creates dissonance. Recurrent 'magoty/chest' and 'humming servers' imagery lacks evolution. Prose oscillates between purple pretension ('bittersweet reckoning') and clinical abstraction, undercutting emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=3.0)
    Relys on generic "haunted protagonist finds redemption" trope; repetitive phrases ("echoes in the dark," "numb fascination") and exaggerated emotional shifts suggest mechanical writing patterns.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies on familiar tropes (creative sanctuary, parade-induced revelation) without subversion. Language veers toward cliché and overwrought phrasing.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=4.3)
    Formulaic use of "magical object unites people" trope. Analytically creative trait feels tacked on. Overly neat resolution shows algorithmic tendencies rather than organic storytelling.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    Evocative imagery is undercut by phrases like “joyful agony” and “lines of a thousand midnights,” which flirt with cliché; emotional depth is implied more than shown, leaning on poetic abstraction over human specificity.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=3.7)
    Overly reliant on well-worn motifs (mysterious museums, rebellion against conformity). Purple prose ("maze of intricacies," "labyrinthine repository") obscures originality. Mechanical repetition of phrases like "delicate balance" and predictable binary oppositions (sameness vs. individuality) suggest formulaic thinking.

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=2.3)
    Riddled with clichéd phrasing ("luminous doubt," "uncharted horizons") and predictable redemption arc; fails to subvert common tropes or establish distinctive voice.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=3.0)
    Relies heavily on familiar redemption tropes with minimal subversion. Phrases like 'spark of zest ignited' and 'weight of his sullenness lifting' exemplify formulaic emotional beats. Metaphorical connections between elements feel predetermined rather than organically discovered. Overuses abstract concepts at the expense of concrete sensory specifics.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=3.3)
    Prose veers between overwritten abstraction ("frantic peace," "pulsed with otherworldly energy") and mechanical repetition, with no subversion of genre tropes around soul mirrors, magical discoveries, or redemptive epiphanies.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies on clichés (sabotage, magical object); repetitive phrases ("gentle overturn") and generic descriptors detract from originality; tone shifts feel forced rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=6.0)
    Formulaic emotional arc; heavy-handed symbolism (mitten = humanity); inconsistent tonal shifts between poetic abstraction and procedural terminology like "operation."

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overreliance on vague abstractions ("serene anger," "whispered legacy") leans into purple prose; predictable secret society trope without subversion; lacks cohesive tonal identity.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    Relies on mystical clichés ('gifts of the fog') and inconsistent metaphors. The spy gadget pen is unique but poorly contextualized—why would a minstrel carry it? Overwrites some passages ('whispers of ancient secrets'), while under-explaining others (family tradition). Characters feel archetypal rather than subversive.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Original premise undermined by occasional overwrought descriptions ("dark, quietly flamboyant world") and slightly formulaic juxtaposition of violence with artistic introspection.

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Original premise weakened by occasionally overwrought language and introspective clichés; some metaphors feel calculated rather than organic

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    Some flowery phrasing but avoids overt tropes; character logic lacks nuance; connections between elements feel algorithmically forced.

  * grade_story_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    Contains overly ornate phrasing ("year's final breath") that distracts from deeper emotional work. The dream-hopping conceit avoids genre clichés but leans too heavily on abstract diction. Human nuance is sacrificed to poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    Repetitive phrasing ("liminal time," "hopeful excavations") and formulaic transitions. Sensory details like "solder and ozone" feel generic rather than world-building specific. Subtext could be more organic.

  * grade_story_117.txt (grade=4.2)
    Relies heavily on genre tropes (haunted mansions, mystical musical discoveries) with minimal subversion; language alternates between florid and vague, creating uneven tone.

  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids major clichés but contains generic phrases ("gentle sharpness") and formulaic transitions; character logic leans mechanistic rather than psychologically textured.

  * grade_story_118.txt (grade=0.9)
    Uses clichéd metaphors; repetitive phrase structures; generic emotional descriptors; formulaic transitions; overly elaborate style without purpose; lacks human emotional complexity; feels algorithmically generated; excessive vagueness indicates conceptual failure.

  * grade_story_12.txt (grade=4.4)
    Florid comparisons ("sterile surfaces giving way to vibrant hues") border on purple prose; reliance on overused motifs (mapping as emotional journey, brokenness as beauty); character psychology follows formulaic "aloof-softening" arc; atmospheric contrasts feel derivative; attempts at uniqueness collapse into generic romanticism.

  * grade_story_122.txt (grade=4.1)
    Repetitive phrasing ("frantic," "euphoric agitation") and clichéd storm descriptions. Overwrought prose ("kaleidoscope of color") overshadows originality. Nuance and subtext absent.

  * grade_story_119.txt (grade=3.0)
    Purple prose abounds ("tangible reminder of unyielding compassion"); repetitive descriptors ("rusting," "whispers") and predictable atmospheric choices suggest formulaic writing; attempts to be profound through abstraction rather than original observation.

  * grade_story_125.txt (grade=4.9)

  * grade_story_45.txt (grade=3.1)

  * grade_story_464.txt (grade=1.9)
    Purple prose dominates ("cascade of forgotten memories," "whispers of the past"); formulaic sentence structures ("with a flick of her wrist..."); trope-heavy narrative (madness-inducing objet d'art) without inversion; emotional beats stated rather than demonstrated; tonal instability suggests disparate influences cobbled together; metaphors/similes generic and exhausted.

  * grade_story_465.txt (grade=5.9)
    Some fresh combinations (airship-as-home), but "mellow bard" tropes and overused metaphors ("joyful terror") dilute originality. The ruler's symbolism echoes AI-generated motifs rather than organic character artifacts.

  * grade_story_467.txt (grade=3.0)
    Relies heavily on genre tropes without innovation - underwater lost cities, mysterious tokens, serendipitous meetings. Writing often descends into purple prose with phrases like "heart full of wonder" and forced metaphors.

  * grade_story_472.txt (grade=7.0)
    Original setting and metaphors elevate the piece, but phrases like "sharp gentleness" verge on cliché. Nuanced emotional subtext exists (regret through action rather than statement), yet some passages feel overly ornate. Avoids most AI-tropes but borders on self-indulgent prose.

  * grade_story_471.txt (grade=5.8)
    Repetitive lyrical phrasing ("abandoned structures and rusting relics"), predictable ghost town tropes, and an overly neat redemption arc suggest formulaic tendencies. The "reckless hunter" concept isn't meaningfully developed, and emotional shifts feel engineered rather than organic.

  * grade_story_479.txt (grade=9.8)
    No formulaic elements detected. Writing exhibits distinctive style with original metaphors ("digital legacy" as "cold repository") and nuanced handling of paradoxical tones (jubilant remorse). Sensory details feel purposefully constructed rather than generic, avoiding cloying sentimentality.

    Repetitive adjectives and generic melancholia typical of algorithmic writing; "feral elegance" and coded lullabies border on cliché. Attempted originality in frame-as-portal undercut by unconvincing mystical mechanics.

  * grade_story_473.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally defaults to familiar juxtapositions (neglected orchard vs. industrial panels). The pruning metaphor feels fresh, yet the "lone visionary guiding lost souls" trope risks predictability. Purple prose emerges in overwrought phrases like "bittersweet grit" or descriptions of the "measured peace." Emotional resonance is present but uneven—Elian’s journey toward accepting responsibility could benefit from more human-scale细节 rather than philosophical abstraction.

    Creative premise undercut by occasionally overwrought prose and underdeveloped paradoxes (individuality vs. cosmic unity).

    Overuses Gothic tropes without subversion; "flippant solemnity" manifests as inconsistent tonal whiplash; repetitive adverbial qualifiers ("overwhelmingly," "unyieldingly") dilute impact; metaphors (darkness as adversity) feel exhausted; emotional beats rely on declarations rather than embodied experience, suggesting algorithmic pattern-recognition over nuanced insight.

  * grade_story_486.txt (grade=6.1)
    Originality in combining pantomime with sound engineering is undercut by clichéd phrases ("map of concentration") and overly ornate descriptions. The "witch's cauldron room" evokes familiar tropes rather than innovating.

  * grade_story_489.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mechanical repetition of "aggressively kind" and "brazen calm" phrases suggests formulaic emotional signaling.

  * grade_story_498.txt (grade=2.7)
    Purple prose abounds (“frost-rimed streets,” “riot of color”), favoring florid adjectives over precision. Clichéd contrasts (green vs. snow) and emotionally flat descriptors (“nervous kingpin”). Character logic feels imposed—detour to unsettle followers is unconnected to plot. Predictable themes of resistance recycled without nuance.

  * grade_story_5.txt (grade=5.5)
    Repetitive phrasing ("ancient wisdom," "humility") and concepts (amulet-induced visions) lean tropish without subversion.

  * grade_story_53.txt (grade=6.0)
    Generic "journey of self-discovery" arc without subversion. Metaphors like "vastness of the cosmos" are stale. Writing occasionally veers into purple prose ("sun dipped below the horizon," "echoes of the wind-swept fortress") and overuses adjectives. Emotional beats are stated, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_55.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_62.txt (grade=6.0)
    Unique setting juxtapositions stand out, but philosophical monologuing veers into clichéd self-importance; the cup’s symbolism avoids formulaicity, while “rewrite the code of existence” leans on modern jargon without reinvention.

  * grade_story_77.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_91.txt (grade=3.0)
    Riddled with generic phrases ("pang of longing," "whispers of the old world") and predictable tropes (lab experiment seeking belonging). The "quiet tuning" concept reads as empty jargon. Sensory details are overgeneralized, and the conflict lacks original stakes.

    Overwrought phrases ("hypnotic spell," "complex web of symbols") tip into purple prose. Predictable secret society tropes and inconsistent emotional nuance suggest algorithmic defaults over authentic reinvention.
