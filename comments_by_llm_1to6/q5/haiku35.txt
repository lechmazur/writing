== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 ==
  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=4.0)
    The combination of elements is certainly original but feels forced, bordering on gimmickry (stunt double + pyramid + garage sales + net). Some phrasing ("peculiar art form," "mundanely spiritual act") verges on purple prose. The narrative logic connecting the disparate elements is weak, suggesting a formulaic combination rather than organic storytelling.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the combination of elements (pennies, statues, cosmic deception) offers surface originality, the execution relies on familiar mystical fantasy tropes (ancient secrets, chosen one archetype, glowing artifacts). Language is elevated but sometimes feels generically ornate rather than uniquely styled. The 'rationally mischievous' statues and the 'apology' feel like slightly forced inclusions rather than organic developments. Emotional depth is lacking.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the light-based communication offers some originality, the narrative employs somewhat standard phrasing ('adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses,' 'fingers danced') and character tropes (brilliant but socially awkward scientist). Emotional nuance is lacking, leaning towards stated feelings rather than demonstrated complexity.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the blend of sci-fi and familial introspection has potential, the execution relies on familiar tropes (mysterious ancestral object revealing secrets, sudden epiphany). Phrases like "whispered mechanical sigh" and the rapid, neat resolution feel formulaic. The emotional shift lacks nuanced portrayal.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core concept is original, but the execution relies on somewhat abstract, potentially jargon-like phrases ("fragile architectures of human experience," "spatial concept that mapped emotional terrains"). While avoiding major clichés, the language sometimes feels overly constructed ("cryptically obvious") rather than possessing effortless authenticity or nuanced emotional depth.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the *combination* of elements has potential originality, the execution leans on familiar tropes (outcast scientist, mystical artifact, hidden knowledge). Phrases like "impossible knowledge," "fundamental truth," and "revolutionary understanding" verge on cliché within this genre space. The "witch's flying carpet garage" feels like a forced quirk rather than an organic element. Emotional states ("frantic peace," "strangely trustworthy") are explicitly labeled, lacking nuanced portrayal.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=5.5)
    While avoiding overt AI tells, the story employs some familiar tropes (stoic guardian, quiet rebel) and slightly formal, elevated language ("silent testament," "bordered on veneration") that can feel generic rather than uniquely stylized. The emotional nuance is present but somewhat muted by the descriptive rather than deeply internalized portrayal.

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=3.0)
    The writing exhibits traits often seen in less refined work: slightly ornate phrasing ("luminous doubt," "crystallizing within him"), a somewhat predictable reluctant hero trope without significant subversion, and an abrupt character shift lacking nuanced psychological grounding. The combination feels more assembled than organic.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=3.5)
    The language often strains for literary effect, resulting in purple prose ("violent embrace," "joyful agony," "echo through time itself"). The core scenario is archetypal, and the integration of elements like the 'random items' feels formulaic rather than organic. Emotional nuance is stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Originality in connecting spatial design to psychological transformation. No clichés; even the bee pin avoids obvious symbolism through its Napoleonic specificity.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids overt clichés through fusion of arcane and mathematical motifs, but ornate phrasing ("cartography of consciousness") occasionally veers into purple prose; the statues' agency feels consistent yet slightly formulaic, and some descriptors (e.g., "dour amusement") are underdeveloped rather than generic.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=5.3)
    Generational trauma theme is fresh but execution leans on familiar redemption tropes. Prose alternates between overcooked ("surgical approach to conflict resolution") and underdeveloped metaphors. Emotional beats rely excessively on stated revelations.

  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overabundance of ornate abstraction borders on self-parody; repetitive 'shadow'/geometry motifs, unnatural philosophical declarations, and inconsistent emotional stakes scream workshop-avoidance tropes.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=5.9)
    Original concept diluted by clichéd phrases ("institutional silence"), inconsistent tone oscillating between poetic and clinical, over-reliance on "liminal" framing.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Contains overwrought phrases ("dancing on razor's edge of madness") and predictable supernatural artifact tropes; some subversion in stuntman-scholar hybrid but insufficiently executed.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Aviods overt clichés but occasionally relies on poetic abstractions over concrete specificity; stylistic flourishes occasionally overshadow narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=2.3)
    Relies on trope-laden combinations (cold warrior's heart, lost child's mitten) without subversion. Language devolves into ornate abstraction. Predictable emotional beats and inconsistent tone suggest algorithmic default patterns rather than intentional artistry.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=3.3)
    Relies on clichéd stranded-island tropes, inconsistent tone shifts, and overwrought descriptions ("liminal space," "overturn of consciousness") that suggest formulaic language over stylistic originality.

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=3.7)
    Dominates with overwritten phrases ("delicate fusion of metaphysical elements," "haunting melody" of laughter) that feel more decorative than purposeful. Tropes (lone genius defying establishment) remain unchallenged. Character psychology presented as grandiose statements rather than nuanced human behavior, bordering on AI-generated affectation.

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Avoids clichés with inventive use of hopscotch as historical map; minimalistic characterizations avoid over-explanation, but occasional ornate phrasing ("archaeologists of taste") tests restraint

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    Original premise about decoding cartographic history undercut by overused secret society trope and abrupt tonal shifts.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into ornate phrasing ("watercolor of hope"). Character psychology leans on stoic anguish without deeper nuance; the "zest" shift feels abrupt rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids genre clichés but contains overwritten phrases about fog's sentience. "Coy malevolence" feels performative rather than psychologically grounded. Metaphors inventive but occasionally detached from character perspective. Shows stylistic control without full emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Originality surfaces in blending paramedic trauma with quantum metaphysics, but phrases like "radical acceptance" risk cliché. The fishing lure metaphor feels fresh, though "excited boredom" and quantum terminology occasionally border on ornate abstraction rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    Avoids most clichés but exhibits AI-adjacent tendencies: disproportionately ornate description ("living memories"), generalized emotional states ("fascinating"), and logical yet emotionally sterile character reactions.

  * grade_story_12.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overly ornate prose ("eager resignation," "cartography of the soul") frequently veers into purple territory; reliance on melancholic tropes and fragmented structure feels like affectation rather than authentic innovation.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    Attempts lyrical prose but slips into clichéd symbolism ("razor's edge of revelation"). Subtle emotional contradictions undercut by overly programmatic atmospheric brooding.

  * grade_story_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mix of fresh concepts (emotional conduit plush) and formulaic phrasing ("quantum resonance"); avoids major clichés but occasionally substitutes ornamentation for nuance.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    Rich ideas undercut by occasionally overwritten passages ("despairing humor", "liminal revelation"); moments of artificiality in emotional nuance

  * grade_story_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Original conceptual framework (hive-mind psychology, wax-encoded trauma) is compelling. Avoids overt clichés but occasionally lapses into poetic abstraction that risks vagueness. Some phrases ("slow drip of candle wax") border on mannerism rather than innovation.

  * grade_story_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere and themes are evocative but occasionally undermined by overuse of poetic abstraction rather than fresh, concrete details or subversive choices.

  * grade_story_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids most tropes through inventive fusion of astral projection and carnival decay, yet occasionally succumbs to ornate description ("spiderweb-thin cracks in reality") that distracts from core conflict. Character logic feels more archetypal than idiosyncratic, suggesting algorithmic undertones.

  * grade_story_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    Mix of originality and tropes—steampunk lounge clichés diluted by intermittent vivid details. Some forced metaphors ("mechanical heartbeat") contrast with fresher mime-as-coding concept. Relies on sentimental closure without deepening character psychology.

  * grade_story_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Avoids genre tropes through unconventional rebellion mechanics. Metaphorical choices (butter churn as anti-tech symbol, ascending via disintegration) feel freshly conceived. Language occasionally veers toward poetic abstraction but maintains purposeful construction rather than algorithmic filler.

  * grade_story_122.txt (grade=5.9)
    Concept is original but execution veers into cyberpunk mysticism clichés; language occasionally becomes self-indulgent without narrative payoff.

  * grade_story_130.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Original use of "functionally dysfunctional" poems avoids cliché. Some over-reliance on "whispering experiments" and "living cartographies" verges on formulaic metaphor. Generally maintains human nuance in its preoccupation with impermanence, though character psychology remains deliberately opaque.

  * grade_story_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    Originality in merging textiles with incantation, but some phrases (“emotional landscapes,” “radical empathy”) feel stock or academic; the prose occasionally prioritizes ornamentation over functional clarity.

  * grade_story_116.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Anchient Egyptian palace/TV contrast shows ingenuity, but some devices (e.g., "crystalline determination") verge on cliché; emotional resonance relies excessively on explicit declarations of inner states.

  * grade_story_121.txt (grade=7.7)
    Avoids formula through mineralogy-as-metaphor framing and noir-tinged surrealism. Some phrases ('crystalline memories') border on purple prose. Emotional contours occasionally generic ('wounded spirit'), but inventive connections (circus forensics) elevate originality.

  * grade_story_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Avoids genre tropes by blending sci-fi with intimate drama; metaphors feel fresh, though occasional tech jargon (“quantum threads”) risks overfamiliarity. Overall style is controlled but not visionary.

    Original premise undermined by occasional ornate phrasing; some elements like "encrypted embroidery" show creativity while hunting methods feel arbitrarily inserted.

  * grade_story_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Original concept blending science and mysticism executed with literary merit, but occasional overwritten descriptions undermine naturalism

  * grade_story_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    Original premise undermined by expected "dangers of forbidden knowledge" arc; flowery descriptions border on purple prose in places; some AI-writing tells (repetitive phrasing about "whispers" and "crystals") dilute authenticity.

  * grade_story_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overly stylized descriptions border on mannerism; some originality in object symbolism, but emotional nuance remains stated rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Original premise weakened by ornate prose ("heartbeat between sleep and consciousness") and trope-adjacent character archetypes.

  * grade_story_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids overt clichés in merging analog relics (tickets) with sci-fi drones, but characterization leans on "eccentric noble" tropes. Some passages risk purple prose ("precipice of something extraordinary") even as others reveal genuine emotional gravity. Sensory details (pulsing lights, metallic wings) strike a reasonable balance between abstraction and immediacy. Feels mostly purposeful but occasionally self-indulgent.

  * grade_story_145.txt (grade=4.7)
    Relies on secret society/crumbling castle tropes with insufficient subversion. Recurring terms ("fantasy practicality," "hidden worlds") feel more like aesthetic choices than thematically vital concepts. Descriptions lean toward generic mystical register rather than offering fresh, concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    Unique premise blending quantum theory with personal ruin occasionally lapses into florid description ("laughing tears oscillate"); metaphors fresh but some procedural elements (lectures, tidal data) feel troped rather than transformed.

  * grade_story_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids overt clichés but treads familiar territory (artifacts of ancient wisdom, caves with agency). The prose is purposeful but occasionally falters into abstraction (“cellular memory,” “primordial energy”). Emotion is shown, yet Reyes’s reactions often read as intellectually detached rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    Over-reliance on flowery abstractions ("interconnected membrane of consciousness") and predictable spiritual metaphors. Sensory details often generic. Philosophical concept over-explained rather than organically earned.

  * grade_story_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Combines esoteric elements with steampunk stylings in a fresh way, but occasionally veers into ornateness. Deeper emotional nuance and tighter pacing would strengthen authenticity.

  * grade_story_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    Postcards-as-ritual-manual subverts mourning tropes inventively; atmospheric flourishes occasionally verge on cliché but precise object choices (horseshoe, meteorite) demonstrate thoughtfulness. Character psychology could be less archetypal.

  * grade_story_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mix of striking originality (tapestry decoding as meteorological method) and familiar archetypes (monastery-as-past-spiritual-education); avoids major clichés but employs occasionally overloaded poetic description that muddies clarity; character logic prioritizes symbolic function over authentic emotional response.

  * grade_story_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Avoids clichés with tea-leaf interpretation as cultural archaeology, but phrases like "miniature galaxies" and "ghosts of libraries" risk over-poeticizing; the fusion of juggling + scholarship is inventive but occasionally strains plausibility.

  * grade_story_140.txt (grade=5.7)
    Relies on overused tropes (haunted protector, sentient doll) without subversion. Excessive adjectives dilute focus; internal logic (e.g., doll’s "electric current" affecting protagonist) borders on vague mysticism. Originality evident in circus-dresser-room setting but undercut by predictable arc.

  * grade_story_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    Some overwritten passages ("between rust and gold," "territories between memory and myth") suggest formulaic lyricism rather than original insight. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally inconsistent (e.g., "bronze and copper tubes" vs. brass opener). The narrative arc shows ingenuity in sound-based mapping but relies on common tropes about misunderstood genius uncovering ancient secrets without deeper subversion.

  * grade_story_146.txt (grade=6.3)
    Certain phrases ("cryptic prophetic fragments") lean into ornate abstraction, and the "peaceful anger" concept feels more imposed than naturally integral to the character or world.

  * grade_story_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids genre clichés but leans on abstract intellectualism over human authenticity; some overwritten descriptions border on pretentious yet maintain a distinct stylistic fingerprint.

  * grade_story_157.txt (grade=6.0)
    Some fresh combinations of elements (genealogy with meteorology) but lapses into mystical clichés. Purple prose tendencies in describing "historical frequencies" and spectral conductors.

  * grade_story_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Excessive reliance on compound adjectives ("spectral moonlight," "translucent forms") and conceptual shortcuts betrays algorithmic patterning; attempts at poetic abstraction often devolve into vague mysticism rather than incisive originality.

  * grade_story_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Avoids overt clichés (e.g., combining math with magic uniquely), but leans on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes (rusted ruins, magical warfare). Avoids purple prose but occasionally drifts into ornate phrasing ("symphony of potential"). Emotional nuance in "fearful joy" is felt through physical cues rather than explicit declarations.

  * grade_story_151.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    Concepts feel derivative (mole people, post-cosmic extinction) but are elevated by unique framing (digitizing memory as resurrection). Some purple prose ("gifted burden") and underdeveloped subtext.

  * grade_story_155.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on stylized prose ("geometric light patterns") that occasionally veers toward abstraction without fully grounding the fantastical elements in emotional truth.

  * grade_story_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Original for blending ecological and cyberpunk themes, though lone inventor trope is familiar. Avoids overt clichés but doesn’t radically subvert expectations. Prose is purposeful yet occasionally overwrought.

  * grade_story_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    Clichéd elements (mysterious island, gambler with hidden skills) receive minimal subversion. Prose veers between minimalist and overwrought, showing AI-writing telltales.

  * grade_story_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids overt clichés in conspiracy structure but relies on predictable revenge narrative framework; peacock code metaphor is fresh but insufficiently distinguishes story from genre tropes; language avoids purple prose but lacks distinctive authorial voice.

  * grade_story_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    Concepts subvert sci-fi tropes, but relies on overwrought phrases ("translucent origami") and underdeveloped tension between logic/emotion.

  * grade_story_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Avoids genre formulas; the blend of mythic and analytical perspectives feels inventive. Some purple prose ("jubilant despair—a paradoxical emotional landscape") risks affectation, but the central metaphor of levitation-as-transformation demonstrates original vision.

  * grade_story_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Avoids genre formulas through ecological-personal parallels; some phrases ("whispers of memories") approach poetic convention but remain purposeful; occasional over-embellishment doesn't undermine emotional authenticity or narrative ingenuity.

  * grade_story_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    Avoids overt clichés in character voice but leans on expected steampunk tropes (airship engine rooms, clockworks); wave metaphor and "sentient" ring veer into familiar poetic territory; emotional resonance resides in specificity of oral history preservation rather than generic melancholy.

    Blends original concepts (black-market genealogy) with archetypal redemptive arcs; language occasionally veers into stylized abstraction but avoids outright formulaic writing.

  * grade_story_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stylized prose avoids most clichés—using a parking stub as quantum artifact shows ingenuity—but occasionally descends into genre platitudes ("razor-sharp smile," "map the connections"). Sensory details are purposeful but generic (light pulses, trembling stations). Elena's deterministic logic feels computational; cloud sentience borders on mystical abstraction. Writing style maintains consistency but leans on ornate descriptors ("intertwined, beautiful complexity") that occasionally sap momentum.

  * grade_story_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The premise avoids genre tropes but occasionally indulges in ornate phrasing ("joyful terror," "supernatural coherence"). Sensory details are specific but sometimes prioritized over narrative momentum, veering toward poetic excess without sufficient thematic anchoring.

  * grade_story_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Certain descriptions ("gentle chaos barely contained," "intricate weaving of fate") rely on abstract generalizations rather than concrete particularity; the ghostly researcher trope avoids full cliché through the plastic straw's unexpected significance but leans heavily on gothic science archetypes.

  * grade_story_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    Original premise diluted by familiar redemption arc; sensory details occasionally verge on overwritten but mostly avoid AI-generated redundancy.

  * grade_story_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    Avoids overt clichés through floral-archaeology fusion but falters with AI-like cadences: repetitive "precise/yet" constructions, abrupt "surgical precision" comparison, and overly ornate similes dilute authenticity. Subtext remains surface-bound by reliance on explicit thematic declarations.

  * grade_story_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Conceptually bold and stylistically adventurous without rehashing genre tropes. Some overwritten phrases risk pretension, but the fusion of real estate and soul-transfiguration shows authentic creativity.

  * grade_story_174.txt (grade=2.3)
    Overly ornate descriptions (e.g., "cascading walls of ancient waterfall") verge on cliché. Nature metaphors feel curated rather than organically emerging. Emotional arc reads as conceptual rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    Originality in combining architectural mysticism with self-defeating heroism is tempered by reliance on New Age spiritual tropes ("transformation," "awareness"). The "reversed wishes" mechanic feels derivative of Borges-esque recursive logic without sufficiently fresh execution. Prose occasionally veers into overwritten abstraction but avoids outright cliché.

  * grade_story_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Some overwritten metaphors and tonal inconsistencies (e.g., "earthbound flight") hint at formulaic tendencies, but the emotional transmission concept demonstrates authentic innovation with occasional stylistic overreach.

  * grade_story_171.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    Original concepts occasionally verge on pretension; avoids major clichés but occasionally relies on poetic abstraction over concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_184.txt (grade=5.9)

    Original concept and controlled prose balance against occasional clichéd phrasing like "mechanical heart."

  * grade_story_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids genre clichés by merging philately with quantum biology. Avoids "quantize" becoming jargon through concrete stamp physicality. Some ornate descriptions ("infinitesimal moment between inhale and exhale") flirt with purple prose but serve thematic purposes. Emotional beats could benefit from more subtext versus exposition about bureaucratic tedium/caregiver trauma.

  * grade_story_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids formulaic structure but occasionally indulges in poetic excess. Some phrases like "barbed wire arms" feel contrived rather than organic.

  * grade_story_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conceptually original but stylistically uneven: The orchardist-cartographer fusion provides fresh perspective, but the "phantom hand" feels trope-laden. Some sensory details ("weathered hands") are specific, while others rely on generalized poetic abstractions. Multiverse treatment lacks distinctive differentiation between realities.

  * grade_story_188.txt (grade=5.3)
    Over-reliance on poetic abstraction ("corroded rapture") and mechanical metaphors; insufficient differentiation between character voice and omniscient narration; emotional beats often told rather than demonstrated through action.

  * grade_story_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    Trope-laden: beehive-as-society, fingerprints as "profound connections." Flowery abstraction ("living, breathing entity") overshadows emotional subtext. Formulaic transitions between concepts.

  * grade_story_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Original concept with fresh object-ritual connections, but occasionally veers into ornate abstraction that feels self-conscious rather than natural.

  * grade_story_190.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Originality undercut by overreliance on gothic and metaphysical tropes. Some phrases ("whispers carried on spectral winds") verge on cliché. Prose stylish but occasionally veers into florid abstraction, diluting tension.

  * grade_story_187.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_186.txt (grade=6.0)
    Over-reliance on ornate descriptors (“stone fingers,” “delicate painted expressions”) and eco-apocalyptic tropes dulls the otherwise original premise of mechanical prophets.

  * grade_story_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overreliance on genre tropes (mysterious ancestral message) without subversion. Mechanical phrasing ("transmissions" of dreams) and vague descriptors ("ritual bone broth") suggest formulaic worldbuilding. Nightmares as a method for reviving traditions lacks human nuance.

    Some originality shines through mystical concepts, but over-reliance on ornate metaphors ("overlapping mists") and predictable tropes (ancient monastery archives) weakens authenticity.

  * grade_story_185.txt (grade=4.9)
    Has tendencies toward AI writing patterns - overly grand phrases like "fractured grace" feel formulaic rather than organic. Relies on sci-fi tropes about consciousness and parallel universes without substantial subversion. Some descriptors are overly precise but lack emotional depth. Character reasoning sometimes feels overly logical without sufficient nuance. Writing style has some consistent poetic tone but occasionally shifts unnaturally between technical descriptions and mystical revelations.

  * grade_story_189.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Original concept execution shows ingenuity but occasionally drowns in ornate abstractions; avoids most AI-writing traps while flirting with purple prose.

  * grade_story_199.txt (grade=7.9)

    Excessive flowery prose weakens impact; metaphors lack freshness; voice feels crafted rather than authentic.

  * grade_story_202.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_205.txt (grade=4.9)
    Verbal embroidery compensates for hollow core—phrases like "peaceful frenzy" and "living canvas" ring hollow. Reliance on clichéd warrior tropes undercut claims of originality.

  * grade_story_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The core concept (art as coded rebellion) is original but occasionally veers into melodrama (“crystalline monuments”). Some phrases lean ornate, and emotional beats are often stated rather than implied. Anonymous kindness feels like a half-realized trope.

  * grade_story_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Original premise strained by ornate descriptions ("translucent skin" for metaphors) and predictable emotional beats; avoids genre tropes but occasionally over-relies on atmospheric vagueness over specificity.

  * grade_story_213.txt (grade=4.9)
    Machine-like tendencies emerge in phrases like "delightfully strange atmosphere" and overused abstractions ("primal sophistication," "sunrise no one believes in").

    Original premise diluted by clichéd elements (midnight calls, encoded messages). Metaphors fresh but occasionally self-indulgent; tone inconsistent shifts.

  * grade_story_215.txt (grade=3.6)
    Riddled with formulaic phrasing ("whisper secrets," "delicate line") and genre tropes (hidden rooms, cryptic puzzles) without subversion. Paragraphs transition based on plot necessity rather than organic character cognition, with emotional beats explicitly stated rather than implied through action.

  * grade_story_219.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conceptual premise shows ingenuity but execution suffers from recurring purple prose and overly wrought metaphors.

Sensory descriptions occasionally specific but too often settle into decorative abstraction rather than visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Avoids overt clichés through inventive combinations (e.g., cobbler as intellectual weapon), but some phrases ("whispered through time") lean toward trope. Conceptual originality exists within familiar frameworks of academic intrigue.

  * grade_story_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    Some evocative phrases ("cheerful despair") verge on cliché. The "spin-the-bottle confessions" introduces originality but reads like algorithmic whimsy. Excessive abstractions about power and resilience risk overshadowing human-scale stakes. Language occasionally slips into portentousness.

  * grade_story_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids overt clichés but contains semi-generic descriptors ("weathered man", "industrial labyrinth"); metaphors verge on overused yet maintain freshness through specific maritime grounding; tension between archival obsession and action remains compellingly human.

  * grade_story_217.txt (grade=5.3)
    Relies on "haunted house equals inner state" trope without subversion; metaphors mostly familiar; emotional arc follows predictable transformation patterns.

  * grade_story_218.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_222.txt (grade=4.1)
    Overreliance on "whispering threads," "pulsing jewelry," and geometric aliens as shorthand for depth. Nuanced moments (e.g., washcloth luminescence) fight against formulaic spiritual-tech hybrid tropes.

  * grade_story_223.txt (grade=3.4)
    Routinely indulges in AI-writing hallmarks: obsessive lunar symbolism, pseudo-archaic tone shifts, and generic "secrets that shaped civilizations" grandstanding. Overreliance on abstract emotional states ("nostalgic defiance") rather than behaviorally demonstrated psychology.

  * grade_story_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Some overly poetic phrasing approaches purple prose. While emotional nuance is generally well-handled, the melancholic artist archetype borders on trope. The seesaw metaphor feels slightly manufactured rather than organically connected to Elena's personal journey. The writing shows individuality but occasionally loses authenticity in pursuit of lyricism.

    Blends sci-fi and medieval elements with conceptual cleverness but contains AI-writing hallmarks: occasionally stilted dialogue, generalized sensory impressions rather than specific physicality.

  * grade_story_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    While the concept of a “bioluminescent archive” is inventive, the prose occasionally veers into lyrical overgeneralization (“forest’s eternal conversation”) that dilutes its impact; some elements (e.g., “unapologetically humble”) feel didactic rather than organically integrated.

  * grade_story_350.txt (grade=3.5)
    Overly ornate descriptions ("millennia of stone and silence") border on purple prose. Clichéd tropes (ancient temples hiding secrets, cryptic stamp codes) dominate without subversion. Emotional depth relies on abstraction ("truth emerged") rather than concrete, humanized reactions.

  * grade_story_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Demonstrates remarkable originality through its fusion of speculative and poetic elements.

    Over-reliance on AI-composite fantasy tropes (sentient settings, vague "metaphysical" conflicts), excessive ornamental language, and flat emotional beats suggest formulaic construction.

  * grade_story_355.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the family trauma narrative is compelling, some imagery (pulsing walls as "genealogical connections") risks over-explanation. The "radical vulnerability" phrasing feels quasi-academic, undercutting rawness.

  * grade_story_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    The post-AI preservation conflict avoids full cliche, but phrases like "storms of doubt" and "rescued memories" trend toward overwrought abstraction.

  * grade_story_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    Original premise undermined by occasional ornateness and vague existentialism; some phrasing borders on poetic abstraction without sufficient anchoring in narrative weight.

  * grade_story_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Occasional purple prose ("rivers meeting ocean") and slightly formulaic transitions between paragraphs. Conceptual freshness in textile linguistics outweighs minor overuse of "woven" metaphor. Emotional nuance feels organic despite occasional lyricism

    Some overwrought metaphors ("whisper ancient narratives") and self-conscious lyricism border on purple prose; psychological nuances feel calculated rather than organic; atmospheric consistency maintained despite occasional poetic flourishes; philosophical musings show ambition but lack authentic human complexity.

  * grade_story_351.txt (grade=7.6)

Tone remains consistent, though wax seal's supernatural resolution risks veering into fantasy tropes without sufficient mytho-poetic foundation.

  * grade_story_360.txt (grade=6.5)
    Originality lies in the meek necromancer archetype and broken pen's repurposing, but the mystical "universal riddle" leans on generic fantasy tropes. Some phrasing ("cosmic understanding") borders on purple prose, and the sudden symbolic resonance risks feeling like AI-generated "depth."

  * grade_story_353.txt (grade=5.1)
    Originality is mixed; combines sci-fi and mysticism but relies on familiar tropes (hidden workshop, tyrant-overthrow plot). Some phrases ("cryptic conversation," "quantum potential") risk sounding like genre clichés. The moon-pattern method feels underexplored, leaning on vague scientific mysticism rather than inventive logic.

  * grade_story_368.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose veers into ornate, AI-like repetition ("twisted... serpentine memories"; "waiting for her next revelation"); emotional resonance is stated, not shown through concrete actions.

  * grade_story_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Some overused tropes (secret societies, cryptic oracles) offset by inventive connections between natural history and political conspiracy; prose occasionally luxuriates in self-conscious lyricism.

  * grade_story_363.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mixed originality: "careful observations through mechanical nightmares" offers fresh perspective on nostalgia, while "calloused hands writing elegantly" risks poetic cliché. Some atmospheric details verge on purple prose ("wood-paneled walls breathe with unspoken transitions").

    Original central concept diluted by generic descriptors and predictable resistance tropes; some fresh metaphors counteract occasional purple prose

  * grade_story_373.txt (grade=5.9)

  * grade_story_385.txt (grade=5.4)
    Mix of strong originality (hospital archaeology hybrid) and clichéd elements (lone obsessive geniuses, "language older than civilization"). Metaphors like "lucid confusion" cleverly capture tone, but the overall narrative leans on familiar tropes without radical subversion.

    Purple prose ("electric potential of revelation," "mechanical puppets") and clichéd phrases ("language of performance and loss") suggest formulaic tendencies. The premise avoids genre tropes but stumbles with overly ornate descriptions that prioritize style over organic character/subtext, occasionally veering into AI-writing hallmarks like repetitive abstraction.

  * grade_story_475.txt (grade=7.1)

    Prose avoids clichéd phrasing but teeters toward ornate abstraction ("time's relentless atomization"). Character reasoning (Ezra's obsession) lacks psychological nuance, and the street musician embodies a semi-mystic trope. While atmospheric originality shines, the narrative leans on poetic abstraction rather than concrete humanism, risking alienation.

    Original premise undermined by clichéd academic rebellion tropes. "Danced like spectral notes" borders on AI-generated metaphor. Sound memory concept fresh but execution follows expected mystical-scientist pattern.

  * grade_story_85.txt (grade=5.4)
    Story relies heavily on clichéd juxtapositions (stone/alive, destruction/creation) and pretentious abstraction ("lucid confusion").
