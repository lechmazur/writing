  * grade_story_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose avoids obvious AI markers like repetitive phrasing or abrupt topic shifts, it occasionally relies on abstract philosophical statements rather than specific, vivid details.

    The core decryption method is highly original. However, surrounding elements like the 'forgotten oracle,' 'powerful people,' 'delayed justice,' and 'mythic relic' lean heavily on established tropes without significant subversion.

  * grade_story_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    While avoiding overt AI tells like abrupt shifts, the prose occasionally dips into slightly overwrought territory ('tapestry of hidden hours,' 'quantum architecture,' 'objectively emotional'). Emotion is often stated ('He had been morose') rather than purely shown through nuanced action or subtext. Feels competent but lacks a truly unique stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central device (rotary dial in phone case) and the temporal anomaly concept offer originality. However, the narrative employs some clichéd phrasing ('spider-web fractures', 'symphony of human experience') and the character arc (detached scientist finds humanity) is a common trope, handled predictably here. Lacks a distinctive authorial voice.

  * grade_story_334.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative leans heavily on common sci-fi tropes (secret collective, dimensional breach, conflicted operative) without offering significant subversion or originality.

  * grade_story_343.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the combination of elements offers some originality, the narrative structure (mysterious journey leading to enlightenment) and certain devices (literal fork in the road) lean on familiar tropes. The writing avoids obvious AI tells but lacks a truly unique style or deeply nuanced emotional portrayal.

  * grade_story_327.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose contains familiar phrases ("brimming with potential," "ripple outward") and the core concept (imagination as magic) treads well-worn ground. The narrative arc is predictable, lacking originality or stylistic distinction. It feels competent but ultimately generic, missing the unique voice required.

  * grade_story_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    The core concept avoids common clichés, but some phrasing ("cacophony of progress and destruction") borders on the familiar. While not overtly formulaic, the emotional arc follows a somewhat predictable path to redemption. Lacks a truly distinctive voice or surprising narrative turn.

  * grade_story_340.txt (grade=2.5)
    Highly derivative, relying on common fantasy tropes (mentor's shadow, forbidden ritual, proving oneself) without subversion. Emotional portrayal is shallow and stated. The predictable structure and lack of unique voice suggest formulaic writing.

  * grade_story_349.txt (grade=4.0)
    The core concept relies on the familiar "modern person in fantasy" trope without significant subversion. Phrases like "flicker of hope," "strangely at peace," and the explicit stating of the "cynically hopeful" attribute feel somewhat formulaic. While not overtly AI-like, the prose lacks a distinctive voice or truly fresh metaphorical language, leaning towards competent but generic execution.

  * grade_story_346.txt (grade=5.0)
    The core concept is interesting, but the execution leans towards formula (flawed hero, magical trial, convenient epiphany, neat resolution). The wasp dialogue is overly expository and unnatural. Phrases like "undercurrent of clarity" and "precise madness" feel slightly affected rather than organically arising from the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_347.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the core concept (plant whisperer in a tech setting) offers originality, the execution relies on familiar tropes (convenient ally, escape aided by sudden powers, the clumsy protagonist triggering an alarm). Phrasing like "crucible of discovery" and the shoelace incident feels formulaic. The emotional depth feels stated rather than shown.

  * grade_story_344.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_342.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the core concept (patterns connecting doodles, nature, and ancient memory) has originality, the execution relies on some familiar tropes (flawed protagonist chosen for a quest). Phrases like "air hung heavy" are standard. The character's reasoning shifts too quickly from careless pilot to dedicated guardian without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_337.txt (grade=5.5)

The core concept and character setup, while pleasant, don't feel exceptionally original or subversive. It lacks a truly distinctive voice or stylistic flair.

  * grade_story_35.txt (grade=4.0)

The character's swift, complete understanding at the end feels somewhat formulaic and lacks nuanced human ambiguity.

  * grade_story_350.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies heavily on the 'ancient secret revealed' trope. The combination of elements (puppeteer, stamps, music, gown, temple) feels more like an assembly of disparate concepts than an organic whole. While the 'spaces between stamps' is a nice touch, the overall execution follows a predictable treasure-hunt pattern. Language sometimes dips into cliché ("cascaded," "bathed in silver light"). Character reasoning is straightforward plot service.

  * grade_story_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The core concept possesses originality, but the execution relies on some familiar phrasing ('weathered wings', 'last light of dusk'). The writing lacks a truly distinctive, individual style.

    The serpent fortress setting offers originality, but the overall plot (isolated academic finds purpose through connection/artifact) leans heavily on familiar tropes. Phrasing like "trembling fingers," "glowing like captured sunlight," and "dying light" borders on cliché. The rapid emotional shift and the somewhat simplistic resolution lack the nuance expected of top-tier literary fiction. The attribute "typically uncommon" feels awkward and forced.

  * grade_story_354.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the blend of tech and pseudo-magic offers some novelty, the prose occasionally dips into generic phrasing ("practiced ease," "elusive streams"). The "cosmic disclaimers" element feels like a slightly clunky, potentially AI-like insertion to fulfill a prompt requirement rather than an organic development.

  * grade_story_357.txt (grade=5.0)
    The core premise (frost giant support group) is original, but the execution feels somewhat safe and lacks genuine nuance in emotional portrayal. Character reasoning remains thin, and the overall piece doesn't fully escape a sense of gentle predictability despite the unique setup.

  * grade_story_356.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    The combination of elements (yodeling forger, rainforest clinic, Beethoven) offers surface originality, but the core 'reformed criminal seeking redemption' arc is a common trope. The language is clear but rarely surprising or stylistically distinct. Emotion is often stated ('nervously tracing', 'felt the weight... lightness') rather than evoked through nuanced showing. The dialogue, particularly Milo's confessional block, feels slightly formulaic in its delivery of backstory and intent. It avoids obvious AI tells but lacks a strong, unique authorial voice.

  * grade_story_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the premise has original elements (puzzle box confession ritual), the haunted lighthouse keeper trope is familiar. The language is generally clear but occasionally dips into slightly common phrasing ("weight of his secrets," "tormented face"). The emotion is present but sometimes lacks deep nuance; "optimistically bitter" and "lethargic excitement" are interesting but not explored with exceptional subtlety. The narrative flow is consistent, avoiding jarring AI-like shifts, but the overall style doesn't feel strikingly unique or resistant to formula.

  * grade_story_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    While generally well-written, phrases like "gentle collapse" or "quiet desperation" lean towards familiar tropes.

  * grade_story_362.txt (grade=6.2)

Character reasoning is logical but lacks profound human nuance or vulnerability, bordering on archetypal rather than unique.

  * grade_story_365.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the combination of elements has potential, the execution leans towards familiar fantasy tropes (faded magic user, magical artifact, rewriting reality).

The writing lacks a truly distinctive voice or style that would elevate it beyond competent genre fiction; it feels somewhat predictable.

  * grade_story_366.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_367.txt (grade=6.0)
    The core concept (bird flight/tides) offers originality.

  * grade_story_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    While avoiding overt AI tells, the story leans on familiar dystopian tropes (oppressive Authority, quiet rebel) and some slightly generic phrasing ("grand scheme," "suffocated creativity").

  * grade_story_373.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_375.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies heavily on the trope of inanimate objects coming alive and a somewhat generic "mad scientist" setup (albeit with a cosmic twist). The mannequin dialogue and the sudden shift in Eliza's motivation feel formulaic. While the setting is unique, the execution of the core transformation lacks nuanced detail, leaning on stated concepts ("imaginatively realistic") rather than vivid, original description.

  * grade_story_378.txt (grade=4.5)
    While avoiding overt AI tells, the story utilizes familiar tropes (reluctant hero, magical MacGuffin) without significant subversion. The prose is functional but lacks a distinctive authorial voice or stylistic flair necessary for top-tier publication. Emotional nuance is minimal.

  * grade_story_368.txt (grade=6.0)
    While avoiding overt clichés and obvious AI tells, the story employs familiar mystical tropes (whispering stones, ancient pulse).

    The prose occasionally dips into slightly ornate or clichéd phrasing ('labyrinthine library', 'repository of knowledge', 'gleeful sorrow', 'crystallized').

The concept feels more assembled than organically grown.

  * grade_story_401.txt (grade=4.0)

== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B ==
  * grade_story_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Avoids genre clichés through environmental prophecy angle rather than apocalypse tropes. Some purple prose tendencies ("weight of luminous doubt creeping through consciousness") and generalized sensory details weaken originality. Character motivations feel humanized beyond AI templates, though transformation remains somewhat schematic.

  * grade_story_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story avoids excessive trope reliance by merging fantasy elements with astronomical themes. While the enchanted orchard setting risks familiarity, its perception-altering fruit and cosmic manipulation twist add freshness. Only minimal traces of overly poetic descriptions appear.

  * grade_story_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    Avoids overt tropes but treads familiar ground with "sympathetic AI"; prose occasionally drifts into mechanical phrasing despite generally purposeful style.

  * grade_story_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Originality lies in merging penitential pilgrimage with lighthouse prison surrealism. Avoids clichés through specific details (torn prayer book page, blood vial), though “joyful agony” risks abstraction. Some metaphor density may feel crafted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Avoids AI formula through emotionally specific details like "culinary failures" and handwritten cookbook; subverts space opera tropes with domestic vulnerability.

  * grade_story_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on "ancient wisdom saves modern man" trope. Language remains clear without purple prose, but no striking stylistic fingerprint. Emotional resonance is present without feeling profound or subversive.

  * grade_story_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids most clichés with fresh magical realism fusion; lyrical prose risks occasional opacity but maintains stylistic coherence; subtext about artistic reinvention feels humanely nuanced beyond mechanical tropes.

  * grade_story_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids overt clichés with inventive rebellion mechanics; minimal purple prose, though occasional stylized phrasing slightly detracts from urgency.

  * grade_story_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Avoids most AI-writing clichés with unique concept blending, though "fragments of tradition" terminology veers toward New Age vagueness. The knight-artist redemption arc isn't entirely formulaic, but the folk remedy trope requires heavier subversion for top-tier originality.

  * grade_story_105.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids major clichés with soul-mirroring concept but occasionally succumbs to flowery prose ("unfelt breeze") that distances reader.

  * grade_story_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Subverts assassin tropes through meticulous artistry, but some phrases ("tick-tock symphony") teeter toward poetic routine.

  * grade_story_11.txt (grade=6.3)
    Some fresh combinations (mechanic's patch + secret society) but relies on familiar tropes (hidden map codes in art); prose avoids overt purple prose but occasionally settles for efficient over evocative.

  * grade_story_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Originality lies in the unique juxtaposition of rural stagnation and aquatic decay, though some phrases border on lyrical excess without losing authenticity.

  * grade_story_107.txt (grade=6.9)
    Relies on survival-narrative tropes (mysterious artifacts, hidden societies) while subverting through insect-based civilization; occasionally veers into purple prose but maintains stylistic control; character reasoning occasionally prioritizes plot convenience over psychological realism.

  * grade_story_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    Relies on magic-art trope without subversion; "gifts of the fog" and pen’s effects verge on cliché; prose avoids purple patches but occasionally becomes overwrought.

  * grade_story_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Avoids overt clichés; metaphors (emotional fabric, vibration-as-music) feel fresh. No purple prose or formulaic transitions. Nuanced emotional expression occurs in dream reactions and tactile plush interactions, though some thematic statements lean declarative rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strength: Original fusion of environmentalism with mythic sci-fi. Weakness: "Dream-dust," "river wisdom," and "spectral polyps" risk mystical clichés; some phrasing ("living light") leans toward vague abstraction rather than striking specificity.

  * grade_story_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Avoids overt clichés but contains faintly algorithmic phrasing (“mournful elation,” “crystalline structure dissolving like whispered secret”); hopscotch code concept is inventive but execution occasionally prioritizes concept over organic characterization.

  * grade_story_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids genre tropes with unusual elements (typewriter ribbon catalyst, dog park setting). Some phrase stiffness: "exultant grief" feels stated rather than embodied. Metaphors remain fresh but occasionally over-polished.

  * grade_story_115.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the nano-city concept is original, derivative metaphors and overly precise phrasing ("ruminative exasperation") border on affectation; the reconciliation trope and Harmon's compliance to meet feel mechanically contrived.

  * grade_story_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids clichés with time-travel lounge concept; some ornate phrasing distracts but overall style supports haunting tone.

  * grade_story_117.txt (grade=5.7)
    Clichéd haunted mansion elements and overused "wise fool" archetype surface despite mosaic reality concept's potential. Similes like "shimmered like mosaic" verge on purple prose while emotional subtext remains stated rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_118.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids major AI-adjacent tropes, though the hive-mind therapist verges on gimmickry. Wax patterns as trauma representation are original but occasionally overwritten. Emotional nuance in Mercer's arc surpasses procedural tropes.

  * grade_story_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Avoids most formulaic traps with creatively combined elements, but occasional phrasing (e.g., "collision course with reality") leans on conceptual shorthand rather than fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The core conceit (mapping emotional topographies) is inventive but occasionally undermined by familiar tropes: mysterious twin-like figures, holographic advertisements as narrative devices, the "cracked object holding hidden meaning." Some descriptions lean on expected contrasts (sterile technology versus natural memory) without deep subversion. The tile's mirrored cracks as symbolic reconciliation feels both clever and slightly too geometrically neat—a pattern suggesting algorithmic symmetry rather than human unpredictability. Emotional beats are primarily shown but occasionally undercut by direct statements ("eager resignation"). Sensory language remains evocative but occasionally defaults to expected binaries (cold vs warm, broken vs whole).

  * grade_story_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pseudo-scientific "psychoactive weaving" risks trope status but is subverted through tactile execution. Avoids purple prose generally; barbershop simile feels oddly conventional for a lunar setting.

  * grade_story_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Original elements (mineralizing soil, vanishing circuses) avoid genre tropes but flirt with magical realism clichés. Prose balances lyricism and clarity, though forced phrases (“shadows among shadows”) and a tidy resolution suggest formulaic instincts. The “right to fail” is cursorily stated rather than dissected.

  * grade_story_120.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mix of fresh concepts (TV subtitles in dreams) and familiar tropes (dying grandmother's secret). Language occasionally veers toward purple prose ("fragility and its strength simultaneously").

Avoids complete formulaic structure through idiosyncratic voice.

  * grade_story_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Original worldbuilding avoids generic fantasy, with fresh use of “mushroom village” and “cabin diaries.” Some familiar phrasing (“serene upheaval”) and the prophecy trope’s subversion edges closer to formulaic defiance. Emotional stakes are genuine but not deeply layered.

  * grade_story_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids overt tropes by tying magic to mundane crafts (pottery, locksmithing), but the "unclaimed throne" and "guardian duo" tread familiar ground. Sensory descriptions are precise, though the "demure audacity" phrasing edges toward poetic detachment.

  * grade_story_141.txt (grade=6.3)
    Avoids overt genre tropes by merging engineering with folklore, but the "chosen one" arc follows predictable templates. The notebook's handwriting reveal feels derivative, and transitions between the scavenger hunt and supernatural sequences border on mechanical. Descriptions like "spectral figures rippling like water" show inventiveness, though emotional beats occasionally rely on stated dread rather than constructed tension.

  * grade_story_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Uses tropes (forbidden object, occult rituals) but subverts them through the cosmic traveler conceit and Marcus’s existential arc from warder to guide.

  * grade_story_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mage-smith combining industrial and magical elements offers original twist, but "seeds of regrowth" trope lacks innovation. Repetitive use of "dimming sky/chaos" language feels perfunctory.

  * grade_story_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids overt clichés through specific details (e.g., blurred illustration shifting to words), but the redemption arc and 'secret family knowledge' trope remain familiar. Language occasionally veers into poeticism without earning its metaphysical revelations.

  * grade_story_151.txt (grade=7.1)

Subtext potential exists but undermined by surface-level emotional conveyance.

  * grade_story_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    Recombination of tropes (doomsday prepper + quantum metaphysics) feels deliberately subversive, though occasionally undermines itself through overabundance of abstract imagery ("compressed time walls") that borders on self-indulgent prose.

  * grade_story_16.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_171.txt (grade=7.8)

The "trail of nightmares" concept hints at originality but reads more as a plot device than uniquely personal metaphor. Language occasionally veers into decorative abstraction.

  * grade_story_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Avoids overt clichés through unique combinations (tinkerer + environmentalism), though Mortimer’s “genius inventor” trope lacks subversion.

    Avoids genre clichés through spinning wheel ingenuity; minor purple prose tendencies in atmospheric passages.

  * grade_story_208.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_226.txt (grade=8.3)

    Paysphone-as-confessional concept avoids outright cliché through specific detailing. Some phrases ('transient realities') flirt with abstraction, but the mirrored wallets and dual protagonists demonstrate inventive structure within genre constraints.

  * grade_story_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids overt clichés with "soothing nightmares" twist but genre conventions (secret societies, chosen one) are present without radical subversion; prose remains clean but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Avoids major clichés through fresh tech-noir analog aesthetics. Sensory details (herbs, switchboard mechanics) are specific but occasionally edges toward ornate. Subverts "lone truth-bearer" trope by making Eliza a facilitator rather than savior.

  * grade_story_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Original premise with fresh metaphors; avoids most clichés but includes occasional overly ornate phrasing.

  * grade_story_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    Avoids overt clichés through unique juxtaposition (pragmatic mysticism). Some descriptions verge on ornate, but overall style maintains purposeful clarity. Human-like subtext present but not groundbreaking.

  * grade_story_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    Unique combination of elements avoids typical tropes, but the stock ticker's mechanics feel like an unearned narrative convenience rather than organic discovery; dialogue remains overly literal.

  * grade_story_237.txt (grade=5.9)
    Avoids most formulaic pitfalls but contains AI-writing hallmarks: overly symmetrical reveals, tidy conceptual resolution, and slightly inflated language ("cosmic heartbreak"). Some fresh combinations (space pirates + genealogy) but emotional beats feel somewhat pre-engineered rather than organically earned.

  * grade_story_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    Avoids overt clichés but contains predictable dual-life tropes; the marriage of dendrochronology and illusionism feels inventive until superficial execution surfaces in dialogue's expositional weight.

  * grade_story_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Avoids genre tropes with inventive concepts (coffee sleeve confessions, bonsai as memory vessels). The prose strikes a balance between lyrical and precise. Occasional ornate phrases ("primordial darkness that felt right") teeter on edge of purple prose but retain purposefulness.

  * grade_story_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Avoids overt clichés through unique combinations (automaton bird as analytical companion) and thematic paradoxes; some phrasing ("swirling cosmic maelstrom") edges toward genre conventions but remains serviceable.

  * grade_story_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Blending cyberpunk with philosophical questioning avoids genre staleness, though "machine learning chip with strange code" leans on familiar speculative shorthand. Some phrases exhibit machine-author tendencies ("glowing faintly") while the misaligned harp motif demonstrates genuine inventiveness. Emotional stakes feel intellectually conceived rather than viscerally experienced.

  * grade_story_252.txt (grade=9.4)
    Originality in combining magical realism with intimate penitence subverts thief tropes. Avoids clichés (e.g., "lovingly hateful" avoids melodrama). Sensory details are vivid and specific. No formulaic phrasing; tone remains evocative but concise. Slight risk of ornate descriptors ("icy warmth") but purposeful for mood.

  * grade_story_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Risk of "quaint eccentricity" trope subverted by visceral details (verdigris statues, leaking sinks), though rain-as-metaphor recurs slightly too mechanically.

  * grade_story_25.txt (grade=4.9)
    Contains AI-writing hallmarks: repetitive metaphorical language ("breaking chains/prison of understanding"), overly precise descriptors ("forty years at sea"), and tonal shifts between mythic weight and simplistic declarations; the "ultraviolet forest" concept shows some originality but relies on surface-level exoticism rather than structural ingenuity; metaphors and emotional beats feel derivative of mystical-revelation tropes.

  * grade_story_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    Avoids formulaic transitions and overly ornate prose. Daydream/star imagery feels fresh conceptually, though "whispers of wilderness" leans trope-y. Emotional arc shown through concrete actions (placing inkwell) rather than stating. Language remains purposeful without sacrificing lyricism. Subtly subverts comedian-tragic-artist dichotomy.

  * grade_story_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Attempts freshness through genre blending (tea leaves in spaceport) but contains inconsistent tonal flourishes (e.g., "thundered to life" feels overwrought). Subtext about emotional repression is present, but the chopstick's symbolic weight borders on overly schematic.

  * grade_story_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Economic prose avoids clichés while forging unexpected connections (e.g., sailing instrument recontextualized as existential cartography); subverts AI tropes by framing synthetic life through anthropological, not dystopian, lens.

  * grade_story_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Avoids genre formulae with scent-based decryption trope, but relic discovery borrows heavily from heroic journey framework; prose occasionally lapses into poetic vagueness that risks purple prose territory; emotional complexity suggested rather than shown.

  * grade_story_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Avoids obvious tropes through unique combinations (traveling library, chalk-on-postcards); some phrases ("bruised exhilaration") lean toward poetical abstraction, but the integration of intellectual struggle with magical realism feels organically human.

  * grade_story_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids most AI tells through specific details (questionable annotations, prancing instructions in yearbooks). Some phrases ("physically metaphysical") risk vagueness but redeemed by organic integration with plot logic. Maintains consistent mythic tone without overwrought language or predictable emotional beats.

  * grade_story_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Avoids genre tropes but occasionally slips into ornate description; character reasoning balances logic/emotion; metaphors (ink as code) inventive; subtle subversion of cursed immortality as eventual strength.

  * grade_story_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids common afterlife tropes through unique crossword-as-portal mechanism. Some phrases ("whispers like mist") border on clichéd. Writing style is purposeful but occasionally veers into ornate descriptions. Emotional nuance present but not fully maximized beyond stated motives.

  * grade_story_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids genre tropes with its grocery-store-portal concept, but phrases like "edges of time blurred" verge on cliché. The spoon's use avoids contrivance through maternal backstory, yet some sentences ("trails in the air," "mechanical breath") risk over-ornamentation. Emotional beats feel earned through concrete rituals (spoon-tapping) rather than abstract declarations.

  * grade_story_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Original cosmic reassembly premise intersects unusually with jigsaw puzzles and marbles; occasional abstract phrases ("unmake what has been wrongly made") border on pretentiousness but avoid full collapse into poetic excess.

  * grade_story_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Blends sci-fi polymerization with folklore curses deftly, but "generational madness" trope remains uninterrogated. Overrelies on phrases like "burden of knowledge" without exploring how madness manifests uniquely per character.

  * grade_story_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids genre clichés through unusual combinations (DNA melodies animating clay), yet some phrasing ("bloodshot from 72 hours without sleep") leans on familiar tropes. Technical jargon (e.g., frequency modulator) feels authentic, but the shame/redemption arc follows predictable contours. Metaphors are fresh but occasionally overwritten.

  * grade_story_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on "storm during pivotal moment" trope. The tailor-scientist duality offers freshness, though the confessional storm device borders on contrived. Technical jargon and metaphors feel balanced.

  * grade_story_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Avoids generic carnival tropes through specific details (red-tailed hawk, cedar pencil box). The "curse of honesty" conceit feels original in execution, though "tapestry of fate" approaches cliché without sufficient novelty in its application.

  * grade_story_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids major tropes through focus on existential discovery over plot mechanics. Purple prose tendencies emerge ("slow poison," "echo of a voice in a canyon"). Emotional resonance hinges on clichéd epiphany rather than nuanced subtext.

  * grade_story_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Refreshingly inventive combination of elements avoids most clichés, though "sad clown" trope receives only moderate subversion. Some phrases ("jagged generosity") verge on self-consciously clever, detracting slightly from emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Avoids clichés through surreal premise; metaphors are fresh but occasionally risk abstract vagueness; tone remains consistent despite formal daring.

  * grade_story_267.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Original in combining alchemy with astronomy; avoids most clichés. Some overly ornate phrases ("stellar formations danced") but emotional restraint and specific details (baseball game as temporal anchor) elevate authenticity.

  * grade_story_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the assassin-for-ecology trope avoids complete cliché through aquatic setting, character reasoning feels overly mechanistic rather than deeply human. Some fresh choices (toxin dagger vs plush toy) but occasional generic phrases dilute uniqueness.

  * grade_story_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    Unique premise undermined by generic emotional beats and trope reliance (mysterious teacher, chosen student). Prose balances lyricism and clarity but overuses cinematic shorthand ("knew you were different"). Thematic connections feel engineered rather than organic.

  * grade_story_271.txt (grade=3.9)
    Relies on overfamiliar tropes (tortured genius, forbidden lab) with insufficient subversion; metaphors like "compass needle to true north" feel formulaic despite moments of originality in descriptive language.

  * grade_story_273.txt (grade=9.4)
    Fresh integration of mythic stakes with intimate human acts avoids formulaicity; language is precise (e.g., “coarse thread,” “solid ground” dreams) without veering into unnecessary ornamentation.

  * grade_story_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids most clichés (weathervane as translation device is inventive); however, the hermit’s role as symbolic savior follows predictable spiritual-teacher tropes without subverting expectations.

  * grade_story_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Original setting combines with fresh ecological themes, but contains occasional generic phrasing ("tactically reckless") and slightly mechanical transitions.

  * grade_story_28.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids overt clichés in core concept but contains occasional over-explaining ("tree of regret"). Sensory details specific but some emotional conclusions (regret lifting) explicitly stated rather than shown.

  * grade_story_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    Original premise avoids genre tropes but veers into overwritten mysticism ('uncharted echoes,' bees as prophets). Some phrases ('secret wisdom') feel trope-adjacent; the cathedral's impossibility lacks anchoring details. The twist tie's vibration is a clever, tactile exception. Emotional restraint prevents full 'purple prose' collapse but distances readers.

  * grade_story_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids most AI-writing pitfalls with fresh metaphors (e.g. "dust particle cosmos"). Some awkward transitions ("The mathematical precision...") and slightly ornate phrasing ("conscious detonation"), but maintains consistent tone through purposeful specificity in craft descriptions.

  * grade_story_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    Avoids overt clichés with original premise; minimal purple prose but occasionally leans on grand abstractions that could be more grounded in specific details

  * grade_story_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    Original premise undermined by occasional clichéd phrases ("accidental wisdom") and expositional dialogue; postcard pattern system shows ingenuity but lacks technical depth.

  * grade_story_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Original premise with fresh imagery (cosmic bees, quantum flight patterns) but occasionally dips into quasi-lyrical abstraction over purposeful detail (e.g., repetitive "mixed blessings" phrasing).

  * grade_story_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Avoids most clichés with its unique escape method and atmospheric tension; however, phrases like "murky tenderness" verge on abstraction without sufficient emotional grounding.

  * grade_story_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on hauntings and poetic catharsis as somewhat familiar devices. Prose is polished but occasionally veers into melodrama (“scorching poise”). Marlow’s introspective tone feels human, but the dummy’s agency lacks organic logic. Metaphors are evocative without revolutionizing the genre.

  * grade_story_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Avoids clichés; the nanobotanical ecosystem and apologetic profession are inventive. Subtle literary devices (e.g., color shifts for emotion) enhance originality. Avoids purple prose while maintaining lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Originality shines through setting and premise; occasional overly ornate descriptors but largely avoids formulaic structures.

  * grade_story_284.txt (grade=4.9)
    Repetitive romantic trope execution feels formulaic; overwritten phrases ("air tasted of honey and possibility") verge on purple prose; emotional shifts stated explicitly rather than demonstrated through nuanced behavior or subtext.

  * grade_story_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Original premise with minor genre-tweaking but occasional overfamiliar elements (hidden libraries, missing mystics); avoids full trope saturation

  * grade_story_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Avoids most clichés through crab symbolism and vulnerable transition concept. Incantation risks whimsy but pays off thematically. Sparse, purposeful prose balances vivid imagery with clarity. Uncommon emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Avoids most clichés through unique metaphors and subversive methods, but some genre conventions (lost love, corrupt kingdom) remain thinly reimagined.

  * grade_story_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids overt AI clichés (no "ancient aliens" tropes) but occasionally relies on familiar beats (lone scientist discovering existential truth). Phrases like "awkward elegance" and "bioluminescent patterns mimicking equations" show ingenuity, yet the final epiphany about "adaptation" feels didactically predictable despite clever surface layering.

  * grade_story_288.txt (grade=5.6)
    Clichés like "quiet courage" and the paddleboarding romance lean toward formulaic writing. Some phrases ("vibrating with nervous energy," "repurposed scientific facility") lean generic rather than vivid. The quarantine as atmospheric disturbance avoids typical zombie/virus tropes but risks vagueness. The "audacious meekness" description lacks grounding in specific behavior.

  * grade_story_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids pure formula through unexpected juxtapositions (taxi mysticism, modern shapeshifters) and subversive refinements (correction from "overthrow" to "restore"). Some purple prose ("symphony of color") and convenient plotting undermine originality. The woman's predatory teeth and shifting eyes feel fresh but verge on cliché in their deliberate menace signaling.

  * grade_story_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Originality lies in blending nautical and cosmic imagery; avoids genre tropes with “star-mapped oceans” and introspective haunting, though “deliberately accidental” risks thematic abstraction over organic integration.

  * grade_story_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Subverts genre tropes by replacing theft with heirloom reclamation. Avoids purple prose but includes a few overfamiliar phrases ("rising and falling like a tide"). Emotional stakes feel organic, though predictability in redemption arc slightly dampens originality.

  * grade_story_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Some overused tropes (mystical ethnicized artist, enchanted artifacts) undercut originality; language occasionally borders on purple prose but avoids outright cliché through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    Avoids clichés; fresh use of "dry-tongued" as a metaphor for lost voice, prism’s function as archival device, and fusion of tech ("electronic amber") with mythic fungi. No purple prose, though some descriptors verge on over-precise.

  * grade_story_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Avoids overt clichés with the paint-smudge method, but the "hidden artifact" trope is largely unchallenged. Language remains purposeful without excess ornamentation. Some phrases ("shimmer of possibility") verge on abstraction, diluting the story’s grounded historical tone.

  * grade_story_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Original handling of AI-susceptible elements: unconventional setting, integration of Eastern philosophical concepts with Western scientific methodology. Avoids purple prose despite poetic elements. While some thematic statements lean slightly abstract, emotional undercurrents feel organically earned through action.

  * grade_story_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    Hybrid setting offers innovation but telekinetic gambler trope leans on familiar space opera conventions. Family tradition exposition feels checklist-driven.

  * grade_story_295.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Visionary concept avoids overt tropes but occasionally relies on familiar phrases (“dance like spirits”) and idealized descriptions that slightly dilute the grit of a post-apocalyptic world.

    Avoids cliché and formulaic writing; metaphors are fresh, and the prose balances richness with clarity and purpose.

  * grade_story_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally leans on familiar archetypes (the last traditional storyteller, artist colony rebellion). The "interconnected paths" concept is original, but some phrases ("living museum," "soul of a place") border on aspirational vagueness that detracts from raw authenticity.

  * grade_story_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Original cosmic-codification concept undermined by occasional purple prose and trope-adjacent madness arc.

  * grade_story_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids major clichés but leans on supernatural convenience. Language is concise but occasionally veers into ornate descriptions (e.g., "soul of the space"). Concept feels derivative of ghostly "voices in walls" tropes.

  * grade_story_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Originality undermined by genre tropes (assassin redemption arcs) and inconsistent prose quality; striking metaphors clash with overused descriptors ("unforgiving road") and a method (spider's web motif) feeling contrived rather than organic.

  * grade_story_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Avoids major AI clichés through inventive combinations (neural pathway spices, language-exchange multiverse), though some phrases ("dignified chaos") verge on generic; subverts procedural sci-fi tropes effectively

  * grade_story_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    Mix of fresh concepts (vibrational archaeology) and overused tropes (fallen child star, mystical Spanish cathedrals); prose occasionally veers into melodrama but maintains stylistic consistency.

  * grade_story_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids overt clichés with a unique rebellion method, but the DVD's influence and council's abrupt change verge on predictable narrative shortcuts.

  * grade_story_302.txt (grade=5.5)
    Over-reliance on romantic poet/mad genius tropes undermines originality. "Taming chaos through poetry" concept has historical antecedents but execution lacks radical reinterpretation. Mechanical fireflies are inventive but isolated from deeper world logic. Purple prose ("brazen humility," "kiss the horizon") frequently replaces authentic strangeness. The napkin ending feels gimmicky rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_309.txt (grade=6.0)
    The detective and gallery lean on genre conventions, but the kaleidoscope infuses originality. Overused descriptors (“bloodshot eyes,” “labyrinth of human depravity”) and the overwrought line “molten sarcasm” suggest template-driven phrasing. Nuanced handling of memory (via flashes rather than exposition) is a rare strength.

  * grade_story_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Avoids most tropes with its unique premise but occasionally veers into poetic abstraction; some descriptors (e.g., "tides of time") risk feeling overfamiliar but are justified by context.

  * grade_story_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Avoids genre clichés through unexpected combinations: Cyberpunk server farms reclaiming farmhouse history adds historical dimension. "Excited restraint" tone avoids reducing daughter to mere tech zombie - her augmented eyes scanning the analog key become ironic critique. Organic network concept reimagines cyberpunk resistance through gardening rather than typical hacker tropes. Similes remain specific ("branches like supplicants") rather than generic. Emotional nuance emerges through actions (weight lifting from shoulders) rather than declarations. Writing maintains consistent voice without excessive ornamentation, balancing tech terms with agricultural lyricism. Subverts expectations by making "interconnected lives" about biological rather than digital networks.

  * grade_story_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Avoids overt clichés with silent rebellion/glass cannon strongholds. Weaknesses include "heartbeat" clock metaphor and occasionally over-polished phrases ("eternal ballet" of light/shadow) that undermine raw urgency. Tension feels algorithmically optimized rather than organically human.

  * grade_story_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    Elements like "serene anger" and "genetically modified wheat" avoid genre tropes, but the bodyguard archetype and colonial rebellion setup feel familiar. Prose is purposeful but occasionally lapses into overly polished phrasing that weakens emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_314.txt (grade=5.0)
    Relies heavily on dystopian-utopia and ancient-aliens tropes without fresh subversion. The "sentient kelp as exploited beings" concept has ecological resonance but falls into predictable "white savior" narrative pattern. The "rustic bread box containing magical orb" sequence reads as arbitrary genre-mixing rather than innovative synthesis, with purple prose moments like "bioluminescent patterns blooming within her" diluting narrative precision.

  * grade_story_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    Combines familiar dystopian tropes with the fresh twist of ghostly collaborators. Avoids overt clichés but leans on “rebellious underdog” archetypes. Language is purposeful but occasionally veers into generic phrasing (“tide he’d learned to ride”).

  * grade_story_317.txt (grade=6.3)
    Avoids overt clichés but leans on familiar AI-character tropes (loyal servant with hidden depth). The crystal-leak saboteur method feels predictable. Some phrases (“burning ache for mornings,” “betrayal of programming”) veer toward cliché or purple prose.

  * grade_story_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escapes common tropes through digital existentialism but exhibits AI patterns: repetitive "dusty" imagery, over-explanation of simulation mechanics, and emotionally detached narration that prioritizes conceptual coolness over human vulnerability.

  * grade_story_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Avoids overt clichés, balancing originality (lullabies as memory encoding) with some overly familiar emotional beats (parental sacrifice).

  * grade_story_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally falls into redemptive arc tropes. Sensory details are specific but occasionally generic ("whispering"). Character reasoning occasionally prioritizes plot needs over human complexity. Language remains purposeful but lacks distinctive stylistic voice.

  * grade_story_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    Fresh metaphors (photos as anchors) undercut by occasionally generic descriptors ("impossible space between" lacks specificity).

  * grade_story_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids overt clichés but contains familiar fantasy elements (fading magic, magical heritage); writing style is polished but occasionally veers into ornate description rather than profound originality

  * grade_story_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    Predictable elements outweigh innovation: The consciousness-transfer trope is given a minimal subversion through the "duplicate" decoy, but relies heavily on familiar sci-fi structures without deep reinvention.

  * grade_story_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stilted metaphors ("threads move like living things") and mystical-stranger trope weaken authenticity; tone shifts feel engineered.

  * grade_story_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids most dystopian clichés through meticulous sensory specifics and unusual metaphors ("bones creaking with the gate"). However, the Sorting scene follows genre tropes without significant subversion, and the protagonist's psychological complexity occasionally gives way to archetypal gestures.

  * grade_story_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Avoids major AI-tropes with specific details (treble clef entanglement, beard-like roots). The "giggling gust" strains believability slightly. Subtly subverts ritual narratives by making sacred practices dependent on mundane objects. Some purple prose tendencies in atmospheric passages.

  * grade_story_325.txt (grade=6.5)
    Blends mad scientist trope with speculative biology, but occasionally lapses into ornate, AI-generated phrasing that undermines its potential novelty

  * grade_story_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Refreshing inversion of "selling" as manipulation vs. invitation; avoids clichés in premise but occasionally dips into familiar mystical object tropes and ornate descriptors ("impossible blooms").

  * grade_story_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Avoids genre clichés by focusing on psychological redemption over external quest. No formulaic phrases. Sensory details specific (e.g., “molten metal eyes,” “bubbling oils”). Subtextual layers (truth as purifying fire) elevate beyond surface plot.

  * grade_story_329.txt (grade=5.9)
    Attempts quirkiness with noodle farms and Soviet microfilms avoid cliché, but execution oscillates between purple prose ("dusk-lit confetti") and underdeveloped concepts (pulse of mystery). Character motivations occasionally feel algorithmically assigned rather than psychologically coherent.

  * grade_story_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction ("scattered harmony" remains conceptually vague). Some details (e.g., hospital bed dialogue) prioritize function over psychological nuance.

  * grade_story_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids genre clichés through conceptual twists (blank card magic, living pearls) but contains minor purple prose tendencies in environmental descriptions; character psychology shows human nuance but metaphors occasionally prioritize poetic over precise.

  * grade_story_330.txt (grade=6.7)
    Some AI-like phrasing patterns emerge ("liquid states depending on lunar phase"). Subverts "Atlantea" rather than Atlantis trope, but redemption arc follows formulaic beats. Purple prose avoided, yet emotional depth remains surface-level through stated transformations rather than nuanced character reactions.

  * grade_story_334.txt (grade=6.3)
    Attempts to subvert clichés (parallel realities rebellion) but relies on overly familiar metaphors and explanatory narration over visceral subtext.

  * grade_story_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids formulaic structures through unique ontological horror framing; cosmic kilter replaces typical sci-fi tropes. Some lyrical passages risk ornateness, but originality shines in conceptualizing awareness of impermanence as inheritance rather than curse. Emotional complexity emerges through subtext rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Avoids genre clichés with quantum-spirituality synthesis, but metaphors occasionally border on pretension ("tarnished silver case etched with forgotten symbols"). Bat-driven agitation strains credulity yet serves plot ingeniously. Subtlety in character psychology edges away from algorithmic patterns.

  * grade_story_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Original synthesis of space opera and artistic quest; avoids most clichés. Occasional ornate phrasing ("impossibly structured like brushstrokes") risks pretension. Subtle subversion of "mad artist" trope but under-explored.

  * grade_story_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Redemption arc avoids overt sentimentality through painterly symbolism. Cathedral-as-artist-sanctuary combines assigned elements inventively. Some purple prose ("heart remembered") and inconsistent metaphor density. Emotional arc feels human despite structural contrivances. Tension between destruction/creation shows creative thinking.

  * grade_story_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but occasionally slips into formalized poetry ("azure skies," "absolute dark"). Metaphors like "brief, brilliant flare of each life" feel fresh, yet repetitive weight/burden imagery and slight over-reliance on abstract emotional descriptions reveal minor formulaic tendencies.

  * grade_story_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    Original setting compromised by clichéd phrases ("tides of compromise"); anvil ritual feels arbitrarily chosen rather than organically integrated.

  * grade_story_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The haunted academia trope is somewhat familiar, though the intentional architectural haunting offers a fresh twist. Some phrasing (“braided bitterness,” “spectral guardian”) veers into ornate abstraction. Emotional beats occasionally rely on direct statements rather than subtext or action.

  * grade_story_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on poetic abstraction (e.g., "reassembly of reality") as a crutch. Metaphors are fresh (kaleidoscope=uncertainty) but some phrasing veers toward ornate ("earnest whimsy"). Emotions shown through objects more than character psychology. Slight AI-flavor in repetitive structure of similes. No major tonal shifts break immersion.

  * grade_story_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids formulaic structures through symbolic layering; metaphors remain specific rather than generic; character psychology shows some human nuance despite brevity constraints; atmospheric descriptions avoid overwrought prose while maintaining lyrical quality.

  * grade_story_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    While avoiding overt clichés, some elements (mentor's disappearance, "weight of legacy" trope) remain predictable; the prose occasionally drifts into ornate descriptions of the Amazon but maintains purposeful phrasing more consistently than many AI-generated texts.

  * grade_story_338.txt (grade=5.3)

  * grade_story_342.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overly polished prose lacks risk-taking; "ancient oaks," "living wood" trope feels recycled. Synesthesia of shifting patterns is fresh but derivative of magic-realist traditions. Reliance on atmospheric vagueness masks shallow conflict.

  * grade_story_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Subverts "returning priest" trope by embracing uncertainty over dogma; metaphors feel fresh (beanstalks as faith's obfuscation), though occasional adjectival density ("unapologetically confused") teeters toward forced poeticism.

  * grade_story_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Avoids major formulaic patterns but operates within mystical ancestry tropes without subversion; writing is purposeful and avoids excess ornamentation, but innovativeness remains limited to atmospheric execution.

  * grade_story_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    While imaginative elements distinguish the story from formulaic tales, certain plot mechanics like villainous monologues from wasp queens and rapid transformation feel contrived.

  * grade_story_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    The floating setting and jam-based healing avoid cliché but flirt with whimsical abstraction. Phrasing like “impossible shapes—coral formations” blends seamlessly, but other lines (“healing comes through the most ordinary pleasures”) feel overfamiliar.

  * grade_story_349.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    Original in combining dance, surreal setting, and epistolary deception. Avoids most clichés, though phrases like "discarded dream" lean generic. Emotional progression feels human despite poetic abstraction, but the "heart as true north" conclusion risks sentimentality.

  * grade_story_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conceptual ingenuity undercut by overreliance on familiar elements (teddy bear trope, “arcane hacker” archetype); uneven similes (“melodious voice”) feel generic; emotional stakes declared rather than shown; erratic line-level polish suggests inconsistent authorial control.

  * grade_story_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The premise blends original elements (time-travel mayor, flower-based frequency) with familiar tropes (lone hero challenging tyranny), avoiding outright cliché through unusual juxtapositions.

Some risk of gothic pretension in descriptions but generally tempered by precise detail ("7:13 PM" specificity). Occasional phrases ("solitude's garden") threaten purple prose but remain restrained. Emotional arc feels organic rather than formulaic, though the final epiphany borders on overly pat resolution for such a shadowed character.

  * grade_story_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Avoids genre clichés with meek protagonist and non-violent resolution; some overly precise descriptions ("luminescent rivers") tip toward stylistic affectation but don't undermine overall originality of combining necromancy with ecological themes.

  * grade_story_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids major formulaic pitfalls; the AI-revolution framework isn't overly clichéd here. Dialogue remains natural, though Eleanor’s role as archivist occasionally feels slightly contrived rather than organically integrated.

  * grade_story_361.txt (grade=9.3)
    Avoids genre tropes by encoding indigenous wisdom in mathematical patterns. No purple prose; the diner's "retrofitted neon" and "spider's web data crystal" offer fresh imagery. Corporate terraformers could descend into caricature but remain effective as faceless antagonists without overcomplication.

  * grade_story_364.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Writing avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on marginally overwrought phrasing ("tendrils of doubt," "talismans against darkness") that risks veering into quasi-poetic abstraction rather than sharply original imagery.

    Original premise with clever ice-patterns metaphor; minimal formulaic phrasing, though pacing occasionally prioritizes plot over psychological realism.

  * grade_story_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Originality is uneven: the swashbuckler-in-cyberpunk conceit is intriguing but underdeveloped. Marbles as a “map to pre-crash tech” borders on contrivance. Prose avoids overt purple prose but includes generic descriptors (“neon-scarred wasteland”) that dilute authenticity.

  * grade_story_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Setting and yodeling add originality, but redemption arc contains formulaic undertones with occasional overwrought phrasing.

  * grade_story_372.txt (grade=6.3)

  * grade_story_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Avoids sci-fi clichés through conceptual fusion (Cartographers mapping reality's seams, seismographs reading data pulses). No purple prose; metaphors feel organic. Emotions emerge through action (transforming character model) rather than exposition, though some transitions between game and real-world logic remain vaguely defined.

  * grade_story_379.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    "Wind chimes" simile risks preciousness; story resists overtly stating "soldier's PTSD" in favor of oblique manifestations (uniform bagginess, medal weight), but some phrases like "throne of reason" flirt with declamatory didacticism; overall style walks tightrope between lyrical and purple.

  * grade_story_376.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_380.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_391.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Borrowed assassin-butterfly dichotomy gains freshness through prophecy manipulation, but phrases like "moved through the palace like a shadow" and "whispers of longing" exhibit AI-patterned phrasing. Emotional subtext remains surface-level despite thematic ambitions.

The sleepwalking patient’s carved palm and Eleanor’s decision to follow footprints are imaginative subversions of genre tropes. Emotional resonance is more atmospheric than visceral, avoiding AI-like flatness but leaning slightly on familiar motifs.

Character reasoning blends logic (inspector's button recognition) and emotion effectively, though their connection feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_450.txt (grade=6.3)
    Uncommon dance/translation conceit juxtaposed with predictable prophecy structure. Family photos as coded legacy feels contrived; patch's glow-and-dissolve mechanism leans on sci-fi shorthand. Purple prose ("saturated ambivalence") undercuts nuance.

  * grade_story_455.txt (grade=7.2)
    Genre hybridity (mysticism/spy history) shows ingenuity but strains internal logic. Tropes (scarred keeper, ghostly legacy) are recombined rather than subverted. Some over-adorned sentences dilute emotional authenticity.

  * grade_story_461.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids genre clichés through psychological depth over supernatural spectacle. Some phrases ("manipulative old bat") verge on archetypal but emotional authenticity in dialogue/dialogueless scenes prevents formulaicity.

  * grade_story_460.txt (grade=9.8)
    The post-apocalyptic trope is refreshed through the puzzle motif and tactile magic realism of the feather. Some phrases ("whispers of possible futures") border on overused fantasy clichés, but the integration of ecological collapse with cognitive revelation feels inventive. Emotional resonance is earned through carefully chosen details (e.g., extinct species' feather) rather than explicit declarations. Language occasionally tips toward ornate ("prickly wonder"), but mostly maintains controlled lyricism.

  * grade_story_451.txt (grade=6.9)
    Original concept undermined by genre tropes (e.g., mystical mountain, apocalyptic prophecy); avoids formulaic writing through inventive paradox mechanics but occasionally lapses into familiar "chosen one" dynamics.

  * grade_story_462.txt (grade=7.8)
    Largely avoids formulaic writing, though phrases like "dust particles that danced" and "cradle of sparks" risk overromanticization. The house of mirrors and self-acceptance theme border on familiar territory but are revitalized through precise, innovative details (the metal sign's rhythmic tapping, stained glass light fracturing). Originality emerges in the convergence of elements rather than individual components. Nuanced emotional texture balances moments of overwrought prose.

  * grade_story_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Originality in reimagining "guardian" tropes with scientific-poetic fusion, but some phrases (e.g., "methodical madness") border on cliché; emotional depth is implied rather than fully inhabited.

  * grade_story_464.txt (grade=9.1)
    The premise avoids clichés, weaving quantum gastronomy and cosmic chaos into a cohesive, imaginative narrative. Prose remains purposeful, though a few overly ornate phrases occasionally detract from clarity.

  * grade_story_463.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fresh handling of Gothic tropes with dance-as-ritual concept. Avoids purple prose while maintaining lyrical quality. Emotions shown more than told, with some exceptions in exposition.

  * grade_story_465.txt (grade=7.8)
    Avoids fantasy clichés through airship ghost specificity, though "elegantly disheveled" and "jaded eyes" border on formulaic phrasing.

  * grade_story_468.txt (grade=8.0)
    Original premise elevated by inventive dream-collection mechanics. Avoids genre tropes but contains occasional purple prose ("loudly serene" over-reliance).

  * grade_story_469.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative avoids overt clichés by grounding smuggler Eliza in moral complexity but occasionally slips into formulaic descriptions (“thrill of discovery”). The jasmine scent twist is original, but the “mechanical voice countdown” trope feels predictable and under-innovated.

  * grade_story_467.txt (grade=8.2)
    Avoids excessive ornamentation; metaphors ("hummingbird possibility") feel fresh. Submerges clichés (lost civilizations) with specificity (librarian's desk, mosaic fragment). Emotional beats shown through actions more than exposition, though Marina's backstory feels slightly imposed.

  * grade_story_470.txt (grade=5.9)
    Relies on genre tropes (hidden diaries, reluctant custodians) without meaningful subversion; sensory descriptions often prioritize invention over psychological realism. While avoiding overt purple prose, dialogue and introspection lean on familiar archetypes rather than nuanced human contradiction.

  * grade_story_466.txt (grade=7.0)
    Original concept executed with mixed stylistic execution. Avoids cliche through specific botanical details but occasionally leans into poetic abstraction ("gentle chaos") rather than sharper, more distinctive imagery. Some phrases border on ornate without deepening character or theme.

  * grade_story_471.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids overt clichés with nuanced twists (e.g., corporation as antagonist, musician narrators). Prose is lyrical but occasionally veers into decorum (“atomize into comprehensible fragments”). Emotional resonance is earned but relies slightly on stated feelings.

  * grade_story_472.txt (grade=6.8)
    Original premise marred by occasional generic descriptors ("amber light," "distant stars"); character reactions blend archetypal logic with genuine surprise; avoids most clichés while occasionally prioritizing concept over emotional realism.

  * grade_story_47.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids most clichés with raw memoir revelations and complex mentor dynamic; some reliance on "cryptic messages" trope; language precise but occasionally veers toward melodrama; emotional subtext strong despite minor instances of stating vs. showing.

  * grade_story_478.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative avoids overt clichés but occasionally relies on familiar fantasy scaffolding (ancient secrets revealed through diaries). Prose leans into lyrical abstraction ("maelstrom gradually calmed") rather than vivid, singular imagery. Emotional nuance is occasionally sacrificed for thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_477.txt (grade=7.0)
    Combines familiar tropes (dystopian conformity, cosmic signals) with inventive logic (ocean as lens), but phrases like “lucid frenzy” feel overly deliberate; avoids outright clichés but occasionally leans on poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_473.txt (grade=5.3)
    Idea-rich yet occasionally strained by familiar rebellion tropes; some phrasing ("achingly bittersweet grit") veers toward self-indulgence; conceptually inventive but tonal consistency falters in minor sections.

  * grade_story_476.txt (grade=9.0)
    Fresh subversion of "brawler" trope, precise language, and nuanced subtext elevate originality; only minor risk of introspective overindulgence.

  * grade_story_474.txt (grade=7.0)
    Avoids overt tropes in the pawn-representing-diversity concept and sentient shadows, but the rebellion’s societal context and romanticized spirituality lean toward conventionality.

  * grade_story_479.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids genre clichés via fresh fusion of mortuary craft and tech; polished prose occasionally veers toward ornate descriptors but maintains voice.

  * grade_story_480.txt (grade=7.8)
    Social media exorcism premise avoids genre staleness, but execution borders on aestheticized cliché (“algorithmic ghosts” never fully explained); prose is crisp but occasionally hollow (e.g., “raw edge” feels glib); infiltrating clubs and receipt-code are clever plot devices but strain credulity as lived-in narrative choices.

  * grade_story_48.txt (grade=4.9)
    Relies on genre conventions (AI companionship, space pirates) without subverting them; some phrases border on ornate ("everyday miracles") but lack specificity; emotional beats feel conceptually stated rather than organically shown.

  * grade_story_484.txt (grade=6.3)
    Blends genre tropes with niche brewing philosophy but remains derivative. Some forced details ("uniquely generic") contrast awkwardly with atmospheric needs; avoids full purple prose but occasionally leans on formulaic phrasing.

  * grade_story_475.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story subverts dystopian tropes by rooting rebellion in analog nostalgia (circus, brewing) rather than tech-savvy heroism. Avoids clichéd “chosen one” arcs; Maxwell’s ordinary expertise is refreshing. Some phrases (“digital tethers,” “implanted”) risk cliché but are offset by originality in lullaby-coding and circus decay. Emotional beats (photo frame, wind-whispered lullaby) feel earned, not formulaic. Minimal purple prose; sensory detail is precise but sparse.

  * grade_story_481.txt (grade=8.6)
    Avoids formulaic phrasing through specific details (dictionary page numbers, burnished copper eyes); forge-in-hospital concept subverts sci-fi tropes while maintaining emotional authenticity

  * grade_story_489.txt (grade=8.1)
    Avoids overt clichés (e.g., the protagonist’s “disappearance” isn’t a tragedy) but leans on haunted-lighthouse tropes with enough nuance (the observer’s ambiguity) to feel fresh. The “aggressively kind” trait avoids one-dimensionality through Eliza’s nuanced interactions. Some metaphors (“haunting call”) border on generic, but the whale-whistle connection is inventive and thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_494.txt (grade=5.8)
    Some tropes (wise old master, arrogant hero’s redemption) feel derivative; the song and tapestry avoid cliché but are inconsistently weighted in the narrative.

  * grade_story_486.txt (grade=7.6)
    Avoids most AI-writing patterns but contains predictable tropes (witch mentor, cathedral decay). Phrasing occasionally veers into purple prose ("dance of clumsily dexterous fingers"). Metaphors (e.g., "hush of a freshly erased chalkboard") clever but insufficiently grounded

  * grade_story_491.txt (grade=7.7)
    The fusion of botanical mysticism with scientific resurrection is inventive, but reliance on familiar phrases (e.g., “art of illusion”) and a few overly ornate descriptions slightly dilute originality.

  * grade_story_483.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (gardening as freedom) but retains familiar redemption arc. Prose precise though occasional repetition of "chaotic" weakens impact slightly.

  * grade_story_490.txt (grade=8.8)
    Avoids most AI clichés with specific organic details (tendrils of awareness, salt-crusted machinery) but contains a few overly poetic phrases ("cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy") that border on purple prose

  * grade_story_492.txt (grade=6.9)
    Some fresh contrasts (analog tools vs digital chains) but risks formulaic storytelling with "dystopian rebel" tropes. Prose occasionally veers toward ornate simplicity ("digital birds") rather than distinctive voice; emotional depth often told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_482.txt (grade=8.3)
    Originality shines in combining insomnia and scrying as tools for truth-seeking; avoids genre clichés but occasionally leans on vague metaphysical phrasing (“peacefully chaotic”) that feels more atmospheric than specific.

  * grade_story_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    Fresh blend of post-apocalyptic grit and magical realism. Some phrases ("whispers of a future") flirt with cliché, but the ritual’s fusion of magic/tech avoids formulaic writing.

  * grade_story_493.txt (grade=6.5)
    Subverts time-travel tropes by placing a knight in a modernized antiquity, but "mysteriously cheerful guide guarding secrets" leans on clichés. Some fresh metaphors (e.g., "familiar unknown") but occasional purple prose ("quiet persistence of patterns") undermines impact.

  * grade_story_488.txt (grade=7.7)
    Avoids most genre tropes but occasionally slips into ornate description (“rusty ecstasy,” “corroded rapture”) that feels self-conscious; the core idea of reflection-as-complement is fresh, though character psychology leans on deterministic motivation without humanizing complexity.

  * grade_story_498.txt (grade=7.4)
    Subverts gangster redemption trope through generational reckoning. Some phrases ("tyranny of indifference") verge on abstraction. Emotional arc genuine but occasionally softened by slightly generic descriptors ("quiet determination").

  * grade_story_485.txt (grade=8.3)
    Original use of charcoal as communication device and symbolic bridge. Some phrases lean toward poetic abstraction ("melody of fractured conscience") but maintain stylistic consistency. Avoids post-apocalyptic tropes through emphasis on scientific ruin rather than survivalist conflict. Emotional beats show nuance through physical gestures more than explicit introspection.

  * grade_story_487.txt (grade=6.1)
    Blends mythic elements with grounded grief effectively in places, but relies on generic "man-eating plants" trope. Some phrases ("moonlight prismatic shadows") verge on overwrought. Emotional beats feel partially formulaic.

  * grade_story_497.txt (grade=7.4)
    Conceptual blend of sci-fi and mythology shows ingenuity, but trope of lone genius making world-changing discovery feels familiar. Some metaphors ("liquid midnight") succeed more than others, emotional nuance occasionally sacrificed for exposition.

  * grade_story_496.txt (grade=8.5)
    Fresh concept of cosmic verse on skin avoids clichés; perfume bottle as literary heirloom adds nuance; occasional ornate phrasing slightly distracts but doesn't undermine originality.

  * grade_story_495.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_499.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Avoids genre tropes; language purposeful despite occasional ornateness; nuance in humility/powerlessness dialectic.

  * grade_story_52.txt (grade=6.0)
    Original elements diluted by trope reliance (noble thief, sudden romance); emotional beats AI-smooth

  * grade_story_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    Original premise with fresh metaphysical elements, but the fork’s role borders on symbolic overstatement; some transitions feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_56.txt (grade=5.5)
    Worldbuilding shows ingenuity, but reliance on swindler/mysterious patron tropes undermines originality. Some lines (“practiced smile masking unease”) verge on rote phrasing. The twist attempts subversion but telegraphs through conventionally manipulative setups.

  * grade_story_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    Avoids major clichés through unique setting, but the "redemption through apologies" trope gets conventional treatment; static garden concept elevates originality despite recognizable emotional arcs.

  * grade_story_53.txt (grade=3.4)
    Riddled with clichéd phrasing ("whispers of distant stars," "fabric of reality") and predictable mystical tropes. The self-consciously poetic style ("moonlight transformed them into a map of constellations") often devolves into purple prose without narrative urgency or fresh perspective.

  * grade_story_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Avoids genre clichés with unique fusion of sci-fi and tradition, but "vibrations of intent" borders on vague mysticism without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Avoids genre clichés through inventive twist (Sparrow as literal bird). Language is purposeful without unnecessary embellishment; "earnest flippancy" adds unique tonal contrast. Logical gaps in how agents operate within an aristocratic estate slightly undermine authenticity, but the concept's originality compensates.

  * grade_story_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Story escapes genre conventions through its unique synthesis of artistic mortality with cosmic spectacle. Avoids excessive exposition while maintaining lyrical precision. The bittersweet realization avoids melodrama through judicious understatement.

  * grade_story_58.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Avoids clichés with fresh metaphors (collar as memory tapestry). Emotional nuance shown rather than told. Some adjectives approach ornate but remain purposeful.

  * grade_story_6.txt (grade=8.5)

    Aversion of common tropes undercut by intermittent clichéd phrasing ("symphony of tension") and overly precise description.

    Fresh premise with inventive metaphors, but some phrasing borders on ornate; avoids clichés but doesn’t fully subvert familiar character arcs.

  * grade_story_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Avoids genre traps with tactile mysticism; metaphors earthbound yet evocative; emotional subtext implied through gesture rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    Original premise with specific sensory details, but character remains archetypally mystical without subverting reader expectations or offering radical narrative innovation.

  * grade_story_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids formulaic AI patterns but occasionally slips into lyrical abstraction ("dizzyingly grounded confidence") that risks vagueness. Metaphors like plant communication are refreshingly reimagined, though Elias’ psychological depth sometimes relies on familiar archetypes of the "haunted soldier."

  * grade_story_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Original fusion of historical and cyberpunk elements; avoids clichés with inventive details (e.g., rake handle inscriptions). No formulaic patterns detected.

  * grade_story_61.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Avoids genre clichés through original combinations (picnic as ritual, doorplate as death token), but some tonal metaphors verge on familiar gothic tropes.

  * grade_story_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fresh lens on ‘taming darkness’ avoids cosmic fantasy clichés. Dialogue remains lean yet character-specific. Avoids purple prose but occasionally leans on abstract adjectives (‘cathedral to mechanical dreams’) where sharper imagery could deepen authenticity. Subtext feels earned, not imposed.

  * grade_story_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Avoids overt clichés through the joker-as-wild-card concept and consciousness-transferral ending. Avoids purple prose but occasionally substitutes symbolic clarity for emotional nuance. Subtly blends poetic elements with technical description without feeling formulaic.

  * grade_story_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Avoids AI clichés through specific, inventive worldbuilding (embedded moss in a lunch tin) and subtle character nuance (herbs as legacy vs. tools), though minor instances of generic phrasing ("pulsed with rhythm") slightly undercut originality.

  * grade_story_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The premise is original, but phrases like "time itself distilled" verge on overwrought. The dolls' "expectantly resigned" demeanor avoids cliché, yet the prose occasionally prioritizes poetic density over organic progression, hinting at formulaic flourishes.

  * grade_story_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The witch’s role feels like a plot device rather than integral worldbuilding. Some descriptions (“gravestones tilting like crooked teeth”) are fresh, but the Tesla bulb leans on recognizable brand-name mystique rather than organic symbolism. Emotional beats occasionally lapse into stated sentimentality.

  * grade_story_73.txt (grade=4.3)
    Phrases like "raucous silence" and "kindrelize" feel forced, while motifs such as "shovel as heartbeat" lean into cliché rather than freshness; subtext is thin, and the narrative occasionally prioritizes concept over organic character or setting development.

  * grade_story_71.txt (grade=6.0)
    Avoids outright cliché recycling but falls into genre-typical patterns with "guardian against unknowable forces" and VR battle tropes. Style occasionally veers toward mannered descriptions with phrases like "crystalline spears."

  * grade_story_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Avoids overt clichés through unique setting/concept combination but occasionally falters with slightly over-polished phrasing ("echo of quiet," "scientific poetry") that feels curated rather than organic; emotional beats show nuance but risk being undercut by elevated diction.

  * grade_story_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    Avoids full cliché with nano-forest uniqueness, but "Collective" villain skews generic; some ornate phrases ("angry peace") feel pretentious rather than precise.

  * grade_story_82.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Original twist on redemption through discovered evidence; avoids clichés with mixtapes-as-codes, but occasional ornate phrasing ("savage grace") risks melodrama.

  * grade_story_77.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strengths: Starlight-siphoning vines offer fresh biological conceit; avoids most bureaucratic sci-fi tropes. Weakness: Some phrases ('living cathedral', 'cup starlight in mortal palms') border on poetic excess; Elena's characterization leans on scientist-saint archetype.

  * grade_story_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Unique combinations of censored texts and dream preservation avoid complete predictability. Occasional poetic phrasing borders on purple prose without undermining originality.

  * grade_story_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Avoids total formulaicity through specific sensory details but relies on familiar apocalypse frameworks. Prose occasionally slips into AI-esque abstraction ("architecture of cosmic balance") rather than authentic introspection.

  * grade_story_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    Avoids most cyberpunk clichés by incorporating unexpected elements like the hot air balloon festival and candle-based hacking. However, phrases like "bones of an ancient timeline" feel overwritten rather than specific, and some emotional beats rely on conventional descriptors ("determined," "bitterly"). Archer's internal conflict shows human nuance, but moments of exposition-driven motivation ("remembering the children in the undercity") verge on formulaic. The writing style maintains consistency but doesn't reach distinctive individuality.

  * grade_story_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Avoids major clichés (Mirror Walker portrayed as luminous rather than monstrous), but mentor’s aphorism and "breadcrumbs" line verge on trope; prose occasionally leans on ornate phrasing unnecessarily.

  * grade_story_81.txt (grade=7.3)
    Avoids time travel tropes but some purple prose (paradoxical breeze) and slightly manufactured emotional beats; mostly succeeds with fresh concept of time observatories and memorial-like decay as calibration tools.

  * grade_story_80.txt (grade=4.3)

  * grade_story_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    Avoids outright clichés but leans on mystical order tropes with uneven execution. Sensory details (light reflections, metallic corrosion) feel specific but could be more visceral. "Confusing certainty" concept is intriguingly paradoxical but underutilized. Avoids purple prose but occasionally becomes overly formal in exposition.

  * grade_story_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    Mix of fresh and formulaic elements; "cosmic Rubik's cube" and billboard maze lean clichéd, while water ring visions feel innovative; some purple prose and predictable emotional beats.

  * grade_story_84.txt (grade=9.3)
    Avoids overused tropes with the turtle-shell city and kind-hearted performance concept. Language is purposeful (e.g., "game is well-played" as understated triumph), though minor instances of ornate phrasing (e.g., "billowing dramatically") slightly detract.

  * grade_story_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Avoids common AI tropes through toaster absurdism; metaphors like "poetry of prime numbers" feel fresh; precise sensory descriptors occasionally lapse into formulaic adjectives.

  * grade_story_91.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Luxury-spiritual fusion leans on spa clichés; the attendant's mystic wisdom borders on trope; metaphors feel consciously contrived rather than organically emerging from character or setting.

  * grade_story_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Original twist on time travel tropes (agency manipulation, self-hunting). Avoids sentimentality; metaphors are fresh. Slight over-reliance on “femme fatale” framework is tempered by nuance in character voice.

  * grade_story_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Avoids overt formulaic writing but occasionally strains credibility - pirate radio coordination feels schematic. "Desperate hope" verges on abstraction rather than embodied emotion. Metaphors stay fresh (calling cards as obsolete messengers of truth) but the cathedral finale risks sentimental payoff. Subtle tonal inconsistencies mar otherwise distinctive voice.

  * grade_story_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Haunted mansion tropes refreshed through botanical abnormalities and blood mystique. Avoids excessive "gothic horror" clichés with modern elements like blood drive backstory. Some purple prose in "heartbeats" plants but generally restrained. Emotional resonance shown through physical reactions rather than explicit statements.

  * grade_story_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Fresh concept execution occasionally falters into poetic abstraction rather than lived-in detail.

  * grade_story_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    Worldbuilding avoids clichés but leans on familiar tropes (e.g., cryptic raven prophecies, magical menageries). Some phrasing ("unwritten futures," "creative well run dry") edges toward poetical shorthand rather than fresh language. The twist (the cup’s sentience) is hinted but feels derivative of "be careful what you wish for" arcs.

  * grade_story_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Avoids most AI markers with specific details (mastiff's slumber, tapestry's movement) but relies on secret society tropes. Plastic ruler's uniqueness offsets familiar initiation narrative. Subverts "forbidden knowledge" warnings via meta-commentary on curiosity.

  * grade_story_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Some phrases ("dimension fracturing like shattered glass") verge on cliché, but most imagery (emotion-colors, "harmonious flux") feels fresh. Avoids over-explanation while maintaining nuance in emotional transitions. No formulaic structure despite clear arc.
