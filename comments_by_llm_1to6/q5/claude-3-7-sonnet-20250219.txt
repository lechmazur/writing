The story lacks the messy human nuance that would make the central relationship and revelation feel authentic.

The dialogue exchange is functional but lacks distinctive character voices.

  * grade_story_57.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story avoids most AI-writing pitfalls but contains some predictable elements. The revelation about the microfilm feels somewhat convenient, and the director's quick capitulation lacks the resistance one would expect.

    While the story avoids many AI-writing pitfalls, certain phrases like "dizzyingly grounded confidence" feel artificially constructed. The narrative occasionally relies on telling emotional states rather than showing them. The resolution, with authorities accepting the plant-memory explanation, feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story demonstrates considerable originality in its concept and execution. The writing avoids common fantasy tropes by focusing on the emotional toll of Crow's existence rather than just the fantastical elements. Metaphors like the "dance of impossible geometries" feel fresh. The emotional nuance of Crow's "fervent apathy" is well-handled.

  * grade_story_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the story avoids most AI hallmarks, phrases like "raucous silence" and "kindrelizing people" feel somewhat forced.

  * grade_story_337.txt (grade=5.5)
    The writing avoids major AI tells but occasionally relies on slightly ornate or familiar phrasing ("stained with ink and wisdom," "earnest whimsy"). The core concept and character setup, while pleasant, don't feel exceptionally original or subversive. It lacks a truly distinctive voice or stylistic flair.

  * grade_story_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    While avoiding overt AI tells like abrupt shifts, the prose occasionally dips into slightly overwrought territory ('tapestry of hidden hours,' 'quantum architecture,' 'objectively emotional').

The connection between Persian astronomers, jealous gods, and a Tehran undertaker feels somewhat constructed rather than organically arising.

  * grade_story_340.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_341.txt (grade=4.2)
    The serpent fortress setting offers originality, but the overall plot (isolated academic finds purpose through connection/artifact) leans heavily on familiar tropes.

  * grade_story_342.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the core concept (patterns connecting doodles, nature, and ancient memory) has originality, the execution relies on some familiar tropes (flawed protagonist chosen for a quest).

  * grade_story_349.txt (grade=4.0)
    The core concept relies on the familiar "modern person in fantasy" trope without significant subversion.

While not overtly AI-like, the prose lacks a distinctive voice or truly fresh metaphorical language, leaning towards competent but generic execution.

  * grade_story_350.txt (grade=4.0)
    Relies heavily on the 'ancient secret revealed' trope. The combination of elements (puppeteer, stamps, music, gown, temple) feels more like an assembly of disparate concepts than an organic whole. While the 'spaces between stamps' is a nice touch, the overall execution follows a predictable treasure-hunt pattern. Language sometimes dips into cliché ("cascaded," "bathed in silver light"). Character reasoning is straightforward plot service.

  * grade_story_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    The core concept possesses originality, but the execution relies on some familiar phrasing ('weathered wings', 'last light of dusk'). The writing lacks a truly distinctive, individual style.

  * grade_story_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the premise has original elements (puzzle box confession ritual), the haunted lighthouse keeper trope is familiar.

The ending's sentimentality and explicit thematic summary feel predictable and lack nuance.

  * grade_story_373.txt (grade=5.8)
