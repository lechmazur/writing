1) Executive insight  

Across this set, you almost always establish a dominant stake early and keep it in view; what varies is whether that stake is ever truly *pressurized*. When a story follows the Accumulative or Situational tracks cleanly—using density, pattern-breaks, or one decisive gesture to narrow options and extract a price—the conflict axis reads strong even without antagonists or reversals. But a large proportion of pieces stop at *stated* risk plus smooth execution: the protagonist’s method works on the first try, no resource or relationship is strained, and coincidence or environment quietly cooperate. In those cases, pressure feels atmospheric rather than consequential. Your best work shows agency driving at least one genuine tightening or stance crystallization with a visible or felt cost that reweights the final image under the chosen lens; your weaker pieces present beautiful procedures or epiphanies that never force a trade-off.  

2) Strength profile  

- **Clear early stakes.** Most pieces establish what “this night / ritual / conversation is about” within the opening movement: “Dominant stake…is signaled in paragraph one” recurs across comments.
- **Single, coherent through-line.** You rarely scatter attention across many conflicts; instead, one stake (occasionally a braided pair) is pursued consistently to closure, which fits the 600–800 word scale.
- **Agency as attention and craft.** Even in reflective pieces, protagonists usually *do* something: “his methodical process,” “each smudge deepens understanding,” “he chooses to descend and raise the fragment at the tree.”
- **Accumulative escalation when it lands.** In higher-band stories, you lean into pattern-density rather than twists: repeated acts (naming, carving, singing, tracing) gain pressure until a single cadence shift (“the shudder,” “the first real answer”) reweights everything.
- **On-page cost in your strongest closings.** High notes consistently feature a trade-off: “he trades the moon rock,” “she forecloses the path of seeking restoration to ‘before’,” “his skin becomes permanently altered, a ‘smooth story of grief and acceptance’.”

3) Weakness profile  

- **Stakes that never bite.** Many pieces declare high stakes (“time was running out,” “the town hung in the balance”) but the on-page action is frictionless: “the plan unfolds
