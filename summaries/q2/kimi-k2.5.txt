**Executive Insight**
The decisive factor separating competent work (Band 6–7) from exceptional craft (Band 8–9) in this cohort is the presence of a distinct **perceptual signature** that modulates under pressure. While many submissions successfully establish a stable, elevated lyric register (Track A), the strongest pieces fuse the protagonist’s specific vocation—botany, mechanics, cartography—into the very syntax of their observation, ensuring that the narration sounds like *thought* rather than *writing*. Lower-scoring entries often suffer from "register drift," where the character’s internal voice slips into academic abstraction or essayistic summary during high-stakes moments, flattening the emotional cost. The most effective stories demonstrate that POV is not just a camera angle but a filter; when the character is stressed, the prose rhythm must fracture or compress to reflect that interior reality, rather than maintaining a uniform, decorative polish.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Vocational filtering:** The most memorable voices filter sensory details through professional expertise. A clockmaker notices the "hitch in a gear"; a botanist notices "chlorophyll and rot." This grounds high-concept fantasy in tactile reality.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "silica and flame," "isobars had danced like fever dreams," "cracks that sang like shattered glass"
*   **Rhythmic modulation:** High-band stories alter sentence length to mirror heart rate. Long, sinuous sentences imply reflection or ritual, while staccato fragments denote panic or decisive action.
*   **Synesthetic texture:** Narrators frequently cross-wire senses (hearing light, tasting frequency) effectively to convey magic or heightened states without breaking POV plausibility.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "silence tasted of honey and dust," "sound... like tearing silk"
*   **Clean psychic distance:** The majority of texts maintain a stable Third-Person Limited (or close First) without head-hopping. Transitions between external observation and internal thought are generally smooth.

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Register drift (The "Essayist" Intrusion):** Under peak dramatic pressure, narrators often abandon their specific lexicon for abstract, thematic summaries. Phrases like "conceptual repricing" or "ontological shift" appear in the minds of characters who should be focused on survival, distancing the reader.
*   **Uniform lyricism:** Many stories maintain a relentless "poetic" intensity that fails to breathe. When every sentence is a dense metaphor, the climax lacks contrast. The voice becomes a decorative overlay rather than a vehicle for pacing.
*   **Filter verb clutter:** Frequent use of "she felt," "he realized," or "she understood" dilutes immediacy. This "Helpful Narrator Syndrome" explains the epiphany instead of trusting the image to deliver it.
*   **Mechanical prompt insertion:** Mandatory phrases (e.g., "rhythmically placid," "intuitively descriptive") are often pasted in verbatim, disrupting the rhythmic cadence and breaking the narrative spell.
*   **Generic perceptual signatures:** Lower-scoring stories assign characters generic "poetic" observations (noticing "darkness" or "hope") rather than idiosyncratic details specific to their history or trauma.

**Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when it commits to **"Prose as Character."** When syntax acts as a mirror to the protagonist's mental state—fragmenting when they are confused, looping when they are obsessed—the POV feels embodied and inevitable. The writing breaks when it prioritizes **atmosphere over embodiment.** This manifests when the narrative voice becomes a "Committee Voice"—a generalized, high-fantasy narrator that speaks in lush, interchangeable metaphors regardless of who the focal character is. Success depends on the courage to let the voice degrade, roughen, or simplify when the character is backed into a corner, rather than polishing the moment into abstraction.

**Signature Moves & Blind Spots**
*   **The "Sensory-Scientific" Hybrid:** A pervasive habit of mixing technical terms (frequency, resonance, algorithm, lattice) with mystical imagery. When consistent, it creates a strong "magical realism" texture; when inconsistent, it reads as jargon.
*   **The "Hushed" Opening:** A vast number of stories begin with a variation of "The silence was heavy" or "The air tasted of..." creating a uniform atmospheric starting point that can feel formulaic.
*   **Blind Spot – Dialogue:** Dialogue is frequently sparse or absent. When present, it often sounds like written prose—grammatically perfect and thematically heavy—rather than spoken speech with subtext and friction.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Lexical consistency under stress:** The character continues to use metaphors derived from their specific background even when terrified (e.g., a weaver thinking of "snapped threads" while dying).
*   **Rhythmic degradation:** The prose rhythm breaks down or accelerates in exact proportion to the character's panic or realization, avoiding "template cadence."
*   **Costly Elision:** Information is withheld not to trick the reader, but because the character is repressing it. The closure pays off this silence with a realization that reframes the omission.

**Revision Levers & Keepers**
*   **Keep:** The "vocational lens." Continue ensuring that a gardener sees the world in roots and rot, and a mechanic sees it in fulcrums and levers.
*   **Keep:** The stable psychic distance. Resist the urge to hop heads or zoom out to an omniscient camera for "cinematic" effect.
*   **Keep:** The lyrical compression. The instinct to skip boring transitions and focus on sensory peaks is strong and fits the scope.

*   **Change:** **Cut the "Essayist."** Scan the final third of the story for abstract nouns (redemption, realization, concept) and replace them with sensory details.
*   **Change:** **Kill filter verbs.** Remove "She heard/felt/saw/realized" to place the reader directly behind the character’s eyes.
*   **Change:** **Vary the drumbeat.** If three sentences in a row follow a "Subject-Verb-Metaphor" structure, break the pattern to match the scene's energy.
