**Executive Insight**
The defining characteristic of this cohort is a mastery of **Accumulative and Textural density** that often comes at the expense of **Causal friction**. The vast majority of these stories succeed in establishing a coherent lens, utilizing rich sensory layering to build atmospheric pressure. However, while readers are consistently oriented and led to a thematic conclusion, the mechanism of closure frequently relies on "smoothness"—rituals that work on the first try, keys that fit immediately, or antagonists who capitulate without struggle. Consequently, while most stories achieve a valid **Resonant Reconfiguration** or **Conceptual Repricing**, they often struggle to pass the **Cost Proof Test**. The stories that break into the highest bands distinguish themselves not by the complexity of their plots, but by the undeniable visibility of the price paid for resolution—where the final image proves that an option has been permanently foreclosed or a resource irrevocably spent.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Immediate Orientation:** The cohort excels at anchoring the reader. Anchors for *who*, *where*, and *when* typically arrive within the first 60 words, successfully waiving the Orientation Test penalty and allowing the 600–800 word count to be spent on deepening rather than positioning.
*   **Coherent Lens Maintenance:** Writers effectively select a Drive Lens (usually Accumulative/Textural) and sustain it. Transitions between shards (Track B) or POVs (Track C) are generally legible and taught early, preventing reader confusion.
*   **Thematic Resonance:** Closure units are thematically sound. The endings almost always reweight the opening stakes, delivering a clear "before/after" state in the protagonist’s internal landscape.
*   **Textural Precision:** High-performing stories anchor abstract concepts in tactile objects.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "fire-kissed and rough," "lid for a void," "filament of hush."

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Frictionless Success:** A pervasive anti-pattern is the "magic key" progression. Obstacles are introduced only to be immediately resolved by a convenient tool or intuition. If a protagonist needs to find a hidden room, the draft often allows them to stumble upon it without a "try/fail" cycle, reducing narrative tension to a linear checklist.
*   **Abstract vs. Felt Cost:** Many stories claim a cost ("she felt the weight of years") without dramatizing it. True closure requires a visible trade-off; too often, the ending offers **Symmetric Satisfaction**—the protagonist gets the prize, saves the town, and heals their trauma with no lingering scar or lost resource.
*   **Summary over Scene:** The middle sections frequently dissolve into montage ("Over the next weeks," "He spent days"). This flattens the causal pressure, turning potential turning points into reported exposition.
*   **The "Soft Reset":** Climaxes often rely on a magical release (a wave of light, a sudden hush) that fixes the external problem and the internal conflict simultaneously, bypassing the need for a difficult, characterizing choice.

**Performance Boundaries**
The boundary between a competent passing score and an exceptional one lies in the **Cost Proof Test**. In the mid-range (scores of 6.0–7.5), the story concludes with a realization or a completed task, but the protagonist remains fundamentally intact and the path forward is open. In the high range (8.5+), the story concludes with a **persistent constraint** or an **irreversible exchange**. The exceptional stories force the protagonist to destroy the tool that saved them, accept a permanent physical alteration (e.g., deafness to a specific frequency), or alienate a companion to achieve the goal. When the writer protects the character from the consequences of their own agency, the story hits a ceiling; when the writer forces the character to pay for their resolution on the page, the score elevates.

**Signature Moves and Blind Spots**
*   **The Conceptual Repricing:** A dominant habit is solving physical problems with philosophical shifts. The protagonist realizes "the maze is a state of mind" rather than escaping the maze. While valid under the rubric, this becomes a blind spot when it substitutes for dramatic action.
*   **The "Convenient Epiphany":** Characters frequently receive full downloads of necessary exposition by touching an object or hearing a ghost, bypassing the investigative work required by a Causal lens.
*   **Atmospheric Stasis:** Writers often mistake descriptive density for narrative tightening. Adding more sensory detail to a static situation does not escalate the plot; narrowing the character's available options does.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Tactile Cost:** The cost is embodied in a physical object or state at the end (e.g., a melted violin, a capped inkwell, a silence that is deafening rather than peaceful).
*   **Motivated Ellipsis:** When time jumps occur, they are driven by the character's waiting or labor, not the author's need to skip to the end.
*   **The Pivot Point:** There is a distinct moment where the protagonist could have chosen safety but chose the riskier path, and that choice creates the ending.

**Revision Levers and Keepers**
*   **Keep:** The swift orientation strategies (anchoring by line 3).
*   **Keep:** The sensory density and lyricism that support the Accumulative lens.
*   **Keep:** The structural discipline of the single-scene or tight two-shard window.

*   **Change:** **Objectify the Cost.** Do not just state the character is tired; take away their ability to perform their art or destroy their favorite tool.
*   **Change:** **Inject Friction.** Introduce one failure before the success. If the ritual works on the first try, break the tool and force an improvisation.
*   **Change:** **Dramatize the Turn.** Convert summary paragraphs ("He worked for days until...") into a specific, real-time action that triggers the climax.
