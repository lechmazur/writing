**Executive Insight**  
Across this body of 600–800 word fiction, the central pattern in Plot, Structure, and Causality is a pronounced fluency with single scene (Track A) or mosaic (Track B) Accumulative/Textural plotting. Stories reliably establish orientation (who, where, when) within the first 120 words, enabling early pattern stability for the reader—an anchor that supports later deepening or tightening moves. Structural escalation typically occurs not through sharp, event-driven causality, but through the focused density-building of motif, image, or internal micro-choice. Most stories culminate in a closure that is not a mechanical tying-off, but a true on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) or Conceptual Repricing (CR), with cost reliably visible or felt. Causal and accumulative lenses are held with a high degree of discipline; even in lyric, symbol-driven pieces, plot amnesia and retroactive patching are nearly absent. When multi-shard or multi-POV (Track B/C) structures appear, segment transitions remain legible and closure unclouded, preserving coherence. In sum, this is a cohort that fully grasps closure mechanics and foregoes convenience in favor of earned transformation—a foundation on which high-impact endings are built.

**Strength Profile**  
- **Reliable orientation:** Stories almost universally anchor setting and who/when by line 20–100, e.g. “Orientation anchors (greenhouse, post-flood, scientist) establish clearly within the first paragraph.”
- **Pattern-teaching:** Accumulative or causal methods are taught early and paid off, supporting trust (“The pattern of observation intensifies to a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.”).
- **Closure on the page:** The great majority of stories land Decisive Change or RR/CR, not simply summarizing resolution. Micro-quotes:  
  - “Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: ‘unfiltered reality was jarring, chaotic, and full of pain.’”
  - “Closure is a decisive change—his stance crystallized, options foreclosed, and the cost is legible in the final sentences.”
- **Meaningful cost:** Transformation, loss, or insight is not abstract, but rendered with on-page signal:  
  - “The cost is legible in ‘bone-deep, earned exhaustion’.”
  - “The final image of ‘leaving the sorrow behind as a residue in his own soul’.”
- **Lens adherence:** Accumulative/Textural and Causal lenses, once established, are rarely violated by shortcut or coincidence.
- **Constraint-driven plots:** Persistent internal or external constraints (e.g. pattern, temporal window, physical toll) shape tactics all the way to closure instead of being conveniently lifted.

**Weakness Profile**  
- **Occasional closure without deep cost:** Some stories reach charged closure, yet the cost lands more as philosophical/conceptual than embodied or sharply pressurized—e.g. “the cost is present but more implied than dramatized.”
- **Pressure plateau:** A subset display escalation that is “low-resistance” or “gentle”—patterns build, but midpoint turns are under-motivated, or pattern breaks feel softly telegraphed rather than a true deepening.
- **Convenient/escalation soft spots:** A few endings resolve with a discovered tool or information that appears “slightly convenient”—e.g., a catalyst “strains plausibility,” or a revelation “feels lightly coincidental.”
- **Mid-story abstraction or lens ambiguity:** Occasionally, the “lens [is] ambiguous past the midpoint and not taught by closure;” in a minority, “reflective block slightly exceeds BRR allowance,” risking pattern drift.
- **Rare orientation delays:** “Orientation delay but pays off,” waives penalty only if directly used to charge closure (if not, this costs in both Q2 and caps Q3 ceiling).
- **Minor soft resets or summary:** A smattering of closure units “tell” the consequence or emotional insight rather than embed it in present-moment imagery or dramatized trade-off.

**Performance Boundaries**  
This writing excels when it (a) establishes pattern clarity early, (b) sustains pressure through meaningful escalation or thematic pattern, (c) crystallizes closure on the page with a directly felt, embodied, or conceptual cost that forecloses prior options. Stories break down when escalation plateaus, cost is not sharply rendered, or when crucial plot tools/results appear by convenience rather than persistent constraint or setup. The strongest pieces avoid solution by “soft reset,” summary, or abstraction, instead landing a vivid before/after codified in action, image, or felt stance. Multi-POV or mosaic structures work when transitions remain legible and the pattern is taught (respecting Track B/C exceptions).

**Signature Moves & Blind Spots**  
- **Moves:**  
  - Motif/symbol density as escalation (e.g. thickening hush, layered echoes, recursive objects).
  - Earned, sensory-anchored closure beats (the “shimmering pearl,” “knees cracking,” “a single, coherent image”).
  - Use of concrete, physical toll or micro-choice to materialize cost at closure.
- **Blind Spots:**  
  - Tendency for cost to remain slightly conceptual or emotional versus viscerally dramatised in some endings.
  - Gentle escalation leading to “rightness” without a moment of undeniable, constricting pressure.
  - Occasional late lens ambiguity or reflection-heavy middle.
  - Small number of “pattern payoff” moments that feel inevitable but unforced—edges towards too easy/convenient at the critical beat.

**High-Band Signals (≈8.8+)**  
- The closure’s cost is visible in a concrete, on-page image, line, or micro-act (e.g. “the hand unclasping, the shell buried, the ‘sudden, absolute silence’”).
- The inferred drive lens (accumulative, causal, or deliberately hybrid) is taught, maintained, and never contradicted—even in experiment.
- Final beat language is clean, unencumbered, and compresses the accumulated narrative weight into a single, charged image without redundancy or summary (e.g. “fragile, living stillness,” “stone circle as farewell”).

**Revision Levers & Keepers**  
*Keep:*  
- Early, clear orientation that supports pattern payoff rather than mere exposition.
- Systematic pattern or constraint that persists through to the final image or act.
- Materialization of cost—chosen action, toll, or relinquishment that is visible/felt at closure.

*Change:*  
- Rework closure units where cost is philosophical or “told” rather than dramatized in the final present moment; convert emotional summation into an enacted gesture, surrender, or sacrifice.
- Sharpen escalation at midpoint: ensure that the pattern tightens or deepens rather than coasting to closure—add or stress a point of meaningful reversal, loss, or micro-defeat.
- Tighten or clarify plot turns, ensuring that late-provided information/tools are earned by constraint/pattern or prior setup, not convenience. If orientation or lens ambiguity is present past midpoint and not integral to the pattern/closure, revise for clarity.

---

**In summary:** The work on this axis consistently demonstrates powerful control over closure and structural escalation, mastery of accumulative and causal lenses, and clear costing at closure. Weakest moments arise in underpressurized escalation, conceptual (rather than dramatized) cost, and occasional pattern or orientation ambiguity. The top stories deliver closure with an undeniable, on-page price, compressing the narrative's total meaning- and action-weight into a transformative final image or realization.
