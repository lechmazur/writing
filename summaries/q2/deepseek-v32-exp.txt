**1) Executive Insight**
The decisive factor separating exceptional narratives from competent ones in this corpus is the distinction between **emergent resonance** and **asserted morality**. High-scoring stories (Track A and B) consistently allow the theme to arise as a volatile vapor from the friction of concrete particulars—broken gears, silence, graftings, and echoes. In these pieces, the ending offers a "non-literal answer" to the central dramatic question, reweighting prior material without reducing it to a lesson. Conversely, a significant portion of the cohort falters by treating the theme as a thesis statement to be proven. These stories frequently collapse into "Thematic Echo," where the narrative explicitly articulates the prompt’s core concept (e.g., "she realized that silence was not emptiness, but potential") in the final paragraph. When closure relies on summary explanation rather than a charged, ambiguous image, the emotional aftereffect evaporates.

**2) Strength Profile**
*   **Conceptual Repricing:** The strongest pieces successfully take a recurring motif (e.g., a broken watch, a silence, a scar) and shift its meaning by the end. The object remains the same, but its value flips from burden to asset or vice versa without authorial commentary.
*   **Subtext via Gesture:** High-scoring stories displace emotional declarations onto physical acts. Instead of stating "he forgave her," a character might re-tie a ribbon or leave a door unlocked.
    *   *Micro-quote:* "fingers trembling on old brushstrokes"
    *   *Micro-quote:* "holding the fierce tenderness like a shield"
*   **Non-Literal Answers:** The best endings answer the story’s central problem not with a solution, but with a state of being or a visual tableau that implies a new equilibrium.
*   **Tactile Metaphor:** Themes are grounded in specific vocations—clockmaking, weaving, gardening—where the physical laws of the trade mirror the metaphysical stakes.

**3) Weakness Profile**
*   **Thematic Echo (The -0.6 Trap):** A pervasive failure mode where the protagonist or narrator explicitly recites the story’s moral in the final third. Phrases like "He finally understood that..." or "She realized the true meaning of..." instantly flatten resonance.
*   **Sermonizing Endings:** Many stories conclude with a "tidy moral" paragraph that summarizes the journey (e.g., "And so, they learned that hope remains eternal..."). This removes the burden of interpretation from the reader.
*   **Prompt Labeling:** Inserting abstract prompt phrases (e.g., "open secrets," "fractured grace") directly into dialogue or narration as diagnostic labels rather than evoking the feeling they describe.
*   **Decorative Symbolism:** Introducing a symbol (a glowing orb, a sudden bird) solely to resolve the plot or theme in the final beat, rather than weaving it through the narrative as a constraint.
*   **Binary Resolution:** Reducing complex themes to simplistic toggles (e.g., Technology = Bad, Nature = Good) without acknowledging cost or nuance.

**4) Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when it operates in the **mode of inquiry**, where the narrative tests a hypothesis through stress and cost, leaving the conclusion slightly open or "bruised" by the effort. It breaks when it shifts into the **mode of instruction**. If the story feels like a fable designed to deliver a specific aphorism, the score collapses. The boundary is often the penultimate paragraph: if the story trusts the final image to land the weight, it succeeds; if it feels the need to explain *why* that image matters, it fails. Stories that permit characters to be wrong, or to find peace without total resolution, consistently outperform those that force a "healing" arc.

**5) Signature Moves and Blind Spots**
*   **The "Abstract Epiphany":** A habit of pairing a concrete observation with an abstract philosophical truth immediately after, as if the author doesn't trust the reader to catch the subtext.
*   **The "Luminous" Crutch:** A reliance on words like "luminous," "radiant," and "shimmering" to signal thematic importance rather than earning it through dramatic pressure.
*   **Silent Communion:** A recurring tendency to have characters "understand without speaking." While this attempts subtext, it often shortcuts genuine dramatic friction or necessary confrontation.
*   **The Curator Protagonist:** Many protagonists are archivists, repairers, or gardeners. While this allows for rich metaphor, it can lead to passive narratives where the hero observes theme rather than enacting it through risky choices.

**6) High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Costly Integration:** The ending integrates the theme in a way that acknowledges loss. The problem is recontextualized, not fixed. (e.g., The scar remains, but is no longer hidden).
*   **Image-Driven Closure:** The final sentence is a visual or sensory detail that re-keys the entire story (e.g., "rain falling upwards," "a clock ticking in a silent room") rather than a thought or feeling.
*   **Resonant Re-weighting:** A motif introduced in the first third returns in the final beat with an inverted or deepened emotional charge, proving the character's internal change without stating it.

**7) Revision Levers and Keepers**
*   **Keep:**
    1.  **Specific Vocations:** The grounding of themes in technical processes (kintsugi, clockwork, botany).
    2.  **Recursive Motifs:** Objects that appear 3+ times, changing significance with each appearance.
    3.  **Ambiguous Endings:** Resolutions that solve the immediate plot but leave the thematic question vibrating.

*   **Change:**
    1.  **Excision of Thesis Statements:** Delete any sentence starting with "She realized," "He understood," or "It was a lesson in..." from the final 150 words.
    2.  **Grounding of Abstractions:** Replace abstract nouns (hope, resilience, eternity) with the physical objects representing them (the seed, the scar, the stone).
    3.  **Complication of Binaries:** If a character is "healing," ensure they lose something in the process. If a character is "rebelling," show the collateral damage. Ensure the theme has a cost.
