# Editorial Brief: Question 2 (Plot, Structure & Causality)

### Executive Insight
The corpus overwhelmingly favors the **Accumulative/Textural lens** over strict Causal progression. Writers consistently eschew linear "plot twists" in favor of building sensory and symbolic density until a critical mass triggers a shift in stance. This approach aligns well with the 600–800 word scope (Track A), producing tight, single-scene vignettes that rarely suffer from spatial confusion. However, the critical differentiator between competent mid-band work (6.0–7.5) and elite narrative (9.0+) is the **Cost Proof Test**. Too many stories rely on "soft" closure—an epiphany realized without sacrifice—or resolutions delivered by environmental convenience (e.g., the magic activates because it’s time). The highest-scoring pieces ensure that the **Resonant Reconfiguration** or **Conceptual Repricing** at the end is purchased with a visible, irreversible price on the page, transforming a poetic observation into a dramatic event.

### Strength Profile
*   **Rapid Orientation:** Writers are exceptionally disciplined at anchoring *who, where, and when* within the first 120 words. Disorientation penalties are rare; readers almost always know the protagonist’s role and immediate physical context by paragraph two.
*   **Mastery of "Conceptual Repricing":** The most successful closure type reframes a central object or premise. Writers excel at taking a static symbol (a broken clock, a glass eye, a silence) and altering its meaning by the final beat without changing its physical properties.
*   **Coherent Accumulative Drives:** The stories rarely break their own logic. Once a pattern of sensory accumulation is established (e.g., layering silence, frost, or static), writers stick to it, avoiding jarring genre shifts or discordant causal leaps.
*   **Micro-Quotes of Note:**
    *   *"Trade the arithmetic of her wounds for something stranger."*
    *   *"The shell doesn’t hold the secret. We do."*
    *   *"Not an ending but a preparation."*
    *   *"Weight of a withheld truth finally set down."*

### Weakness Profile
*   **The "Gift" Ending:** A pervasive failure where the solution arrives via external agency or coincidence (e.g., a ghost appears to explain the plot, a magical object activates spontaneously, or a secondary character solves the puzzle). This robs the protagonist of agency and violates the requirement for *earned* closure.
*   **Invisibility of Cost:** Many stories land on a mood of "peace" or "acceptance" without demonstrating what was lost to achieve it. If the protagonist gains wisdom without forfeiting safety, certainty, or a tangible option, the closure fails the Cost Proof Test.
*   **Summary at the Crux:** Writers frequently resort to synopsis exactly when the tension should peak (e.g., *"Over the next few weeks, she worked..."* or *"He understood finally..."*). This flattens the narrative arc, converting a dramatic scene into an essay on feelings.
*   **Static Vignettes:** Some pieces establish a beautiful setting and a compelling character but fail to introduce a *tightening* agent. The character observes the world but does not encounter a pressure that forces a reconfiguration of their stance.

### Performance Boundaries
The narrative succeeds when the **internal drive aligns with external constraint**. The writing excels when a persistent limitation—a ticking clock, a physical disability, a resource scarcity—forces the protagonist to improvise a solution that is imperfect but necessary. This generates the "Charged Poise" required for high marks. The narrative breaks when it relies on **Dream Logic** to resolve plot holes. If a character overcomes an obstacle simply because they "let go" or "believed hard enough" without a corresponding shift in external reality or tactical approach, the causality collapses, and the score caps at the 6.0–7.0 range regardless of prose quality.

### Signature Moves & Blind Spots
*   **The "Charged Poise" Exit:** A dominant habit is ending the story on the threshold of action (e.g., a character about to write a letter, open a door, or step into the dark). This is effective only if the prior text has made the *cost* of that step undeniable.
*   **Object-Anchored Epiphany:** Writers frequently use a small, tactile object (a shard of glass, a seed, a gear) to carry the narrative weight. This works well to anchor abstract themes.
*   **Blind Spot: The "Soft Reset":** A tendency to resolve tension by returning to the status quo with a "new perspective." If the world hasn't changed and the character's options haven't narrowed, this reads as a failure of consequence.
*   **Blind Spot: Asserted Transformation:** Telling the reader "she was fundamentally changed" rather than showing the character making a choice she couldn't have made at the start.

### High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)
*   **Irreversible Stance Shift:** The ending forecloses a specific path. The character cannot go back to who they were because they have burned a bridge, revealed a secret, or broken a tool.
*   **Persistent Constraint Payoff:** An obstacle introduced early (e.g., blindness, a time limit, a shortage of fuel) directly shapes the form of the resolution. The solution is not perfect; it is shaped by what was lacking.
*   **Legible Cost Sentence:** There is a specific sentence in the final paragraph where the price of the resolution is physically or emotionally registered (e.g., *“Her knees ached, and the silence was absolute, but the map was drawn.”*).

### Revision Levers and Keepers
**Keep:**
*   **The Single-Scene Focus:** Maintain the discipline of one continuous time-window (Track A). It prevents bloat and keeps causality tight.
*   **Early Anchoring:** Continue grounding the reader in the first paragraph. It buys goodwill for later experimental or lyrical moves.
*   **Tactile Motifs:** Keep using physical objects to track internal changes. It gives the Accumulative lens a spine.

**Change:**
*   **Tax the Magic:** If a supernatural element solves a problem, it must exact a price (pain, memory loss, breakage). Remove any "free" magic.
*   **Dramatize the Realization:** Convert internal monologues of realization into active beats. Instead of *"She realized she had to leave,"* have her *pack the bag while weeping.*
*   **Sharpen the Option Space:** Ensure the protagonist faces a binary choice or a dilemma before the end. Force them to reject one "good" outcome to achieve a "necessary" one.
