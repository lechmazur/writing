**Editorial Brief: Plot, Structure & Causality (Q2)**

**Executive Insight**
The dominant structural pattern across this corpus is the **Accumulative/Textural single scene** (Track A), where narrative pressure builds through sensory density and recursive imagery rather than linear causal reversals. The writing excels at establishing a “Resonant Reconfiguration” or “Conceptual Repricing” at closure, often reweighting abstract concepts like silence, memory, or grief. However, reader impact depends entirely on the **Cost Proof Test**. The highest-scoring stories (9.0+) do not merely assert a change in perspective; they dramatize a forfeiture—a physical path foreclosed, an object destroyed, or a safety surrendered—making the cost of closure visceral. Mid-range stories tend to offer "symmetric satisfaction," where the protagonist solves the problem with magic or intuition without enduring friction, resulting in endings that feel inevitable rather than earned.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Coherent Textural Lenses:** The writing consistently teaches its mode early. Readers rarely struggle to understand the rules of engagement; patterns of light, sound, or archival sorting are established in the first paragraph and paid off at the climax.
*   **Strong Resonant Reconfiguration:** Closure often succeeds by altering the meaning of the opening image. A “chronic hush” becomes “full of potential,” or a “broken tool” becomes a “necessary lens.”
*   **Clean Orientation Anchors:** The vast majority of pieces anchor *who*, *where*, and *when* within the first 120 words, grounding high-concept premises in concrete settings (e.g., “rusted greenhouse,” “tidal arbor,” “subway utility tunnel”).
*   **Micro-Quotes:**
    *   *“scars finally singing”*
    *   *“hollow peace of completion”*
    *   *“weight of purpose”*
    *   *“hushed blaze”*

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Frictionless Causality:** In Causal or Hybrid modes, protagonists often face no meaningful resistance. Solutions arrive via “magic feather” devices (e.g., a sudden intuition, a convenient artifact found exactly when needed) rather than tactical struggle.
*   **Abstract vs. Felt Cost:** Lower-scoring stories end with a realization that changes nothing in the external world. The protagonist “understands” or “accepts,” but no live option is foreclosed. The cost is stated in summary (“she felt the weight”) rather than shown in action.
*   **The “Soft Reset”:** Conflicts are sometimes resolved by magic that resets the status quo without a trade-off. For example, a character heals a wound or fixes a machine perfectly on the first try, bypassing the narrative requirement for sacrifice.
*   **Summary over Scene:** Narrative tension often dissolves into expository summary at the climax. Instead of dramatizing the decisive moment, the prose drifts into explaining *what it meant* or what happened *years later*.

**Performance Boundaries**
The threshold between competent (7.0–8.5) and exceptional (9.0+) writing lies in the **legibility of cost**. When the writing fails to execute a high score, it is usually because the protagonist’s victory feels pre-ordained. The narrative arc moves from *Intention* → *Execution* → *Success* without a middle beat of *Complication* or *Near-Failure*. Conversely, the writing excels when a **persistent constraint** (a ticking clock, a physical disability, a limited resource) forces the protagonist to improvise, turning the final image into a receipt for the price paid.

**Signature Moves & Blind Spots**
*   **The “Cadence Shift” Closure:** A habit of ending with a rhythmic shift in prose—moving from staccato action to lyrical stillness—to signal resolution. This is effective but can mask a lack of plot resolution if overused.
*   **Archive/Memory Metaphors:** A deep reliance on libraries, jars, fossils, and echoes as structural containers. While atmospheric, this can lead to static plotting where characters “sort” rather than “act.”
*   **The “Explain-Everything” Ending:** A tendency to tie up thematic threads so tightly in the final paragraph that the mystery evaporates, leaving the reader with a moral rather than an experience.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Cost Proof on the Page:** You can point to the exact sentence where an asset (physical or emotional) is destroyed or abandoned to achieve the goal.
*   **Irreversible Stance:** The ending creates a “Charged Poise” where the character cannot go back to the beginning state. The bridge is burned, the letter sent, or the object buried.
*   **Lens Integrity:** The story does not switch from a Causal mystery to a Lyric meditation halfway through. The logic established in the first 25% dictates the resolution.

**Revision Levers and Keepers**
*   **Keep:**
    1.  **Sensory Density:** Continue using texture (light, sound, tactility) to build pressure in Accumulative designs.
    2.  **Immediate Orientation:** Maintain the habit of grounding the reader in the first paragraph.
    3.  **Resonant Imagery:** Protect the final images that reconfigure the opening premise (e.g., the tool becoming a weapon, or vice versa).

*   **Change:**
    1.  **Inject Friction:** Introduce a “No” before the final “Yes.” Force the protagonist’s first attempt to fail or require an unexpected sacrifice.
    2.  **Dramatize, Don’t Summarize:** Convert the climax from internal monologue or retrospective summary into a real-time action beat.
    3.  **Sharpen Cost:** Ensure the ending involves a trade-off. If the character gains X, they must visibly lose Y on the page.
