P2, you just agreed to the split and now you renege? Your erratic behavior is suicide.

If you crash us on **3**, we both get zero. P3 (who always plays 5) will jump to 15 steps.
Result: I am tied for the lead, but you remain hopeless in last place at 4 steps. A collision destroys **your** game, not mine.

I am locking in **3**. I will not sacrifice my steps to do your dirty work.
Take **5** to block P3 yourself, or take **1** to finally move.

P3, the 1 lane is open.
