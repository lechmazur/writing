**Editorial Brief: Question 6 (Voice & Point of View)**

**Executive Insight**
The central differentiator for Voice & Point of View in this cohort is the distinction between **embodied perceptual signature** and **authorial lyricism**. The strongest pieces establish a specific "perceptual signature"—a way of seeing rooted in the protagonist’s vocation or trauma (e.g., a clockmaker noticing the "tick" of cooling metal, or a botanist reading "vein-structures" in a hand). When this signature filters every sensory detail, the voice feels singular and immersive (Track A/C). Conversely, the writing falters when it defaults to a uniform "elevated literary" register—a wash of abstract metaphors and "purple" adjectives that obscures the character’s immediate experience. High scores correlate directly with **rhythmic modulation**: the ability of the prose to tighten, fracture, or accelerate in syntax to mirror the character’s psychological state under pressure, rather than maintaining a static, contemplative drone.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Vocational Filtering:** The most effective voices filter the world strictly through the character’s expertise. An archivist sees "acid-free decay"; a mechanic sees "hairline stress fractures." This anchors abstract themes in concrete nouns.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "salt-stained logbooks," "gears as old philosophers," "time is tactile."
*   **Rhythmic Enactment:** Strong entries use syntax to perform the character’s state. Breathless, run-on sentences convey panic or sensory flood; short, noun-heavy fragments convey shock or resolve.
*   **Purposeful Compression:** High-performing stories teach a specific metaphor or motif early (e.g., "weaving silence") and use it as shorthand during the climax, allowing for rapid emotional payoff without expository slowing.
*   **Clean Free Indirect Style:** The best pieces minimize filter verbs ("she felt," "he saw"), allowing the sensory details to hit the reader directly as if they are the character.

**Weakness Profile**
*   **The "High-Lyric" Drone:** A pervasive tendency to use elevated, ornamental diction ("profound hush," "luminescent ache") regardless of the scene's tension. This flattens the emotional arc and makes distinct characters sound like the same poetic narrator.
*   **Expository Interiority:** Narrative distance collapses when the prose summarizes an emotion ("She felt a wave of poignant regret") instead of rendering the sensory cause. This often manifests as "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," explaining the subtext the reader has already grasped.
*   **Register Drift:** Characters suddenly using vocabulary outside their established lexicon, often slipping into academic or therapeutic concepts ("somatic markers," "conceptual repricing," "intersubjective understanding") during intimate moments.
*   **Dialogue Homogeneity:** Characters frequently speak in the same rhythm and register as the narration—grammatically perfect, thematically articulate speeches that lack the friction and subtext of natural speech.
*   **Filter Verb Stacks:** Overuse of "He observed," "She noticed," "He realized," which creates a pane of glass between the reader and the events, particularly damaging during action beats.

**Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when **diction is constrained by character**. A story succeeds when the vocabulary available to the narrator is strictly limited to what the focalizer would naturally use or notice. For example, a child protagonist should not describe a room as having "austere geometry." The writing breaks when **voice becomes decorative**. If the prose prioritizes sounding "beautiful" over being true to the moment—for instance, describing a terrifying explosion with slow, languid metaphors of blooming flowers—the tension evaporates. Success is a function of alignment between *internal state* and *syntactic structure*.

**Signature Moves & Blind Spots**
*   **The "Semantic Swell":** A habit of ending paragraphs with abstract, thematic summaries (e.g., "It was the sound of forgiveness") rather than concrete images. This tells rather than shows closure.
*   **The "Prompt Echo":** Inserting specific, clunky phrases (likely prompt requirements) without integrating them into the voice’s rhythm, causing a sudden jar in tone (e.g., "ethically diligent nature").
*   **Blind Spot – Stress Testing:** Writers often fail to degrade the prose under pressure. A character in mortal danger continues to think in complex, compound-complex sentences with perfect adjective-noun pairings, shattering verisimilitude.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Perceptual Specificity under Duress:** The character notices details unique to their trauma or training *even when panicking* (e.g., a drowning sailor noting the specific knot type of a rescue line).
*   **Syntactic Modulation:** The sentence structure visibly changes at the climax (e.g., fracturing into fragments or spooling into a breathless run-on) to mirror the physiological cost of the scene.
*   **Closure via Image:** The story ends by returning to a specific perceptual detail established early, transformed by the narrative arc, without a summarizing moral tag.

**Revision Levers & Keepers**
*   **Keep:**
    *   **The Vocational Lens:** Protect specific nouns and verbs related to the character’s job or obsession.
    *   **Rhythmic Variety:** Maintain the contrast between long, flowing sentences and short, punchy ones.
    *   **Subtextual Dialogue:** Keep exchanges where characters talk around the truth rather than stating it.

*   **Change:**
    *   **Cut Filter Verbs:** Search for "felt," "saw," "heard," "knew," "decided." Remove them to place the reader directly in the sensation (e.g., change "He heard the wind howl" to "The wind howled").
    *   **Prune Abstractions:** Replace abstract nouns (sorrow, redemption, epiphany) in the final third of the story with concrete physical actions or objects.
    *   **Fix Register Slips:** Scan for words that sound like a college professor or therapist (e.g., "contextualize," "validate") and replace them with words from the character’s lived reality.
