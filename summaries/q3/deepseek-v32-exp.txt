**1) Executive Insight**
In the 600–800 word range, the dividing line between competent description and high-band mastery lies in whether the setting acts as a **crucible** or merely a **backdrop**. Top-tier stories (9.0+) treat the environment not as a stage for the action, but as an active antagonist or necessary tool that **constrains tactical choices**. When a character must alter their physical movement because of a "low-gravity summit," or modify a ritual because of "broken piano strings," the setting earns its keep. Lower-band stories often feature lush, visually evocative "postcard" descriptions—glowing nebulas, ancient libraries, misty gardens—that set a mood but allow the protagonist to move and act without friction. For Q3, specificity is not just about adjective count; it is about causal integration. If the story could take place in a generic room without altering the plot’s mechanics, the score caps at the 7-band. The highest scores are reserved for narratives where the environment—or a **micro-setting** object—is indispensable to the solution and actively **charges the final image** with reweighted meaning.

**2) Strength Profile**
*   **Micro-Setting as Anchor:** The most effective pieces often shrink the scope to a single, tactile focal point—a "beaded valve wheel," a "cracked font," or a "glass inkwell"—which functions as the setting. This allows for deep specificity without word-count bloat.
*   **POV-Filtered Sensory Hierarchy:** Strong stories filter details through the protagonist’s immediate needs or profession. A glazier notices "refractive angles"; a deep-sea diver feels "crushing pressure" before seeing light.
*   **Environmental Constraint:** High scorers use the setting to force trade-offs. The character cannot run because of "knee-deep silt"; they must whisper because the "acoustic gallery" amplifies sound.
*   **Causal Evolution:** The setting changes in response to the plot. A "frozen lake" thaws to reveal secrets; a "dusty workshop" is illuminated by the protagonist's work.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "roots snaked between femurs," "air tasted of ozone and rot," "scent of iron gall ink."

**3) Weakness Profile**
*   **Postcard Description:** Vivid visual descriptions (sunsets, shimmering magic, glowing runes) that fail to interact with the character. The protagonist observes the scenery rather than inhabiting it.
*   **The "Hush" Abstraction:** A pervasive reliance on abstract nouns like "hush," "gloom," "silence," and "void" to do the heavy lifting for atmosphere, rather than concrete sensory details (e.g., the *sound* of a dripping tap vs. "the silence was heavy").
*   **Lack of Spatial Choreography:** "White-room syndrome" where bodies and objects float in undefined space. Readers cannot track where the character is standing relative to the door or the table.
*   **Static Backdrops:** The setting is established in the first paragraph and then ignored. It does not exert pressure during the climax or participate in the resolution.
*   **Generic Fantasy Tropes:** Reliance on "ancient stones," "ethereal light," and "humming crystals" without specific, lived-in textures that distinguish this specific magic system.

**4) Performance Boundaries**
The boundary between the 7-band and the 9-band is **tactical constraint**. A 7.5 story describes a "spooky, fog-filled cemetery" that establishes a sad mood. A 9.0 story places the protagonist in a cemetery where the *fog obscures the specific grave marker they need*, forcing them to kneel and feel the cold stone inscriptions with their bare hands to find the right one. In the 7.5 story, the setting creates emotion; in the 9.0 story, the setting dictates action. Similarly, a story excels when the final image re-uses a setting element introduced early on (e.g., a "dried pen" or "broken clock") but imbues it with the weight of the story's resolution ("charging the final image"). If the setting vanishes at the end, the score drops.

**5) Signature Moves and Blind Spots**
*   **The "Atmospheric" Trap:** Writers often mistake accumulation of adjectives (shimmering, pulsing, velvet, abyssal) for specificity. True specificity is often a noun or a verb (e.g., "the floorboards *groaned*," "the *grit* under her nail").
*   **The Floating Prop:** Objects are often described vividly when introduced but then disappear from the physical reality of the scene (e.g., a character holding a heavy lantern suddenly uses two hands for a task without setting it down).
*   **Visual Bias:** Over-reliance on sight. High-band stories often leverage temperature, smell, and proprioception (balance, weight) to ground the reader, especially in "crisis" moments where vision narrows.

**6) High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Irreplaceability:** The plot solution relies on a specific feature of the setting (e.g., using a specific echo in a canyon, or a reflection in a shard of glass).
*   **Tactile Closure:** The final beat involves the protagonist physically interacting with the setting (closing a door, dropping a stone, feeling the rain), grounding the theme in matter.
*   **Occupational Texture:** The setting details reflect the specific labor or expertise of the POV character (e.g., a clockmaker noticing the "hitch" in a pendulum rather than just "ticking").

**7) Revision Levers and Keepers**
*   **Keep:** Any detail that is physically handled or used by the protagonist.
*   **Keep:** Sensory details that are *not* visual (smells, textures, sounds).
*   **Keep:** The "Micro-setting" focus (the workbench, the cockpit, the single tree) over broad geography.
*   **Change:** Convert "atmospheric" adjectives into "tactical" nouns. (Instead of "the room was chaotic," use "piles of books blocked the exit.")
*   **Change:** Ensure the setting *resists* the protagonist at least once (a stuck drawer, a slippery floor, a blinding light).
*   **Change:** Anchor the final image in the physical environment. Make the closing sentiment land on a specific object or sensory detail established earlier.
