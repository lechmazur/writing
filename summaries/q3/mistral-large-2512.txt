**Executive Insight**
The decisive factor separating competent drafts (Band 7–8) from exceptional ones (Band 9+) on this axis is **environmental agency**. In the strongest pieces, the setting is not merely a backdrop or atmospheric wrapper; it is an active antagonist or indispensable tool that **constrains tactical choice**. The texts that fail to break the 8.8 ceiling often provide vivid, "postcard" descriptions—bioluminescent caves, stormed-swept observatories, rusted libraries—that set a mood but allow the protagonist to move through them unimpeded. The highest-scoring stories leverage the **Micro-setting option**: they treat a specific workstation, a diving suit, a single cracked window, or a recurring object as the true terrain. In these high-band pieces, the environment dictates the pacing (e.g., waiting for a drip, fighting a current) and physically reconfigures to charge the final image. When the setting is causal, the story lands; when it is merely decorative, the tension floats.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Tactile Micro-Settings:** The most successful stories shrink the world to a manageable, tactile scale. Instead of describing a whole city, they focus on "the cold bite of the caliper" or the "silt like ash" in a submerged room. This adherence to the *Economy bias* allows for high specificity without exposition dumps.
*   **POV-Filtered Sensory Hierarchy:** Strong drafts filter details through the protagonist’s professional or emotional bias. A musician notices acoustics ("swallowed sound"); a mechanic notices "heat from the breakers." This creates a lived-in texture rather than a tourist catalog.
*   **The Object-as-Setting:** In many 9+ stories, a small object functions as the setting. A "beaded valve wheel," a "cracked lens," or a "warp in the floorboards" anchors the choreography and constrains the character's physical options.
*   **Atmospheric Consistency:** The writing excels at sustaining mood. Whether it is "ozone and old paper" or "damp earth and rot," the sensory palette remains coherent from the opening hook to the final beat.

**Weakness Profile**
*   **The "Postcard" Trap:** Many stories render a beautiful location—a floating island, a neon market—that exerts zero pressure. The character looks *at* the setting rather than struggling *against* it. The environment does not force a trade-off or alter a tactic.
*   **Generic Sensory Shorthand:** Over-reliance on stock phrases like "ozone and rust," "petrichor," "bruised sky," or "silence was heavy." These signal a genre (usually sci-fi or fantasy) without providing the specific "on-page signals" required for high marks.
*   **Spatial Drift (White Room Syndrome):** In the middle third of stories, characters often detach from their environment to have a dialogue or internal monologue. They float in a void until the writer remembers to mention the rain or the floor again at the end.
*   **Failure of the 9+ Gate:** The rubric explicitly demands that the environment "constrain a choice or charge the final image." Many drafts fail this by having the setting disappear at the climax, resolving the conflict in an abstract mental space rather than grounding it in the physical world established in the opening.

**Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when it embraces **claustrophobia and resistance**. Stories set in confined spaces (a diving bell, a crumbling ledge, a glass-walled garden) where the physics of the space dictate the action invariably score higher. The writing breaks down when it attempts **epic scope** within 800 words. Vague "cities of spires" or "shimmering nebulas" often result in orientation penalties because the reader cannot visualize the immediate physical constraints on the character. When the setting is vast, the stakes become abstract; when the setting is narrow and resistant, the stakes become visceral.

**Signature Moves and Blind Spots**
*   **The "Luminous" Crutch:** A signature habit is relying on light-based descriptions (bioluminescence, glowing runes, holographic flickers) to the exclusion of tactile, olfactory, or thermal details.
*   **The "Ruined Archive":** A recurring setting archetype is the abandoned library/observatory/greenhouse. While often atmospheric, these spaces frequently lack distinct hazards, becoming interchangeable "sad, quiet places."
*   **The "Final Glance":** A positive signature move is the tendency to return to the setting in the final sentence (e.g., the light hitting the dust, the water settling), which effectively attempts to satisfy the "charged final image" requirement.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Causal Evolution:** The setting changes because of the plot (e.g., the ice melts, the glass cracks, the tide comes in). The environment at the end is physically different from the start.
*   **Tactile Constraint:** The character fails an action because of the setting (slipping on moss, unable to hear over the wind, running out of oxygen).
*   **The "Third Actor":** The setting functions as a character that pushes back. It is not passive; it acts upon the protagonist (e.g., "the cold bit through his gloves," "the root snagged her ankle").

**Revision Levers and Keepers**
*   **Keep:**
    *   The instinct to filter sensory details through the protagonist's expertise (occupational lens).
    *   The use of recurring micro-objects (keys, petals, shards) to anchor abstract scenes.
    *   The "bookending" technique where the setting frames the opening and closing beats.

*   **Change:**
    *   **Convert Atmosphere to Obstacle:** Take one descriptive element (e.g., "thick fog") and make it force a tactical change (e.g., "she had to crawl to find the edge").
    *   **Purge Generic Markers:** Find every instance of "ozone," "petrichor," or "ancient energy" and replace it with a specific, non-cliché sensory detail (e.g., "smelled like wet wool," "vibrated like a struck bell").
    *   **Anchor the Middle:** Force the character to interact physically with the setting during the central dialogue or reflection to cure spatial drift.
