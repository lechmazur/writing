**Executive Insight**
The cohort demonstrates a high baseline of technical competence in maintaining POV stability (Track A/C), with very little unauthorized head-hopping. The central differentiator between competent work (7-band) and exceptional work (9-band) is the depth of the **perceptual signature**. Mid-range stories tend to filter the world through a generic "literary fantasy" voice—relying on stock atmospheric markers like "hush," "shimmer," and "breath"—regardless of the focalizer’s background. High-performing stories allow the character’s specific vocation (e.g., a watchmaker noting gears, an archivist smelling ozone and rot) to colonize the diction and syntax completely. Reader impact falters when the narrative voice remains intellectually detached or essayistic during high-pressure beats; it succeeds when the prose rhythm fractures, compresses, or accelerates to mirror the character’s physiological state.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Vocation-Specific Filtering:** The strongest pieces rigorously filter sensory input through the protagonist's trade or obsession. An alchemist notices "transmute," a musician hears "dissonant undertones," and a gardener sees "withered vines."
*   **Stable Psychic Distance:** Most stories successfully anchor the reader in a close-third or first-person perspective without leaking into omniscience. The camera stays behind the eyes.
*   **Rhythmic Modulation:** Effective stories vary sentence length to match the emotional arc—languid, complex sentences for reflection; short, percussive fragments for action or realization.
*   **Micro-quotes:**
    *   "flashlight cutting through the dust like a knife through stale bread"
    *   "ink bleeding into the paper like water through cracked earth"
    *   "brass gears frozen mid-tick"
    *   "wind tugging like an impatient creditor"

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Register Drift (The "Essayist" Intrusion):** A recurring failure involves the narration slipping into academic or corporate diction that clashes with the character’s lived reality. Phrases like "conceptual repricing," "nurturing intersubjective understanding," or "operatively gentle" break the immersive spell, reading as authorial notes left in the text rather than organic thought.
*   **Filter Verb Clustering:** In high-pressure moments, immediacy is often dulled by stacks of sensory filters ("he saw," "she felt," "he realized," "she watched as"). This pushes the reader back into an observational stance just when they should be embodied.
*   **Generic Lyricism:** Many stories default to a "warm bath" of atmospheric writing—uniform prettiness involving silence, dust motes, and light—that fails to sharpen when the stakes rise.
*   **Expository Interiority:** The narrator often explains an emotion immediately after dramatizing it (e.g., explaining *why* a character is sad after showing them crying), signalling a lack of trust in the reader.

**Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when it commits to **prose as character**. When the syntax mimics the mind at work—looping for an obsessive, fractured for the traumatized, precise for the engineer—the story lands with visceral impact. The writing breaks when it prioritizes "sounding literary" over clarity and character specificity. This manifests as "purple" descriptions of eyes or weather that stop the action dead, or dialogue that functions as a thematic thesis statement rather than natural, goal-driven speech. When a character in a life-or-death crisis pauses to articulate a philosophical maxim in perfect grammar, the tension evaporates.

**Signature Moves and Blind Spots**
*   **The "Hushed" Opening:** A vast majority of stories begin with a contemplative, atmospheric beat focusing on dust, light, or silence. While often well-written, this habit delays the "drive" required by the rubric.
*   **Simile Overload:** A reliance on "as if" or "like" constructions to convey internal states. While often evocative, they can create a repetitive cadence that distances the reader from direct experience.
*   **Thematic Ventriloquism:** Characters—especially secondary "guide" figures—often speak in riddles or thematic summaries ("You are not a guardian," "History is rewriting itself") rather than possessing a distinct, natural idiom.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Rhythmic Compression:** Under peak stress, the prose sheds articles, connectives, and filter verbs, mimicking the narrowing of focus (e.g., "The latch clicked. The door swung open.").
*   **No "Helpful" Narrator:** The story refuses to explain the significance of a symbol or action, trusting the accumulated context to deliver the payload. Elision is taught and paid off.
*   **Idiomatic Consistency:** The diction remains locked to the character's worldview even in abstract moments (e.g., a mapmaker thinking in coordinates/edges, not "feelings").

**Revision Levers and Keepers**
*   **Keep:** The discipline regarding POV stability. The absence of head-hopping is a major asset that anchors the reader.
*   **Keep:** The instinct for sensory detail. The grounding in tactile and auditory cues (rust, hums, temperatures) provides necessary friction.
*   **Keep:** Purposeful compression. When the writing trusts the reader to leap across a gap (time or logic), the engagement is higher.

*   **Change:** **Purge academic abstractions.** Search for words like "conceptual," "intersubjective," "embodied," or "resonantly" and replace them with concrete imagery derived from the character's specific world.
*   **Change:** **Cut filter verbs in climax beats.** In the final third of the story, remove "he saw/heard/felt" to force direct sensory contact (e.g., change "He heard the glass shatter" to "The glass shattered").
*   **Change:** **Sharpen dialogue subtext.** Ensure characters are not stating their feelings or the theme directly. If a character says "I am sad," change it to a line where they criticize the tea for being cold.
