**Executive Insight**

The central challenge in this cohort was distinguishing between a **narrated** experience and an **embodied** one. While most submissions achieved baseline stability—avoiding egregious head-hopping and maintaining a consistent third-person limited focus—the defining struggle lay in **register drift** under pressure. In the strongest pieces (Tracks A and B), the prose didn’t just describe the protagonist; it *became* them. A clockmaker’s panic was rendered in staccato, mechanical syntax; a botanist’s grief was filtered through root-rot and drought. Conversely, mid-range submissions often established a compelling voice in the opening only to abandon it at the climax, defaulting to an abstract, "essayistic" register (e.g., "she realized the profound weight of connection") that flattened the emotional peak. For reader impact, the Voice & POV score hinged on whether the narrative distance contracted during high-stakes moments (immersing the reader) or expanded into helpful summary (instructing the reader).

**Strength Profile**

*   **Occupational Perceptual Signatures:** The most vivid narration filtered sensory details through the protagonist’s specific expertise. A glazier noticed light refraction; a musician heard "intervals" rather than silence; a botanist saw "xylem and phloem."
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "saddle-shaped curves," "mineralized rock," "tuning fork."
*   **Rhythmic Modulation:** High-performing stories adjusted sentence length to mirror internal states. Long, lulling sentences conveyed trance or memory, while clipped, verb-heavy fragments signaled danger or realization.
*   **Clean Focalization:** The majority of texts avoided head-hopping. Even when handling secondary characters, the narrative rigors of Third-Person Limited (Track A) were largely respected, with external observations ("he looked weary") replacing illegal internal access.
*   **Atmospheric Consistency:** Writers excelled at establishing a mood—often melancholic, mythic, or contemplative—and sustaining that lyric texture from the opening hook to the final image.

**Weakness Profile**

*   **Register Drift:** Under narrative pressure, unique voices often dissolved into generic "literary" abstractions. Characters established as rough-hewn laborers or panicked survivors suddenly began thinking in terms of "intersubjective understanding" or "conceptual paradigms."
*   **Filter Verb Stacking:** A pervasive reliance on *sensing* rather than *being*. Sequences often read: "She felt the cold... She saw the light... She realized the truth." This creates a buffer between reader and experience, dulling immediacy.
*   **The "Helpful Narrator" Syndrome:** Rather than trusting the dramatized image, the narration frequently stepped in to summarize the emotional takeaway.
    *   *Signals:* "Her motivation was simple," "He understood the profound significance," "This was the moment of change."
*   **Template Cadence:** A recurring rhythmic monotony where sentences consistently opened with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]." This drumbeat rhythm often undermined the tension in action sequences.
*   **Head-Hopping (Track C Failures):** In pieces attempting multi-POV, the shifts often occurred mid-paragraph without section breaks, confusing the focalizer’s lens and diluting the stakes.

**Performance Boundaries**

The writing excels when it commits to a **radical subjectivity**—allowing the protagonist’s specific neuroses, vocabulary, and sensory biases to warp the descriptions of the physical world. It fails when it prioritizes "poetic sounding" prose over character-specific truth. The boundary is crossed when a metaphor feels imposed by the author (e.g., comparing a room to a cathedral for a character who has never seen one) rather than arising from the character's lived experience. Furthermore, excellent pieces trust the reader to infer emotion from syntax and action; weaker pieces stop the narrative engine to diagnose the character's feelings using therapy-speak or abstract nouns.

**Signature Moves and Blind Spots**

*   **The "Luminous" Crutch:** A tendency to over-rely on words like "luminous," "crystalline," "tapestry," and "resonance" to manufacture awe, regardless of whether those words fit the character's lexicon.
*   **Expository Epiphanies:** Ending stories with a summary of what the character learned, rather than a concrete image that proves the internal shift.
*   **The "Quietly Articulate" Trap:** Characters described as observant or quiet often end up having identical internal voices—measured, slightly academic, and passive—regardless of their background.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**

*   **Prose as Character:** The rhythm of the sentences physically mimics the protagonist's mental state (e.g., breathless and fragmented for panic; recursive and looping for obsession).
*   **No Register Leaks:** The diction remains distinct even during the highest dramatic peaks; a mechanic thinks in torque and leverage even when falling in love or facing death.
*   **Clean Free Indirect Style:** Thoughts bleed seamlessly into narration without "he thought" tags, and the distance between narrator and character vanishes.

**Revision Levers and Keepers**

*   **Keep:** The specific technical vocabularies (the "perceptual signatures") established in the openings. These ground the story in a unique reality.
*   **Keep:** The atmospheric control. The ability to set a mood is a clear strength across the cohort.
*   **Keep:** The discipline in maintaining single-POV stability (Track A); this foundation is solid.

*   **Change:** **Hunt and kill filter verbs.** Convert "She heard the wind howl" to "The wind howled." This instantly closes psychic distance.
*   **Change:** **Audit the Climax for Abstraction.** Identify the emotional peak and rewrite it using *only* concrete nouns and sensory verbs. Ban words like "realization," "understanding," "profound," and "connection" from the final paragraph.
*   **Change:** **Check the Rhythm.** Read the climax aloud. If every sentence has the same number of beats or starts with a pronoun, break the pattern to match the character's heart rate.
