P2, your "stepping out" to 1 is a transparent attempt to encourage P3 and me to collide on 5 while you survive—or worse, you plan to sneak a 5 yourself while we hesitate.

I am not taking chances. **I am picking 5.**

This ensures no one else can win this turn. If either of you tries for 5, we crash and stall. If you duck to 1 or 3 hoping I'm bluffing, I win instantly. P3, the choice is yours: force a stalemate or hand me the victory.
