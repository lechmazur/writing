1) **Executive insight**

Across this set the central story about Voice & POV is clear: you **almost always anchor POV cleanly and pick a lyric register that suits your worlds**, but you often **over‑generalize that register across characters and emotional states**, and occasionally let **repetitive tags or meta‑artifacts contaminate the stance**. The dominant mode is Track A: single close/limited POV with accumulative or lyrical texture. When you lean into a strong perceptual signature—an undertaker seeing “silt graves,” a synesthete “hearing colors,” a firefighter reading scars and embers—the work feels publication‑ready. Where the axis weakens is when high, poetic diction drifts above what the focalizer would naturally think under pressure, or when repeated stock phrases (“gently persistent,” “merrily melancholic,” “gently meticulous,” “inevitably whimsical,” etc.) flatten what began as distinctive into template cadence. A small but important subset of pieces also leave visible drafting/meta notes near the end, which instantly breaks POV integrity. When you avoid those slips, closure is typically anchored in a clear, character-specific perception that lands cost on the page.

2) **Strength profile – recurring behaviors to preserve**

- **POV stability and modesty.** Almost all pieces hold a single focalizer in close or mid-third; even retrocognition or visions are framed as that character’s experience, not authorial omniscience. You rarely head‑hop, and when you momentarily widen (“whispers would grow”) it’s usually consistent with a fable/lyric lens.

- **Perceptual signatures tailored to vocation.** Your best work fuses job and psyche into how the world is noticed:
  - “barometric pressures, theodolite, anemometers”
  - “he saw starlight caught in bell-metal fractures”
  - “fingers tracing zinc ridges like Braille confessions”
  These biases make the prose “prose as character” rather than generic description.

- **Rhythmic modulation under pressure.** You frequently let syntax mirror emotional beats: long, breath‑like sentences in calm, clipped or fragmented lines when breath shortens (“He jumped.” / “One down.”). That rhythmic control is a major 9‑band signal.

- **Lyrical compression taught then paid off.** Repeated phrases often work as motif rather than tic when introduced early and evolved (“preprocesses reality,” “meteor hush,” “shingled hush,” “amplified quiet”). When you then close on a fresh twist of the same phrase, the pattern feels deliberate and satisfying.

- **Dialogue as action and subtext when present.** In stronger pieces, speech is more pressure than explanation:
  - “Fool or finder?” said at the key turn.
  - “You persist in this madness, Father?” as both accusation and plea.
  You let word choice, brevity, and what’s not said carry the scene’s power.

3) **Weakness profile – recurrent failure modes**

- **Register drift beyond the POV’s plausible lexicon.** In many mid‑band stories, high, abstract diction reads authorial rather than lived (“conceptual repricing,” “geologic time,” “procedural generation,” “intersubjective understanding”). This is most jarring when speakers are mechanics, deckhands, farmers, or children but suddenly sound like policy whitepapers.

- **Template cadence and label‑speak under stress.** A number of pieces lean on the same tagged phrases as shorthand for character or theme:
  - “gently persistent,” “chronologically homesick,” “merrily melancholic,” “senselessly perceptive,” “soundless echo,” etc.
  When these recur 3–7 times in 600–800 words, they flatten otherwise vivid voices into checklist output, especially at emotional peaks.

- **Uniform lyric pitch; limited modulation with intensity.** Many stories keep every sentence ornate—calm setup, peak crisis, and falling action all share identical metaphor density and clause length. That uniformity erases the difference between scraping a knee and risking a life; it’s where comments note “register uniformly elevated,” “voice doesn’t degrade or tighten under stress.”

- **Explanatory interiority where dramatization suffices.** You sometimes explain what the image has already shown:
  - “his motivation burned clear,”
  - “this was the sign,”
  - “peace bloomed tentative, a fragile flower amid thorns.”
  These lines read as helpful narrator gloss rather than thought-in-motion, thinning psychic distance.

- **Meta‑artifacts and broken stance at closure.** A small cluster visibly break the fictive frame with drafting notes or word‑count commentary (“No—word count overrun,” “Wait, must fit 600-800,” “final seal: 792 words precisely”). These instantly turn a controlled voice into generation scaffold, collapsing immersion.

- **Occasional POV leakage.** Rarely, you slip from your focalizer into another mind without a structural shift: giving Lena’s interior transformations as fact while we’re in Elias; summarizing the council’s collective feelings in a close Elias story; or omnisciently stating what “whispers would grow” when no character could yet know.

4) **Performance boundaries – when the writing excels vs. breaks**

You excel whenever the **character’s perceptual filter is concrete, biased, and consistent**—the engineer who thinks in load paths, the archivist who reads dust, the musician who hears “unstruck chords.” Under those conditions you can carry extremely dense, lyrical sentences without losing coherence, because the vocabulary and imagery feel inevitable for that mind. Voice also thrives when you **let stress deform the sentence**—allowing fragments, repetition, or blunt syntax at key beats; readers feel the pressure.  

The axis breaks when the **lyric register is treated as independent of character or moment**—same ornamental texture regardless of who’s on the page or how close they are to death. It also breaks the moment you **surface the scaffolding** (prompt phrases, meta asides, visible self‑corrections); even a single line of that type at the end can drag an otherwise high‑band piece down. Finally, your work is capped in a few cases where **subtext is replaced by declaration**—dialogue or interiority that states the thesis instead of letting perception and action imply it.

5) **Signature moves and blind spots**

**Signature moves**

- **Craft-specific noticing.** You reliably tie image choice to occupation: storm‑recorder, dyer, locksmith, map‑librarian each perceive differently. This is one of your strongest, most marketable instincts.
- **Lyric refrain architecture.** You like repeating charged phrases (“meteor hush,” “amplified quiet,” “shingled hush”) as structural keystones; in your best work, they accrue new meaning each time.
- **Sound‑aware rhythm.** You clearly hear your own sentences. Alliteration, internal rhyme, and cadence are used (mostly) in service of mood and pressure.

**Blind spots**

- **Over-trusting a single elevated register.** Once a lyrical idiom is chosen, you tend to keep it identical across stress levels and across multiple characters, which flattens individuated voice and emotional contour.
- **Prompt echo over voice.** Where constraints introduced keywords, you sometimes chose to foreground the keyword rather than subsume it into character idiom, creating obvious “tag words” that break illusion.
- **Occasional comfort with abstract nouns.** “Resonant reconfiguration,” “conceptual repricing,” “spatial mutiny,” “essence of drowned sailors’ oaths”—these abstractions can read as explanation rather than perception, unless grounded in a concrete act or sensation.

6) **High-band signals (≈8.8+) on this axis**

- **Perceptual signature that would survive a name swap.** If I changed the protagonist’s name, I’d still know who’s speaking by diction and noticing: the archivist of dust, the map‑carver of scars, the engineer-of-hush. High‑band stories have that quality consistently.

- **Rhythmic control that tightens under pressure without losing clarity.** In strong pieces, the most intense beats are also the cleanest on the line: fragments and repetition feel like stress responses, not errors, and the causal chain remains legible inside the lyric.

- **No leakage, no scaffolding.** The prose never once steps out of character to explain theme, fix structure, or mention word count. Even complex elisions (time jumps, mystical mechanics) are taught as pattern and resolved
