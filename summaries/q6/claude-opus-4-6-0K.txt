Here is the editorial brief based on the aggregate grading commentary for Question 6.

### Executive Insight
The submission pool demonstrates an exceptional command of **perceptual signature**—the ability to filter narrative description strictly through the protagonist's specific vocational or emotional lens. Rather than generic third-person observation, these stories consistently render the world through the eyes of archivists, geologists, and musicians, allowing technical lexicons to carry emotional weight. This creates a high-fidelity immersive experience where the "voice" is inseparable from the character’s expertise. The vast majority of pieces succeed under **Track A (Single POV)**, maintaining rigorous focalization stability. However, a recurring ceiling exists where the narrative voice drifts into an "essayistic" or "academic" register during emotional peaks, prioritizing thematic summary over visceral immediacy. The strongest pieces trust the established perceptual lens to land closure without explaining the metaphor to the reader.

### Strength Profile
*   **Vocational Perceptual Filters:** The most consistent strength is the integration of character expertise into sensory description. Characters do not just see a setting; they read it via their trade (e.g., a bone-setter noticing a "fractured radius of knowledge," a navigator reading "current correction").
*   **Rhythmic Modulation:** The prose frequently succeeds in mirroring the protagonist's internal state through syntax. Long, spiraling sentences effectively convey reflection or disorientation, while short, percussive clauses ("She pulled. It held.") sharpen focus during high-pressure beats.
*   **Lyrical Precision:** Diction is elevated but usually controlled. Phrases like "factually mystical," "load-bearing whispers," and "bronze quiet" demonstrate a capacity for coining terms that feel native to the story’s specific world.
*   **POV Stability:** Head-hopping is virtually non-existent. The narrative distance remains stable, successfully navigating Track A constraints. Even in rare multi-character scenes, focalization remains anchored to the primary perceiver.
*   **Clean Free Indirect Style:** The writing seamlessly blends narration with character thought without needing clunky thought tags, allowing for smooth transitions between external action and internal processing.

### Weakness Profile
*   **Register Drift / Essayistic Slide:** Under peak emotional pressure, the narrative voice often abandons the character’s immediate sensory experience in favor of abstract, authorial summarization. The text begins to sound like a thesis statement on the theme rather than a lived moment (e.g., "inadvertently profound in the way all genuine understanding is").
*   **"Helpful Narrator" Syndrome:** A persistent tendency to follow a strong image with an explanation of what that image means. The prose frequently tells the reader an emotion ("she felt a wave of nostalgic grief") immediately after showing it effectively.
*   **Filter Verb Clusters:** While generally controlled, specific beats—often transitions or realizations—suffer from stacks of "she felt," "she saw," or "she realized," which distance the reader from the immediacy of the event.
*   **Uniformity of Voice:** While individual interiorities are strong, there is a risk of "voice convergence" across different stories. Distinct characters (a roughneck scavenger vs. a refined scholar) sometimes sound like the same "poetic academic" in their internal monologues.
*   **Template Cadence:** In action sequences, there is a recurring reliance on repetitive sentence structures (Subject-Verb-Object) that creates a droning rhythm, flattening the tension of the scene.

### Performance Boundaries
The writing **excels** when it commits fully to the "prose as character" principle—when the syntax itself breaks or expands to match the protagonist’s psychological state (e.g., a fragmented mind yielding fragmented sentences). It creates a "lucid turbulence" that is highly effective.

The writing **breaks** when it prioritizes "beautiful writing" over "character logic." This occurs when the vocabulary becomes so ornate or the metaphors so dense that they obscure the physical causality of the scene, or when a character uses a metaphor (e.g., a complex architectural analogy) that is alien to their established background.

### Signature Moves & Blind Spots
*   **The "Lyric-Technical" Hybrid:** A signature habit of pairing a hard science word with an abstract emotion (e.g., "emotional geometry," "calculated wilderness"). This is usually effective but can feel formulaic if overused.
*   **The Atmospheric Hinge:** Using weather or lighting changes (fog, dusk, dawn) to signal internal shifts. While atmospheric, it can become a crutch for moving the plot forward.
*   **Blind Spot - Dialogue Distinction:** Because the narrative voice is so strong, dialogue often sounds like spoken narration. Characters frequently speak in complete, grammatically perfect sentences with the same elevated vocabulary as the prose, lacking idiolect or natural roughness.

### High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)
*   **Rhythmic Enactment:** The prose rhythm doesn't just describe the action; it *performs* it (e.g., a sentence about suffocation that leaves the reader breathless, or a description of a spiral that syntactically loops).
*   **POV Modesty:** The narrative strictly adheres to what the focalizer can plausibly know or infer, resisting the urge to broadcast the feelings of other characters to "help" the reader understand the dynamic.
*   **Paid-off Elision:** Narrative gaps (withholding a name, a memory, or a specific detail) create friction that is released at the climax, proving the omission was a structural choice, not an oversight.

### Revision Levers and Keepers

**Keep:**
*   The **perceptual signatures**. Protect the specific, trade-based metaphors (e.g., the glazier noticing refraction, the musician noticing intervals).
*   The **rhythmic variance**. Continue contrasting long, fluid sentences with short, hard stops to control pacing.
*   The **stable focalization**. The discipline in maintaining a single POV is a major asset; do not dilute it with head-hopping.

**Change:**
*   **Cut Explanatory Tags:** Remove clauses that explain a metaphor immediately after it is presented. Trust the image. (Edit: "The silence was heavy, *like a weight on her chest*." -> "The silence weighed on her chest.")
*   **Scrub Filter Verbs:** Conduct a targeted sweep for "felt," "saw," "heard," and "realized." Convert these into direct sensory statements to close psychic distance.
*   **Roughen Dialogue:** Ensure characters do not sound like the narrator. Give distinct speakers different vocabularies, sentence lengths, and degrees of grammatical correctness to separate them from the prose.
