1) **Executive insight**

Across this set, point of view control is a relative strength: almost everything holds a clean single-POV Track A or close-third lens, with only a few fable-like omniscient variants and almost no true head-hopping. You consistently filter perception through a character’s vocation and wound—undertaker, hydrologist, archivist, alchemist, musician—so the *perceptual signature* is usually distinct and sustained. Where scores slip, the problem is less “whose head are we in?” and more “whose *words* are these?”: moments of authorial thesis or prompt-echo diction intrude into what otherwise reads as lived interiority. Under pressure, the best pieces modulate rhythm and diction in ways that feel like the focal character fracturing or focusing; weaker ones maintain a smooth, elevated register that flattens immediacy or slides toward abstract commentary. Dialogue, when present, is generally functional and often subtext-rich, but some stories drift into thematic speech or “wise mentor” exposition that momentarily breaks the illusion of real people pursuing goals. Overall, closure tends to land cleanly under the chosen lens; the main opportunity is tightening line-level alignment—especially at emotional peaks—so the prose always feels like *prose-as-character* rather than a beautiful overlay.

2) **Strength profile**

- **POV stability and modesty.** You almost never head-hop. Knowledge stays bounded to what the focalizer can plausibly infer, even in high-weirdness pieces (e.g., scientists reading instruments, archivists reading traces).

- **Perceptual signature as character.** Many stories build voice from *what* the character notices:  
  - “overlapping shingles of chitin”  
  - “translucent depths of glass chambers”  
  - “frost patterns like botanical illustrations”  
  These choices root the lyricism in profession and temperament.

- **Rhythmic modulation under pressure.** Syntax often shortens at crisis (“She ran.” “He lifted the bead.”) and lengthens for reflection, giving emotional beats a felt tempo rather than a flat drumbeat.

- **Consistent lexical field.** Scientific, artisanal, or mystical vocabularies stay aligned with the focalizer’s background: “anemometer array,” “methodically playful,” “fossilized spider silk” feel character-earned, not bolted on.

- **Subtext-capable dialogue.** When you lean into dialogue, it often does real work—probing, deflecting, or wounding rather than explaining (“You’re good at reading people, terrible at protecting yourself”; “You already have”).

3) **Weakness profile**

- **Authorial thesis creeping into interiority.** Some climactic lines sound like the story explaining itself rather than the character thinking under stress:  
  - “the space between sigh and smile”  
  - “the deeper truth she’d inherited understood”  
  - “true liberation required strategy over force”  
  These read as external commentary, not a lived idiom.

- **Elevated abstraction at peak beats.** Under pressure, several pieces tilt into essay- or prompt-register—“conceptual repricing,” “ethical playful koan,” “psychic infrastructure”—which breaks immersion given the tight focalization.

- **Therapy-speak and academic leakage.** Terms like “progressive disclosure,” “heuristically gentle,” “emotionally rational” occasionally surface in otherwise textured voices, especially near resolution, flattening the individuality of the consciousness.

- **Expository or thesis-y dialogue.** In some stories, mentors or oracles speak in cleanly formulated themes (“The divine breath moves through the cracks we’d rather seal”; “The sound of hundreds of feet moving together is…”) rather than speech shaped by fear, status, or evasion. The goal is clear, but the line sounds written rather than spoken.

- **Slight rhythm monotony in reflective modes.** A subset of pieces sit in one sentence length and cadence for too long—often long, balanced, clause-heavy lines—which softens contrast between observation, decision, and reversal.

- **Occasional prompt-echo tags.** Phrases like “serene upheaval,” “shadowseam,” “sensitively perceptive” sometimes appear as labels rather than having been earned by prior perceptual patterning, briefly revealing the machinery.

4) **Performance boundaries**

You excel when the focalizer has a concrete craft, and the voice grows out of that craft’s noticing habits. As soon as stakes rise, your best pages cut away abstraction and let syntax, image, and omission do the work; the reader experiences pressure rather than being told about it. Things wobble when the scene wants to sum itself up. If you let that impulse spill into thesis-sentences or jargon, the prose detaches from the character and reads like a committee epigraph, even when everything around it is tight. Any time dialogue is forced to carry explanation that hasn’t been seeded through perception, the speaker’s idiom flattens. Conversely, when you trust patterned diction, specific noticing, and slight rhythmic shift to signal meaning, closure lands with cost and without explanation.

5) **Signature moves and blind spots**

**Signature moves**

- Craft-grounded lyricism: turning tools, weather, and bodily strain into recurring metaphor systems unique to each POV.
- Pattern-taught compression: introducing a phrase or image early (“progressive disclosure,” “saffron quiet”) and bringing it back at a different charge in the last paragraph.
- Silence as action: many of your most charged beats are non-verbal decisions, and the prose knows how to close on an image rather than a declaration.

**Blind spots**

- A temptation to let one or two peak lines slip into essay-voice or prompt-voice (“the physics of letting go,” “become legend... the kind of folktale she'd spent her life collecting”).
- Occasional reliance on filter-verbs or internal labels (“she understood,” “he realized,” “she felt different”) at exactly the beats where unfiltered sensation would hit hardest.
- Mentor/guide figures who default to gnomic exposition rather than revealing their own stakes or fear through the way they speak.

6) **High-band signals (≈8.8+)**

- **Embodied thesis instead of stated thesis.** The story’s “aboutness” is felt in the final image or micro-choice, not spelled out in a closing line; any summary phrase echoes patterns the piece has already taught.
- **Pressure-tuned rhythm.** In the final third, sentence length, punctuation, and white space shift in a way that feels like *this* character under *this* stress, not a generic cinematic quickening.
- **Lexical fidelity at the peak.** The highest-stakes lines still sound like the focalizer: no last-minute slide into academic, corporate, or diagnostic register; metaphors stay rooted in their world and tools.

7) **Revision levers and keepers**

**Keep**

1. **Craft-driven perception.** Keep rooting voice in the character’s work: what their hands know, what their tools reveal, what their training blinds them to.
2. **Rhythmic modulation.** Protect the way you already tighten or loosen syntax around key beats; it’s doing a lot of invisible emotional work.
3. **Subtext in sparse dialogue.** Retain your habit of giving characters short, loaded lines rather than speeches; when it’s working, it carries far more than exposition.

**Change**

1. **Strip thesis-lines at closures.** In revision, flag any sentence that sounds like “This meant that…” or abstracts the moment. Test cutting it and see if the image right before or after already carries the meaning.
2. **Audit peak-register diction.** At emotional climaxes, run a pass for terms that smell of workshop, therapy, or philosophy. Replace them with *this character’s* sensory or craft vocabulary, or with silence.
3. **Roughen mentor speech.** Take one “wise” character and rewrite their key lines with more hesitation, metaphor, or defensiveness. Give them a goal besides teaching (protecting themselves, deflecting pain) and let that distort their wording.
