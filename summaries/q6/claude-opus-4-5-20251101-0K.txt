1) Executive insight  
Across this body of work, point of view and voice are clear strengths. Almost all pieces run in tight third-person or first-person limited and obey that constraint rigorously: there is virtually no unmotivated head‑hopping, and psychic distance is modulated with intent. The dominant track is A (single-POV, accumulative/reflective), with a few pieces edging toward B (mosaic of visions) yet still anchored by one consciousness. The central pattern: narrators have a strong, specific *perceptual signature*—scientists who think in spectra, artisans who think in texture, oracles who think in probability—and the sentence-level music is tuned to that mind. Where things wobble, it’s almost always from small register mismatches or momentary “author voice” abstractions that float above the character’s idiom. Closure, however, nearly always lands through the established lens; even heavily lyrical or compressed stories pay off their early patterning without POV leaks.

2) Strength profile  

- **Stable, disciplined focalization.**  
  Nearly every story holds a single focalizer with no head‑hopping. Multi-character scenes are consistently filtered through what the POV can see/hear/infer (“she inferred his panic from the way his hand tightened on the rail,” not an omniscient statement of his thoughts).

- **Distinct, character‑specific perceptual signatures.**  
  The narrators don’t just see; they *see like themselves*. A few recurring but effective examples:  
  - “gears that no longer measured time”  
  - “silence tasted like possibility”  
  - “clouds the color of old bruises”  
  These lenses are taught early and then saturate later description, giving each story a non‑generic texture.

- **Rhythmic control and modulation under pressure.**  
  Syntax shortens and sharpens at key turns (lever pulls, confessions, discoveries), then lengthens into lyric cadences in reflection. That variation is almost always purposeful rather than mechanically alternating.

- **Dialogue that carries goal and subtext when present.**  
  In pieces with conversation, lines are typically compact, character‑specific, and do real work (“You came specifically because the power failed” / “How did you know?”). Exposition is more often dramatized than declared.

- **Prose as character (“voice-as-mind”).**  
  Sentence shape and diction echo the focalizer’s habits: archivists think in catalogues, mapmakers in coordinates and edges, musicians in rhythm and pitch. This holds even in speculative or fable registers.

3) Weakness profile  

- **Occasional register drift into essay/authorial summary.**  
  Some closures or theme beats spike into abstract, thesis-like language that sounds more like the writer than the character:  
  - “architecture of survival: not grand gestures but repeated small ones”  
  - “families dissolve under the weight of truths never meant to surface”  
  These moments briefly break the illusion of a mind under pressure and flatten immediacy.

- **Therapy- or workshop‑speak in peak emotion.**  
  A minority of stories let phrases like “emotional archaeology,” “cognitive revenue,” or “transformative, unraveling every memory” surface at climaxes. When not organically tied to the character’s background, these read as conceptual labeling rather than lived perception.

- **Filter-verb clusters at crucial beats.**  
  Though most pieces avoid this, a recurring minor tic is stacking “she felt / she realized / she knew” right where we most want direct sensation. It softens otherwise sharp, embodied moments.

- **Occasional over-ornamentation/prompt echo.**  
  A few images strain either through density (“amber grief, crimson determination, the pale blue of hope”) or through visible prompt-language (“conceptual repricing,” “heuristically gentle”). These don’t often derail a scene, but they momentarily foreground the workshop exercise over the character.

4) Performance boundaries  

This voice/POV control excels when the story sits close to a single consciousness in time and space, under moderate to high emotional pressure, and lets that mind’s way of noticing drive diction and syntax. As soon as the narration leans away from embodied perception—into abstract theme, meta-commentary, or borrowed jargon—the illusion thins. The pieces remain readable, but the sense of “this is *this* person thinking, right now” attenuates. Conversely, when the writer trusts the focalizer’s biases and limits—letting us feel what they *can’t* know as absence or misinterpretation—the prose becomes both richer and more reliable.

5) Signature moves and blind spots  

- **Signature moves**  
  - Using one striking coined phrase early (“sieved hush,” “wanderingly exact,” “honeyed hush”) and letting it echo at closure as tonal anchor.  
  - Letting dialogue be sparse but barbed; many key exchanges consist of a few lines where what *isn’t* said carries the emotional payload.  
  - Handling reflection-heavy structures by anchoring every musing to a present stimulus (a button, a rope, a shard), which preserves POV integrity.

- **Blind spots**  
  - Trusting abstraction just a bit too much on the last page—some endings tell us the lesson instead of staying inside the charged image.  
  - Leaning on the same elevated adjectives/nouns across very different characters (e.g., “luminous,” “liminal,” “architecture,” “cartography” recur). This risks a house voice overriding individual voices at the margins.  
  - Slight overuse of declarative “X was Y” statements under stress (“It was enough,” “It was beautiful and terrible”) instead of letting the POV’s idiosyncratic noticing imply those judgments.

6) High-band signals (≈8.8+)  

- **Perceptual bias stays consistent even at the emotional apex.**  
  In the strongest pieces, the same kind of noticing that defined paragraph one is what shapes the final turn. A glassblower who began with “molten gold” dawn will end by reading guilt or forgiveness in refracted light, not in abstract terms.

- **Rhythmic tightening without loss of clarity.**  
  Climax moments often drop into very short clauses or fragments, but the referents remain crystal-clear; the pressure registers as breath-shift, not as confusion.

- **Thematic insight emerges from focalized perception, not commentary.**  
  Lines that feel “true” (“time curled back upon itself like smoke remembering flame”) arise from what the POV is already doing on the page and don’t require explanatory gloss. This is a major separator between strong and exceptional work here.

7) Revision levers and keepers  

- **Keep**  
  1. The commitment to a single, strongly biased lens per story; that’s what gives these pieces their texture.  
  2. The rhythmic modulation that shortens syntax at moments of danger, decision, or revelation.  
  3. The integration of profession or craft into diction—scientists, artisans, and archivists all *think* in their tools.

- **Change (testable edits)**  
  1. In late paragraphs, run a “voice pass” stripping or revising any sentence that could have been written by an omniscient essayist rather than this specific POV. Replace summary insights with one more concrete, character-filtered perception.  
  2. At emotional peaks, audit for stacked filters (“she felt / realized / knew”) and replace at least half with direct sensation or image. If you must keep one, let it be the *turning-point* verb.  
  3. Build a small “do not reuse lightly” list of your own pet abstractions (e.g., “luminous,” “liminal,” “architecture of X”). In revision, allow each story at most one of these—and only if anchored in the POV’s lexicon.
