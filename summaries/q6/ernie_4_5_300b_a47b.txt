**Question 6 Editorial Brief — Voice & Point of View**

---

### 1. Executive Insight

Across this story set, the prevailing pattern is a strong commitment to character-distinct, closely held third-person limited points of view—Track A by default, with rare forays into Track B accumulative or Track C multi-POV structures. Most stories demonstrate a clear perceptual signature, meaning sensory selection, diction, and syntactic rhythm are consistently filtered through the focalizer’s unique biases and sensory limitations. Dialogue tends to be sparse but, at its best, advances plot or subtext in line with character motivation. When the voice succeeds, it envelops the narrative in texture and mood, fostering immersion and authentic emotional modulations under pressure. However, even in higher-band work, voice drift—the intrusion of generic lyricism, register mismatches, or unfiltered abstraction—remains a primary source of friction, often surfacing during emotional peaks or moments of conceptual reflection. Closures tend to land with legibility and cost, provided the voice sustains its modulation through the final beats.

### 2. Strength Profile

- **Distinct Perceptual Signature:** Most pieces filter all sensory information through the professional/psychological lens of the focalizer (e.g., "waveform of a dying pulsar", "accretion disks" for a scientist; "molten scrap glass catching the sun" for an artist). This underpins character specificity.
- **Rhythmic Modulation with Pressure:** Syntax and sentence rhythm accelerate or compress to mirror emotional intensity and narrative stress. Example: “hands still trembled at the memory” and “heartbeat fluttered against her skin.”
- **Purposeful Compression and Elision:** Where experimental patterns emerge, such as lyrical repetition or accumulative omission, these moves are generally taught early and paid off at closure, supporting mood or psychological pressure (e.g., “retell the silence,” “liquid memory—clear, viscous substances labeled with dates”).
- **Dialogue as Subtextual Action:** Even sparse dialogue advances stakes or relationships, often employing implication more than overt explanation. Example: Elias and Marisol’s exchange—“You occupy impossible spaces already”—communicates grief and the mechanics of coping.
- **Prose as Character:** Vocabulary, syntax, and metaphor choices consistently reflect the character’s professional/psychological state (e.g., “clockmaker’s precision,” “synesthetic perception,” “musician noticing sound and silence”).
- **Controlled Experimental Form (when present):** On rare entries into Track B or C, segmentation or lyric compression is usually taught up front and resolved with clarity ("heard colors faintly as vibrations in her cochlea”).
  
Micro-quotes:
- “waveform of a dying pulsar”
- “melting scrap glass into vases that caught the sun in liquid swirls”
- “hands still trembled at the memory”
- “each coffin a promise”
- "heard colors faintly as vibrations in her cochlea”

### 3. Weakness Profile

- **Register Drift and Abstraction:** Voice frequently slips into either a more elevated/lyrical register or clinical abstraction at peaks (“raw, unfiltered process”; “labyrinthine archive”; “conceptual abstraction”) disrupting authenticity and immediacy.
- **Dialogue Convergence:** Across focalizers, secondary character dialogue can default to the narrative’s rhythm, with insufficient differentiation—e.g., mothers, ghosts, or rivals speaking in similar cryptic, expository, or poetic registers as focal characters.
- **Filter Verb/Expository Clutter:** Over-reliance on filter constructions (“she thought,” “he felt,” “she realized”), particularly in reflective or high-stakes moments, dulls narrative immediacy and undermines pressure, unless voice-motivated.
- **Occasional POV Drift/Unexplained Slippage:** Rare but critical, some stories break POV stability through unmarked shifts (Track-test: grade_story_wc_249.txt breaks entirely from third to first, shattering coherence).
- **Flattened Rhythm under High Pressure:** At crisis, the prose sometimes abandons its earlier idiomatic or compressed voice for abstract, generalized, or overwrought phrasing not taught earlier (e.g., “bridge generational wisdom,” “loom of existence,” “ephemeral monuments”) or syntactic monotony emerges.
- **Missed Distinction in Low-Dialogue Pieces:** Where dialogue is absent, some stories do not compensate with interiority vivid enough to fully sustain or test the textural voice axis.
- **Track-Test Failures:** Rare, but present—unmarked POV shifts (grade_story_wc_249.txt: third to first mid-scene), or segments/voices not sufficiently taught, severely disrupt the illusion.

### 4. Performance Boundaries

This writing excels when it anchors every sensory, emotional, and thematic observation in the nuanced, pressure-responsive voice of a singular focalizer—and when it modulates that voice’s lexical and rhythmic field to reflect scene tension or psychological escalation. It falters when abstraction, generic lyricism, or unmotivated register shifts break the auditory illusion, especially during emotional or conceptual peaks. The difference between high and exceptional is most pronounced under narrative stress: strong pieces tighten and intensify voice, while weaker ones default to stock lyricism, summary, or academic abstraction, puncturing immersion.

### 5. Signature Moves and Blind Spots

**Signature Moves**
- Lyric compression taught and paid off in closure
- Professional lexicons (scientific, artistic, archival, musical) deeply infusing perception
- Stress-modulated syntax: sentence rhythm mirrors scene tension
- Dialogue as implication or negative space—subtextual exchanges often do more than explicit statements

**Blind Spots**
- Overwritten or generic metaphors at crisis (“loom of existence,” “fractal rainbow”)
- Dialogue indistinctness among minor/secondary characters
- Filter-verb clusters as unexamined crutches (“she thought/felt/knew”) during high stakes
- Unjustified register elevation—vocabulary not plausibly character-specific
- One-off POV leakage or experimental slippage not taught or resolved

---

### 6. High-Band Signals (≈8.8+)

- **Coherent Lens at Closure:** The story ends with a voice as distinct—ideally more pressured and modulated—as the opening, paying off earlier patterning (e.g., closure echoing or formally answering opening lexical or rhythmic cues).
- **Cost Legibility within Voice:** The consequences, epiphanies, or reversals land specifically in the character’s way of noticing, not via general thematic statement or authorial “tie-off.”
- **Clean Line Work in Final Third:** Under stress, syntax, sensory hierarchy, and metaphor remain precise and character-motivated; no slippage into generic, abstract, or “committee” voice.

---

### 7. Revision Levers and Keepers

**Keep:**
- Professionally biased, idiosyncratic perceptual signatures (scientists, artists, artisans)
- Syntax and diction shaped dynamically by emotional intensity/scene pressure
- Early, clearly taught compression or lyric patterning that is repaid in narrative resolution

**Change:**
- Prune or retool filter-verb clusters and explanatory statements, especially at scene pivots/peaks, unless strictly voice-motivated
- Audit for secondary/tertiary character dialogue: ensure register, rhythm, and lexicon are distinct and stress-appropriate
- Test for unmotivated register elevation: every elevated metaphor or abstraction at peaks must be voice-anchored or cut
- For experimental moves or POV shifts, ensure pattern is taught early and closure lands on-page with cost, else revert to disciplined single-POV

**Summary:**  
The best work in this set is unmistakable in voice, consistent in psychic distance, and precise in emotional/rhythmic modulation under stress. Weaknesses most commonly present as register drift, undifferentiated dialogue, or reliance on filter-verb summary. Rigorous pruning of these artifacts, and cultivation of individual perceptual bias and syntactic play, will push most stories decisively upward on this axis.
