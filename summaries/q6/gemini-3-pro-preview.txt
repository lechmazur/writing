1) **Executive insight**

Across this cluster, point of view control and voice are clear strengths. Almost every piece runs in tight third-person limited (or first-person) with a single focalizer whose *perceptual signature* is strongly tied to vocation, obsession, or wound—a glass worker who thinks in viscosity, a genealogist who thinks in branches, a mechanic who hears stress in rivets. Syntax and rhythm typically modulate with pressure: long, accretive lines in setup, tightening into clipped clauses under peak stress, then breathing out into a quieter closure. Elevated, lyrical diction is a deliberate global choice, and in most stories it remains character-bound rather than generic “literary voice.” The main frictions emerge when that lyricism slips into abstraction or authorial summary, or when filter verbs creep in at high-intensity moments and flatten immediacy. True head-hopping is rare; when it appears, it’s usually a brief sentence of omniscient insight into another character rather than wholesale POV drift. Overall, the work lives very comfortably in Track A: single-POV, accumulative or ritual-driven pieces whose closure effects are legible and earned under a consistent lens.

2) **Strength profile**

- **Stable, close focalization.** The norm is a single POV held cleanly from first line to last, with no unjustified access to others’ interior lives. Even in pieces with telepathy or hauntings, other minds appear as pressure or signal, not as co-focalizers.

- **Strong perceptual signatures.** Stories teach, early and consistently, how the focalizer notices:  
  - “preprocessed the reality… as a wireframe of its future state”  
  - “sees books by heartbreak gravity, not Dewey Decimal”  
  - “taste of soot… sleeping dust and compressed ages”  
  This bias in attention makes narrators feel non-interchangeable.

- **Rhythmic modulation under stress.** Sentence length and syntax reliably track emotional intensity: long, layered description in low-stakes beats; compressed, monosyllabic or paratactic lines at climaxes (“She swung the rail spike. It flew…”).

- **Diction aligned to vocation.** Technical or elevated vocabulary is usually justified by the character’s background—meteorologists handle “pressure gradients,” archivists “stratigraphy,” glaziers “stress fractures”—and those registers tend to stay coherent even at peak emotion.

- **Compression and elision are taught and paid off.** Many pieces open in an already-compressed idiom—rituals mid-stream, time already strange—and then use that same pattern to deliver their closure (e.g., taught breath-holding mechanic, then the decisive held-breath in the final scene).

3) **Weakness profile**

- **Register drift at emotional peaks.** A recurring wobble is abstraction or thesis language intruding into otherwise embodied POVs in high-intensity beats:
  - “fundamental failure of truth,” “architecture of his soul,” “intersubjective understanding”
  - labels like “reactively visionary,” “senselessly perceptive,” “deep shadow work”
  These feel more like authorial commentary than what the focalizer would think in the moment.

- **Filter-verb flare-ups in climaxes.** While many pieces use free indirect style cleanly, some sequences stack verbs like *felt / knew / realized / saw* exactly when immediacy should sharpen (“He realized he had to act,” “She felt the weight of it all”), slightly dulling impact.

- **Helpful-narrator explanation.** A subset of stories let the narrator step in to interpret or summarize what an image already implies:  
  - “It was a paradoxical state of being,”  
  - “This was the physical link between them,”  
  - “the mechanism of their connection was simple.”  
  These glosses flatten subtext and reduce trust in dramatization.

- **Occasional POV slippage / mini head-hops.** Though rare, some texts briefly jump into another character’s certainty or crowd-mind (“panic flooding his eyes,” “began to experience epiphanies,” “she finally understood”) at exactly the moment the primary POV’s limited perception is most valuable.

- **Uniform high lyricism.** In a few pieces, the voice stays at one elevated, metaphor-dense register from start to finish; without any degradation or roughening as pressure rises, emotional peaks can feel less acute, more like a continuous hum.

4) **Performance boundaries**

This writing excels when a story is anchored in a single, tightly held consciousness whose sensory and conceptual habits are allowed to fully color the page, and when the prose trusts embodied perception to carry theme. Under those conditions, elevated diction and intricate metaphor become assets: they deepen character and world, and rhythm under pressure stays clear and propulsive. It breaks, or at least flattens, when abstraction intrudes—when the narrator starts naming “the core concept” of an encounter or diagnosing characters (“senselessly perceptive,” “factually mystical science”) instead of letting images and choices speak. Similarly, prose that maintains the same lush register through calm and crisis risks emotional monotony; the work is strongest when syntax, not just imagery, shifts to reflect stress. Multi-POV or omniscient frames are nearly absent; when you *do* briefly step outside the focalizer, the result often feels like a slip rather than a designed Track C maneuver.

5) **Signature moves and blind spots**

**Signature moves**

- **Profession-as-lens narration.** Characters’ jobs and obsessions are the grammar of the prose; you reliably build metaphor and noticing from vocation rather than generic imagery.

- **Ritualized, accumulative scenes.** Many stories are single-tableau rituals (a repair, a climb, a tuning) where voice and POV carry escalation without big plot swings.

- **Sonic and tactile emphasis.** Even in visually rich pieces, attention to sound, pressure, and texture (“cracking knuckle,” “hum in his bones,” “thrum of blood”) is a recurring, effective through-line.

**Blind spots**

- **Overexplaining meaning.** The impulse to make sure the reader grasps the thematic move sometimes leads you to tell us what an image “means” immediately after showing it.

- **Abstract label shortcuts.** At emotional peaks, you sometimes reach for abstract tags—“terrifyingly complex,” “violent, beautiful calculus of atonement,” “savage peace”—instead of staying inside the POV’s lived lexicon.

- **Occasional inconsistent distance.** In a few stories, psychic distance stays at a reflective mid-range even during crisis, so we observe characters undergoing stress rather than inhabiting their thinking as it frays.

---

6) **High-band signals (≈8.8+)**

- **Embodied closure without explanation.** Endings that land entirely on an image or small action filtered through the established signature—e.g., the single match struck, the last valve turned, the reed’s scream—without a summarizing sentence about what it “proves.”

- **Pressure-responsive syntax.** Climaxes where sentence shape and rhythm shift noticeably—fragments, parallelism, compression—but the underlying voice and lexicon remain clearly that character’s, not a default “elevated” narrator.

- **Metaphor rooted in POV, not theme.** Figurative language that always arises from what *this person* knows and notices (tea leaves as geometry, silence as archival material), never dropping in a metaphor that sounds like the author’s thesis rather than the focalizer’s thought.

7) **Revision levers and keepers**

**Keep**

1. **Single, deep focalization.** Your strongest pieces commit to one consciousness and let it fully tint the narrative; keep resisting calls to explain what other characters feel unless the POV could plausibly infer it.

2. **Vocation-shaped diction.** The habit of drawing metaphor and vocabulary from a character’s trade (archivist, glazier, sailor) gives your voices real specificity; protect this and continue seeding it early.

3. **Rhythmic modulation under stress.** The tendency to tighten syntax and shorten clauses at peaks creates felt pressure; keep using rhythm as a primary tool, not just imagery.

**Change**

1. **Strip explanatory gloss at peaks.** In revision, flag lines that explain an image’s meaning (“this was the physical link,” “the universe, it seemed”) and test cuts: does the scene read stronger if you trust the reader to infer? Where needed, replace with one more concrete, POV-true perception instead of a summary.

2. **Audit filter verbs in climaxes.** On a second pass, specifically scan high-intensity paragraphs for stacks of *felt/knew/realized/saw* and experiment with recasting 1–2 sentences as direct sensory description or free indirect thought. The goal is not zero filters, but fewer at the exact beats where immediacy matters most.

3. **Let pressure roughen the lyric register.** In pieces that stay uniformly ornate, deliberately allow the voice to fray a little under maximum stress—shorter, plainer words; fewer modifiers. Staying inside the same elevated idiom through panic can undercut stakes; a brief drop in polish, still in character, will often feel more honest and make the surrounding lyricism land harder.
