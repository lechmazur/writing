**Executive Insight**
The cohort demonstrates exceptional command of **Perceptual Signature**, with nearly every story establishing a narrative voice deeply rooted in the protagonist’s vocation and sensory hierarchy. Whether the focalizer is an archivist, a glazier, or a cartographer, the prose consistently filters the world through their specific expertise (e.g., reading "cracks as maps" or "silence as architecture"). This commitment to **Track A (Single-POV)** stability allows for deep immersion; head-hopping is virtually nonexistent. The primary differentiator between strong (8.0–8.7) and exceptional (9.0+) work lies in **Rhythmic Control under Pressure**. While almost all writers sustain a lyrical, reflective tone, only the top tier successfully modulates syntax to mirror physiological stress—fracturing the prose during crisis and expanding it during revelation. Closure reliably lands because the voice remains coherent, paying off early poetic patterns with earned resonance.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Vocation-Specific Imagery:** Narrators consistently use metaphors derived from their trade, creating a "lived-in" worldview rather than generic literary description.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "gears were worn teeth," "silence as architecture," "light dying golden," "ink layered over ink."
*   **Stable Psychic Distance:** The writing maintains a tight, intimate proximity to the focalizer, rarely pulling back into cold objectivity or unmotivated omniscience.
*   **Clean Free Indirect Style:** Thoughts blend seamlessly with narration without clunky tags, allowing the character’s internal lexicon to color the prose.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "Not fabric, but frequencies," "pain had become geometry."
*   **Purposeful Compression:** Backstory and world-building are often elided or compressed into lyric shards that teach the reader how to read the story, paying off at the climax.

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Essayistic Register Drift:** At moments of peak emotion or thematic realization, voices sometimes slip into abstract, academic, or "workshop" language that feels authorial rather than character-bound.
    *   *Signals:* Phrases like "conceptual repricing," "haggard awe," or summarizing "the nature of grief" instead of showing its physical symptom.
*   **Filter Verb Stacking:** In weaker moments, immediacy is dulled by unnecessary sensory filters that distance the reader from the experience.
    *   *Signals:* Clusters of "she felt," "she saw," "she realized," "she understood" appearing in high-stakes beats.
*   **Uniform Lyricism:** Some stories maintain a "beautiful" mid-tempo rhythm regardless of the action, failing to accelerate or fragment when the character is terrified or running.
*   **Helpful Narrator Syndrome:** Over-explaining the subtext of a gesture or line of dialogue immediately after it occurs, betraying a lack of trust in the dramatization.

**Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when **syntax mimics cognition**—when a methodical character speaks in measured, balanced clauses, or a frantic character thinks in staccato fragments. The spell breaks when **diction floats**; if a rough-hewn scavenger suddenly uses words like "interlaced absence" or "symphonic resonance" without a textual basis for that vocabulary, the character dissolves into a generic literary narrator. Success requires that the *texture* of the prose changes to match the *temperature* of the scene.

**Signature Moves & Blind Spots**
*   **The Expert-Poet:** The default protagonist is a hyper-competent professional (archivist, engineer) who internalizes their world through a lens of melancholic beauty.
*   **Synesthetic Shortcuts:** A heavy reliance on crossing senses (hearing colors, tasting silence) to establish "voice," which works well but risks becoming a tic if not grounded in the character’s specific physiology.
*   **The "Silent" Dialogue:** Many stories eschew spoken dialogue entirely, relying on internal monologue. While often successful, this sometimes leads to a lack of external friction or distinct "other" voices to challenge the protagonist.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Syntactic porosity under stress:** The sentence structure degrades or tightens in direct response to the character’s rising panic or awe, rather than just describing it.
*   **Invisible transitions:** Shifts between present action, memory, and technical observation occur without paragraph breaks or clunky signposting, held together by the strength of the voice.
*   **Lexical discipline:** Even in abstract moments, the metaphors stick strictly to the character’s established knowledge base (e.g., a sailor never uses a gardening metaphor).

**Revision Levers & Keepers**
*   **Keep:** The intense focus on **trade-based metaphors**; this is the cohort's superpower and grounds even the wildest speculative elements.
*   **Keep:** The **POV stability**; the discipline in avoiding head-hopping is professional-grade and anchors the reader.
*   **Keep:** The use of **sensory texture** (weight, temperature, vibration) over mere visual description.
*   **Change:** Hunt and kill **abstract thematic summaries** at the ends of paragraphs; let the concrete image hold the weight.
*   **Change:** Prune **filter verbs** ("she watched," "he heard") to close the psychic distance, especially in climactic scenes.
*   **Change:** check **dialogue registers** (if present) to ensure supporting characters do not sound exactly like the narrator; give them distinct rhythms or vocabularies.
