1) **Executive insight**

Across these stories, voice and POV are generally an asset rather than a liability. The dominant pattern is **tight, single-focalization third person** (with a healthy scattering of first-person pieces), almost always Track A: one clear lens, no gratuitous head-hopping, and closure that reads through that same lens. Where the work excels, the voice is *prose-as-character*: a scientist who “preprocesses reality,” a bell tuner who reads “gaps between notes,” an archivist who hears “echoes in paper.” Syntax and diction consistently mirror these perceptual signatures, and under narrative pressure the best pieces *tighten* rather than flatten—sentence rhythm shifts, but lexicon and stance stay coherent. Experimental allowances (compressed lyricism, patterned elision, or semi-omniscient lyric distance) largely stay within Global Experimental parameters: patterns are taught early and paid off at closure. Slips tend to cluster not in outright POV breaks, but in voice drift: purple or essayistic phrases that sit slightly outside the established lexicon, or dialogue that collapses into thesis exposition. Overall, the default is controlled, character-bound focalization with rhythmic modulation that could go straight into literary magazines with minimal line-editing.

2) **Strength profile**

- **Stable, disciplined focalization.** The overwhelming majority of stories keep to a single, limited lens—whether close third or first—with *no unmotivated head-hopping*. Even when additional perspectives appear (e.g., the skimmer in the canyon, the lamplighter’s family, or a queen plus an old woman), those are cleanly segmented and remain Track B/C-legible.

- **Distinct perceptual signatures.** Many narrators/narrative stances have immediately recognizable filters:
  - “she heard the apples first—their preserved crimson a low hum”
  - “her fingers blackening as she pried”
  - “time moved wanderingly exact—neither linear nor chaotic”
  These signatures are not just metaphor; they systematically govern what gets noticed and how it’s described.

- **Rhythmic modulation under pressure.** Syntax shortens when stakes spike, and lengthens for reflection, without collapsing into monotone. Examples:
  - Quiet build → “She swung the bell.” (single, decisive beat)
  - Reflective lyric blocks cut by sharp, one-line realizations like “Before the coup.”

- **Lyric precision rather than blur.** At higher bands, figurative language is dense but disciplined—images are concrete and POV-bound: “boat bells chimed in violet,” “dripping rate of cosmic balance seeking its center,” “salt-stiff rope.” The reader rarely has to choose between music and clarity; you typically deliver both.

- **Dialogue as subtext-driven action.** When dialogue appears, it’s usually lean and purposeful:
  - “You’re still performing” / “No. I perform the opposite.”
  - “Does it still count as beautiful if it’s broken?”
  Lines advance goals, wound or test, rather than recap what narration already told us.

3) **Weakness profile**

- **Occasional register drift into essay or thesis-speak.** In some stories, under peak stress the narration steps slightly outside the character’s lexicon:
  - “architecture of feeling itself,” “resurrection of all they’d thought they’d lost”
  - “transformation’s texture,” “calculated wilderness”
  These read as authorial commentary more than lived thought, especially in climactic beats.

- **Purple or over-curated phrases that puncture immediacy.** A small but recurring pattern: isolated lines like “terrestrially cosmic phenomenon,” “factually mystical,” “rosewood dread,” or “luminous ache” that feel more like prompt-fulfillment than organic voice. They rarely break the scene, but they do momentarily foreground the *writing* over the POV.

- **Filter-verb and abstraction spikes at climaxes.** Though your overall filter-verb usage is low, some key beats lean on “she felt / knew / understood” where direct embodiment would be sharper:
  - “She understood then what needed doing.”
  - “Mara realized this was the work of return.”
  These cues distance the reader at the exact moment you could move closer.

- **Dialogue that occasionally turns into thesis delivery.** A minority of exchanges flatten into idea-statement rather than subtext (often in conceptual SF or therapy-adjacent pieces):
  - “Because nothing costs nothing.”
  - “Your perfect system can only catalog what persists. But truth lives in transitions.”
  They’re thematically apt but sound like the author speaking through multiple mouths; character idioms converge.

- **A few track-test grazes.** Very isolated instances where:
  - A brief late-perspective shift (e.g., to mother or brother) isn’t fully segmented, or
  - Summative finales (“understanding at last that…”) tilt toward near-omniscient reassurance rather than staying fully inside the focalizer’s uncertainty.
  These don’t cause full confusion but they soften the otherwise clean lens at closure.

4) **Performance boundaries**

This writing excels when the POV character is *doing or sensing something highly specific* and the prose lets that specificity dictate lexicon and rhythm. Archivists, glaziers, divers, cartographers, tune-smiths: when the world is filtered through their biased noticing, voice becomes effortlessly character-bound and rhythmic variation under pressure feels natural. It falters when the prose tries to *announce* theme rather than letting action, image, and subtext imply it—especially via elevated abstractions or dialogue that over-articulates insight. The closer you stay to “what this particular mind would notice and how they’d phrase it right now,” the stronger the voice; when you reach for generic “x of y” coinages or essay sentences at the top of a scene, the texture flattens and risks committee-voice.

5) **Signature moves and blind spots**

**Signature moves**

- Lyric-technical fusion: you consistently integrate precise jargon (“hyperbolic distance,” “piezoelectric”) with lush metaphor in a way that feels character-earned.
- Sensorially anchored thought: internal realizations are usually grounded in a specific tactile, visual, or acoustic cue (a chipped plate, a tremor in rope, a humming fragment).
- Closing on image, not explanation: many endings land on a physical gesture or sensory detail (“She lifted the seed. / It pulsed once.”) rather than spelled-out moral.

**Blind spots**

- Occasional indulgence in stock elevated phrases (“terrible beauty,” “benediction,” “slow violence of…”), which risk flattening an otherwise unique voice.
- Tendency, in some therapy- or philosophy-adjacent pieces, to let dialogue “solve” scenes with aphorisms instead of dramatized conflict and misrecognition.
- Slight overreliance on a stable lyric register; a few high-stress beats might benefit from rougher, more syntactically broken texture to match panic or shock.

---

6) **High-band signals (≈ 8.8+)**

- **Coherent perceptual signature under peak stress.** In the strongest stories, the exact same noticing habit that defined the opening (e.g., counting drips, reading dust, tasting memories) governs perception in the climax, even as syntax tightens. There’s no sudden switch to abstract summary or narrator thesis.

- **Rhythmic control aligned to scene physics.** Sentence length and structure meaningfully mirror breath, motion, or sonic environment: ascent scenes move in vertical clauses, tuning scenes in repeated beats, flood scenes in long, rolling periods that break at impact.

- **Dialogue that reveals more than it says.** High-band stories use very few lines, but each is layered: a question doubles as accusation; a joke masks fear; a simple “Show me” or “Next moon” carries forward emotional negotiations seeded well before.

7) **Revision levers and keepers**

**Keep**

1. **Perceptual specificity.** The crafts, sciences, and odd vocations through which your narrators see the world are your strongest asset; preserve that selective bias and let it keep owning the lexicon.

2. **Rhythmic modulation.** Maintain your habit of tightening syntax at pressure points and loosening it in contemplative spans—the breath-level pacing is working.

3. **Image-led closure.** Protect your instinct to end on charged sensory images or small gestures rather than explicit takeaways; it gives endings weight without sermon.

**Change**

1. **Audit climax abstractions.** In revision, circle every “she/he understood / realized / knew” and every sentence that sounds like a thesis. For each, test whether you can swap it for a concrete reaction, image, or line of dialogue that *enacts* the same shift.

2. **Trim authorial coinages.** When you hit phrases like “architecture of feeling,” “fierce autonomy,” or “factually mystical,” ask: would this exact character think or say it under stress? If not, recast in their idiom or cut.

3. **Sharpen dialogue naturalism where needed.** For scenes that currently feature aphoristic exchanges, try a pass where each speaker’s lines are slightly *less* articulate and more goal-driven—interruptions, half-sentences, misfires; let subtext carry theme instead of polished declarations.

If you keep leaning into character-bound perception and let that drive both diction and syntax, your Voice & POV axis is already operating at a level most top-tier venues seek. The remaining gains are mostly about shaving away the few abstract or over-neat moments that briefly dilute an otherwise potent lens.
