**Executive Insight**
The corpus demonstrates a sophisticated grasp of the **Accumulative/Textural lens** (Track B), prioritizing internal transformation and stance crystallization over high-velocity external plotting. At this word count (600–800), the writing succeeds when it commits to **one meaningful tightening**—a single moment where pressure coheres to force a trade-off—rather than attempting multiple reversals. The central discriminator between functional and exceptional work here is the legibility of **cost**. High-performing stories dramatize the price of the protagonist’s agency (e.g., forfeiture of safety, destruction of a relic, acceptance of permanent loss), while lower-tier pieces rely on conceptual stakes where success feels inevitable or frictionless. The most consistent victory is the "Charged Poise" ending, where resolution is not a fix, but an earned, irreversible shift in the protagonist's relationship to their burden.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Early Signal Clarity:** Dominant stakes are almost invariably established within the first two paragraphs, anchoring the reader immediately in the conflict (e.g., truth vs. erasure, preservation vs. release).
*   **Agency as Renunciation:** The writing excels at framing agency not just as doing, but as *refusing*. Protagonists frequently achieve resolution by foreclosing the easier path (e.g., rejecting comfortable silence for painful speech).
*   **Coherent Accumulation:** Pressure mounts effectively through density and sensory layering rather than frenetic action. This suits the short form, allowing the “weight” of the stake to grow until a single decision becomes necessary.
*   **Lens Consistency:** The narratives rarely break their established logic. If a story begins as an internal meditation on grief, it resolves through emotional alchemy, not a sudden external action sequence.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* “Not healed but healing,” “luminous regret,” “swallowed truth.”

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Frictionless Success:** Too often, protagonists possess a unique skill that solves the central problem without tactical adaptation or failure. If a character enters a dangerous ruin to decode a language, they frequently succeed on the first try without material resistance.
*   **Abstract vs. Visceral Cost:** Lower-performing stories declare stakes (“the world will forget”) but fail to dramatize the immediate penalty. The “cost” remains theoretical—a sadness the character thinks about—rather than a resource (time, health, tool, relationship) lost on the page.
*   **Atmospheric "Tightening":** In weaker pieces, escalation is confused with description. The storm gets louder or the room gets darker, but the protagonist’s *options* do not narrow. True escalation requires that a live option be killed off.
*   **The Passive Epiphany:** Resolutions sometimes arrive via coincidence or sudden realization ("she understood now") rather than a forced choice. This creates a "soft" ending where the character is enlightened but untested.

**Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when it treats internal conflict as a tactical landscape with tangible rules. It thrives in the **Accumulative mode**, where layers of memory or sensory detail build a crushing weight that forces a single, decisive act of witness or sacrifice. However, the work breaks down when it mistakes *serenity* for *stasis*. Stories in the lower bands often feature protagonists who are observers rather than agents; they watch a magical event, feel a feeling, and leave. The pivot point between a grade of 6.0 and 9.0 is almost always **resistance**: does the environment/antagonist push back hard enough to force the protagonist to abandon their initial plan and pay a price for the new one?

**Signature Moves and Blind Spots**
*   **The "One-Way Door":** A frequent, successful structural move where the protagonist crosses a threshold (physical or emotional) that cannot be uncrossed, crystallizing their stance.
*   **The Artifact as Proxy:** Emotional stakes are often embodied in a single object (a coin, a lens, a seed). This works well, provided the object is put at genuine risk.
*   **Blind Spot—The Helpful Ghost:** Antagonistic forces (spirits, memories, ruins) are often too cooperative, aiding the protagonist’s journey rather than obstructing it, which deflates tension.
*   **Blind Spot—Telescopic Stakes:** Declaring universe-ending consequences for a conflict that plays out as a minor interpersonal misunderstanding or a quiet moment of reflection.

**High-Band Signals (8.8+)**
*   **Irreversible Forfeiture:** The protagonist actively destroys or abandons a valuable resource (a tool, a safety net, a comforting lie) to achieve the goal. The loss is permanent and visible.
*   **Somatic Cost:** The price of the conflict is registered in the body—trembling hands, exhaustion, physical pain—anchoring abstract stakes in visceral reality.
*   **Tactical Narrowing:** The narrative demonstrates that the protagonist has run out of safe options. The final act is the *only* remaining move, not just a good idea.

**Revision Levers**
**Keep:**
1.  **The Accumulative Structure:** Continue using density and layering to build pressure; this is a distinct stylistic strength for this length.
2.  **Early Anchoring:** Maintain the habit of signaling the dominant stake in the opening beats; it provides essential narrative traction.
3.  **The Charged Poise Ending:** Continue resolving stories through stance crystallization rather than neat plot bows; it resonates well with the tone.

**Change:**
1.  **Introduce Friction:** Ensure the protagonist’s primary skill fails or is insufficient at least once before the climax. Force them to adapt.
2.  **Convert Thought to Action:** If a character realizes a truth, make them perform a physical action that proves they accept the cost (e.g., instead of thinking "I must let go," they drop the artifact into the sea).
3.  **Sharpen the Antagonist:** Even if the antagonist is "Silence" or "Entropy," give it a move. Make the silence oppressive enough to hurt; make the entropy destroy something the protagonist tries to save.
