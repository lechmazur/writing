**Executive Insight**
The defining characteristic of high-performing entries on the Prose & Line-Level Craft axis is **informational efficiency**. The strongest pieces achieve a high density where sentences routinely perform double or triple duty—establishing setting, advancing character interiority, and ratcheting tension simultaneously—without becoming cluttered or obscure. Lower-scoring entries often idle in “paraphrase loops” (restating a concept immediately after showing it) or rely on “scaffold” sentences (transitional filler like *She looked at the door and decided to open it*) that kill momentum. When propulsion flags, it is rarely due to a lack of plot, but rather a failure of sentence-level economy. The most critical differentiator is the handling of closure: top-tier stories land on a concrete image that recharges the narrative’s central motif, whereas mid-tier entries retreat into abstract summary or thematic explanation in the final paragraph.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Double-Duty Phrasing:** The best lines compress physical action and atmospheric pressure into single strokes.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "jagged edges catching... like teeth"; "frost-kissed stones"; "ink bleeding... like veins."
*   **Pattern-Taught Figurative Language:** Successful entries introduce a specific metaphoric lexicon (e.g., weaving, combustion, tides) early and sustain it coherently, avoiding mixed metaphors in peak beats.
*   **Rhythmic Variety (The Ear Test):** High-scoring texts modulate sentence length to match the scene’s "breath"—long, fluid clauses for memory/atmosphere, shifting to staccato fragments during high-pressure action sequences.
*   **Tactile Anchoring:** Abstract concepts are consistently grounded in physical objects, preventing "floating" narration.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "scent of salt and gun oil"; "rough as sandstone."

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Paraphrase Loops:** This is the most pervasive flaw. Writers state an idea, then immediately restate it in the next sentence with slightly different words, stalling the narrative engine.
    *   *Signals:* "He felt alone. The solitude pressed in on him." / "The door was locked. It wouldn't open."
*   **Template Cadence:** A rhythmic stutter caused by starting three or more consecutive sentences with the same syntactic structure (often *Subject-Verb* or *Pronoun-Verb*).
    *   *Signals:* "She reached... She saw... She felt..." sequences that create a droning, mechanical effect.
*   **Stock Metaphor Strings:** Reliance on received language rather than fresh observation, particularly in high-stakes moments.
    *   *Signals:* "Moth to a flame," "liquid gold," "silence was deafening," "eyes like obsidian," "ribs of a sleeping giant."
*   **Filter Verb Stacking:** Unnecessary filtering of sensory experience through the character’s perception, distancing the reader.
    *   *Signals:* "He heard the wind," "She saw the light," "He realized that..." (instead of simply describing the wind, light, or realization).
*   **Register Drift:** The sudden intrusion of academic, corporate, or "therapy-speak" diction into an otherwise sensory or lyrical narrative.
    *   *Signals:* "Conceptual repricing," "intersubjective understanding," "heuristically gentle."

**Performance Boundaries**
The boundary between a "7" and a "9" often lies in the management of **figurative density**. In mid-range stories, metaphors are used decoratively—sprinkled on top of the action like garnish, often mixing vehicles (e.g., a "burning" desire that also "drowns" the protagonist). This creates "purple" prose that obscures causality. In high-band stories, metaphors are structural; they advance the plot or reveal character limits. The writing breaks when the author attempts to elevate the stakes through adjective stacking ("furiously tranquil," "shatteringly loud") rather than through precise verbs and nouns. Additionally, the **Closure Beat** is a strict boundary: if the final paragraph relies on a summary of the theme ("And she knew she would be okay") rather than a charged image, the piece cannot access the highest tier.

**Signature Moves & Blind Spots**
*   **The "Liquid Silver/Gold" Crutch:** A pervasive blind spot where light or water is lazily described as "liquid [precious metal]." It appears in dozens of entries and signals a lack of visual precision.
*   **The Explanatory Scaffold:** Writers frequently insert a "telling" sentence immediately after a "showing" sentence, untrusting of their own imagery. (e.g., *The shadows stretched long. It was getting late.*)
*   **The Breath/Pulse Tic:** An over-reliance on somatic clichés to convey emotion. *Breath hitched, released a breath she didn't know she was holding, heart pounded, pulse quickened.*

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Zero Loops:** The prose contains absolutely no adjacent restatements of information; every sentence advances the timeline or the understanding.
*   **Coherent Lens at Closure:** The final image physically enacts the story's change without needing to explain it (e.g., a character dropping a keepsake rather than thinking about letting go).
*   **High Information Density:** Sentences convey backstory, setting, and immediate action simultaneously without feeling crowded.

**Revision Levers & Keepers**
*   **Keep:**
    *   **Specific Nouns:** Retain objects like "sextant," "tuning fork," or "graphite" that anchor the world.
    *   **Action-Based Transitions:** Keep transitions that move characters through space rather than through "thinking" blocks.
    *   **Patterned Metaphors:** Protect extended metaphors that are set up early and paid off late (e.g., a weaving motif that ends with a cut thread).

*   **Change:**
    *   **Prune the Loops:** Ruthlessly cut the second sentence of any pair that restates the first. If sentence A says "It was cold," cut sentence B ("The temperature had dropped").
    *   **De-Stack Filters:** Ctrl+F for "felt," "heard," "saw," "realized." Delete the verb and the pronoun, leaving the direct sensory experience.
    *   **Break Template Runs:** If three sentences start with "He [verb]," combine two or invert the syntax of one to break the monotonous drumbeat.
