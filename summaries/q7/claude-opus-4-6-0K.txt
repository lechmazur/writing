**Executive Insight**
The defining characteristic of high-performing prose on this axis is **high information density coupled with rhythmic propulsion**. The strongest pieces do not merely “write well”; they demand that every sentence perform multiple jobs simultaneously—advancing character interiority, establishing world logic, and escalating narrative stakes in a single breath. Where the writing fails, it is rarely due to a lack of vocabulary, but rather a lack of trust in the image. This manifests as “paraphrase loops” (restating a concept immediately after showing it), “scaffolding” (explaining that a character is realizing something rather than showing the realization), or “synonym churn” (stacking adjectives to ensure the reader gets the point). Success requires a ruthless economy where lyricism serves as a structural load-bearing element, not decoration. Closure must land via a recharged image that resolves the narrative’s figurative logic without devolving into thematic summary.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Multi-Tasking Syntax:** The most effective lines carry heavy loads without buckling. A single sentence often establishes setting, metaphor, and character motivation.
    *   *Evidence:* “Roots threading through limestone like veins through a body that refused to die.”
*   **Coherent Figurative Systems:** Metaphors are not random; they are drawn from the specific lexicon of the POV character (e.g., a clockmaker uses mechanical metaphors; a botanist uses growth/decay imagery). This prevents “mixed metaphor muddle.”
    *   *Evidence:* “Mercy has a half-life,” “Silence pooling... like rainwater.”
*   **Rhythmic Control:** Paragraphs breathe. Long, cumulative sentences that mirror a character’s spiraling thoughts are punctuated by short, percussive declaratives that mark a decision or a shift in reality.
    *   *Evidence:* “The gears turned. The kaleidoscope rotated. The arrow tip scored.”
*   **Pattern-Taught Imagery:** High-band stories introduce a figurative concept early (e.g., light as liquid) and escalate it throughout the narrative, so the final image lands with earned resonance rather than confusion.

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Paraphrase Loops:** A persistent issue where a strong image is immediately followed by an explanatory sentence that restates the same idea in abstract terms. This kills momentum and triggers specific rubric penalties.
    *   *Signal:* “She felt a deep sense of loss. It was a hollowness that echoed inside her.” (The second sentence adds no new pressure).
*   **Scaffolding and Filter Verbs:** Over-reliance on "She realized," "He understood," or "She felt" creates distance between the reader and the sensory experience. This "scaffolding" clutters high-pressure beats.
*   **Register Drift:** Narratives that establish a grounded, sensory voice suddenly shifting into "therapy-speak" or academic abstraction during emotional peaks (e.g., labeling an emotion as “validating” or “processing” rather than embodying the sensation).
*   **Template Cadence:** Runs of sentences with identical syntactic structures (e.g., "He [verb], then he [verb]") that create a robotic drumbeat effect, flattening the reading experience.

**Performance Boundaries**
The line between a 7.5 and a 9.0 is often determined by **trust**. Lower-scoring entries do not trust the reader to understand the image, resulting in “overwriting” where metaphors are stacked three deep or explained after deployment. High-scoring entries trust the concrete detail to carry the emotional weight. The writing breaks when the author prioritizes "sounding literary" over narrative clarity, leading to "purple prose" that obscures cause and effect. It excels when the lyricism is strictly functional—when the specific description of a "broken Fresnel lens" is the *only* way to convey the character's fractured worldview.

**Signature Moves and Blind Spots**
*   **The "Recharged" Closer:** A signature of strong drafts is a final line that reuses a motif from the opening (e.g., a bell, a seed, a specific color) but changes its context to prove the character has changed.
*   **The Adjective Stack (Blind Spot):** Writers often stack modifiers ("the cold, grey, indifferent sea") in an attempt to add weight, creating "synonym churn" that dilutes power. One perfect noun is worth three adjectives.
*   **The "As If" Crutch:** A tendency to rely heavily on similes using "as if" or "like" to explain action, rather than using strong verbs to *make* the action metaphorical (e.g., "The wind screamed" vs. "The wind sounded like it was screaming").

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Zero Loops:** The prose contains absolutely no adjacent sentences that restate the same information. Every period marks a step forward in time or depth.
*   **Embodied Closure:** The story ends with a physical action or image that resolves the central tension, rather than a summary of what the character learned.
*   **Clean Peak Beats:** In the story’s most intense moments, the prose becomes leaner, shedding adjectives and filters to focus entirely on immediate sensory data and cause-and-effect.

**Revision Levers and Keepers**
*   **Keep:**
    *   **Specific Nouns:** Protect the technical vocabulary of the character’s world (e.g., *sextant, mycelium, Fresnel lens*). These anchor the voice.
    *   **Rhythmic Variety:** Maintain the mix of long, flowing sentences for introspection and short, sharp fragments for action.
    *   **Thematic Metaphors:** Keep figurative language that aligns with the story’s central logic (e.g., time as water, memory as stone).

*   **Change:**
    *   **Cut the Explanation:** Identify every instance of "She realized" or "He understood" and delete it. Let the observation stand alone.
    *   **Merge Loops:** Find every pair of sentences that say the same thing. Cut the weaker one or merge them into a single, high-density line.
    *   **Prune Modifiers:** Scan for adjective-noun-adjective constructions. Remove the modifiers and find a stronger noun or verb that carries the weight alone.
