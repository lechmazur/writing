Based on a review of the editorial comments using the Question 7 rubric, here is the synthesized brief on Prose & Line-Level Craft.

### 1. Executive Insight
The prose demonstrates a high aptitude for **information density** and **atmospheric propulsion**, frequently achieving a "Charged Poise" where sentences perform multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, and thematic layering) simultaneously. The dominant mode is lyrical and accumulative, excelling when figurative language is "pattern-taught"—introduced early and extended coherently—rather than stacked as decorative ornament. However, this ambitious density carries a specific risk profile: the writing occasionally stalls under the weight of **paraphrase loops** (restating an image or idea in adjacent sentences without added pressure) and **figurative saturation** in high-pressure beats. The text succeeds most when it trusts its concrete imagery to carry the emotional load; it falters when it resorts to **scaffolding** (explanatory bridges) or **synonym churn** to ensure the reader "gets it." When the line-level craft is disciplined—stripping away filter verbs and redundant restatements—the work routinely enters the highest bands of literary execution.

### 2. Strength Profile
*   **High Information Density:** Sentences are rarely singular in function; they typically fuse sensory detail with character motive or world logic.
    *   *Micro-quote:* "rusted ribs... like the bones of sleeping giants"
    *   *Micro-quote:* "hulls curving like parentheses"
*   **Coherent Figurative Systems:** Metaphors often extend a single physical logic (e.g., sound as water, light as weight) throughout a piece rather than mixing vehicles, creating a unified textural reality.
    *   *Micro-quote:* "petals drifting down like soft ammunition"
*   **Rhythmic Variation:** The prose generally passes the "read-aloud ear test," modulating between long, sinuous descriptions for atmosphere and short, percussive declaratives for action or realization.
*   **Textural Specificity:** The writing favors concrete nouns and strong verbs over generic descriptors, anchoring abstract concepts in physical objects.
    *   *Micro-quote:* "spine of volcanic glass"

### 3. Weakness Profile
*   **Paraphrase Loops:** A recurring tendency to state an idea and then immediately restate it with slight variation, stalling momentum (e.g., "The silence was heavy. It weighed on her like a stone."). This often triggers the **Loop/Scaffold Screen** penalty.
*   **Template Cadence Runs:** Sequences of three or more sentences with identical syntactic openings (e.g., "She [verb]... She [verb]... She [verb]..."). While sometimes intended as anaphora, these often read as mechanical drag in non-climactic beats.
*   **Overwriting in Peak Beats:** In moments of high emotional or plot pressure, the prose sometimes stacks multiple abstract metaphors (e.g., "luminous grief," "shivering bliss") rather than grounding the moment in concrete action, leading to **figurative muddle**.
*   **Scaffolding and Filter Verbs:** The use of explanatory phrases ("She understood then that...") or filter stacks ("She felt," "She saw") that distance the reader from the immediate experience, violating the immediacy requirement.
*   **Register Drift:** Occasional lapses into "therapy-speak" or abstract academic diction ("regenerative silence," "conceptual repricing") that clash with the established sensory POV.

### 4. Performance Boundaries
The writing excels when it operates in a mode of **concrete lyricism**—where every metaphor has a physical correlative in the scene. It breaks when it shifts into **abstract summarization**, trying to define the theme directly rather than letting it emerge from the imagery. The prose creates strong propulsion when sentence structures vary dynamically to match the scene's tempo; it flattens when it falls into algorithmic patterns or "list-like transitions." Crucially, the closure beats succeed when they resolve via a "recharged motif" (an image used earlier, now transformed) but fail when they rely on a summary statement or a stock emotional label.

### 5. Signature Moves and Blind Spots
*   **The "Not X, but Y" Construction:** A habit of defining things by negation (e.g., "It was not silence, but a living stillness"). This is effective sparingly but becomes a tic that creates drag when overused.
*   **The "Luminous" Crutch:** A reliance on words like "luminous," "hush," "amber," and "resounding" to elevate tone, which can lead to lexical monotony or "purple" drift if not anchored by grit.
*   **Echoing Openings:** A structural habit of mirroring the opening line’s rhythm or imagery in the final line. When successful, this provides resonance; when forced, it feels like a schematic container.
*   **Visual-Sonic Synesthesia:** A distinct strength in describing sound as texture or light as weight, though this sometimes risks mixed metaphors if not carefully managed.

### 6. High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)
*   **Zero Paraphrase Loops:** The text trusts the first iteration of an image or thought, moving immediately to the next beat without a "safety net" restatement.
*   **Pattern-Taught Figurative Language:** Complex metaphors (e.g., silence as a physical architecture) are introduced early and developed consistently, paying off in the climax without needing explanation.
*   **Pristine Closure Beat:** The final 10% of the story is free of artifacts (scaffolding, mixed metaphors, or clichéd phrasing), delivering a "clean" image that carries the thematic weight effortlessly.

### 7. Revision Levers and Keepers
**Keep:**
1.  **Multi-tasking Sentences:** Continue layering sensory detail with character interiority to maintain high information density.
2.  **Rhythmic Modulation:** Preserve the instinct to shorten sentences at moments of high tension or realization.
3.  **Coherent Metaphor Systems:** Maintain the discipline of extending a single figurative logic (e.g., botany, geology) through a piece.

**Change:**
1.  **Cut the Second Sentence:** Aggressively hunt for paraphrase loops. If sentence B merely restates sentence A in prettier words, cut B.
2.  **Exorcise Filter Verbs:** Scan for "felt," "saw," "heard," and "knew." Rewrite the sentence to make the sensation or observation the subject (e.g., change "She heard the wind howl" to "The wind howled").
3.  **Ground the Peak:** In the story's emotional climax, replace at least one abstract descriptor (e.g., "overwhelming joy") with a concrete physical action or object. Eliminate stacked metaphors in these critical beats to ensure clarity.
