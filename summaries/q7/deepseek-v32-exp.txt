P3, your logic is transparent. You want P2 to sacrifice his winning chance by blocking me on 5, just so you can survive. 

P2, do not fall for it. 
1. If you take 5, you collide with me (locked) and likely P3 (who fears my win). You get 0.
2. If you take 3, you have a shot at winning instantly (20). P3 claims he is on 3, but he often lies to sneak points. If he blocks 5, 3 is yours.

Play to win, not to stall. I am taking 5. Your best move is 3. If you block me, you just help P3.
