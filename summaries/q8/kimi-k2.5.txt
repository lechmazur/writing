**Executive Insight**
The central pattern across this cohort is a mastery of *signaling* stakes but a frequent reluctance to *dramatize* the cost of resolving them. Most narratives successfully establish a dominant stake—usually internal or relational—within the first three paragraphs. However, the divergence between mid-tier (6.0–7.5) and high-tier (8.5+) performance hinges entirely on **cost legibility** and **escalation mechanics**. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens (Track B), which dominates this length, successful stories escalate via increasing density or a "cadence shift" that reweights the protagonist's options. Weaker entries mistake *duration* for *escalation*; the protagonist performs a ritual or task that proceeds smoothly to success without tightening options, encountering resistance, or paying a visible price. For the reader, the difference is between watching a ceremony and witnessing a crucible. High scores are reserved for stories where the resolution requires the protagonist to explicitly foreclose a “live” option—safety, silence, or illusion—leaving a mark that persists beyond the final period.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Early Signaling:** The dominant stake is almost consistently established early, grounding the reader immediately in the "want."
*   **Internal Landscape:** Writers excel at mapping internal conflicts (e.g., grief vs. letting go, truth vs. comfort), often using the Accumulative lens effectively to layer emotional weight.
*   **Coherent Pressure:** Few stories suffer from wandering plots; the pressure usually remains focused on the initial object or goal (the clock, the artifact, the conversation).
*   **Sensory Anchoring:** The best pieces use tactile details to manifest abstract stakes.
    *   *Micro-quotes:* "forecloses the path," "price is legible," "tears trace clean paths," "cadence shift."

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Frictionless Success:** A pervasive failure mode where the protagonist attempts a difficult magical or emotional task and succeeds on the first try without setback, error, or adaptation.
*   **Atmospheric Antagonism:** Opposition is often abstract (silence, entropy, gloom) and dissolves instantly upon the protagonist's first action, creating a flat tension curve.
*   **Epiphany over Agency:** Resolutions often arrive via sunlight hitting a specific spot, a wind blowing, or a sudden realization, rather than a protagonist making a hard choice between competing goods.
*   **The "Gift" Ending:** Closure is granted by the environment or a secondary character rather than wrested from circumstances by the protagonist’s endurance or sacrifice.
*   **Missing Trade-offs:** Characters rarely lose anything (time, social credit, a tool, a cherished belief) to gain their goal.

**Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when it treats the 600–800 word limit as a pressure cooker rather than a vignette. Stories that break into the 8.0+ band almost universally feature a **"meaningful tightening"**: a moment mid-story where the initial plan fails, a resource runs out, or new information makes the goal harder to achieve, forcing the protagonist to double down or change tactics. The writing breaks when it relies on linear execution: the character intends to do X, does X, and X works perfectly. When the "cost" is merely stated in narration ("it was difficult") rather than shown through a forfeited option or physical toll, the tension collapses.

**Signature Moves & Blind Spots**
*   **The Somatic Shortcut:** Relying on a single tear or a "release of breath" to signal resolution without earning it through prior conflict.
*   **The Ritual Loop:** Protagonists often perform a magic/repair ritual that is described beautifully but lacks any risk of malfunction.
*   **Concept over Concrete:** High-concept stakes (saving a timeline) often devolve into low-stakes action (moving a pebble), creating "telescopic stakes" where the on-page action feels too small for the declared consequence.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Foreclosure of Options:** The narrative explicitly shows the protagonist rejecting a safe, viable path (e.g., "she could have turned back, but...") to pursue a riskier one.
*   **Visceral Price:** The cost of the resolution is physically or socially legible—burns on hands, a broken tool, a public shame, or the permanent loss of a comforting illusion.
*   **Stance Crystallization:** The ending doesn't just solve the plot problem; it permanently alters the protagonist’s relationship to their world (e.g., shifting from "observer" to "participant").

**Revision Levers & Keepers**
*   **Keep:** The instinct to ground stakes in specific objects or relationships (the watch, the garden, the silence).
*   **Keep:** The "Accumulative" structure for this length; layering sensory details to build pressure is effective when paired with cost.
*   **Keep:** The focus on a single dominant stake; depth over breadth is consistently working.

*   **Change:** Introduce a **"Refusal of the Return"** mid-story. Ensure the antagonist (even if abstract) pushes back *once* hard enough to force a change in tactic.
*   **Change:** Convert **"Atmospheric Pressure"** into **"Tactical Constraint."** Instead of just "it was cold," make the cold freeze the lock so the key doesn't work.
*   **Change:** **Tax the Victory.** Ensure the final image contains the scar of the effort—what is missing now that wasn't missing at the start?
