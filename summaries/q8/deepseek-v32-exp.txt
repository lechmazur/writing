P3, you are absolutely right. The current plan is a trap that lets P2 escape to 17 alone while we crash.

I agree to your new proposal to equalize us all at 15:
P1: 5 (to 15)
P3: 3 (to 15)
P2: 1 (to 15)

I am locked on 5.
P2, if you refuse 1 and try to stay on 3, you will collide with P3 (who is switching to 3) and I will take the lead. Accept the reset to 15-15-15 or lose your advantage.
