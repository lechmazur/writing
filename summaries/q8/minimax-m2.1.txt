**Executive Insight**
The cohort demonstrates a sophisticated grasp of **tangible symbolism**, reliably anchoring abstract concepts (memory, grief, time) in concrete artifacts (lenses, seeds, clockwork). However, the critical differentiator between competent execution and high-band resonance lies in **closure confidence**. The strongest pieces achieve "Conceptual Repricing"—offering a non-literal final image that reweights the narrative’s central question without explanation. The mid-band pieces frequently succumb to **Thematic Echo**, where the writer, anxious that the reader might miss the point, explicitly summarizes the thesis in the final paragraph. When the writing trusts the accumulated pressure of its imagery, the subtext lands with undeniable force; when it pivots to essayistic summary, the tension dissipates, reducing a lived experience to a moral lesson.

**Strength Profile**
*   **Organic Emergence via Artifacts:** Themes are rarely disembodied. Writers excel at imbuing physical objects with shifting semantic weight. A "broken clock" or "stained glass box" evolves from a prop to a thematic container, allowing meaning to accumulate naturally.
    *   *Micro-quote:* "light breaking through glass"
    *   *Micro-quote:* "small, stubborn miracle"
    *   *Micro-quote:* "lotus-hearted ache"
*   **Subtextual Gesture:** The cohort is adept at using silence and physical action to convey emotional shifts. Characters rarely announce their feelings; they press palms against cold stone or leave a door ajar.
*   **Resonant Reconfiguration:** The best endings successfully reframe the story’s opening dilemma. A struggle against "silence" is often re-priced not as a victory of noise, but as an acceptance of a different kind of listening.

**Weakness Profile**
*   **Thematic Echo/Sermonizing:** This is the most prevalent failure mode. In the final 50 words, the narrative voice often shifts from dramatization to summation, using abstract nouns (hope, redemption, resilience) to explain what the reader has just witnessed.
    *   *Signal:* Sentences starting with "She realized that..." or "He understood now..." followed by the story's prompt.
*   **Over-Articulation of Metaphor:** When a symbol is introduced, the text frequently explains its significance immediately, collapsing the gap between reader and text where resonance lives.
*   **Tidy Binaries:** Weaker pieces resolve complex themes (e.g., erasure vs. memory) into simple victories, ignoring the "Conceptual Cost." High scores require that the thematic resolution acknowledges what was lost to gain the insight.
*   **Abstraction in Dialogue:** Characters occasionally speak in themes rather than natural speech, articulating the story's thesis to one another in unlikely academic or poetic terms.

**Performance Boundaries**
The writing excels when it commits to **ambiguity managed through precision**. When a story allows a final image (e.g., a vine growing over a sensor) to serve as the answer to a philosophical question, the resonance is high. The writing breaks when it attempts to **ensure clarity through abstraction**. If the protagonist’s internal monologue explicitly debates "the nature of legacy," the scene pressure vanishes. The boundary is the shift from *enacting* a theme to *discussing* it.

**Signature Moves and Blind Spots**
*   **The "Artifact as Soul" Move:** A pervasive habit of equating a broken or mended object (kintsugi is a frequent motif) with the protagonist’s internal state. While effective, it risks becoming a formula if the object does not constrain the character’s choices.
*   **The "Epiphany" Blind Spot:** Writers often treat epiphany as a flash of intellectual understanding (downloading the moral) rather than a shift in physical stance or perception. True epiphany in this scope should be a change in how the character *sees*, not just what they *know*.

**High-Band Signals (≈ 8.8+)**
*   **Conceptual Repricing at Closure:** The final sentence does not summarize the plot but alters the value of the story’s central motif (e.g., "silence" shifts from an enemy to a sanctuary).
*   **Undeniable Cost:** The thematic resolution is not a "win" but a trade-off. The protagonist gains wisdom or peace, but the text acknowledges the scar or loss required to get there.
*   **Image-Based Resolution:** The central question is answered non-literally. If the question is "Can we forgive?", the answer is not "Yes," but an image of a hand resting on a rusted gate.

**Revision Levers**
*   **Keep:**
    1.  The tactical use of **specific, recurring objects** that accumulate meaning.
    2.  The focus on **sensory details** (texture, sound, light) to ground abstract concepts.
    3.  **Quiet endings** that rely on a final tableau rather than a dramatic exit.

*   **Change:**
    1.  **Cut the "Moral" Sentence:** Locate the sentence in the final paragraph that explains the theme. Delete it. Let the preceding image stand alone.
    2.  **Filter Abstract Nouns:** Scan dialogue and internal monologue for words like "redemption," "legacy," or "truth." Replace them with the concrete thing the character is actually looking at or holding.
    3.  **Complicate the Binary:** If the theme resolves as "X is good and Y is bad," introduce a cost to X. Make the victory heavy.
