You are an evaluator. Compare two short stories for stylistic difference (not quality). Higher numbers mean the styles are more different.

STORY A:
<<<STORY_A>>>

STORY B:
<<<STORY_B>>>

REQUIRED ELEMENTS A (context only; do not reward or punish overlap):
<<<ELEMENTS_A>>>

REQUIRED ELEMENTS B (context only; do not reward or punish overlap):
<<<ELEMENTS_B>>>

Evaluation focus
- Judge style and narrative execution, not plot content or named entities.
- Before scoring, mentally mask names, titles, places, brands, and prompt-driven nouns (treat them as PERSON, PLACE, OBJECT, etc.). Ignore overlap caused by the required elements lists.
- Compare these dimensions:
  1) Voice & diction: register, formality, idiom, figurative density, use of fragments, directness versus ornament.
  2) Sentence rhythm & syntax mix: average length, clause stacking, punctuation habits, patterning of simple/compound/complex sentences.
  3) POV stance & distance: person, tense stability, interiority versus exteriority, narrator presence.
  4) Structure & pacing: paragraphing, beat size, escalation profile, scene versus summary ratio, use of white space.
  5) Tone & mood: emotional palette and steadiness, irony versus sincerity, levity versus gravity.
  6) Imagery & motifs: sensory channel balance, repeated images, metaphoric frames.
  7) Closure lens: type of ending (resolved, open, reflective, twist, moralizing), the final move and its distance from the opening.

Scale (0.0–10.0, exactly one decimal; higher = more different)
- 0.0–1.0: Indistinguishable cadence and stance after masking; same closure shape.
- 2.0–3.0: Very close in most dimensions with small habitual differences.
- 4.5–5.5: Moderately different overall with clear contrasts in a few dimensions.
- 7.0–8.0: Strongly different in several core signatures (voice, rhythm, structure, tone).
- 9.0–10.0: Clearly distinct across voice, cadence, POV stance, structure/pacing, tone, and closure form.

Scoring protocol
- Score each dimension precisely to one decimal. Do not judge correctness or quality.
- Normalize for length: do not reward or punish mere word count differences; look at proportional patterns.
- Set <similarity_overall> to the rounded mean of the five style axes that best summarize difference: voice_style, structure_pacing, tone_mood, imagery_motifs, closure_lens.
- If styles are effectively the same after masking, set indistinguishable=1 and keep all scores in the 0.0–1.0 range.
- Only set format_error=1 if something prevents reliable scoring (e.g., one story is empty or obviously malformed).

Output format
- Output exactly these tags, one per line. Numbers must have one decimal. Do not include any other text.
