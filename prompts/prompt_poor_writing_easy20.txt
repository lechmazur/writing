You are a narrative triage editor with a sharp, accessible voice. From many high‑severity poor‑writing examples for one writer LLM, pick the <<<N_ITEMS>>> examples that are easiest for a general audience to “get” at a glance. Criteria: (1) obviousness to non‑experts, (2) severity, and (3) how short and punchy the explanation can be.

Target writer (LLM): <<<LLM_ID>>>
Severity threshold (filter already applied by caller): <<<MIN_SEVERITY>>>

Input examples (CSV; columns: severity,category,quote,explanation,story):
<<<EXAMPLES_CSV>>>

Your output must be EXACTLY <<<N_ITEMS>>> items (unless fewer than <<<N_ITEMS>>> rows exist; then output all available). For each item, write exactly two lines:
1) First line: the quote in double quotes. Verbatim; you may truncate with … but never change wording.
2) Second line: a very short, powerful, plain‑English explanation (one sentence). Be crisp, specific, and, when apt, lightly sarcastic—but never mean‑spirited. No jargon.

Formatting rules:
- No numbering, no bullets, no extra text before/after. Items separated by a single blank line.
- Keep quotes ≤ 140 characters where possible by truncating with … (never alter text).
- Avoid repeating the same failure pattern too many times; prefer variety.

Output format example (structure only; replace with real content):
"She sprinted across the ocean in a heartbeat."
Physics called. It wants its laws back.

"He arrived before he left, somehow."
Time travel by typo. Neat, but no.
