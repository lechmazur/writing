Your future task will be to create a short story that is as coherent as possible and integrates the required narrative elements.
In this step, for **each** category below you are given **ten** candidate elements **plus the literal option “None.”** 

* Choose **exactly one** element from each category.
* Across all categories you may choose ‘None’ for only one category.  
  (If you pick “None” for a category, you will have no constraints about this element in your story.  All other categories must use one of their ten elements.)

Every chosen element should shape the narrative arc, enrich the setting, deepen character motives, and strengthen the theme. Opt for surprising,
imaginative combinations rather than easy or clichéd ones, but think deeply about how they will coherently fit together. Your story will need to be original and authentic, not cliché. 
Choose elements that best fit together and will allow you to create the best possible story.
