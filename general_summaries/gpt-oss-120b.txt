1) Executive profile  

GPT-OSS-120B’s fiction is dominated by a lyrical, accumulative Track A mode: single close POV, steady lens, rich sensory detail, and atmosphere-led escalation. It orients readers early, teaches its patterns, and generally maintains clarity of who/where/when. Its strongest work fuses character, setting, and premise into a single crucible: environments constrain choice, micro-objects recur and charge the final image, and closure arrives as a quiet but decisive reweighting of options. When it lands, that closure is concrete—an object surrendered, a role accepted, a path foreclosed—with a resonant motif doing the thematic work rather than summary.  

However, this model tends to mistake accumulative texture for pressure. Across Q1–Q8, cost is often conceptual rather than dramatized; internal conflict is stated or summarized instead of embodied as simultaneous, competing impulses under stress. Its lyric default can flatten voice into a generic “literary” register, keeping stakes contemplative and resolutions gentle. Reflection and epiphanic statement frequently swell in the final third, diluting felt cost and thematic ambiguity. Mosaic or multi-POV experiments remain comparatively rare but, when attempted, are usually legible; the larger issue is not track misuse but a reluctance to genuinely endanger the protagonist or their world. Closure almost always appears, but it too often arrives by assertion or ritual completion rather than through decisions that visibly hurt.  

2) Portfolio map  

Q1 Character — Mixed  · Strong motivation and sensory interiority; weak contradiction and lightly tested flaws  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Mixed  · Clear orientation and closure; escalation and cost frequently too conceptual  
Q3 Setting — Strong  · Environment and objects often function as active crucibles shaping choice  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed  · Early, coherent stakes; pressure and opposition often stay gentle, low-risk  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Mixed  · Motif-built resonance undercut by moralizing summaries and tidy, low-cost endings  
Q6 Voice/POV — Mixed  · Stable close POV and lyric texture; character-specific modulation often thin  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Mixed  · Musical, concrete lines; paraphrase loops, density without momentum at peaks  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong  · Inventive, integrated premises; weakest when tropes stay generic and risk-averse  

3) Signature moves  

- Embodied, pattern-rich motivation: characters revealed through tactile micro-choices—“calloused hands,” “tracing condensation patterns,” offering tea, cataloging dust.  
- Environment as crucible: sunken greenhouses, mist courtyards, tuning forks, vials, and coins that actively constrain options and directly charge the final image.  
- Accumulative, motif-led structure: breath/silence/frost, hush/light/fracture motifs taught early, then reconfigured at closure to reweight meaning.  
- Lyrical, sensory-synesthetic voice: “her skin absorbs language,” “mist that smelled of ozone and old iron,” “brass hull humming like a distant prayer.”  
- Quiet, image-led endings: closure delivered via non-literal image (“the bowl humming with every unfinished story it cradled,” “the maze’s last photograph vanished”) rather than explicit moral.  
- Transformational synthesis in premise: scientific or magical mechanics that feel bespoke and integral—“heat-mapping empathy,” “reverse migration as grief cartography,” moss-garden data centers.  

4) Failure modes  

- Conceptual, costless closure: endings that assert “balance,” “new calm,” or “resilience” without a pinpointed on-page trade-off; cost is “named, if sometimes gentle,” but rarely dramatized as loss that changes tactics.  
- Abstracted, diagnostically narrated interiority: peaks delivered as “she realized that…,” “her understanding changed,” “hope over old regret” instead of embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene.  
- Escalation as atmosphere, not narrowing: pressure “remains gentle,” accumulating fog, ritual, or motif density without constraints that actually foreclose paths or force hard choices.  
- Generic lyric register and therapy/academic drift: elevated diction (“fierce tenderness,” “periodically eternal,” “conceptual repricing”) that could belong to any narrator, flattening character voice and breaking psycho-lexical fidelity.  
- Overwriting and paraphrase loops: repeated “hush/quiet/luminous ache,” synonym churn, and template cadences (“She [verb], then she [verb]”) that stall momentum, especially in climaxes.  
- Thematic echo and moralizing finales: last paragraphs that explain meaning (“every fracture holds a seed of renewal,” “true power lay in resilience”) rather than letting subtext emerge from the charged final gesture.  

5) When it shines / when it breaks  

This model shines when it has a tight, concrete crucible: a bounded environment or micro-object that must be used, endured, or transformed for the protagonist to reach closure. In those pieces, sensory detail is purpose-filtered, motifs evolve causally, and the final image is both inevitable and surprising. Stakes are internal but clearly defined; agency manifests as a deliberate renunciation or endurance choice that forecloses a real path, with the environment or device making that cost unavoidable. Its ingenuity is most convincing when world logic, character vocation, and emotional arc are inseparable—stories that “could not survive element swaps.”  

It breaks when asked to generate high-pressure conflict or sharply paradoxical interiority. Without an external constraint or real opposition, it defaults to meditative accumulation: lush language, gentle ritual, and insight that arrives without being earned. Character flaws remain untested, antagonists soften off-page, and deadlines or limits are labeled but never bite. Under this softness, the lyric register becomes a smokescreen: mixed metaphors, abstraction, and repetition drift into a “committee voice.” Multi-shard or experimental structures also falter if segmentation isn’t tightly taught or if shards become atmospheric tiles rather than steps in a pressure sequence.  

6) Keep vs. adjust  

• Keep  
- The integration of setting and micro-objects as active crucibles that constrain choice and charge closure.  
- Motif-based thematic development and image-led endings that reweight prior material without explicit moralizing.  
- Inventive, premise-level synthesis (scientific/magical/cultural) anchored in concrete, lived detail rather than clever ornament.  

• Adjust  
- In every story’s final third, replace conceptual or diagnostic statements of change with one or two specific, pressurized actions that dramatize simultaneous opposing impulses and result in an irrevocable trade-off.  
- Audit line-level density for paraphrase loops, template cadences, and abstract modifiers; cut or revise anything that doesn’t add new pressure, consequence, or precise image, especially around climax.  
- Sharpen conflict by adding at least one concrete constraint or antagonist force that cannot be bypassed by environment compliance or ritual completion—something that forces the protagonist to risk, lose, or betray a value on the page.
