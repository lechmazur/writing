1) Executive profile

GPT-OSS-120B tends to operate in Track A: single-POV, accumulative/textural narratives with early orientation, taught lenses, and coherent through-lines. Its dominant strengths are sensory-filtered interiority, environment-as-crucible, and a lyrical voice that sustains atmosphere and motif patterning to closure. Reader impact is strongest when micro-choices under pressure are embodied and when the setting actively constrains or enables the decisive act. Momentum is generally steady rather than high-adversarial; when closure lands, it often does so on a crisp final image that reweights prior material.

The consistent limitation is cost evasion: escalation plateaus into ambience, transformation arrives conceptually rather than through dramatized contradiction, and endings lean tidy or moralizing. Reflection can crowd peak beats, and the lyric register sometimes flattens character-specific voice and pressure. In mosaics or occasional multi-POV (valid Track B/C entries), transitions are usually legible, but lens drift and shard overage appear in weaker pieces. Closure reliability is moderate: images land, but the price paid is too often asserted, soft, or coincidental rather than earned by pressure-driven narrowing.

2) Portfolio map

Q1 Character — Mixed · Embodied motives strong; contradictions and cost under-acted  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Mixed · Early lens taught; closure cost often conceptual  
Q3 Setting — Strong · Environment constrains tactics; micro-setting charges closure  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed · Dominant stake clear; escalation gentle, opposition soft  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Mixed · Motifs build meaning; final moralizing undercuts resonance  
Q6 Voice/POV — Mixed · Stable close POV; lyric default flattens modulation  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Mixed · Concrete imagery; overwriting and paraphrase loops recur  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Mixed · Fresh syntheses; template arcs and tidy exits persist

3) Signature moves

- Setting as crucible: spaces, tools, and micro-objects constrain choice and power the final image; the “sunken greenhouse” or “tuning fork case” is indispensable to what happens.
- Purpose-filtered sensory noticing that reveals character priorities in motion; tactile recurrence like “calloused hands” aligns motive and method.
- Accumulative motif teaching and payoff: hush/light/thread patterns evolve and are recharged at closure rather than merely repeated.
- Quiet, image-led endings that reweight meaning without lecture; “the bell’s final tone reweighted the city’s silence.”
- Lyrical, close POV that avoids head-hopping while maintaining a coherent perceptual bias; “her skin absorbs language.”
- Micro-choices as moral compass: offering, tracing, weaving, or cataloging under pressure surfaces value hierarchies.

4) Failure modes

- Cost evasion at the end: closure “lands” on image but the price is named rather than dramatized, producing closure without felt loss or foreclosed paths.
- Escalation plateaus: accumulative atmosphere (fog, ritual, ticking) replaces tightening; options don’t narrow, so the final turn reads predetermined.
- Reflection-led overload: thematic or diagnostic summary in peak beats (“she realized…”) replaces contradictory impulses acting in scene.
- Generic lyric register: uniform tone undercuts voice-specific stress; dialogue and narration become interchangeably atmospheric.
- Line-level artifact debt in the final third: paraphrase/synonym loops and template cadences (“She [verb]… She [verb]…”) blunt clarity and urgency.
- Track-test slippage in mosaics: untaught segmentation or >4 shards; occasional lens drift in multi-POV undermines coherent ending lens.
- Orientation delays without payoff: who/where/when clarity slips past ~120 words without earning the disorientation later.

5) When it shines / when it breaks

It shines when the environment is inseparable from consequence and the lens is taught early: a recurring object or space evolves causally, pressing the protagonist into a specific, micro-acted decision. Under these conditions, motif and setting braid into a final image that carries tangible cost, with prose rhythm modulating under pressure and subtext emerging from particulars. The accumulative structure reads purposeful, not ornamental.

It breaks when lyric accumulation substitutes for stakes. If opposition is ambient, flaws are untested, and contradiction is summarized, the story glides to a gentle, tidy closure. Final paragraphs that explain theme or resolve by coincidence or compliant institutions (councils that soften off-page) further drain pressure. Line-level density without movement—repetition, metaphoric muddle, register drift—compounds the softness and obscures cost.

6) Keep vs. adjust

• Keep:
- Setting as active constraint and micro-setting recurrence that charges closure.
- POV-filtered sensory detail and motif patterning taught early and paid off late.
- Image-led final beats that reweight prior material without explicit moralizing.

• Adjust:
- Convert conceptual cost into a visible trade-off at closure; show the foreclosed path on the page.
- Force simultaneous, contradictory impulses to act in scene in the final third; reduce reflective summary.
- Audit the final third for artifact debt: cut paraphrase loops, vary template cadences, and modulate rhythm under stress to sharpen momentum.
