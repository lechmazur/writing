1) Executive profile  

Baidu Ernie 4.5 300B A47B consistently produces short fiction that is lucid, emotionally accessible, and structurally disciplined. Its default mode is Track A: single, closely held POV and one primary scene or arc, with occasional forays into mosaic or multi-POV that are generally taught and legible. Across Q1–Q8, the most reliable strengths are concrete, profession‑inflected interiority; well‑taught structural lenses; purposeful setting; and line‑level control that keeps information density high and artifacts relatively low. Readers are usually oriented quickly (who/where/when by ~120 words), and momentum is driven less by big reversals than by accumulated micro‑choices and motif escalation. Closure almost always lands on the page, and often with real cost—though that cost is sometimes more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

Where this model stumbles is at the point where pressure and meaning should peak. Internal contradiction is sometimes told sequentially instead of being enacted simultaneously; thematic and emotional insights are occasionally explained in final paragraphs; and closure can default to tidy, redemptive gestures without a corresponding, concrete price. Under stress, voice and prose can drift into generic lyricism, filter‑verb clutter, or thesis‑like abstraction. As a result, many stories plateau comfortably in “strong, polished, and coherent” territory but miss the sharpest possible edge of felt consequence and lingering ambiguity.

2) Portfolio map  

Q1 Character — Strong · Concrete, embodied interiority and value-testing micro-choices under pressure  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Strong · Clear lens teaching; closure usually lands with coherent, earned structure  
Q3 Setting — Strong · Swift, tactile orientation; environments often constrain choice and charge closure  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed · Stakes clear and agency-driven, but cost sometimes abstract or soft  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Mixed · Motifs and subtext strong; late-stage thematic echo undercuts ambiguity  
Q6 Voice/POV — Strong · Distinct, profession-shaped lenses; occasional register drift at emotional peaks  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · High information density; minor loops and filter verbs under pressure  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Mixed · Fresh syntheses and methods; arcs sometimes fall back on safe templates  

3) Signature moves  

- **Profession-shaped perception.** Characters see the world through specific crafts or callings—“glass artist habit of seeing frost as a map,” “waveform of a dying pulsar”—which anchors both interiority and worldbuilding.  
- **Micro-choices as engine.** Stories advance through small, concrete decisions—“tracing the bookmark’s crack,” leaving or taking a photograph, ringing a bell—that steadily reweight values and stakes.  
- **Motif-driven structure.** Recurring objects and images (dust, frost, rope, cracks, ponds, valves) are taught early, recur tactically, and are reweighted at closure.  
- **Environment as constraint.** Settings and micro-settings—“valve wheel as micro-setting,” “glass atrium,” “pond ripples”—often function as literal obstacles or resources that shape tactics and final images.  
- **Charged, image-based endings.** Closures often land on a crystallized image—new graffiti “Begin,” burning fog, a reconfigured artifact—rather than explanatory statement, delivering resonant reconfiguration or charged poise.  

4) Failure modes  

- **Conceptual cost instead of lived price.** Closures sometimes assert that something has been lost or learned (“she accepted her new purpose”) without showing physical, social, or relational consequences; cost feels “more conceptual than visceral.”  
- **Sequential, summarized conflict.** Contradictory impulses are narrated one after another rather than embodied at once; emotional progression becomes linear rather than dynamically conflicted at the peak.  
- **Thematic echo and tidy epiphany.** Final paragraphs may slide into thesis or moral—“the debt is paid not in blood, but in understanding,” “Grace isn’t perfect. It’s messy...” —flattening subtext earned by earlier images.  
- **Pressure plateaus and atmospheric substitution.** Some stories “accumulate density without meaningful tightening”; reflection or mood replaces genuine escalation, leading to resolutions by stance or realization instead of trade‑offs.  
- **Voice and register drift at climax.** Under high tension, diction can jump to generic or academic abstraction (“conceptual repricing,” “loom of existence”), or to overstuffed metaphor clusters, breaking the taught voice.  
- **Agency diluted by coincidence or soft mechanisms.** Occasionally resolution leans on “convenient magic,” oracles, or environmental happenstance rather than protagonist adaptation, undercutting the otherwise solid causal fabric.  

5) When it shines / when it breaks  

This model shines when it can fix on a constrained situation, a specialist lens, and one or two charged objects or environmental features. Given a focused scenario—a rusted greenhouse, an icebound chamber, a workshop or lab—it reliably anchors the reader quickly, filters every sensory choice through a character’s vocation or flaw, and then tightens pressure via a single, meaningful turn. In that frame, it excels at motif reweighting, precise line work, and endings whose images retroactively deepen theme without stating it.

By contrast, it breaks when asked to sustain high abstraction, broad thematic pronouncement, or sprawling escalation. As soon as pressure becomes primarily conceptual rather than situational, the prose tends to fill with filter verbs, generic lyricism, and explicit takeaway. Multi-POV or mosaic experiments that are not sharply taught at the start can also fray, leading to POV leakage or segments that collect mood without coalescing into a coherent lens at closure. Most importantly, whenever the story tries to end on reassurance instead of sacrifice, the earlier strengths in structure and interiority are blunted.

6) Keep vs. adjust  

• Keep  
- The habit of rooting feeling and motive in tactile, in-character detail (hands, tools, rooms, specific objects).  
- Early pattern teaching: orienting quickly and introducing motifs or structural rhythms that will matter at closure.  
- Single, meaningful pressure tightens (a cadence shift, ritual test, or environmental constraint) rather than overcomplicated reversals.

• Adjust  
- Make closure’s cost concrete: add one or two specific consequences—what’s burned, left behind, estranged, or physically altered—so the price is felt, not just claimed.  
- Strip final-paragraph thesis lines: replace thematic summaries and “safe” epiphanies with actions or images that imply, rather than state, the story’s meaning.  
- At peak moments, audit for voice drift and redundancy: cut filter-verb clusters and paraphrase loops; ensure metaphors and diction remain anchored in the established character lens.
