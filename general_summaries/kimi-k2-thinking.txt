1) **Executive profile**

Across these eight questions, Kimi K2 Thinking tends to operate in Track A (single-POV, single-scene) with periodic, controlled forays into Track B mosaics. Its strongest work feels like a dense crucible: one character, one vocation, one charged object, one pressured space. Within that constraint, it can deliver high information density, vivid micro-settings, and closure that reweights earlier particulars. The preferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural rather than incident-heavy Causal: motifs and sensory patterns build until a small but irreversible act locks in the ending.

Reader impact is usually high on clarity and atmosphere: orientation is often established within the first 30–60 words, spatial choreography stays legible, and the world feels specific. Momentum, however, is vulnerable to decorative drag and frictionless execution; conflict can glide along pre-cleared rails, with rituals or magic working perfectly on first try. Felt cost and resonance are at their best when the story lands on Earned Stasis or Renunciation—endings where the protagonist carries on under altered terms—but too often the final beats drift into diagnostic labels and “He realized that…” epiphanies that summarize rather than dramatize change.

Track usage is generally disciplined: multi-POV and mosaic attempts are rare and, when present, are cleanly segmented with a coherent lens through closure. Reflection-led passages can exceed the normal allowance but are often anchored in tactile ritual and micro-choices, so long as the line doesn’t slip into essay-voice. Closure usually lands in a legible way; the key variability is *cost*: high-band pieces show tangible forfeiture, while mid-band ones default to soft, symmetric satisfaction where everything is gained and nothing is lost.

2) **Portfolio map**

Q1 Character — Mixed  · Rich vocational interiority, but epiphany labels and frictionless competence recur  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Mixed · Strong orientation and objects, weaker on cost and earned causality  
Q3 Setting — Strong · Micro-settings constrain tactics; atmosphere often operational, not just decorative  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed · Clear stakes; resistance, trade-offs, and adaptive antagonism often underpowered  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Mixed · Potent object-metaphors, but frequent “He realized…” moralizing at closure  
Q6 Voice/POV — Strong · Stable POV with vivid perceptual signatures and rhythmic modulation  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · High-density, multi-tasking lines; main drag is repetition and template cadence  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong · Irreplaceable mechanics and objects; arcs sometimes default to safe templates  

3) **Signature moves**

- **Occupational lenses as worldview.** Characters interpret everything through their craft—“reading dust the way others read books,” “decay curves” for an astrophysicist, an undertaker whose “hands were permanent wrinkles of silt and sorrow.”
- **Object-as-soul mechanics.** Shards, valves, shells, gears, “a beaded valve wheel,” “map settled into skin” operate simultaneously as tools, constraints, and emotional metaphors.
- **Accumulative pressure via motif.** Recurring patterns—hush, static, frost, roots, dust—are taught early and reappear re-weighted at closure, enabling low-incident stories to feel tense and coherent.
- **Micro-setting crucibles.** Tight spaces or single objects—a “frozen gauge,” “cracked porcelain box,” a humming wire—become the entire stage, dictating tactics and charging final images.
- **Costly endurance endings.** Earned Stasis/Renunciation beats where problems aren’t solved but borne differently: “refusal to sign,” “abandoning the shell,” “leaving the bowl behind.”
- **Multi-tasking lyric lines.** Sentences that carry world, emotion, and stakes at once: “roots gripped stone like desperate fingers”; “brass teeth glinting like frozen starlight.”

4) **Failure modes**

- **Diagnostic epiphanies at the peak.** Climaxes turn into therapy-report abstractions—“she processed his grief,” “She understood now that vulnerability was her greatest strength”—short-circuiting the earned subtext.
- **Frictionless competence and ritual glide.** Protagonists execute plans or rituals that work on the first attempt (“the crystal glowed immediately,” the ghost simply accepts the offering), with no tactical pivot or tool failure.
- **Costless or abstract closure.** Endings that assert “she felt lighter” or “the weight of centuries lifted” without on-page forfeiture—no broken tool, lost relationship, or foreclosed path—yield soft-reset arcs.
- **Postcard/backdrop settings.** Lush but inert imagery (“bruised purple sky,” “luminescent moss,” “humming crystals”) that doesn’t alter movement or choice; protagonists could be anywhere.
- **Template lyricism and phrase churn.** Overused constructions (“luminous,” “hush,” “pane of hush,” “nested patterns,” “quiet blaze”) and paraphrase loops that restate the same idea, especially damaging in the final paragraph.
- **Theme explained instead of embodied.** Thematic Echo and sermonizing endings where a narrator or character spells out the moral in balanced aphorisms (“Not X, but Y”) rather than trusting the final image.

5) **When it shines / when it breaks**

It shines when the story is tightly scoped around a vocation and a charged object in a constrained environment. Under those conditions, POV-specific noticing, tactile ritual, and accumulative motifs naturally braid plot, theme, and character. If the invented mechanic genuinely constrains what’s possible—light that must be tuned, silence that must be mapped, a rusted lever that demands bodily risk—then conflict tightens, cost becomes legible, and closure can land as a non-literal but unmistakable answer to the story’s thematic question.

It breaks when the prose is asked to carry theme directly, or when the premise’s strangeness is treated as atmosphere instead of engine. As stakes rise, the voice can float into abstract labels and “He realized…” statements, antagonistic forces stay passive, and the magic system offers convenient solutions rather than hard choices. In those moments, richly original worlds end up propping up familiar, low-risk arcs—solitary guardians finding meaning, artisans healing grief—whose outcomes would barely change in a mundane setting.

6) **Keep vs. adjust**

**Keep**

- **Occupational texture and moralized tools.** Filtering perception and mechanics through concrete work (clockmaking, glassblowing, archiving) yields distinctive voice and originality; keep building systems from what characters *do with their hands*.
- **Tactile anchors and micro-settings.** Objects and tight spaces that constrain tactics—valve wheels, frozen gauges, shells, rusted levers—are central to your best setting, plot, and thematic work.
- **Earned, image-led closure.** Endings where a physical act (“burning the ledger,” “dropping a compass,” “map settled into skin”) proves inner change without explicit moralizing are consistently your most resonant.

**Adjust**

- **Replace realization-talk with proof-actions.** Systematically excise “realized/understood/felt/knew” at climaxes, and substitute one irreversible micro-choice (unlocking and leaving the door open, snapping the crozier, swallowing the crystal) that *enacts* the insight.
- **Sharpen and physicalize cost.** For each story, articulate what the protagonist tangibly loses—object, status, safety, comforting belief—and ensure that loss is visible in the final third. Abstract “weight lifting” should be matched by a broken tool, altered body, or closed path.
- **Let the weirdness bite.** Pressure-test arcs so that invented mechanics and settings *force* non-obvious, high-friction choices. If the current resolution would still work in a realistic world, revise until the world’s specific rules and constraints make a different, riskier outcome inevitable.
