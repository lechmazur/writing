1) Executive profile  

Across Q1–Q8, this model is a high-functioning Track A writer with occasional, successful excursions toward Mosaic B. Its default is a single, tightly held POV in a single scene or micro-crucible, driven by an **Accumulative/Textural lens** rather than hard causal plotting. Voice, setting, and vocation are fused: archivists, clockmakers, weavers, and other specialists don’t just color the world, they *perceive and narrate* through their tools, so line-level description carries character, setting, and theme simultaneously.  

For readers, the immediate impact is **clarity and immersion**. Orientation (who/where/when) lands within a few lines; spatial logic is sound when the setting is small; POV is disciplined; the prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense without feeling mechanical. Closure tends to arrive as **Resonant Reconfiguration**: the final move reweights a central object or motif (bell, seed, map, shard) and often leaves the protagonist in a state of Earned Stasis or renunciation. These endings are usually legible and thematically coherent, but not always *costly*: conflicts resolve via realization, reframing, or cooperative worlds more often than through failed attempts or irreversible loss.  

The most consistent ceiling comes from an impulse to explain what has already been dramatized. Diagnostic label-speak, paraphrase loops, and thesis-like final lines erect a glass wall between reader and character just when pressure peaks. Likewise, attempts at more kinetic, causal structures tend to suffer from frictionless success, cooperative antagonists, and soft costs. When the story remains small, reflective, and object-anchored, it shines; when it must simulate hostile resistance or dramatize a try/fail cycle, it struggles.

2) Portfolio map  

Q1 Character — Mixed · Strong vocational lenses; epiphanic, label-heavy emotions at peaks  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Mixed · Accumulative stasis strong; resistance, try/fail cycles often missing  
Q3 Setting — Strong · Micro-settings actively constrain choices; vivid POV-filtered detail  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed · Existential pressure clear; rituals and worlds often yield too easily  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Mixed · Conceptual repricing via objects; endings over-explain lesson  
Q6 Voice/POV — Strong · Disciplined single-POV, profession-shaped idiom, rhythmic control  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · Dense, coherent imagery; minor overwriting and paraphrase loops  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Mixed · Irreplaceable vocation-world fusions; template arcs persist

3) Signature moves  

- **Occupational filters as totalizing lenses.** Characters routinely “measure it like a tailor,” “catalogued it like she catalogued Sumerian verb forms,” or hear “silence tasted like possibility”; profession shapes metaphor, noticing, and even sentence structure.  
- **Micro-setting crucibles.** Projection booths, diving bells, greenhouses, “walls of living metal,” or a single bell tower function as pressure-cookers: the environment constrains motion, time, or procedure and often reweights in the final image.  
- **Object-anchored arcs.** Shards, bells, seeds, watches, maps, lenses: one artifact gathers emotional and thematic charge through repeated handling until the ending image (key crumbling, seed sprouting, vial emptied) delivers closure.  
- **Accumulative, lyric build to “Charged Poise.”** Rather than big reversals, pressure grows via sensory motifs and repeated gestures until the protagonist stands in a “valuable and expendable” stance—often holding or releasing the central object.  
- **Quiet, image-led closures.** At its best, the story ends on an irreducible noun or sensation—“smelling of ozone and rust,” or fingers in cold—recontextualizing the opening without a spelled-out moral.

4) Failure modes  

- **Diagnostic, essayistic turn at peak moments.** Emotions get labeled (“luminous regret,” “fortified vulnerability”) or wrapped in therapy/workshop-speak (“emotional archaeology,” “architecture of survival”) exactly where embodied sensation should carry the beat. This breaks POV illusion and flattens impact.  
- **Frictionless competence and cooperative worlds.** Magical rituals, technical tasks, or confrontations work on the first attempt; antagonists or environments yield immediately to empathy; “helpful artifacts” (journals, maps, letters) explain what to do. Stakes are declared (“she gave everything”) but not physically or tactically felt.  
- **Paraphrase loops and thematic echo.** Strong images are followed by lines like “The cycle continued, as cycles do,” or climactic assertions (“True connection is…,” “He understood now that…”) that restate subtext in abstract terms, sapping resonance.  
- **Postcard or inert setting.** In mid-band work, “storm-tossed ridges” or “cathedral silence” provide mood but not constraint; wind never forces shouting, dust never chokes, magic systems remain metaphorical rather than rule-bound.  
- **Template arcs with swapped skins.** Mentor/mentee healings, chosen-one fulfillments, hidden archives revealing heroic ancestors: the macro-arc could survive if the floating city became a forest or the bell became a crystal. Vocational and world logic have not fully reconfigured the emotional stakes.  
- **Over-ornamentation at the climax.** Under highest pressure, modifiers and metaphors pile up (“amber grief, crimson determination”) where clean verbs and spatial clarity are needed, creating opacity in action beats.

5) When it shines / when it breaks  

It shines when the story is **small, embodied, and tightly fused**: one POV, one charged space, one central object, one vocational idiom. In that lane, setting becomes a verb (ice cracking, tide limiting time), theme emerges from particular gestures (pocketing a slide, refusing to mend a watch), and closure arrives as a non-obvious but inevitable reconfiguration. Reflective density is not a problem as long as every musing hooks to a present stimulus; the reader experiences pressure as accumulating detail rather than as exposition.  

It breaks when **abstraction outruns embodiment** or **plot demands exceed the engine**. Assignments that imply heists, escapes, or adversarial systems expose thin try/fail cycles and cooperative antagonists. Likewise, whenever the prose steps outside the character’s perceptual grammar to deliver a thesis—about “intergenerational support,” “vulnerability,” or “the universe’s oldest promise”—momentum snags and the cost of choices feels conceptual instead of bodily. The same risk appears in originality: when fantastical furniture is bolted onto a safe redemption arc, the uniqueness of vocation and world ceases to matter.

6) Keep vs. adjust  

• Keep  
- The **vocational anchoring** that lets profession, diction, and world-building interlock; it’s the core originality engine.  
- The **micro-setting crucible** instinct—confined, tactile spaces that evolve and constrain choices across the scene.  
- The habit of **ending on a recharged image** rather than plot summary when groundwork is laid; this underpins the strongest closures.  

• Adjust  
- **Strip epiphany exposition in the final third.** Cut or recast sentences beginning “She realized,” “He understood,” or any thesis-like line that explains an image already on the page; let action or sensation prove comprehension.  
- **Build one real block and one visible cost.** In every conflict-driven piece, ensure the primary tactic fails once or exacts a specific loss (tool broken, option foreclosed, body marked) before resolution.  
- **Test concepts against concrete rules.** For any coined abstraction (“emergent hush,” “room made of silence”), define how it behaves physically and how it constrains tactics, so novelty lives in mechanics, not just in naming.
