1) Executive profile

Kimi K2’s dominant strengths span embodied interiority, tight voice control, and accumulative patterning that guides readers toward earned, on-page closure. Most pieces operate in Track A defaults—single-POV, present-anchored, with one primary pressure—while occasional mosaics or split structures are taught early and resolve cleanly under a coherent lens. Character is consistently dramatized through tactile perception and micro-choices; voice and rhythm modulate with pressure; setting often acts as a live constraint rather than backdrop; and closure typically reweights the central motif with visible cost. The line-level carries high information density without loops or scaffold, and originality tends to arise from object-driven conceits where world, character, and stakes interlock.

Limitations recur at the pressure crest: abstracted label-speak or moralizing edges into peak beats; figurative density spikes into overwriting; escalation can plateau under atmospheric accumulation; orientation sometimes arrives after ~120 words; and a minority of closures gesture at conceptual “repricing” without making the price materially legible. Drive-lens drift—late rule-changes or wobbling between causal and textural modes—occasionally softens momentum. Even with these lapses, closure usually lands; when it misses, the cause is consistent: cost implied rather than shown, or a final image that re-states rather than reconfigures.

2) Portfolio map

Q1 Character — Strong · Embodied micro-choices under pressure; cost on-page at closure  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Mixed · Lens wobble/orientation debt; cost sometimes stated not shown  
Q3 Setting — Strong · Environment constrains tactics and charges the final image  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed · Mid-section plateaus; occasional passive agency and diffuse cost  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Strong · Motif-driven emergence; non-literal closure avoids thesis statements  
Q6 Voice/POV — Strong · Distinct, pressure-responsive voice; clean single-POV stability  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · High-density, multi-job lines; minimal loops or scaffold  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong · Object-engineered conceits with earned, pattern-taught turns

3) Signature moves

- Embodied perception as engine: sensory specifics anchor motive and choice (“salt-blistered tongue”).  
- Accumulative ritual/motif builds to “Closure as Charged Poise,” with cost crystallized in image.  
- Objects as micro-settings: a lens, coin, or seed that constrains tactics and reweights closure.  
- Voice-world mesh: professional/cultural lexicon filters noticing and rhythm under pressure.  
- High-density line craft: “each sentence layers image and stakes” while advancing momentum.  
- Thematic reconfiguration via final image, not thesis—non-literal repricing of a taught motif.

4) Failure modes

- Orientation debt past ~120 words: who/where/when unclear until after action begins.  
- Drive-lens wobble or late rule-change: accumulative logic undercut by new mechanics near closure.  
- Closure without cost: conceptual “repricing” or uplift not paid for on the page.  
- Escalation plateaus: atmospheric deepening replaces a decisive tightening beat or obstacle.  
- Register drift at peak: therapy-speak or abstract diction leaks into crisis beats.  
- Figurative saturation: stacked metaphors in high-pressure passages blur causality and pace.  
- Template stems/loops: repeated openings or filter verbs flatten immediacy in the middle third.  
- Occasional thematic echo: a final aphoristic line edges toward moralizing, dulling subtext.

5) When it shines / when it breaks

It shines when one dominant pressure is declared early, the environment or object constrains tactics, and accumulative patterning narrows options toward an on-page, irreversible choice. Voice remains character-bound under stress; motifs recur with evolution; and the final image both closes the live problem and reweights the central motif—cost legible in a sentence or gesture.

It breaks when the story hesitates to dramatize the price: reflection replaces action at the crest, or a late mechanic undercuts the taught lens. Orientation lags without payoff, escalation stalls in “gentle stasis,” or figurative density spikes without pattern or purpose. Theme slips into thesis, and the ending reframes feeling without foreclosing an option.

6) Keep vs. adjust

• Keep:
- Embodied, micro-choice-driven interiority that reveals evolving value hierarchies under pressure.
- Patterned motif/ritual design that teaches the reader how the story will pay off.
- Pressure-responsive rhythm and clean POV containment that preserve momentum and clarity.

• Adjust:
- Make cost legible on the page at closure: add a concrete forfeiture, scar, or broken bond.  
- Audit lens consistency by midpoint; remove late-arriving rules or mechanics that weren’t taught.  
- Trim peak-density figurative stacks; swap abstract/label phrasing for character-specific action or image.
