1) Executive profile  
Across Q1–Q8, this model’s fiction is defined by tightly held single-POV work in Track A, with rare but coherent forays into Mosaic structures. Its clearest strengths lie in accumulative/textural drive, micro-setting usage, and vocation-inflected voice. Most stories orient the reader quickly, maintain POV stability, and land some form of Earned Stasis or Conceptual Repricing at closure. Readers are usually held by atmosphere, specificity, and voice clarity.

Momentum is quieter than plot-driven; pressure rises by density of detail and narrowing options rather than big reversals. When it works, a single object or constraint (a clock, a shard of glass, a tide, a freezing room) intensifies until it forces a revised stance. Closure is typically legible and image-driven, but not always costly enough. The largest systemic limitation is “cost evasion”: realizations and victories often arrive with insufficient on-page sacrifice, leaving the emotional impact softer than the setup promises.  

The drive lens is consistently reflective and interior, but anchored in the present more often than not via tools, trades, and tactile rituals. Reflection-led mode is frequent yet usually controlled; issues arise when essayistic drift or diagnostic label-speak displace embodied micro-choices. As a result, reader resonance is high at the level of mood and theme, but can flatten at the climactic beat when conflict, cost, or antagonist presence remains under-dramatized.

2) Portfolio map  
Q1 Character — Mixed · Vivid vocational interiority, but epiphanies too often frictionless  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Mixed · Strong accumulative structure; weak causal cost and convenience issues  
Q3 Setting — Strong · Micro-settings and charged objects shape closure and atmosphere  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Fragile · Declared stakes outstrip dramatized resistance and embodied price  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Mixed · Powerful image-driven themes undercut by sermonizing final sentences  
Q6 Voice/POV — Strong · Stable, vocation-rooted voice with clean free indirect style  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Mixed · High-density, rhythmic prose marred by paraphrase loops, abstractions  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Mixed · Specific, tactile premises but “therapeutic template” arcs blunt novelty  

3) Signature moves  
* Occupational interiority as engine: glaziers, archivists, engineers, cartographers whose technical gaze filters everything—“vocation as psychology” in practice.  
* Micro-setting crucibles: a bench, a tower, a single lens or tool becomes the whole arena, fulfilling constraint and allowing the environment to press on choice.  
* Charged-object closures: returning to a seed, shard, watch, or pendant at the end to reweight meaning and deliver Conceptual Repricing (“silence could sing,” “gardens remember”).  
* Accumulative “stance crystallization”: one meaningful deepening instead of three-act plotting—pressure spirals around a motif until a single renunciation or endurance choice locks in.  
* Trade-based metaphor systems: coherent figurative palettes—“scars mapping... like river tributaries,” “silence as architecture,” “smell of iron and antiquity.”  
* The melancholy expert-witness: “lonely archivist” / “expert-poet” focalizers who observe and record, linking internal states to external textures with subtext carried in what’s unsaid.  

4) Failure modes  
* Costless epiphany endings: “She realized that...” / “He understood now...” closures that assert growth without a foreclosed option, broken tool, damaged relationship, or visible sacrifice.  
* Frictionless competence and cooperative worlds: rituals, repairs, and conversations that succeed on first try; magic or environment rearranging to help instead of resisting, failing the Cost Proof and Transformation tests.  
* Atmosphere without tactical constraint: lush “mist-clad,” “twilight hush,” or surreal libraries that never force new tactics—setting as mood-board rather than obstacle or tool.  
* Summary and essayistic drift: key struggles glossed in “Over the following months” or abstract paragraphs on “memory,” “time,” or “truth” that decouple from present-scene pressure.  
* Paraphrase loops and scaffolding: strong images immediately “double-tapped” by explanation (“Double-Tap Description”), filter-verb stacking (“she felt,” “she saw,” “she realized”) that dilute immediacy and rhythm.  
* Template arcs and stock devices: “therapeutic” grief-recovery journeys, “Library of Lost Things,” “Wise Grandmother” mentors delivering morals, speculative conceits that could be swapped out with no plot impact.  

5) When it shines / when it breaks  
It shines whenever the story is confined: single-POV, one pressured space, one tool or rule that matters. Under those conditions, the model’s strengths—micro-setting, occupational voice, accumulative drive—align. The environment constrains behavior, metaphors stay disciplined, and closure returns to a charged object with a fresh inflection that feels inevitable. When resistances are small but honest (cold slowing fingers, a time limit, a broken part), the fiction can deliver quietly devastating Earned Stasis or renunciation with real weight.

It breaks when the frame widens in time or concept without adding commensurate resistance. Mosaic attempts that span seasons, broad fantasy landscapes, or high-concept magical spaces tend to devolve into “static beauty” and essayistic reflection. Stakes are declared large but enacted as smooth procedures. The narrator, worried the reader might miss the point, starts sermonizing; magic resolves rather than complicates; antagonism is diffuse (“the Council,” entropy) instead of embodied. The result is work that sounds polished and strange but lands emotionally mild.

6) Keep vs. adjust  

• Keep  
- Trade-bound perception: continue filtering every sensory choice and metaphor through the character’s vocation; it’s the core of the voice.  
- Micro-setting focus and charged final images: the habit of letting one object or space do heavy lifting for constraint and closure.  
- Accumulative, image-first thematics: trusting recurring motifs and concrete gestures (“gardens remember,” “silence could sing”) to carry theme without overt signposting—at least until the final paragraph.  

• Adjust  
- Enforce cost on climax: in revisions, ask what concrete thing is lost or foreclosed at the ending—a tool, safety, relationship, self-image—and put that loss on the page.  
- Strip interpretive scaffolding: cut “realized/understood/knew” sentences and paraphrase echoes, especially near climaxes; let the image or action stand unglossed.  
- Make setting and magic push back: for every speculative or atmospheric element, define one rule that actively obstructs the protagonist’s plan and forces a tactical adjustment rather than smoothing the path.
