1) Executive profile  

Mistral Large 3 tends toward **single-POV, close-third or first-person stories** that sit comfortably in Track A, with occasional Mosaic/Track B moves built from image and motif rather than hard plot turns. The default drive lens is **Accumulative/Textural**: pressure comes from layered sensory detail, recurring objects, and atmosphere, not from reversals or intricate causality. Within that lane, the model is reliably clear on the basics—orientation, motivation, and a coherent final tableau. Endings typically land on a **charged image or Earned Stasis** rather than a twist.

Reader impact is shaped by a persistent split between **rich perception and low-cost resolution**. Characters see, feel, and handle their worlds with striking specificity, often through an occupational lens, but their arcs frequently plateau at realization instead of decisive, costly action. Conflicts “tighten” more conceptually than tactically; stakes are declared or felt rather than tested on the body or in the environment. Closure is thus visually satisfying but often **soft on consequence**, leaving resonance more contemplative than gutting.

Across Q1–Q8, the model shows a strong instinct for **objects as anchors**—clocks, shards, valves, lenses—and for threading these through character, setting, theme, and ingenuity. It maintains POV hygiene and structural coherence even when shading into Mosaic. Where it struggles is converting that elegant scaffolding into **irreversible change with visible trade-offs**. Reflection and thematic explanation often overrun late paragraphs, undercutting subtext and pressure just where the story needs its hardest edge.

2) Portfolio map  

Q1 Character — Mixed  · Deep occupational interiority, but low-cost, epiphany-led resolutions  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Mixed · Clear orientation, accumulative pressure; frequent soft-cost, convenient resolutions  
Q3 Setting — Mixed · Strong micro-settings; big vistas go decorative, not constraining  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed · Textural escalation works; frictionless success and conceptual costs recur  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Mixed · Potent motif-based themes; frequent on-the-nose thesis statements  
Q6 Voice/POV — Mixed · Stable close POV; generic lyricism and register drift in stress beats  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Mixed · High information density; paraphrase loops, filters, and stock metaphors  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Mixed · Inventive vocational magic; archive-epiphany template and passive insight

3) Signature moves  

- **Occupational filtering as spine.** The model habitually lets vocation colonize perception: archivists taste dust, clockmakers think in tension/release, musicians read silence. This yields non-generic interiority across character, setting, and voice.  
- **Object-as-axis storytelling.** Central talismanic items (a cracked lens, tuning fork, jade tear, broken clock) carry plot, theme, and conflict simultaneously, often undergoing **Conceptual Repricing** by the end.  
- **Accumulative lyricism with strong bookends.** It layers motifs (hum, petals, tide, gears) through the middle and reliably returns to the opening texture for a **“final glance”** that charges the closing image.  
- **Micro-choices with symbolic weight.** The strongest climaxes hinge on tiny physical acts—pocketing or dropping a shard, extinguishing a candle—that enact stance crystallization without needing exposition.  
- **Quiet speculative lyricism.** Magic and worldbuilding tend to be “hymn the mundane”: tactile, small-scale weirdness (silence as substance, memory as sediment) integrated into trades rather than grand systems.  
- **Memorable metaphoric fragments.** When it commits to a lexicon, lines like “grief as tide, not monument” or “silence had a language” feel earned and specific, not decorative.

4) Failure modes  

- **Competence without cost.** Characters frequently reach “he understood / she realized” rather than undertaking a risky act that forecloses an option. They gain wisdom or relief without losing tools, status, safety, or relationships, dulling emotional payoff.  
- **Soft, convenient resolutions.** Plot lenses that start as Causal or Situational often resolve via **helpful apparitions, ghost-mentors, or perfectly functioning magic**, bypassing struggle and failing the “Cost Proof” test.  
- **Atmosphere that doesn’t bite.** Settings—especially ruins, archives, observatories—remain postcard-pretty. Fog, tides, storms, or voids rarely force tactic changes, so environment becomes wallpaper rather than the “third actor” that constrains choice.  
- **Reflection and sermon creep in the final third.** Under pressure, the prose leans on summary (“weeks passed”), thematic statements, and “X was not Y, but Z” constructions. Reflection can exceed the rubric’s tolerance without enough on-page micro-choices to keep momentum.  
- **Generic lyricism and register drift.** A default palette of “hush, shimmer, breath, silence” mixes with jarring academic/therapy-speak (“conceptual repricing,” “intersubjective”) in otherwise immersive passages, signaling authorial intrusion.  
- **Headroom-limiting templates.** The **artifact-epiphany in a liminal space** recurs: a solitary caretaker enters archive/garden/lighthouse, encounters a glowing object or ghost, receives a download of meaning, and leaves “lighter.” Magic and mentors do the work the protagonist should.

5) When it shines / when it breaks  

It shines when the scope stays **micro and resistant**: one POV, one charged space, one or two objects whose physical rules matter. Claustrophobic environments, somatic or professional constraints, and a single decisive turn let its accumulative lyricism and object-driven structure pay off in a clean, resonant image. When a character must improvise within tight limitations—can’t speak, can’t touch, oxygen low, vow binding—the model converts sensory density into real pressure and manages organic, subtext-rich themes.

It breaks when asked to do **big stakes or analytic explanation** within 600–800 words. Epic cities, regimes, or universe-scale threats remain abstract; antagonism is declared rather than dramatized. In these drafts the model leans on mood, mentors, and interior essays: reflection balloons, the environment stops constraining tactics, and conflict resolves through understanding instead of loss. Line-level habits—paraphrase loops, filter stacks, stock metaphors, and thesis statements—then compound to flatten momentum and drain closure of cost.

6) Keep vs. adjust  

• Keep  
- **Occupational lenses and tactile magic.** Filtering world, diction, and metaphors through a specific trade or bodily limitation is the core engine of its distinctiveness.  
- **Object-centered, accumulative structures.** The practice of teaching motifs early and reconfiguring them in a final image sustains coherence and resonance.  
- **Single decisive micro-turns.** Building toward one small but irreversible physical act as climax preserves clarity and focus at this length.

• Adjust  
- **Harden cost at closure.** For each story, force the protagonist to lose or break something tangible—tool, place, ally, illusion—so that the final image proves a trade-off, not just a mood shift.  
- **Turn atmosphere and theme into obstacles, not commentary.** Convert at least one major descriptive or thematic element (fog, silence, archive, grief) into a practical constraint that changes tactics, and delete late-paragraph sentences that explain “what it meant.”  
- **Prune abstraction and scaffolding at the sentence level.** Systematically cut paraphrase loops, filter verbs, and academic/therapy diction in the final third, keeping only lines that both advance the moment and stay true to the focal character’s idiom.
