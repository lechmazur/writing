1) Executive profile  

DeepSeek V3.1 Non-Think shows a consistently high baseline across all eight axes. Its dominant mode is Track A: single-POV, scene-focused narratives with one primary setting and a small cast. Within that default, it reliably teaches a clear drive lens early—usually causal or accumulative/textural—and then holds it through to closure. The reader almost always gets crisp orientation within ~120 words, coherent escalation, and an ending beat that is legibly paid for on the page.  

Character work, plot/causality, setting, and theme all intersect around one core habit: pressure is funneled through a specific protagonist’s embodied perception, with micro-choices under constraint shaping both structure and meaning. Closure typically arrives as Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: renunciation, depletion, foreclosed paths. Momentum is steady and controlled rather than frenetic, with a preference for one decisive tightening over multiple reversals. The main risks are softening pressure in the middle, abstracting or moralizing in the final lines, or letting line-level artifacts (diagnostic phrasing, paraphrase loops, over-lyric diction) intrude exactly where emotional cost should be sharpest. Multi-shard or multi-POV experiments (Track B/C) are rare but generally legible when attempted; the model’s strongest work remains single-lens, high-pressure, and cleanly closed.  

2) Portfolio map  

- Q1 Character — Strong  · Embodied contradiction, motivated micro-choices, closure with visible cost  
- Q2 Plot/Causality — Strong  · Clear lens, tight escalation, disciplined, paid-off closure beats  
- Q3 Setting — Strong  · Environments and objects act as constraints, not wallpaper  
- Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Strong  · Early stakes, agency-driven tightening, on-page cost at climax  
- Q5 Theme/Subtext — Strong  · Theme emerges from motif and image, not stated morals  
- Q6 Voice/POV — Strong  · Singular, character-specific lens with rhythmic modulation under stress  
- Q7 Prose/Line-level — Strong  · High-density lines, varied rhythm, concrete imagery over filler  
- Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong  · Tropes transformed via irreplaceable professions, tools, and world-logic  

3) Signature moves  

- Embodied interiority under pressure: characters experience “contradictory impulses (terror vs wonder)” simultaneously, with motives expressed through tactile anchors like “pressing the arrowhead for grounding.”  
- Closure with cost via renunciation or endurance: endings often hinge on giving something up (“forecloses a genuinely viable alternative”) with the price made bodily—“tears cutting clean through grime,” “silver light fading from her.”  
- Setting as crucible rather than backdrop: micro-settings such as “the projector lens” or “hourglass grain” actively constrain tactics and define what closure can be.  
- Accumulative motif work that reweights at the end: dust, light, music, or silence recur and change meaning—“the open roof reframes all dust as evidence of ‘persistent, beautiful existence.’”  
- Character-tuned voice with controlled rhythm: syntax shortens under strain, stretches in reflection; diction is filtered through vocation and bias (“finding patterns in static,” “strip needless drama from the loss”).  
- Conceptual risk grounded in craft discipline: inventive premises (emotion cartographers, “neutron-star botanist”) are always subordinated to character stakes and a coherent, constraint-driven arc.  

4) Failure modes  

- Peak beats lapsing into abstract or diagnostic label-speak: moments of crisis sometimes default to “granular purpose feels slightly diagnostic,” “her motivation snapped into painful clarity,” or therapeutic phrasing, flattening otherwise rich interiority.  
- Closure without fully felt pressure or cost: some endings state loss conceptually (“last link to the past”) or resolve with convenience/competence, missing a friction-tested micro-choice or embodied price.  
- Middle-section softening: a number of stories move from premise to conclusion with only “gentle” or “slightly redundant” escalation, skipping a tangible obstacle, failure, or dilemma that would tighten stakes.  
- Theme over-explained in final lines: explicit echoes (“courage is not the absence of fear”; “the choice is not the point. The understanding is.”) or meta-commentary undercut subtext earned by scenes.  
- Register drift and figurative overload at climaxes: under pressure, the voice can spike into untaught elevated diction (“cathedral of silence,” “texture of time itself”) or metaphor pile-ups, briefly clouding action and character.  
- Line-level artifact debt in the last third: paraphrase/synonym loops, filter-verb clusters (“she saw, she felt, he noticed”), or template cadences creep into crucial paragraphs and cap impact, especially at closure.  

5) When it shines / when it breaks  

This model shines when it has a tight, constraint-rich situation; a single, deeply inhabited POV; and one central stake that can be pressed to a visible, costly decision. Give it a room, tool, or bodily limit that *must* shape tactics, and it will build a clean arc: specific noticing, micro-choices under pressure, motif recursion, and a closure image that feels both surprising and inevitable. It is particularly strong at quiet, accumulative narratives where theme emerges from reweighted symbols and the final act is a renunciation, endurance, or reframed perception rather than a twist.  

It breaks, or at least flattens, when asked to carry too much abstraction or moral freight without enough concrete struggle. If the core conflict is primarily intellectual or therapeutic and external constraints are weak, the prose tends to slide toward generalized language and explicit statement at exactly the wrong time. Similarly, if the structure under-delivers on escalation—no real obstacle, no live alternative to foreclose—the dependable closure mechanics start to feel tidy or soft. Over-ambitious lyric diction, untaught stylistic jumps, or mosaic structures without a crisp throughline can also erode clarity and pressure.  

6) Keep vs. adjust  

• Keep  
- The fusion of motive, flaw, and perception into embodied interiority—tactile, specific cues (“foxglove regret,” “dust motes, thick as felt”) that make motives felt rather than named.  
- Constraint-driven architecture: early orientation, clear drive lens, and closing beats that pay off every meaningful object, rule, and pattern with on-page cost.  
- Motif-led, image-centered thematics: endings that reconfigure a recurring symbol or sensory pattern instead of summarizing a lesson.  

• Adjust  
- Replace diagnostic or abstract phrasing in peak beats with scene-anchored conflict: show contradiction and struggle through gesture, misstep, or physical sensation rather than labels.  
- Sharpen middle and final-third pressure: introduce or amplify at least one concrete obstacle, trade-off, or failed tactic so closure feels hard-won, not gently arrived at.  
- Audit final paragraphs for paraphrase, moralizing, and register drift; cut loops and explicit theses, and re-ground the ending in a single, concrete, character-true image of what has been lost, chosen, or irrevocably changed.
