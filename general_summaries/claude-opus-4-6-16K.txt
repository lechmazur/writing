1) Executive profile  

Across Q1–Q8, this model’s fiction is defined by accumulative, textural storytelling with a narrow physical focus, deep interiority, and elevated lyricism. It most naturally operates in Track A and compact Track B mosaic: single or few scenes, a solitary expert protagonist, one charged object or micro-setting, and a closure that reweights an initial image. Narrative pressure typically comes from density—of sensory detail, ritual, and emotional resonance—rather than from kinetic plot reversals.

The reader experience is one of high clarity and immersion at the sentence and scene level. Orientation is almost always clean within the first 60–80 words, and the perceptual filter (often vocational) stays consistent, keeping POV tidy and psychic distance controlled. Momentum is steadier than fast, but when the accumulative lens is well taught, the tightening is unmistakable: environmental clocks, bodily strain, and one meaningful stance crystallization that forecloses a prior option. Felt cost is strongest when the story enacts renunciation or earned stasis through an on-page physical act (burning, breaking, refusing); it weakens when cost is confined to realization or mood.

Closures usually land as "Charged Poise" or "Resonant Reconfiguration": the world remains broken or constrained, but the protagonist’s stance toward that world—and the value of a central object or motif—has shifted. High-band pieces reliably pass the cost proof and transformation tests; mid-band ones hover at soft, epiphanic endings where the model double-explains the theme or lets competence resolve conflict without sacrifice. Voice is a major asset but also a trap: the default "luminous hush" register can blur tonal range, and essayistic intrusions at the end can flatten otherwise sophisticated subtext.

2) Portfolio map  

Q1 Character — Mixed · Rich vocational interiority; cost and contradiction sometimes told, not enacted  
Q2 Plot/Causality — Mixed · Strong accumulative arcs; summary bridges and “magic keys” erode pressure  
Q3 Setting — Strong · Micro-setting as active constraint; occasional spatial drift, macro-context thin  
Q4 Conflict/Stakes — Mixed · Renunciatory agency and visceral cost at best; frictionless success recurs  
Q5 Theme/Subtext — Strong · Conceptual repricing via objects; undercut by end-of-story moralizing lines  
Q6 Voice/POV — Strong · Perceptual signature and clean POV; register drift to essay-voice at peaks  
Q7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · Dense, rhythmic, metaphorically coherent; paraphrase loops and overwriting  
Q8 Originality/Ingenuity — Mixed · Vocational-speculative synthesis excels; emotional arcs often template  

3) Signature moves  

- Vocational perception as core lens: characters "read cracks with a dentist’s precision" or feel history "hummed at a frequency… in her molars," fusing expertise with emotion.  
- Object-as-axis structure: clocks, maps, lenses, archives, or shards introduced early and "re-weighted" in the final image to deliver Conceptual Repricing.  
- Accumulative, atmospheric pressure: sound, light, weather, and tactile constraint act as an antagonist, with setting serving as "Atmosphere as Clock" rather than mere backdrop.  
- Agency through renunciation: stakes often hinge on refusing a default—choosing not to repair, not to deliver, foreclosing "the path of passive recording."  
- Quiet, charged closures: ending on "Charged Poise," often the moment of decision with cost legible (burned letters, broken tools) but consequences left just beyond the frame.  
- Vocational-speculative fusion: magic and technology treated as labor—"collecting absences," "hymning the mundane"—so that speculative physics emerge from procedural detail.  

4) Failure modes  

- Diagnostic and essayistic intrusion: motivation or theme summarized in therapy/academic diction ("inadvertently stubborn," "conceptual repricing") instead of enacted through behavior, especially in final paragraphs.  
- Frictionless competence and "magic keys": expert protagonists solve puzzles or fix machines on the first try, or stumble onto "the exact right journal entry," deflating conflict and undermining earned cost.  
- Soft, conceptual cost: stories stop at mental epiphany ("she understood then") or melancholic acceptance without on-page foreclosure—no ruined tool, broken relationship, or bodily toll to prove stakes.  
- Accumulative drift and summary bridges: atmospheric detail piles up without narrowing options; middle sections leap through time ("Over the following weeks") instead of dramatizing a pressure-cooker beat.  
- Lyric monotone and figurative overload: the same "luminous," "hush," "fractured" register applied to all scenes; peak moments buried under stacked metaphors and paraphrase loops that stall momentum.  
- Orientation and antagonism gaps: while micro-settings are strong, macro geography and concrete antagonistic forces (beyond entropy/silence) can be thin, yielding "floating rooms" and abstract, undramatized opposition.  

5) When it shines / when it breaks  

This model shines when the brief invites a solitary or small-cast expert in a constrained environment, under an accumulative or textural lens. Give it a glazier in a failing greenhouse, an archivist in a flooded library, a deaf percussionist in a collapsing coal town, and it will build a coherent figurative system where setting actively shapes tactics, conflict emerges from attention and refusal, and closure lands with an image that revalues the opening premise. Track A or compact Track B shards with clear environmental clocks and an object-driven arc reliably produce publishable work featuring rich subtext and distinctive voice.

It breaks when asked for kinetic, multi-vector conflict, overt moral argument, or big temporal sweeps. High-velocity plot, multi-POV ensembles, or external antagonists that must adapt tactically will expose its reliance on mood over pressure and competence over struggle. The model’s instinct to explain—diagnosing emotion, thematizing in essay-register, double-tapping the ending—can turn subtle conceptual work into didactic closure. Similarly, when speculative premises are inventive but emotional arcs default to unmodified "letting go" or "finding closure," ingenuity scores flatten and endings feel predictable despite the beautiful surface.

6) Keep vs. adjust  

• Keep  
- The vocational perceptual signature that filters every detail through trade-specific lexicons and metaphors.  
- Object-led and micro-setting-driven structures that allow setting, artifact, and theme to interlock at closure.  
- Accumulative, renunciatory climaxes where a single irreversible action (burning, breaking, refusing) carries real cost.  

• Adjust  
- Replace diagnostic/theme-summary sentences—especially "she realized/understood" and essay-register abstractions—with concrete, consequential actions in the present scene.  
- Introduce at least one moment of real resistance and tactical adaptation: let puzzles jam, ghosts misbehave, tools fail, forcing a riskier second attempt.  
- Scrub paraphrase loops and overused lexical crutches ("luminous," "hush," "not X, but Y"), trusting the first clear image and varying tone to match actual stakes.
