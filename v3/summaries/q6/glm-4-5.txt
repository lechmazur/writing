**Q6 Editorial Brief – Voice & Point of View (600–800 word stories)**

**1) Executive Insight**

Across the sample, the central pattern for Q6 is an overwhelming preference for richly textured, single-POV narration (Track A default), with a subtle but crucial split between stories that develop a *distinct perceptual signature* grounded in character-specific noticing, and those that slide into generic lyricism, summary, or poetic template. The highest impact comes when the narrative voice is consistently filtered—scene by scene, beat by beat—through the protagonist’s knowledge, biases, and senses, with rhythmic and syntactic control modulating under pressure. This creates organic emotional momentum, immersive intimacy, and a friction that accrues real cost at closure. While a minority of stories successfully deploys Accumulative/lyric (Track B) or controlled multi-POV/sectional (Track C) approaches, most maintain the “default” single-character lens, with only rare, non-disruptive drift (e.g., brief summaries or poetic compression in moment-of-stress). Closure, when effective, lands not just on revelation but through the voice’s costed evolution—often using lyric or patterned elision as both a tension engine and a payoff mechanism.

**2) Strength Profile**

- Most stories maintain stable narrative stance and “modesty of knowledge,” rarely leaking into unearned omniscience or unjustified inference. Lines such as “POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that blends scientific precision with poetic observation,” typify tight filtering and specificity.
- The best stories teach and sustain a pattern of lyric compression or patterned diction, as in: “Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure” (Qwen); “Compression and elision are purposeful and paid off at closure” (Kimi K2).
- Controlled modulation of syntax and rhythm under pressure is common in high-performing stories: “Rhythm modulates under pressure: longer reflective sentences collapse into clipped action during descent.” (“Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through an illustrator’s perceptual bias”).
- Dialogue, when present, generally serves subtext and/or goal-pursuit, is voice-specific, and rarely slips into expository or author-assistive function: “Dialogue feels natural and subtextual, advancing the rediscovery” or “Dialogue is minimal but effective, with Marlo’s final lines to Vance carrying significant subtext.”
- Rare but exemplary multi-POV, lyric, or accumulative stories use clear pattern teaching, intentional sectioning or repetition, and consistently modulate voice within each segment.

**3) Weakness Profile**

- A persistent, cross-sample weakness is the lack of a *distinct* perceptual signature: “narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elena notices what any scholar might notice,” or “reads as generic literary prose without character-specific diction or rhythm.” This flattens line-level urgency and obliterates individuality under stress.
- Rhythmic monotony and template cadence are flagged frequently: “repetition of assigned phrases...creates minor voice convergence, slightly undermining...distinct perceptual signature,” and “repetitive sentence structures...create monotony.”
- Register mismatches, particularly elevated or academic/diagnostic diction at peak stress, distance the reader or feel unmotivated: “register drift occurs with phrases like ‘drowsy alertness that had been creeping over him’,” and “abstract emotional declarations...replace embodied perception during peak moments.” Some stories slip into summary, label-speak, or filter-verb clusters (“she felt,” “she knew,” “he realized”) that dull immediacy instead of dramatizing insight.
- Stories sometimes exhibit closure-without-cost or pattern motifs that are not taught early enough: “elision of concrete mechanics feels untaught, obscuring closure legibility,” or “untaught segmentation” in Track B/C cases.
- More rarely, untaught POV slippage or unmodulated psychic distance emerges, especially during revelations or when internal monologue abruptly becomes authorial in tone (“The voice explains more than the narration dramatizes”).

**4) Performance Boundaries**

This writing excels when it establishes a perceptual signature early, maintains consistent POV and character-specific diction, and modulates both rhythm and syntactic density as pressure or discovery build. Voice remains potent when purposefully poetic or technical registers serve the character’s state rather than the author’s flourish, and when any lyric or accumulative patterns are “taught” and paid off in closure. It breaks when pressure leads to summary, filter-verb accumulation, repetition for repetition’s sake, or abstraction—moving the reader out of the character’s dynamic, selective consciousness and into generic lyricism or omniscience. Risk moves (rhapsodic lyric, patterned sectioning, brief multi-POV) elevate if they land closure with legibility and cost but backfire if not clearly grounded.

**5) Signature Moves and Blind Spots**

- *Signature Moves:*
  - Reliable single-POV focalization that maintains “modesty of knowledge.”
  - Tactile, sensory, or professional noticing that filters all description.
  - Lyric or poetic repetition, when pattern-taught.
- *Blind Spots:*
  - Rhythm or lexical repetition that becomes mechanical (“template cadence”).
  - Abstract, diagnostic, or academic language leaking in, especially at emotional peaks.
  - Tendency to “tell” what’s shown, or summarize character change or realization.

**6) High-Band Signals (~8.8+):**

- A *coherent perceptual lens at closure*—the character’s way of noticing and language choices evolve, provoke new insight, or accrue consequence (“patterned elision taught early and paid off at closure”).
- *Cost legibility*—the tension built through withholding, poetic compression, or lyric repetition “imposes cost” that the closing beat then “pays off on the page.”
- *Clean, pressure-reactive final-third lines*—as pressure rises, syntax and diction compress, modulate, and intensify in clear alignment with character stress, never lapsing into summary or abstraction.

**7) Revision Levers and Keepers**

- **Keep:**
  - Consistent, character-specific filtering of perception (“scientific precision,” “tactile noticing,” etc.).
  - Pattern-taught lyric compression or accumulative devices that are paid off in the closing action or realization.
  - Purposeful pressure-point modulation of syntax/rhythm and diction.
- **Change:**
  - Replace summary, abstract, or diagnostic label-speak (“she felt,” “drowsy alertness,” “analytically intuitive”) with dramatized, embodied experience rooted in the POV’s sensorium.
  - Break up repetitive, template sentence structures—introduce syntactic variation at emotional highs.
  - Re-anchor any poetic or accumulative flourishes to the character’s evolving perspective, ensuring early pattern teaching and closure payoff for lyric or segmented experiments.

**In sum:** Foster specificity, compression, and pressure-tested rhythm in the voice, and cull all flattening generalities, filter-verb clusters, and untaught lyric or register drift. The distinct mind—not the prose style—must drive what and how we see.
