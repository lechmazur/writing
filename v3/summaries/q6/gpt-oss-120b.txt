**Q6 Editorial Brief: Voice & Point of View (600–800 word stories)**

---

### 1) Executive Insight

For this Q6 cohort, the central pattern is a rigorous alignment between lyrical, often metaphor-infused prose and a consistently close, character-bound point of view. Nearly all stories operate within a single focalizer—mostly Track A, with rare and clean-forged Track B/C mosaics—delivering a notable uniformity in voice and psychic distance. The strongest work succeeds by fusing a distinct perceptual signature to the lens (how, not just what, is noticed), teaching any compression or poetic elision early, and modulating the lyric cadence or diction with emotional pressure. However, the modal output trends toward a "literary lyric default": poetic atmosphere and sensory texture reliably persist, but too often at the expense of sharply individuated character interiority or syntactic/rhythmic adaptation under stress. Closure almost always lands without head-hopping or lens confusion, but cost on the page and granular voice distinction vary: the best scripts embody stress via rhythm shifts and POV-specific noticing; the weakest flatten all scenes into a generic poetic register. Dialogue, when present, often functions more as atmospheric extension than as character-revealing friction.

### 2) Strength Profile

- **Consistent, Lyrical Prose Texture**  
  Most stories sustain a poetic, musical line-level texture, often with a measured sentence rhythm: e.g., "The sea had long swallowed the stone streets." This lyric commitment rarely breaks, even in complex builds.

- **Distinctive Sensory Bias/Perceptual Signature**  
  Many focalizers demonstrate specific noticing bias, elevating the prose above generic: “glass sang, its tones drifting like distant resonances”; “static tasted of old rain”; “ambered hush of forgotten tides.” This sensory focus supports immersive atmosphere.

- **POV Stability and Modesty**  
  Stories nearly never head-hop. Internal voice stays locked within a plausible lexicon and knowledge boundary for the focalizer—pressure never prompts unearned omniscient access (“She watched the old maps peel. She would not claim the legend as her own”).

- **Patterned Compression and Early Teaching of Elision**  
  When stories use compression or lyrical omission, they teach the reader how to read (via repetition or motif) and then pay off that expectation at closure: e.g., “purposeful compression (e.g., ‘uncertainly certain’) is taught early and pays off.”

- **Rhythmic Modulation with Pressure (High-Band Only)**  
  The top third modulate prose rhythm—clipped, tense lines under duress; more languid, elliptical phrasing in reverie—making interior states legible in form as well as content: “Rhythm modulates under discovery moments or emotional peaks, creating a somewhat monotonous rhythm [in weaker entries].”

### 3) Weakness Profile

- **Generic Lyric Register without Character-Specific Modulation**  
  Many pieces default to a uniformly elevated, poetic style regardless of focalizer, stress, or setting; this flattens character and renders voice interchangeable: “Descriptive register could belong to any literary narrator”; “Mara notices everything with the same elevated tone.”

- **Lack of Distinct POV-Specific Filtering in High-Pressure/Peak Scenes**  
  Under emotional duress or action, the prose often fails to adapt, maintaining “uniformly contemplative tone” and missing an opportunity to embody stress in line length, rhythm, or diction.

- **Label-Speak, Filter Verbs, and Thematic Abstraction**  
  Some scripts lean on summary (“she understood,” “she realized”) or therapy-speak (“fierce tenderness,” “hushed blaze”) especially at emotional climaxes, dulling immediacy or veering into telling rather than showing.

- **Compression or Elision Not Fully Taught/Patterned**  
  In weaker pieces, compression—whether abrupt omission of action/emotion or poetic leap—is not prepared or paid off, leading to reader disorientation rather than deliberate accumulative effect.

- **Register Drift or Artificed Diction**  
  Occasional abrupt shifts into academic or abstract vocabulary (“periodically eternal,” “conceptual repricing”) break the expectation of a voice-rooted lexicon.

### 4) Performance Boundaries

This writing excels in stories where the lyric mode is fused with a sharply individuated perceptual bias and responsive modulation: when prose rhythm and diction compress or fracture under pressure, and pattern-taught compression deepens rather than confuses emotional turn. It breaks when the lyric template is imposed generically, producing a “committee voice” (per the rubric) that could belong to any narrator—regardless of background, context, or situational urgency. Modulation in voice, syntactic length, or image logic during stress is the fulcrum: entries that remain static, with a “monolithic” pitch, lose the edge.

### 5) Signature Moves & Blind Spots

- **Signature Moves**  
  - Lyric, poetic register with strong control over sentence rhythm  
  - Bias toward sensory or synesthetic noticing (light, sound, tactile hints)  
  - Early, purposeful patterning of elision, symbolism, or compression  

- **Blind Spots**  
  - Uniform register despite character or situational changes (flat under pressure)  
  - Heavy reliance on filter verbs in moments of intensity  
  - Descriptive and dialogue voices often indistinguishable; dialogue sometimes absent or atmospheric, not goal-driven

### 6) High-Band (≈8.8+) Signals

- **Micro-Patterning and Payoff**  
  Distinct perceptual patterns (noticing/habitual metaphors) are taught, varied, and then transformed at closure, showing emotional cost or change on the page.

- **Rhythmic/Structural Modulation with Pressure**  
  Prose line-length, punctuation, and image logic compress or fray at peaks—embodying interiority under stress, not just thematizing it.

- **Psycho-Lexical Fidelity**  
  Lexicon, syntax, and metaphor remain tightly bound to the character/focalizer’s profession, class, mood, and physical/psychic situation, never defaulting to “literary” generality.

### 7) Revision Levers and Keepers

- **Keep:**  
  1. Concrete sensory/micro-perceptual bias unique to focalizer  
  2. Early, readable patterning of compression/elision (preparing the reader for poetic moves)  
  3. Lyric line-level control with clear, scene-serving rhythm

- **Change:**  
  1. Modulate prose rhythm, diction, and image logic during scenes of pressure/urgency; teach reader to expect—and reward—syntactic stress  
  2. Eliminate filter verbs and expository labeling in crucial moments; render through perception and metaphor, not summary  
  3. Audit for and remove register drifts (“academic,” “therapy-speak”); root all abstraction in the character’s plausible vocabulary and mental frame

**Coda:**  
The gold standard on this axis is not simply lyric prose, but lyric prose inseparable from the character’s embodied mind and modulated by moment-to-moment pressure. Preserve the patterning, but make the closure cost land through change in what—and how—the protagonist can bear to notice.
