<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Alex’s skepticism versus compulsion to explore generates credible internal friction, and his tactile choices (examining then turning the valve) align with motive. The confession seed motivates the night journey and the later reinterpretation of his father. The final repricing—seeing the disappearance as escape—lands, though it edges on tidy and fast. Emotions are embodied (dust, beads, hiss) rather than labeled, strengthening the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive: accumulative atmosphere with causal turns (ghosts manifest → he turns the valve → water/clarity and repricing). Orientation is clean early; the radio device coheres with his appraisal mindset. Closure is on‑page via the valve’s action and the conceptual cost of relinquishing a protective belief. The price is more internal than external, but legible at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel and valve wheel are vivid and functional; the environment constrains what he can do and charges the final image (beads clicking like a rosary, water washing dust). Sensory detail (glow, grit, hiss) is purposeful and POV‑filtered through an industrial lens. The world remains consistent and specific without touristic listing. The setting evolves with the action (valve releases water; dawn outside).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres from eerie quiet to apparition to the choice to act; the tightening is clear though not harrowing. The dominant stake is internal—the cost of repricing his father—and the ghost shift deepens that conflict. Stakes skew reflective over perilous, which slightly softens escalation. Still, the turn at the valve forecloses his prior narrative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of labor’s haunt, inherited denial, and skepticism transformed are integrated through particulars (radio callers mirroring his secret; wheel as pseudo‑sacramental). The final water image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (washing the burden). A few moments state symbolism too directly (“not just monetary, but symbolic”), trimming some subtlety. Overall, subtext outpaces any brief moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and plausibly limited; the diction marries industrial grit with lyric touches without breaking voice. The radio interleaving is controlled and adds texture to his perception. Minor explanatory lines slightly flatten the music, but the rhythm mostly tightens under pressure and lifts at dawn. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry scene, image, and thought efficiently, with good verb choice and sensory density. Some redundancy and overt signposting (“interpreting… appraised”) edge toward telling, and a couple metaphors flirt with purple but don’t blur clarity. Momentum holds, with variation in sentence length matching tension. Clean mechanics and a strong final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>“Factory ghost shift” is a familiar conceit, but the talk‑radio psychic lens and the beaded industrial artifact create a fresh synthesis. The father’s escape reinterpretation adds emotional specificity. The risks are coherent rather than flashy, with originality arising from selection and linkage of elements. Not groundbreaking, but distinctly executed.</comment>
