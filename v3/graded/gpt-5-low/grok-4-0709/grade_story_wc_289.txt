<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (to “rejoin” by risking his own words) is clear and aligns with his keeper‑of‑secrets flaw. Interiority is evocative but mostly summarized; contradictory impulses in-scene are muted until Mira appears. His key action—building the installation and finally handing Mira a scroll—tracks, but the emotional cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally. The reunion leans on recognition rather than pressure that forces a harder choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the installation accrues meaning, the crowd gathers, Mira’s recognition triggers the final cadence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he exposes his own words, with a modest cost (vulnerability). Orientation is clean; scene unity holds. The Mira coincidence softens causal tightening, but the final image coherently reweights the premise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly integrated and tactically relevant: floating lanterns, the buoyed spiral, storm‑sheen light charge the ending. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility and evolve with action. The environment literally enables the art method and inflects tone. The final shimmered surface and temple shadow heighten the last beat’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes—risking secrecy for connection—are legible, and the installation constitutes a meaningful tightening. Escalation remains gentle; tension rises via accumulation and public exposure rather than conflict. Resolution is earned by his act of sharing, yet coincidence (Mira’s arrival) does heavy lifting. The visible price is modest (social/emotional vulnerability), not a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motifs (thread/spiral/lanterns/temple) cohere into a theme of turning private longing into communal connection. Subtext operates in images (the nest spiral “pulsing”) more than in speech, which preserves lyric resonance. Occasional direct statement (“to find the thread that connects all things”) verges on on‑the‑nose. Still, the final shared quiet reweights the premise without a spelled‑out moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent, lyric third‑person closely held to Elias; diction and rhythm suit the whimsical sensibility. The brief dialogue is natural and charged by implication. No head‑hopping; stance stays controlled. Slight purple lean is voice‑coherent and doesn’t obscure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lovely images and strong noun/verb choices sustain mood, with clean mechanics. Some density drift toward ornament (prismatic, whispering colors, repeated “spiral”/“thread”) softens propulsion. Minimal scaffold; no major loops, but figurative stacking occasionally blurs edge and cost. The final image is clear despite lushness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A love‑letter ghostwriter staging a communal installation around a thrush‑nest spiral at a lotus temple feels fresh and specific. The nature‑made helix as anchor that “pulses” at closure is an inventive synthesis. Stakes are intimate rather than high, but the conceptual integration shows integrity and risk. The coincidence prevents a higher band, not the ingenuity.</comment>
