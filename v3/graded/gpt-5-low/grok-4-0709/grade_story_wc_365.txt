<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—she will risk getting lost to learn the truth about her brother. Sensory‑anchored interiority feels particular to her craft and body. The confrontation with the brother variant lands, but it’s delivered quickly and with limited contradictory impulses on the page. Emotional cost is present but not deeply wrestled through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: shard → redirect → overheard intel → further redirect → confrontation → return with resolve. Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration: she learns the withheld truth and chooses to bear and act on it. Some convenience (overheard exposition, swift confession) softens cost, but the throughline remains coherent under a causal lens. Stakes return to the opening setting with a charged final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The repair bay is vivid across senses (metal tang, ozone, ship husks), filtered through a sensory mapper’s priorities. The shard functions as a micro‑setting tool that constrains choice and charges the last image. The environment evolves across parallel threads (abandoned → bustling), enriching atmosphere and information flow. Depth is strong without overexposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit early and pressure tightens at the alarm/pullback, forcing her to anchor and push deeper. The emotional cost of the brother’s defection and her imposed shame lands, though external resistance feels light and quickly overcome. Escalation is present but not grueling; reversals are brief and mostly informational. The price is more internal than tactical.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, protection through silence, and the burden of inherited shame arise organically from her pursuit and the brother’s reveal. The shard’s cool‑down and “dawn” image offer a resonant, if slightly on‑the‑nose, closing cadence. Subtext operates in sensory motifs and the idea of mapping intangible truths. Avoids moralizing but leans on familiar redemption notes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyrical, sensorium‑rich voice remains stable and character‑specific. POV control is clean with no head‑hopping; compression feels purposeful in a dream‑adjacent frame. Occasional expository lines (“The core concept of her craft…”) flatten an otherwise textured register. Dialogue is minimal but effective at the hinge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong cadence and vivid diction with multi‑tasking sentences. Minor scaffolding and abstraction (“core concept,” “method of parallel universes”) dilute immediacy at peak beats. No major loops or metaphor muddle; information density stays high. Rhythm supports momentum across the transitions.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sensory map maker angle and object‑as‑portal give freshness to a familiar multiverse premise. Recurring sensory coordinates as navigation are memorable and integrated with plot. The brother‑as‑defector reveal is genre‑familiar but earns pathos through the craft’s texture. Risk is moderate and coherent, not flashy for its own sake.</comment>
