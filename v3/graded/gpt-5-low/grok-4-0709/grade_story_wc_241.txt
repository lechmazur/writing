<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—calculating professor vs. gambler’s daughter—drives credible choices (following graffiti, lighting the lantern) with embodied cues (“heart pounding,” petrichor). Her vow reads earned by the on‑page quest rather than a summary epiphany. The cost is implied (risking her safe pedagogy), though it isn’t deeply dramatized. Slight repetition of her “theoretically rebellious” label softens sharpness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Graffiti → line switch → library → lantern → realization → vow tracks cleanly, with one scene transition and a clear before/after. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing (she alters her teaching ethos) with modest on‑page cost. The convenience of finding the exact mica lantern blunts pressure but doesn’t break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed library is vivid and specific (leaky Athenaeum, fogged windows), and the lantern functions as a micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image. Lighting the mica‑pane flame alters what she can perceive (revealed scrawls) and frames the closing talisman. Sensory texture is integrated and filtered through her perspective without tourist listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to engage uncertainty without ruin—is clear and coherently pressured by the graffiti quest. The meaningful tightening arrives when she lights the lantern and reads the reweighted message; it prompts her vow. Cost is mostly conceptual and not fully felt as a trade‑off on the page; opposition is gentle, with little friction beyond weather and doubt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—responsible openness to chance—emerges through the lantern’s “contained and wild” image and her father’s cautionary role. However, the prose sometimes states the thesis (“to widen perspectives responsibly”) rather than letting subtext carry it, especially in the final vow paragraph. The final mica talisman helps resonance despite mild moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The close third is steady, with a controlled lyrical register that fits a probability professor (e.g., “lucid contradictions,” “calculable chance”). Rhythm varies and modulates well in the library sequence. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; diction remains coherent to her sensibility though it occasionally edges toward overt statement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is generally clean and propulsive with vivid images (“petrichor,” “mica pane” glow). Some abstraction and repetition (“theoretically rebellious,” “widen perspectives responsibly”) create mild redundancy and a whiff of purple in places. Still, sentences often do double duty, and the closing image is crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—probability pedagogy meets subway augury and a mica lantern—is fresh and coherent, with the mica’s physicality anchoring the idea of “contained wildness.” The quest via graffiti is an inventive engine for an internal turn. Risks are tasteful rather than radical, with a small convenience in discovery tempering surprise.</comment>
