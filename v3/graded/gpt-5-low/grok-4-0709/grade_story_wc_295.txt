<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her profession informs her tactics. However, there’s little contradictory impulse—she moves from receipt of the telegram to help without friction—so change bears limited cost. Embodied detail (telegraph’s daylily, variable stars as anchor) grounds her emotion. The relationship with Thorne reconfigures by the end, but his presence is largely visionary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: telegram → lucid witnessing → healing words → invitation → arrival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration from isolation to partnership, though cost is mostly conceptual. Orientation is firm early; single POV and scope are well contained. The “final secrets” are gestured at rather than tested on-page, softening the decisive feel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The observatory, telescope, and antique telegraph create a coherent, tactile atmosphere that fits the lyrical night tone. Setting shapes choices (remote clarity enabling lucid work; telegraph as trigger) and charges the final image of co-mapping. Details stay POV‑filtered and purposeful. It stops short of constraining a specific high-stakes choice at the peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ending isolation, decoding via shared burden) is signaled and pursued. The telegram and dream vision provide one meaningful tightening, but pressure remains gentle and largely internal. The resolution feels earned but low-cost, with minimal foreclosed options. Tension rises, then resolves smoothly without a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Shared burdens and witness recur through stars/inscriptions/daylily and culminate in a communal stance. Some lines tip toward thesis-stating (“Burden shared, dawn breaks eternal”), reducing subtext. Still, the final image of mapping together reweights prior particulars effectively. The metaphor of variable stars as communal brightening is apt and cohesive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person close maintains distance and diction appropriate to Elara’s sensibility. Rhythm and imagery are controlled; brief dialogue is functional and not over-expository. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; the voice modulates gently with the dream turn. Elevated language feels earned by the milieu.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong image economy (daylily, brass fittings, red lights) and few mechanical flaws. Occasional purple lean and near‑redundancies (“understanding dawned… with an inner illumination”) soften momentum. Syntax varies and lines often do double duty. The final third remains clear and avoids muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lucid dream cartography plus antique telegraph and variable stars as a witnessing method feels fresh. The daylily telegram as an urgent, ephemeral plea adds distinctiveness. The arc is familiar (from isolation to connection), but the execution carries particularity. Risks are tasteful, coherent, and integrated without gimmick.</comment>
