<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—she collects burdens to counterweight her recursion—and her ritual choices align with that drive. However, interior contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays an embodied emotional price beyond a brief risk of weaving herself. The traveler offers a momentary relational crucible, but it’s mainly instrumental. The final choice reads earned yet not deeply contested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. Setups (lamp, starlight, orientation) pay off in the precise ritual that yields stones and culminates in weaving herself to calcify the trap; the because/therefore chain is clean. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: “The infinite recursion snapped,” with a conceptual cost signaled by embedding her essence. The orientation (who/where/when) is crisp early, and the dawn clock tightens options credibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting and object-as-setting are vivid and functional: the open bronze grotto, starlight geometry, and lamp burner directly constrain tactics. Details like snowmelt oil and crystal refraction integrate into action rather than decorate. The final image reweights prior specifics (lamp flicker out; bronze hush). Rich atmosphere supports theme without drifting into static postcarding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens: wanderers arrive, the pile of weights grows, starlight fades toward dawn, forcing the meta-pattern attempt. Her agency drives escalation—adjusting the lamp, aligning with constellations, then risking self-integration. Cost is present but felt more conceptually than viscerally, tempering intensity. Still, one clear deepening—turning the collected weights on herself—narrows options decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Order versus recursion, burden as currency, and liberation through balance emerge from concrete acts (calcification, orientation) rather than commentary. Recurring images (whalebone reverie, shingled hush, bronze, fractal threads) accrue and reweight at the end without moralizing. Thematic aftertaste is resonant though not disturbingly complex; ambiguity is contained but present in the cost of self-weaving. Overall, strong integration with the final reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person maintains a consistent, distinctive diction, with controlled cadence and image systems. Dialogue is spare but functional and not expository. The voice modulates slightly with pressure (brighter flame, trembling grotto) while preserving the established idiom. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful motifs; most sentences pull double duty. A few phrases verge on purple or repeat (“shingled hush,” “reverie”), but they function as taught patterns rather than scaffolding. Syntax varies, and momentum is preserved through action-linked description. No major loops or muddled metaphors at the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Original synthesis—fractal weaving, calcifying burdens via lamp-starlight orientation, snowmelt oil—feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns arise from established rules rather than late inventions, and the final reconfiguration reads inevitable in hindsight. The risk-taking is aesthetic and conceptual without obscuring clarity. Emotional complexity could deepen, but the vision feels singular.</comment>
