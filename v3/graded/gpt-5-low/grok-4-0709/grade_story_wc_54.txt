<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—curious, competent, and bent on “equations for hope”—and her choices drive every beat. However, she faces little inner friction or contradictory impulse; the stoic steadiness flattens the arc. Her embodied reactions (cold, steady hands, tactile work) are present but spare. The final stance feels earned, though the visible personal cost is light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: arrive → discover sextant → diagnose failed hydro → improvise redirection → systems revive → charged final image. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the set‑ups (star maps, conduits, carnival debris) pay off. Closure lands with a concrete change (the filtration/hydroponics awakening) and a conceptual reweighting from ruin to renewal. The on‑page cost is modest, keeping it below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered and functionally shapes tactics (vines in light shafts, ruptured pipes, faded star maps, hydroponic bays). The sextant and infrastructure act as micro‑settings/tools that constrain and enable choices; they also charge the final image with algae and sprouting seeds. Detail selection feels filtered through an engineer’s eye. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can ingenuity reanimate this ruin?) is signaled early, and the plan tightens options through the redirection gambit. But pressure never bites back: there’s little resistance, no failed attempt, and minimal cost or trade‑off on the page. Escalation reads as steady progression rather than a meaningful squeeze. The outcome feels earned yet low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of repurposed ambition, renewal, and ethical salvage arise from particulars (redirected flows, carnival scrap, dormant seeds) more than declaration. The sextant motif reweights meaning at the end without overt moralizing. Phrases like “equations for hope” edge toward abstract thesis, but the final image mostly carries the resonance. Ambiguity is gentle yet present: cradle vs. tomb recast.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third‑person close with an observant, technically fluent cadence fits Elara’s mind; diction is consistent and controlled. The voice maintains measured “stoic wonder” without head‑hopping or register slips. Some abstraction (“maze of intentions,” “equations for hope”) repeats, but rhythm remains legible and purposeful. No dialogue needed for this frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, with strong nouns and verbs tied to concrete action; information density is good. A few motif loops (“stoic wonder,” “maze of intentions”) and conceptual echoes could be tightened to sharpen momentum. Figurative language is apt but occasionally hovers near purple; it doesn’t obscure causality. The closing image lands crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The fusion of derelict spaceport archaeology with pragmatic hydrology—and the sextant repurposed as a sighting tool—feels fresh. The carnival detritus as material resource is a smart, specific turn. While the conflict is gentle, the conceptual synthesis reads singular rather than templated. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but they cohere.</comment>
