<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, character-specific motive (uncorking suppressed creativity) drives concrete choices, and interiority shows lived regret without therapy-speak. The “mnemonically gifted, cursed” line verges on label-y, but the charcoal-stained hands, trembling, and tool improvisation embody pressure. Contradictory impulses (fear of damaging the chest vs. need to reclaim self) register in the decision to build an indirect mechanism. The change at the end reads earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional rather than materially foreclosing a path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: laughter fades → finds broken lock → recalls vow → builds hidden mechanism → retrieves chest → resumes art. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the broken lock/payoff loop lands. Closure is on-page (Decisive Change into renewed creation), with a felt emotional cost. Escalation is modest but coherent, avoiding coincidence-based resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cave is vividly particular (auroral quartz, dripping hum) and functionally shapes tactics: crevice geometry, vines, and crystal shards enable the pulley rig. Light charges the portrait’s final image and integrates tone. Details are filtered through the artist’s eye, keeping specificity purposeful. Strong environmental integration without museum-tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the chest without damage/rekindling art) is established early, and the key tightening is the choice to engineer a non-destructive solution. The mechanism works on the first try, softening pressure and visible cost. Internal fear vs. need interweaves, but there’s little complication or reversal once the plan starts. Tension is present but never truly bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lock and “auroral sorrow” motifs coherently refract the theme of self-corked potential and reclamation. The final image (tears and renewed sketching) answers the question without a moral. A couple of statements flirt with on-the-nose (“cursed,” “frivolous pursuit”), but most resonance arises from action and image. The symbolism stays integrated rather than grafted on.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical register aligned to an artist’s perception; diction and cadence are controlled. No dialogue, but the narrative voice modulates with pressure and remains within plausible lexicon. Elision is minimal and legible. A few elevated turns are lush but not garish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Images carry multiple jobs, and momentum largely holds; sentences vary in rhythm and length. Occasional purple accents (“auroral sorrow,” “uncorked”) repeat and risk redundancy, but clarity survives. No major scaffold or template-cadence loops. The final lines are clean and image-driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reclamation-of-art arc is familiar, but the specific contrivance—painting-as-cover for a cave-built extraction rig—feels fresh and character-true. Broken lock as self-corked soul is effective without feeling gimmicky. Risk is moderate and disciplined; the piece commits to its lyric-causal hybrid without hedging. Not groundbreaking, but distinctly executed.</comment>
