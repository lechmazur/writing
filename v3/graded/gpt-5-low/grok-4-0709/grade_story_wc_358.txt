<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear and embodied in micro‑choices (adjusting the respirator, recalibrating instruments, reorienting the survey after finding the patch). However, interior contradiction is minimal—Mara is highly competent with little visible doubt or cost. The final stance (reporting for prevention) is earned but emotionally cool. Strong professional specificity carries characterization despite the limited inner conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with a light accumulative texture—survey → wind data → convergence → patch reframes causation → resolve to report. Orientation is clean from the outset; the beats link logically and culminate in a conceptual reconfiguration. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR rather than a decisive act, with cost implied by the silenced city. Slight softness remains because the on‑page price to Mara is conceptual more than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The port’s container labyrinth is vivid and functionally constraining—urban canyons shape wind, tactic placement of anemometers, and the causal explanation. Sensory detail (haze, whiff of chemicals) is purposeful and filtered through a professional eye. The setting charges the final image as the haze lifts over a scarred horizon. A touch more tactile constraint on her movement could have pushed this to the top tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncovering cause to prevent recurrence) is coherent, and pressure tightens through the discovery of the patch and the wind funnel pattern. The escalation is primarily informational rather than jeopardy‑driven, with limited visible cost or trade‑off. Still, the mid‑story turn (human involvement possibility) deepens stakes credibly. The resolution is earned but lacks a sharp on‑page price point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of foresight, adaptation, and convergence arise from concrete process and setting, not just statements. However, some lines verge on thesis (“She would report not just the accident, but the foresight needed to avert the next”), softening subtext. The final image reweights prior material with modest resonance (haze lifting, charts in hand). Strong integration, if a bit declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and disciplined, the diction (“hazy precision”) matching her professional mind. Rhythmic control is confident, with clear focalization and no head‑hopping. Minor repetition of key terms (“haze,” “singular convergence”) edges toward motif rather than redundancy. Overall a distinct, controlled narrative stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line work is clean and purposeful with good image economy; technical detail does double duty for mood and causality. There’s mild overwriting at the edges (fog “like a shroud,” silence “like a guillotine,” stacked metaphors) and some concept repetition. Momentum holds with minimal scaffold. A bit more syntactic variety in the middle third would sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone‑era industrial ruin, forensic aerodynamics, and a human trace (the patch) feels fresh and grounded. The “singular convergence” conceit meaningfully shapes both plot and theme. Risk‑taking is measured rather than bold, with originality coming from procedural specificity. Memorable, if not boundary‑pushing.</comment>
