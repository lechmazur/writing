<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—finding the shape of collective grief—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (unspooling the ribbon, walking its path, carving abstract swirls). His “fiercely meditative” temperament coheres with the deliberate ritual, though contradictory impulses under strain are only lightly dramatized. The mentor relationship adds pressure without eclipsing Elias’s agency. The change from inscription to weaving/carving patterns reads as an earned renunciation, if softly costed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions (ribbon, retracing, butterflies) layer toward a reweighted understanding of grief. Orientation is immediate (greenhouse at dusk; carver at work) and the spectral mentor’s arrival catalyzes the sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/partial conceptual repricing when Elias shifts from names to abstract carvings charged by communal ritual. The cost is felt more than explicit, but the foreclosing of mere inscription is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse and migration saturate the piece with purposeful sensory detail, and the ribbon functions as micro‑setting that literally maps action. Butterflies and glass panes interact with the ritual, charging the final image (ribbon linking stone to the greenhouse’s heart). Environmental specificity is consistent and filtered through Elias’s craft‑mind. The setting constrains and guides choices rather than serving as postcard backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover grief’s shape) tightens when the mentor reframes carving as weaving/sharing, forcing Elias to adopt a new tactic (ritual retracing, abstract carving). Escalation is accumulative—density of butterflies, ribbon unfurling, memory of poem‑trading—rather than reversal‑driven, but the cadence meaningfully deepens. The visible price is modest (abandoning the sufficiency of names/dates), yet it coherently charges the end. No coincidence shortcuts resolve the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—grief as communal, woven ritual—emerges organically from images and action (ribbon, migration, poem‑trading) and reweights in the ending. The mentor’s lines verge on articulation (“grief is not carved; it is woven”), but they’re dramatized through the ritual and carving choice, not tacked on as moral. The final whisper (“Trade your poems with the dead…”) risks explicitness yet resonates as a charged directive that reframes the craft. Subtext persists in the butterflies’ clustering as pattern made communal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elias’s perceptual signature—craft verbs, tactile focus, ritual cadence. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and tonal; the mentor’s diction aligns with the piece’s register without breaking plausibility. Psychic distance stays stable, with controlled modulation as pressure builds. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience intrudes.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished and sonically attentive, with varied sentence rhythms and high information density. A few compounds (“thundering calm,” “serene frenzy”) flirt with saturation but remain coherent and motif‑driven rather than purple for its own sake. Minimal redundancy; most lines do double duty (image + action or theme). Mechanics are clean and momentum holds through the ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of gravestone craft, greenhouse ecology, migration, and a ritual ribbon yields a fresh conceptual synthesis. Spectral mentorship is used tactically rather than as mere ornament, and the poem‑trading custom is an unusual, resonant lever. The final shift to abstract carving via communal patterns feels earned and distinctive. Risks in diction and symbolism cohere without gimmickry.</comment>
