<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—shaping grief into something held—is consistent and enacted through micro‑choices (each cut, the pause for the kettle). Her contradictions read credibly: seeking peace while carving a predator’s strike and weary eyes. A slight neatness creeps in with labeled takeaways (“First lesson”), but the cost of enduring, not erasing, him is felt. The half‑formed lion and her decision to stop and sip registers an earned stasis rather than a tidy cure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, tools, and kettle time build pressure toward a charged poise at the whistle. Closure lands on the page—the tea pour and half‑carved lion lock a before/after stance (contain grief by shaping it). Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the price—living with the unfixable while refusing denial—is legible. The single tightening (kettle’s approach) is sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The loft, skylight, rain, kettle, chisel, and ash wood are tactile and purpose‑driven; object‑as‑setting constrains pace (boil time) and tactics (properties of ash). Weather and light mirror interior without cliché, and the tools charge the final image. Specific sensory cues (steam, wood scent, bead‑racing rain) stay POV‑true. Strong integration without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to live with loss) is present early and tightens via the ticking kettle and the increasingly specific carving choices. The whistle forces a stance crystallization without drama‑dump; she forecloses numbing avoidance by choosing attentive containment. The cost is endurance over resolution; escalation is quiet but coherent for the chosen lens. A single more resistant snag (a slip, a mar in the wood) could have intensified pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motifs (“here and gone,” amber/crystallized time, rain beads) accrue into a resonant answer: you don’t conquer impermanence; you hold its shape. A few lines verge on statement (“First lesson,” “That was the method”), softening subtext. Still, meaning is mostly earned through action (mane that stops, weary eyes) and the final image reweights earlier material. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric, tactile voice is consistent and character‑plausible, with controlled rhythm and sensory bias toward woodcraft and weather. Distance stays steady; the single quoted memory fits the register and deepens present action. Minor flourishiness never breaks focalization. Cadence modulates effectively at the whistle.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean and purposeful, with strong image economy; however, figurative density is high and occasionally declarative (method/lesson statements) blunts momentum. No major loops or scaffolding, but a touch of purple accrues in spots. Rhythm varies and action sequence remains clear through the close. A bit more pruning could heighten propulsion without losing texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The widow of a lion tamer carving his lion from ash while racing a kettle clock feels freshly synthesized and thematically integrated. The crystallized‑time method is distinctive and inevitized by the close. Risks are tasteful and coherent rather than gimmicky. Only minor conventional phrasing keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
