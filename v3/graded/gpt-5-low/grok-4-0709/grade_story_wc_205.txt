<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motivation—to reclaim a suppressed history and redeem his failed revolution—drives clear micro‑choices (builds a sanctuary, deciphers the shard, reframes the narrative). Interiority is specific enough to feel character‑particular (poetic lens, “burnished sorrow”), though contradictory impulses under pressure are light. The renunciation of mere poetry‑as‑solace for evidence‑backed elegy reads as earned. Emotional embodiment is present but skews declarative in a few lines.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Causal drive holds: storms threaten, mirrors amplify, therefore he devises covers, therefore a sanctuary enables decipherment, therefore meaning and stance change. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he exits with a charged object and renewed purpose. Cost is modest but legible (resourceful labor under temporal pressure; acceptance of a quieter, elegiac victory over insurrection). Orientation is crisp and single‑scene coherence is maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and visible time‑veils are vividly rendered and functionally integrated—temporal weather shapes tactics and the sanctuary’s creation. The mirror‑covering method ties environment to consequence, and the shard’s charged reprise in the final image leverages place. Sensory texture is controlled and POV‑filtered rather than touristic. A touch of overt symbolism (“burnished sorrow”) edges toward on‑the‑nose but doesn’t break effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (untainted evidence to reweight a civilization’s story) is clear and tightens once when the storm forces a tactical pivot. The devised method creates a meaningful turn that changes options and yields knowledge. The price paid remains mostly procedural and emotional, not a sharp sacrifice; no strong loss or foreclosed alternative beyond time exposure. Tension is steady if not blistering.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of spectacle masking oppression, the ethics of historiography, and redeemed failure arise from concrete acts (sanctuary‑making, deciphering, reframing). The final image—shard as talisman—reweights prior opulence as elegy. A few overt assertions (“This would settle the archaeological dispute…”) skim toward thesis‑telling, slightly dulling subtext. Still, resonance lingers with plausible ambiguity about truth and propaganda.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is lush, consistent, and coherently filtered through a poet‑revolutionary’s sensibility. Lyric density modulates enough to retain clarity during tactical beats (mirror covers, examination). No head‑hopping or stance drift; free‑indirect texture feels controlled. Occasional elevated phrasing risks purple but remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are rhythmic with good information density; imagery usually does double duty (atmosphere + causality). Minor repetition (“baroque,” “burnished sorrow”) and occasional declaratives slow momentum slightly. Figurative language stays coherent with the world logic (time‑veils, mirrors). Mechanics are clean with no major scaffold or loop artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Visible time” as weather, mirrors amplifying temporal veils, and a baroque asteroid are fresh and thematically aligned. The superstition‑to‑method turn feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. The revolutionary‑poet angle personalizes the speculative premise beyond trope. Risk is real but never gimmicky; only the tidy “this will settle the dispute” note tempers surprise.</comment>
