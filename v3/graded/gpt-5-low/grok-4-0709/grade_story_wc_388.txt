<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (debunking) drives concrete actions, and the late doubt about exposing the truth adds credible internal tension. Interiority is particular enough (meters dipping, apples unmutated, “heart raced”) but occasionally leans on summary. The choice to pocket the diamond is motivated and revealing. Emotional embodiment could be deeper at the peak; the moral trade‑off registers but not viscerally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: rumor → orchard anomaly → discovery of box → shredded letters reassembled → scientific explanation → pocketing the diamond. Orientation is strong and the lens stays causal. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: he leaves with the diamond, burdened by a truth that can save or doom. The price is largely conceptual/ethical rather than dramatized on the page, softening the impact slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard micro‑climate and the storms are vivid, purposeful, and filter through Elias’s trained perception (radiation meters, unmutated fruit). Environment constrains action (safety inside vs. storm outside) and charges the final image. The diamond-as-object anchors setting and stakes. A few more tactile pressures (sound/air/gear limitations) at the climax could have pushed into 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are clear: expose truth/use the stillpoint versus maintaining protective myths and the orchard’s safety. Escalation proceeds through discovery and decoding, culminating in a morally freighted choice. Pressure is coherent but mostly internal; absence of external resistance or tangible cost on the page keeps the tightening from fully biting. The final choice forecloses a path, but its price remains implied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus comforting lies integrates with the stillpoint concept and Elias’s vocation; the orchard reframes “miracle” as science. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing, leaving a resonant dilemma. Subtext around exploitation and protection lingers. A touch less explicit labeling (“this wasn’t magic, but exploitable science”) would heighten subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady, close third with a controlled, spare cadence that fits a skeptical debunker. Diction and certainty stay within what Elias could plausibly infer; the letters’ content is integrated cleanly. No dialogue, but the narrative voice carries momentum. Occasional elevated phrasing is fine but not especially idiosyncratic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear and efficient with good image economy (meters dipping, “inner fire,” shredded letters mosaic). Minor clichés and light scaffolding (“his heart raced,” “curiosity gnawed”) appear but don’t stall momentum. The expository reveal via letters is handled with tactile action, not a dump. Greater syntactic variety at the end could sharpen the final beat’s charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stillpoint diamond as a scientific oasis in a radioactive wasteland feels fresh and thematically apt, and the shredded‑letters method adds texture. The debunker protagonist and post‑apoc setting are familiar, but the synthesis reads coherent and specific. The ethical charged poise at the end avoids neat answers. Not radical, but confidently executed.</comment>
