<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Thorne’s motive and tactic are clear and consistent, and his endurance reads as a credible, earned stance. However, interiority is sparse and largely archetypal; we get little contradictory impulse or embodied emotional texture under pressure. The micro-choices (ritual, cadence, teaching by modeling) track, but conflict inside him is minimal. His departure suggests cost (solitude), but it lands more as function than character wound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition builds to a cadence shift as others join and the bells chime. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the town moves from hush to living whisper, and Thorne exits with balance restored. Cost is implicit (time, vigilance, self-effacement), a touch light but present on the page. Orientation is clean from the archway onward; temporal wideness is taught and consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the archway, cobblestones, and tower aren’t postcards—they function as tools and stage the ritual. The tuning fork on stone and steps on cobbles literalize the method; the archway “witness” charges the final image. Sensory selection fits the lyric hush, with consistent world rules. A hair shy of 9+ only because environmental constraint, while strong, never forces a hard tactical trade-off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (revive Eldridge before collapse), and escalation occurs via density: from solitary ritual to communal heartbeat to bells. The tightening is felt when others join and the tremors ease, but explicit costs or squeezed options remain gentle. Resolution stems from Thorne’s sustained agency, not coincidence. Pressure fits the accumulative lens but never truly bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Harmony, community, and balance emerge organically through image and action (fork note, foot cadence, bells realigned). The “wild hush” to “living whisper” shift is a resonant answer to the theme. Occasional direct statements (“greed fractured the town’s soul”) edge toward telling, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the closing image reframes prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-modulated; distance stays steady with no head-hopping. Diction supports the hush and ritual without register slips. No dialogue is needed; rhythm in sentences mirrors the method. Minor repetition is intentional and pattern-taught.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and economical, with images doing multiple jobs (archway as sentinel, witness, and instrument). Some repeated formulations and adjective stacks risk mild redundancy (“infinitely patient” recurs), but they generally serve cadence. No figurative muddle or scaffolding that obscures action. Momentum sustains through accumulative beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—revival by communal footfall calibrated by a bell tuner’s fork—is fresh and specific. Familiar ruins/ghost-town tropes are reanimated by the particular method and tonal control. The ending’s quiet departure avoids cliché by honoring the premise’s logic. Not a radical risk, but confidently distinct.</comment>
