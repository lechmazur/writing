<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation—seeking beauty in the unfinished—drives all choices, culminating in the vow. Interiority is sensorial and particular (acoustic bias), but internal contradiction is minimal, so pressure feels gentle rather than contested. The ritual vow functions as an Earned Stasis, with a conceptual cost (renouncing completion). A touch more friction or doubt in the lead-up would deepen character texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → preparation → ritual → release, each deepening the sound motif. Closure lands on the page via the unbinding and vow, with a felt conceptual cost and a clear before/after of the hush. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence is strong. The causal scaffold is elegant, though the pressure never tightens beyond the ritual stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Vivid, specific environment that filters through sound; shipwrecks and greenhouse are not postcards—they supply driftwood, frame acoustics, and charge the final image. Recurring objects (glass dome, branches, ribs of ships) evolve under firelight and water. The setting meaningfully shapes tactics (bonfire materials, sanctuary containment). Minor note: one or two fewer decorative images would keep spotlight on the constraining details.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the trapped resonance without shattering the hush—is legible. Escalation reads as a purposeful cadence shift when the vow triggers unbinding; the price is a renunciation of completion. Pressure is coherent but low-threat; no genuine alternative path is tested on-page. The earned resolution still feels grounded in agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of embracing incompletion emerges organically from action, sound, and ritual, with a strong final image that reweights the world. The explicit vow risks minor overstatement but remains diegetic and earned by tradition. The echoes’ mingling with ambient ruin lands as conceptual repricing rather than a tidy moral. Subtext lives in the choice to accept “becoming” over closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: an ear‑led sensibility governs diction and imagery. Rhythm is controlled and modulates well from hush to release. POV distance remains steady; no head‑hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Lyric texture stays legible under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet generally precise; images often do double duty, advancing mood and action. Minor repetition (“chronic hush”) skirts redundancy without dulling momentum. Figurative language remains coherent; no mixed metaphors at the peak. A light trim of modifiers would heighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: post‑burn soundscape, shipwreck ring, and a humming mendicant bowl threaded through a bonfire‑story ritual. The unbinding as music release rather than spectacle feels fresh and inevitable. Risks are tasteful and coherent, not gimmicks. The conceptual cost is specific and memorable.</comment>
