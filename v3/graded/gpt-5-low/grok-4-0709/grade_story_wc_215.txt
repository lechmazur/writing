<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motives are clear and consistent—preserve the unspoken—and his choices (to unearth, to gaze rather than pry, to enshrine) align with his tranquil perceptiveness. The emotional cost is mostly internal and quiet, but present in his refusal to open the box and his acceptance of guardianship. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than dramatized, limiting intensity. The Mira ghost beat reveals character through restraint rather than confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: discovery → contemplation → apparition → inscription → vow → placement. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a conceptual cost—the burden of carrying what remains unspoken—made legible by the hive placement. Orientation is swift and stable; no lens ambiguity. The causal links are soft but purposeful, in line with the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The oasis, hives, heat, and ghosts are vivid and POV-filtered; light through stained glass creates a charged atmosphere that informs meaning. The setting materially shapes the ending choice (placing the box in the largest hive, guarded by bees). Sensory balance leans visual but supports tone and theme. World rules (visible ghosts) stay consistent and are learned through observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: whether and how to honor unspoken words. Pressure deepens when Mira’s ghost appears and the inscription is revealed, nudging a choice between prying and reverent preservation; he pays the price of renunciation. The escalation is quiet but definite, appropriate for the mode. A narrower, sharper on-page dilemma could have heightened cost visibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of silence, covenant, and preservation emerge organically through image (bees/flowers, stained glass, hum/ghosts) rather than thesis. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing—unspoken words preserved “like honey in a comb.” Subtext operates through gesture and light rather than declaration. Complexity persists, with love’s burden honored and accepted rather than explained away.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, calm, and lucid, matching Elias’s temperament; it modulates gently as pressure grows. No dialogue, but narrative rhythm carries subtext and action cleanly. Diction fits the lyric mode without head-hopping or register slips. The perceptual signature—quiet noticing and inference—feels specific to this character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and image-dense with minimal scaffolding; sentences carry atmosphere and action together. A few elevated phrases skirt purple but remain coherent and purposeful. Cadence varies enough to maintain momentum. The closing lines are clean and decisive without explanatory drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Beekeeping in a scorched wasteland plus visible ghosts and a stained-glass reliquary for unspoken words is a fresh synthesis. The choice to gaze and decode through light and pattern, rather than open, reorients expected beats. The final hive-guarded preservation is both specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking stays coherent and pays off at closure.</comment>
