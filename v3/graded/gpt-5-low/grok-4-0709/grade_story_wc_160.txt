<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (bridge sacred and extractive aims) and embodied emotion (“dappled resolve,” hands trembling). Micro‑choices—investigate adhesive, decode, integrate chain—track with his competence. However, internal contradiction is modest and pressure light; doubt doesn’t force a costly trade. The resolution reads emotionally sincere but largely untested by opposing forces on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. Because he finds the chain/envelope → he analyzes adhesive → deciphers plea → retools design → first gate trembles into place. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (committing to measured compromise), but the on‑page cost is soft. Orientation is clean; single scene coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dormant volcano and breathing amphitheater are vivid and consistently filtered through a machinist’s eye. The chain functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image when built into the mechanism. Environmental pressure is more tonal than constraining—lava risk is abstract rather than immediate—limiting top‑band eligibility. Still, specificity and atmosphere are strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear, but escalation is gentle: discovery → decoding → implementation without a substantive squeeze or reversal. No antagonist or material obstacle appears on the page to force a trade‑off. The “breathing” clock adds texture, not pressure. The final act is earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of balance, stewardship, and “measured mercy” cohere through the chain and adhesive code. However, Mira’s explicit plea (“Preserve the heart…”) tips toward moral statement over subtext. The ending’s harmony is tidy, with limited ambiguity or lingering cost. Resonance arises from images more than discovery under duress.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person close with a machinist’s perceptual bias; rhythm is confident. Diction sometimes edges purple (“building breathed,” repeated), but voice stays coherent. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Modulation under pressure is present but not sharply tightened by crisis.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with purposeful imagery and clear sequencing. Figurative density is high, occasionally redundant (“building breathed” recurs) and risks purple, but clarity holds. Minimal scaffold; sentences generally carry multiple jobs. Greater variation and restraint at peak beats would sharpen momentum and impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: encoded adhesive, a surveyor’s chain repurposed as calibration, and “encrypted compassion” as engineering ethic. The setting and method feel fresh without gimmickry. The solution arrives smoothly, limiting surprise; risk is conceptual rather than dramatic. Still, the combination reads singular and memorable.</comment>
