<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s guardedness, craft, and longing for transparency drive concrete choices (taking the tickets, using the lens, stepping into the open to risk disclosure). The vulnerability cost is present but lightly paid; the visitor’s easy receptivity softens the crucible. Embodied moments (trembling fingers, cool damp air) anchor his interior shift. A few summary lines (“His motivation burned quietly”) flatten nuance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal dominance: find tickets → read visions → choose to project his own → mutual thaw. Closure is a Decisive Change—he abandons isolating eavesdropping for transparent self‑exposure—with an on‑page act and a felt emotional price. The sequence is coherent and continuous; orientation is clear early. Cost lands, though the resolution meets minimal resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt, rain hush, and projector lens light are vivid and functional; the crystals’ light and “whispers” directly enable the visioning and embolden the choice. Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered, sustaining tone without museum‑tour excess. World rules (wordless confessions, lens mechanics) stay consistent through action. Strong charge in the final image with the glistening crystals reflecting a reconfigured world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal trust vs isolation; escalation tightens when Elias moves from covert eavesdropping to public projection, foreclosing safety. Pressure coheres under the silent‑world constraint and the ambiguous visions that demand interpretation. The cost—risking honesty—is clear but the counterforce (the visitor’s possible rejection) never bites, so peak tension is moderate. Still, the turn is earned and consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme arises largely through images (tickets, lens, rain, crystalline hush) culminating in mutual exposure; the final exchange reweights mistrust into connection. However, the explicit thesis line (“The core concept crystallized: freed by honesty…”) is a Thematic Echo that overstates what the scene already shows, dulling resonance. Subtext otherwise functions through gesture and shared vision. The ambiguity of the visions nicely resists tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled close third with a distinct, quiet lyric texture aligned to Elias’s sensibility. Patterned diction (“whisper,” “hush,” “ambiguously clear”) supports the design without head‑hopping or stance drift. Purposeful compression reads natural in this mode; no gratuitous withholding. Minor register lifts occur but remain voice‑coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are clean, rhythmic, and image‑dense with generally high information value; action and reflection braid smoothly. Occasional purple pressure and small redundancies (reiterated motifs and concept labels) slightly slow momentum. Figurative logic holds; no mixed metaphors in critical beats. The final cadence lands with clarity and image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The confessional doodles on old tickets, the salvaged projector lens, and the crystal forecourt form a fresh synthesis that feels organic. The silent‑era premise is used to alter tactics, not just mood. The turn to mutual projection feels inevitable in hindsight given the tools and rules taught. Risk comes from committing to a quiet, lyric close—and it works.</comment>
