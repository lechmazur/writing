<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motive (to eulogize the living and understand healing) drives a concrete ritual choice. Interiority is vivid and embodied (thread’s pulse, garden’s hush), with a credible price—accepting solitude. Contradiction (yearning for Mira vs. renunciation) is present but softly rendered, keeping pressure modest. No false epiphany, but the internal struggle could tighten under sharper on‑page friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds through ritual focus to a reweighted understanding (CR/Earned Stasis). Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the thread object stitches beats together cleanly. Closure lands on the page with cost—he remains alone, altered by acceptance. The turn is subtle rather than dramatic, but coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The garden and the weft thread are sensorially rich and POV‑filtered; details serve mood and action. The thread functions as micro‑setting/object, charging the final image (warming, guiding, cooling). Seasonal and spatial specificity stay consistent and purposeful. Lushness rarely over-spills into static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reframing Mira’s absence—tightens through the ritual as the thread heats and directs the projection, culminating in spoken obituary and acceptance. Cost is emotional and legible (remaining alone, foreclosing reunion). Escalation is felt as a density/cadence shift rather than reversals, appropriate to the chosen lens. A slightly sharper mid‑pressure complication could have heightened the price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of “explained absences” emerges through image and act, but is also stated outright (“not voids to be mourned, but spaces deliberately carved”), blunting subtext. The final rose/coming frost image resonates and fits the cost of acceptance. Insights feel earned by ritual rather than grafted on, though a lighter touch would deepen afterglow. Emotional honesty holds without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent single-POV lyric voice with controlled elevation and rhythmic variation. Diction suits the character’s sensibility and the piece’s aims; the one line of addressed speech lands with intent. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. At peaks, the register borders on ornate but remains legible and voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, with high information density; recurring images do double duty. Some purple tendencies and near‑synonym lushness (e.g., layered modifiers) risk saturation. Minimal repetition and solid cadence keep momentum. Tightening a few high‑ornament sentences would sharpen impact further.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Obituaries for the living” combined with a talismanic thread and projection ritual is a fresh synthesis. The piece commits to its conceit without hedging, and the final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. The novelty serves emotional truth rather than mere ornament.</comment>
