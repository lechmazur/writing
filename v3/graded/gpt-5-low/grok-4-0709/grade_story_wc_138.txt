<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s motive—escape from immortal boredom by finding the “after‑goodbye”—is clear and consistent, and her tactics (coaxing fields, aligning runes) align with it. Interiority is textured and embodied through sensory anchors (the storm’s vibration through her bones), though internal contradiction remains relatively simple (yearning for end vs. curse’s anchor). Micro‑choices under pressure register—she chooses subtlety over force. The cost lands via the fragment’s shattering, earning a modest but credible change in stance at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain is solid: storm → manipulation via amulet → mutiny → glimpse → curse snapback → altered aftermath. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and holds through the climax. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the fragment breaks and she returns changed. Minor abstraction in mechanics never breaks causality or the ending’s legibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vivid and consequential—its prisms fracture, warp, and ultimately shatter, directly shaping options and the climax image. Environmental specifics (refractive walls, iridescent floor) are filtered through Elowen’s priorities and used tactically. The setting’s properties constrain and enable choices, not just decorate. The final stasis is charged by the altered place and object states.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (breach the after‑goodbye or remain cursed) and escalate coherently with the storm’s peak. The tightening turn occurs when the curse fights back, forcing her to spend the amulet (it shatters) to win a partial vision. Agency drives the pressure; she adapts from “forcing” to “coaxing” as tactics deepen. The price is unmistakable and alters future options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece interrogates “what happens after goodbye” and lands on a non‑literal answer (renewal vs. oblivion) earned through the experience of the breach. Recurring images (light fractures, hushed thunder) accrue thematic weight without overt moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—knowledge comes in “fragments,” tempering boredom rather than banishing it. A hair of direct statement remains, but it doesn’t blunt resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (physics filtered through emotion: “magnetic fields like threads in a loom”). Rhythm modulates well at peak beats; compression stays legible. Repetition of key phrases is intentional if a touch insistent. No POV leakage or unearned certainty beyond Elowen’s established dimensional awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are generally precise and propulsive, balancing image with action; information density is high. There’s minor purple saturation (“spatial mutiny” and “hushed thunder” recur) and occasional near‑duplicates that could be trimmed. Metaphor vehicles remain coherent to the world’s physics and don’t muddle the climax. Momentum is preserved through the breach and snapback.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—immortal ennui, a prism refuge, a magnetic‑field‑induced “spatial mutiny”—feels fresh and thematically aligned. The risk of a quiet, conceptual climax pays off with a charged image and tangible cost. Familiar elements (immortality, cursed object) are transformed by specific tactics and tone. Nothing reads like a template twist or borrowed set‑piece.</comment>
