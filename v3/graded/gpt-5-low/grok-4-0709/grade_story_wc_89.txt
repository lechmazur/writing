<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (reforge the bond with Thorne) is clear and intensifies under pressure, with credible reluctance about losing her human self. Micro‑choices—harvesting spices, lighting the circle, continuing the chant as feathers erupt—track her value hierarchy. The cost (accepting hybrid form) is earned and felt. Interiority stays character‑specific through sensory filters rather than label‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: fortune → decision → spices ritual → involuntary metamorphosis → surrender → merger. Closure lands on the page with cost as she stabilizes into a hybrid and the bond is reforged. The Causal lens holds throughout, with no orientation debt. No late rule change undercuts the ending; the phoenix‑spice logic is seeded before use.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The orchard under permanent moonlight is vivid and functional; the “heart where moonlight pooled like liquid silver” directly stages the ritual. Details like runed bark, crystalline pod, and spice smoke integrate with action rather than pausing it. The environment charges the final image (soaring over the moonlit orchard) and anchors the thematic contrast between constancy and change.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bond vs. loss of self) is signaled early and tightens when the metamorphosis starts without her full assent. The meaningful turn is her surrender to transformation, foreclosing the path of remaining human. Cost is legible and carries into the ending. Tension coheres without needing an external antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of transformation vs. constancy and love’s cost emerge organically through image (permanent moonlight, steady bloom) and choice (accepting a hybrid self). The fortune risks on‑the‑nose statement but earns its place by reweighting the final surrender. The closing flight reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext hums in how steadiness “anchors” her acceptance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third carries a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit a fable‑myth register. Psychic distance remains stable and modulates well during stress. Minor repetition of key phrases (“cosmic intimacy”) slightly narrows the palette but doesn’t blur POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is lush and mostly controlled, with strong sensory layering, but density occasionally tips toward purple (stacked modifiers and recurring cosmic metaphors). A few repetitions (“paradoxically steady bloom,” “cosmic intimacy”) create light echo. Clarity remains intact and momentum holds through the ritual.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—fortune cookie in a moonlit fable orchard, phoenix‑flame spices, griffin‑human merger—feels genuine and specific. Familiar metamorphosis and rebirth tropes are re‑angled through concrete, idiosyncratic details. The final reconfiguration reads inevitable from the seeded elements.</comment>
