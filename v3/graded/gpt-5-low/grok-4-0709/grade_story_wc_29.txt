<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent—outwit the tricksters to protect a fracturing community—and her micro-choices (calibration, masking the broadcast) align under pressure. The “cautiously hopeful” contradiction is present on the page and informs her restraint. However, internal conflict remains modest; competence outpaces visible doubt or cost. The ending’s vigilance implies price, but we don’t feel a sharp personal cost in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: identification of threat → plan → targeted broadcast → measurable external effect. Orientation is crisp from the opening—who/where/what are legible—and the decisive flip of the switch provides closure. Cost is comparatively light, landing as ongoing vigilance rather than an on-page sacrifice, which trims impact. Still, the arc resolves the dominant stake for the night with coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The radio station and its tools (ancient transmitter, antenna, subsonic emitter) are tactile and central, constraining tactics and making the solution plausible. Sensory detail (“stale coffee and ozone,” “flicker of a single bulb”) builds atmosphere without bloat. The setting charges the final image—the hum and charts—and remains integrated with action. Only a hair shy of transcendent because the environment rarely pushes back or exacts a concrete price.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent escalation into violence—is signaled early and tightened by the countdown to the night’s protest. Agency drives the turn; her interference produces a reversal (crowd calms, tricksters recoil). The cost remains mostly conceptual; there’s little loss or trade-off that narrows future options beyond vigilance. Tension is steady, but the pressure doesn’t quite bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: manipulation via unseen frequencies, the ethics of intervention, and knowledge as a tool to mend division. The final image offers a quiet, earned repricing—victory as temporary, vigilance required—without moralizing. Expository lines about “harvesting emotional energies” edge toward telling, flattening subtext. The piece invites reflection but skews explicit over suggestive at key moments.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third-person close POV is stable and confident, with a controlled lyric texture that fits Elara’s technical yet sensory mind. Diction generally matches the character and context, and rhythm modulates well around the switch-flip climax. There’s no dialogue to test, but internal cadence remains specific rather than generic. Occasional repeated formulations (“power plays”) create minor tonal stiffness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and largely economical, with strong sensory layering and purposeful verbs. Minor redundancy and abstract phrasing (“deliberate power plays,” “ethereal entities”) soften edge and slightly slow momentum. Syntax varies and carries the scene through the decisive act cleanly. No significant figurative muddle, but a few conceptual restatements could be trimmed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of college radio grit with cosmic tricksters manipulating subsonic mood control feels fresh and specific. The method-of-interference angle gives the premise a tactile anchor beyond trope. Some elements (emotional-harvest tricksters) echo genre patterns without deep subversion. The execution is cohesive and particular enough to rise above template.</comment>
