<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—preserving communal trust under pressure—is clear and consistently drives her choices. Embodied interiority through the parachute buckle and muscle memory grounds her competence. However, internal contradiction is light; doubt and fear never notably deform her actions, keeping the arc comfortably competent rather than fraught. The final stance (calm broadcast, plan enacted) feels earned but low on visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: storm clears → radio reveals fractures and updrafts → initial plan invalid → she revises → evacuation begins. Closure lands with Charged Poise: the descent starts and hope replaces dread. The cost is implied risk and foreclosing the glider plan rather than a concrete loss, but it’s legible at this scale. Orientation is solid early; the causal lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arbor above clouds, bioluminescent vines, and updrafts are not decorative: they constrain tactics (gliders become risky; vines enable tethers) and charge the final image. The parachute buckle as micro‑setting/tool recurs and anchors decisions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with atmosphere integrated into action. World rules remain consistent and learned via use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and coherent: protect lives and trust amidst structural failure and unstable winds. Escalation tightens when the radio contradicts the original plan, forcing a trade‑off and swift revision. Agency drives the turn, though the on‑page price is mild (no tangible loss or near‑miss). Tension is carried more by imagined peril than a dramatized setback.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, earned trust, and embodied knowledge emerge from concrete particulars (buckle, drills, silent arbor). The “soundless echo” motif accrues meaning and modulates the final hope‑toned image. Occasional explicit statement (“to preserve trust under pressure”) trims subtlety. Still, the ending reweights prior images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a lucid, lyric texture suited to high‑altitude vigilance. Diction and rhythm are consistent; brief radio dialogue is functional and in character. Repetition of the “soundless echo” risks monotony but remains purposeful. POV modesty holds; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, with strong verb choices and tactile specificity; the buckle sequence delivers crisp kinetics. Some redundancies and motif reiterations (“soundless,” “echo”) verge on purple in clusters. Pace holds, though a few paraphrase echoes could be tightened. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor above clouds and vine‑tethered parachute formations feel fresh and integrated, not ornamental. The muscle‑memory method as tactical engine is a smart, specific twist. While the core “leader revises plan under pressure” trope is familiar, execution and particulars differentiate it. Risks are measured and coherent, yielding a memorable texture.</comment>
