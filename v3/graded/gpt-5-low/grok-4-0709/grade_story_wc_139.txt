<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and specific—an honest child seeking a “mathematics of a fair trade”—and choices (testing the ink, deciding to breach) align under pressure. The internal contradiction (honesty vs. deceit) is dramatized rather than labeled, with the ink catalyzing a morally costly shift. Some thematic repetition slightly flattens the texture of interiority. The closing act—granting asylum despite “alerts”—reads as an earned stance with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: preparation → window → breach → outcome, with the ink’s effect motivating the decisive act. Orientation is clear early (prep room, casket, laptop, midnight clock), and the single-scene structure stays tight. Closure lands on-page with cost (“alerts would come”) and a reconfigured self (closing the casket). Minor convenience around the breach’s ease keeps it just below exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is tactile and specific (embalming tools, refrigeration hum) and the “deathly vitality” tone pervades action, not just description. The environment charges the final image (closing the casket amid humming units) and frames the illicit work. While the setting doesn’t constrain tactics mechanically, it coheres with stakes and outcome. Detail remains purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (Elena’s asylum) and tightens via the midnight window and Alex’s ethical compromise. The “active waiting” deepens pressure credibly, and the breach is an earned turn. The cost is present (legal risk, moral compromise) though the on-page resistance during the hack is light. The internal and external conflicts interlock effectively at the climax.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: equity versus deceit, bureaucracy versus liquefied rigidity, life balanced against legacy. The ink’s property and the funeral home’s liminal space refract the moral calculus in images rather than argument. A few explicit thesis lines (“mathematics of a fair trade”) curb subtlety, but the final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. Resonance lingers in the cost of chosen deceit to preserve justice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, slightly lyric texture that suits the premise; no head-hopping or stance slippage. Diction tracks the character’s analytic bent without drifting into sterile jargon. Rhythm modulates well between atmospheric description and clock-driven urgency. Minor abstraction repeats but does not blur focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sensory, and mostly high-density; metaphor and image carry multiple jobs (tone, setting, psychology). Some phrase recurrence (“deathly vitality,” “mathematics of a fair trade,” “liquefied rigidity”) edges toward redundancy but stops short of loops that stall momentum. Syntax varies, and the final lines land crisply. No muddled figuratives in the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blend of funeral-home noir, a magical ink that alters cognition, and a principled breach for asylum feels fresh and coherent. The “honest con” calculus is a non-obvious inflection that reconfigures familiar hacker/forgery tropes. Choices grow organically from the premise, with the final casket-close as a striking, specific image. Small risks (lyric tone with procedural stakes) pay off.</comment>
