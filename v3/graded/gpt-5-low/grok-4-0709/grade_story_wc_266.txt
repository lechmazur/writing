<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and steady, and key micro‑choices (offering the fear‑scrap, accepting indirect routes, boarding) align with it. Interiority is evocative but skews archetypal, with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The guides function as presences more than pressures, though their gentle insistence frames her choices. The cost of change is present but soft‑focused, more symbolic than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the tale tightens from approach → punch → hidden paths → ferry, ending in a Charged Poise as she commits to the crossing. Orientation is clear early and maintained. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (foreclosing the “leash” life, accepting slow, indirect passage). The because/therefore chain is slender but coherent for a lyric piece.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, fog, cliff‑hugging paths, and concealed cove are vivid and integrated into action. Environment shapes tactics (indirect routes, narrow ledges, hidden ferry), not just mood. Recurring sea/lullaby details charge the final image. Specificity is strong without over‑touristing the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes (will she commit to the arduous, indirect crossing to awaken courage) are signaled early and deepen once the ticket is punched and the hidden path demands trust. Escalation is gentle but real, culminating in the boat’s departure. Costs remain primarily conceptual, with little on‑page sacrifice beyond the fear‑scrap and acceptance of delay. Pressure coheres, if quietly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Themes of patience, indirectness, and courage awakening accrue through recurring images (leash, star stamp, lullaby, vigil) and culminate in the ferry crossing. One line states the thesis explicitly (“You seek what lies unused within”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, the ending reweights earlier motifs convincingly. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third‑person close lyric voice is consistent and modulates well with the scene’s hush. Dialogue is minimal but natural and subtextually aligned with the guides’ ethos. Diction fits the atmosphere without head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm supports the gentle build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are polished, with varied syntax and purposeful echoes; information density is good for a lyric mode. Occasional purple notes (“eyes like polished shells,” “velvet hush”) and safe metaphors appear but don’t cloud clarity. Minimal redundancy, clean mechanics, and a strong final image. Momentum is maintained despite the contemplative pace.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Archetypal materials (ferry guides, twilight crossing) are rendered with a fresh, hushed tenderness and a specific tool (star punch) that recurs. The indirect‑routes ethos gives a modestly distinctive slant. Emotional truth is steady, if not surprising. Ingenuity rests more in integration than invention.</comment>
