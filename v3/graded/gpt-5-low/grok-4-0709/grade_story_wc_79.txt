<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is precise and sustained, and the taboo-breaking crack embodies a credible cost. Interiority is present (“trembling hands,” sacred violation) but remains more summarized than pressure-damaged, with limited contradictory impulses on the page. The choice to break a sacred shell is well motivated by months of work and the city’s dread. The ending stance—choosing to face mind-shattering watchers—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: research → deciphered path → forbidden crack → scroll revelation → whistle call → watchers stir → departure. Closure lands as Charged Poise with visible cost and narrowed options. Orientation is clear early and the lens holds. The scroll is an efficient but slightly expository device rather than an embodied confrontation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shell-city, sacred taboos, watchers, and rusted gate are vividly integrated and influence choices. Details consistently filter through a cartographer’s priorities and charge the final image. The environment constrains tactics (forbidden shell, isolation) and infuses tone. Minor opportunity remains to show physical navigation costs in the final approach.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: seek truth from the watchers at risk of sanity and sacrilege. Escalation tightens via the taboo act, the terrible revelation, and then provoking a response with the whistle. Cost is legible (sacred violation, implied mind-shattering risk) and the final choice forecloses safety. A direct adversarial beat is deferred, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of knowledge versus taboo, surveillance, and living on slumbering power emerge through concrete acts and the scroll’s repricing of the city. The final image reweights the world (watchers stir; turtles may awaken) without moralizing. The reed whistle as patterned language bridges method and meaning. Slightly didactic scroll exposition keeps it shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, luminous third-person voice with consistent focalization fits the material. Diction and rhythm support the sunwashed dread without head‑hopping. Occasional lushness edges toward purple but maintains clarity. No dialogue, but the voice carries action and interiority well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences are purposeful with strong imagery and momentum; little scaffold or looping. Figurative density is high yet coherent, supporting mood rather than muddling action. Key beats (the crack, the scroll, the whistle) are crisp. A touch of ornamental phrasing keeps it below the highest band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The turtle‑city, spiral cartography, pattern languages, and watcher‑curse synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The slumbering‑turtles reveal reprices the whole setting with thematic bite. Risks are taken without sacrificing clarity. Minor reliance on a revealing document, rather than pure scene, tempers the ceiling.</comment>
