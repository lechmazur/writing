<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elowen’s drive “to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows” is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (ascending, igniting, adjusting facets) align with that motive. The interior contradiction—joy veiled by foreboding—adds texture but seldom forces a costly trade‑off. Emotional embodiment is largely atmospheric rather than visceral. The final acceptance of a charged role lands, but with limited felt price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the ritual intensifies toward a conceptually reweighted final image (shadows woven into renewal) with her laughter foreshadowing a blackout. Closure reads as conceptual repricing/charged poise more than decisive change; cost is implied rather than dramatized. Orientation is clean and the scene holds one coherent throughline. A sharper on‑page price at the end would elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and the glass‑wick lantern are vivid, integrated, and function as tool‑as‑setting that shapes tactics. Spatial clarity (stairs, apex, lantern) and rule‑logic (total internal reflection) are consistent and charged in the final image. Atmosphere and specificity serve theme without tourist cataloging. Constraint is soft but present through the lantern’s mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (clarity versus information storms) is signaled early, and escalation arrives through intensifying light and the guided beams. However, opposition is minimal and options are not meaningfully foreclosed; the ritual proceeds largely unhindered. The prophetic laugh complicates context but doesn’t force a trade‑off on the page. Tension is lyric rather than conflict‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—reviving communal wisdom versus flickering data—is woven through object, setting, and ritual and reweighted by the final silhouettes. Subtext operates in image (old glooms repurposed) rather than moralizing, with a lingering ambiguity about cost. A few declaratives (“She believed…”) verge on telling but do not swamp the scene. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature sustains coherence; diction matches the mythic register. Rhythm modulates as the ritual intensifies, and focalization stays stable. No dialogue needed; the narrative stance feels confidently singular. Occasional purple edges, but the voice remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet generally precise, with strong verbs and clean sequencing; the optics metaphor is handled clearly. Some density and repeated constructions risk over‑richness, but momentum holds and lines often do multiple jobs. No major loops or scaffold; imagery coheres. A touch more concision in mid‑paragraph explication would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of arcane optics, a spectral storm herald, and a post‑print world feels fresh and inevitable by the end. The glass wick/total internal reflection conceit is inventive and meaningfully tied to stakes and closure. Risks in tone and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity could deepen, but the vision is singular.</comment>
