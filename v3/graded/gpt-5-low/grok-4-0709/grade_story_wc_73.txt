<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—revisiting the “texture of a missed opportunity” to crack the staircase—drives concrete choices (dice-guided theorem, extending the proof). Interiority is specific and character‑rooted (mathematician’s lens, chipped die as flaw). A credible endurance-to-action shift culminates in stepping through the door. Contradictory impulses (grim optimism vs suspicion of illusion) surface at the end without neat resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: resolve to disprove, methodical proof, Q.E.D., tremor, door. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a felt conceptual cost (freedom may be another loop). The hybrid causal/accumulative build holds consistently and the final image pays off set‑ups. No orientation debt; single‑scene focus remains tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is vivid and functional—its boundlessness constrains tactics and defines the goal. Micro‑setting details (cold stone, echoing steps) support mood and choice. The dice operate as charged objects within the space and return at the end. A bit more tactile evolution of the environment under strain could push higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape/understanding) is clear and tightens as he commits to the proof. Escalation is intellectual but consequential; the tremor and door serve as the earned turn. The cost is largely conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening pressure. Still, agency drives the reversal rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Regret, chance vs determinism, and the impossibility of perpetual motion braid into a coherent theme. The chipped die and the proof reweight the final image without moralizing. Occasional explicit statements (“recalling the laws of thermodynamics”) lean didactic, but the ending’s ambiguity resists tidy moral closure. Resonance lingers in the charged uncertainty of freedom.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third‑person limited is steady, with a mathematician’s lexicon that fits the character. Rhythmic control and image selection suit the contemplative pressure. The academic register edges close to expositional at times but remains voice‑motivated. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, economical, and mostly propulsive; repeated motifs do double duty. Minor tell‑leaning exposition of proofs slightly dulls immediacy but doesn’t stall momentum. No significant loops or figurative muddle at the climax. Final lines land crisply with image and implication.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a mathematician dismantles an impossible space via proof to rupture a metaphysical trap, with dice as fate/imperfection. The paradox of perpetual motion turned against itself feels earned and non‑obvious. Risks are coherent and pay off in a charged final step. A touch more singular sensory strangeness could heighten distinctiveness.</comment>
