<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—honoring Mira’s promise reframes his arsonist guilt into a preservational drive. Interiority is particular (tracing chisel scars; tears as “volcanic tenderness”), and micro‑choices (inferring the alcove, decoding the cuts, deciding to recreate the tapestry) reveal character under pressure. The internal contradiction—destroyer vs guardian—feels earned at the end. Minor weakness: the intellect rarely misfires; struggle costs are mostly emotional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a sequence of artworks narrows toward the tapestry and final recreation. Closure lands on‑page as a conceptual repricing of his arson—now a sanctioned role by the lost civilization—at evident emotional cost. Causality is tight enough (“because” moves from relief → mosaic → portrait → tapestry → portrayal). Slight convenience in the pattern intuitions, but it’s seeded as trait.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archive is tactile and purposeful—relief, mosaic, portrait, and the floor become tools and constraints. Environment dictates tactics (follow the art; sketch on stone with charcoal) and charges the final image. Details are filtered through his analytical bias without tourist cataloging. Could use one more concrete sensory anchor beyond visual to reach the very top.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescuing the promise—tightens through the art‑trail deepening to the decisive act of portrayal. The key turn is the discovery behind the portrait and the choice to reconstruct, with an internal cost. Pressure is largely internal; absence of an external counterforce softens escalation. Still, the cadence shift to tears and redefinition reads earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Destruction vs preservation, love as an ethical fire, and heritage safeguarded from tyranny resonate through concrete images. The ending reweights his past arson without sermonizing, though “It spoke of the civilization’s final vow” edges toward explicitness. The recurring art objects carry subtext cleanly. Emotional aftereffect lingers as duty transformed by grief.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—analytic yet tender—holds steady. Diction and rhythm suit the subject; psychic distance tightens at the end without leakage. Some heightened metaphors recur (“volcanic tenderness”), flirting with overassertion, but voice remains coherent. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lines are generally clear with good propulsion, but density of figurative language and a few repeated constructions (“tender, volcanic”) verge on purple in peak beats. Minimal scaffold and clean sequencing help momentum. More varied sensory grounding and pruning of near‑duplicates would sharpen impact. Final image is intact despite minor overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—an arsonist decoding a vandalized self‑portrait via an art breadcrumb trail to redeem destruction as guardianship—feels fresh. The method (art as code) and tone (volcanic tenderness) create a memorable angle. Risks are integrated rather than gimmicky, though a few familiar lyric gestures blunt uniqueness. Overall, distinctive and coherent.</comment>
