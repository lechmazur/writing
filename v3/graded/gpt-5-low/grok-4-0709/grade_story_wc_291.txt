<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s prosopagnosia and cultivated detachment convincingly drive his method and choices, and the ribbon engages a credible curiosity. His internal shift toward empathy lands, but it’s largely told and tidy rather than pressured into being on the page. Micro-choices exist (pocketing the ribbon, returning to the quarry, submitting the portrait), yet struggle is smoothed by summary. Emotional contradiction (detachment vs. awakening) is present but under-dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Because-then beats track cleanly (find ribbon → research → identification → submission → memorial), and closure arrives with a decisive reconfiguration for Elias and the case. Cost is soft and mostly conceptual, but a before/after is legible. The structure leans on summary rather than scene pressure, reducing the felt consequence of turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The quarry and mist are vivid and recur to charge the opening and closing images; the ribbon functions as a concrete, worked object filtered through his professional eye. Atmosphere is specific and purposeful (“furrowed hush,” condensation, damp earth). While not heavily constraining tactics, the setting frames discovery and closure convincingly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming and humanizing Jane Doe while confronting Elias’s detachment—is clear, but escalation is mostly off‑stage. The identification leap (tying the ribbon to a specific 1987 ball) feels convenient and untested by counterpressure. The memorial payoff arrives without a meaningful on‑page cost or trade‑off, keeping tension moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “unifying opposites” motif threads through object, setting, and vocation and reweights the final image. However, the theme is articulated directly several times, edging toward thesis rather than subtext. Still, the last movement reframes the mask/grave and blindness/recognition in a resonant way without outright moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>A consistent, slightly austere third‑person close suits a methodical artist; diction and rhythm are controlled and cohesive. Voice carries procedural precision without head‑hopping. Some repeated formulations (“unify,” “lance,” “furrowed hush”) risk mannerism but do not break the spell. Elision of process is a choice that favors tone over kinetic immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and imagistic, with purposeful nouns and a steady cadence. There’s mild overwriting and motif repetition that borders on paraphrase loops (opposites, mist, hush), and a few abstract summaries flatten momentum. Clarity remains high, but the density occasionally dulls propulsion in key beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The face‑blind portraitist solving a purged cold case via a salvaged ribbon and art‑forensics offers a fresh synthesis. The “lance with a brush” conceit risks preciousness but distinguishes method and theme. Resolution is conventional (research link, authorities, memorial) yet the inner reconfiguration gives it a distinctive aftertaste. More on‑page friction would elevate originality into inevitability.</comment>
