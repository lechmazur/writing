<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s guilt-driven motive is clear and consistent, and her choices (prying open the desk, tethering with amber, tattooing herself) align under pressure. Interiority is present but could show more simultaneous contradictory impulses beyond remorse and resolve. The self‑tattoo beat nicely externalizes her internal cost. The forgiveness resolution lands but edges toward tidy, reducing lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: letters → hidden device → tether with amber → translation → return to storm → forgiveness. Closure is on the page with a resonant before/after as the guilt hushes and the daughter’s voice reframes the past. The method’s convenience (instructions solve each step) softens friction but doesn’t break logic. Cost is legible (self‑marking, emotional confrontation), sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly realized and functionally integrated; devices and resonators feel native to the choice architecture. The amber and console operate as charged objects that constrain tactics and infuse the final image. Sensory and tonal details cohere without museum‑tour excess. World rules (time fold, spectral code) stay consistent within the story’s frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption through connection) is signaled early and tightens through activation, tethering, and self‑tattoo. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, though opposition is soft and solutions arrive without significant setback. The return to the storm is a meaningful deepening that changes options. Emotional and bodily prices are present but not punishing, keeping tension modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, translation, and time’s reparative/illusory nature emerge organically from objects and actions. The amber and “meteor hush” shift from atmosphere to moral frame, reweighting the final hush. The explicit forgiveness line risks sentimentality but is supported by prior beats. Ambiguity remains about metaphysical cost, which helps the resonance linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A controlled lyrical voice with a distinct lexicon (“meteor hush,” “haunted firmware”) remains steady in close third. Diction suits the aestheticized world and modulates gently as pressure rises. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; elision is taught and paid off. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple but stay coherent with POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry strong image economy and momentum; most sentences do multiple jobs. Some metaphor density and repeated “hush/meteor” textures teeter on excess but don’t blur action. Minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies with good rhythm. The closure image is clean and not dulled by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattooist, haunted firmware translating infant cries, amber tether in a sound‑lab where time folds—feels fresh and organically interlocked. Turns grow from prior particulars rather than late rule changes. The conceptual risk pays off with a distinctive final cadence. Slight convenience prevents a higher tier, but the vision is memorable.</comment>
