<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—transmuting inherited harm into healing—is clear and embodied in the grafting ritual and nightly tending. Interiority is concrete (coin as scar, red thread as blood tie), though internal contradiction remains mild; she’s serene and assured rather than meaningfully torn. Micro-choices (mixing black sand, choosing lagoon brine, binding with the coin) reveal values under gentle pressure. The closing stance feels earned, if low‑conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual action accretes until the sapling sings, reweighting the premise. Orientation is clean from the outset; cause flows sensibly from objects and place. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—proof that scars can sing—though the on‑page cost is largely conceptual/emotional rather than actively contested. The scene keeps one locus, one stake, and a coherent cadence shift at the song.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and kelp form a tactile system that supplies resources (sand, brine) and charges the final image. Details are selective, professional bias peeks through her choices, and the environment shapes tactics rather than sitting as postcard. Tonal atmosphere matches thematic intent without over-explaining. Strong specificity with tools-as-setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (can scars become song?) but pressure is gentle; escalation is more cadence than conflict. The meaningful tightening is the completion of the graft and the later moment of song, with little risk or trade‑off tested on the page. No antagonist or failure beat probes her resolve. The price reads mostly in backstory and symbolic endurance rather than a live on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: coin as repurposed scar, red thread as blood tie, volcanic sand as renewal, culminating in communal witnessing of the tree’s song. Subtext arrives through image rather than sermon, with the final cadence reframing pain as generative. A few explicit statements (“to prove that scars can sing”) nudge toward tell, but the closing image earns the insight. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric third-person closely held to Elara is steady, with a distinct sensory and metaphorical palette. Rhythm and diction feel intentional and consistent; no head‑hopping. Slight lushness risks purple but stays legible and character‑motivated. The voice modulates at the song moment without breaking pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and mostly economical; recurring images do double duty thematically and atmospherically. Some phrases recur (“gracefully alert,” “kelp‑drift peace”), flirting with ornamental repetition, yet they function as motif more than filler. Figurative density is high but coherent; minimal scaffold. Syntax varies enough to maintain momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Arsonist’s daughter turned firefighter who grafts with a drilled coin at an obsidian lagoon is an original synthesis rendered with conviction. The singing‑scar tree gives a fresh magical realist turn grounded in lived textures. Risks are taken in tone and symbolism without obscuring clarity. Only the low on‑page pressure keeps it from the very top tier.</comment>
