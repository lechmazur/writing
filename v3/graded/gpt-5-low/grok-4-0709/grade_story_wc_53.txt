<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation to confront her ghost is clear and sustained, with embodied actions (wading, tuning the wheel) under pressure. Internal contradiction—ambition vs. eroded self—registers credibly without therapy-speak. The negotiation scene shows micro-choices and a values hierarchy, though the cost lands more as acceptance than sacrifice. Emotional beats are strong but slightly tidy at the end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: fragments → apparition → negotiation → reweighted stance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as regret becomes catalyst and options reconfigure (carousel hints movement). Orientation is intact early; stakes cohere around the reckoning. The cost is felt but soft, more conceptual than dramatized loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and skyborne carousel are vivid, rule-consistent, and filtered through Elara’s priorities. The disposable camera wheel functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains how she accesses whispers and charges the final image. Environmental dynamics (paused churn, pockets of calm) mirror and shape choice. Detail is purposeful and immersive without digressive cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconcile with ghost/self) is signaled and tightens through the ghost’s accusation and Elara’s counter-offer. The negotiation constitutes a meaningful deepening leading to stance crystallization. Prices are internal and implicit; no external option is clearly foreclosed beyond the old self-conception. Tension is steady but rarely knifes into unmistakable consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of ambition’s erosion and regret-as-catalyst emerges from concrete images (camera wheel frames, currents, eddies) and the negotiated truce. Subtext operates in the reweighting of stillness/kinetics and the spectral self as both indictment and resource. A few on-the-nose lines (“Ambitions erode”) dull subtlety slightly. The ending’s reshaped ambition avoids a moral and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close carries a distinct perceptual signature with controlled rhythm and diction. Psychic distance is stable; brief dialogue is spare and pressurized. Patterned elision around time confusion is taught early and paid off. Minor repetition of constructions keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient overall, with strong verbs and layered imagery (“mirror cracked but not yet shattered,” “wind into her memory’s spool”). Occasional purple overtones and echoing phrasing (“Ambitions erode”) introduce light redundancy. Momentum holds and the final cadence lands cleanly. No coherence errors or artifact loops that obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sky‑lagoon, halted carousel, and camera wheel-as-transducer feel fresh and organically tied to character and stakes. The ghost negotiation is familiar in concept but enlivened by specific world logic and images. Risk-taking in setting and object integration pays off without gimmickry. The turn is earned and non-obvious in execution.</comment>
