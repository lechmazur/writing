<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and coherent—preserve the sound of names—rooted in her craft and the recent self-forgiveness. Interiority is embodied through tactile work with rope and card, not just labels. Limited contradiction on the page (the guilt has already transformed), which slightly flattens live internal conflict. Micro-choices (how to rebraid, when to tug) align with “technically gentle” and reveal values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density and ritual action build to a resonant reconfiguration when light and voices emerge. Orientation is crisp early, and the sequence (study card → rebraid → tug → illumination/sound) reads clean. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the years lost and the charged relief of finally hearing the names. A hair of convenience remains (no on‑page risk of failure), but causality is intact for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sanctum, aurora, and rope are not backdrop; they constrain tactics and fuel the final image. Sensory specificity—ice crackle, prismatic light—stays tied to action. The environment’s rules (aurora channeled through reconfigured braids) are learned in use. The setting charges the ending as the light refracts and the runes and voices surface.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres through a ritual task that must be executed precisely. Escalation reads as a steady tightening from preparation to activation, culminating in illumination and voices. Cost is primarily emotional rather than a hard trade‑off; still, the risk of silence and the tremor in her hands lend tension. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of heritage, memory preservation, and self‑forgiveness emerge through concrete images (punched card as names; rope as voice‑binder). The final image reweights all motifs without overt moralizing. A couple of lines verge on tidy declarations (“ensuring the names would echo eternally”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Subtext largely lives in the labor and tools, not speeches.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is consistent and confident, with controlled distance and no head‑hopping. Diction is elevated but character‑plausible given the ritual frame and craft focus. Rhythmic modulation toward the climax supports the pressure. Minor repetition of coined phrases (“snowmelt ardor,” “technically gentle”) brushes self‑consciousness but doesn’t derail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are largely clear and purposeful, with good momentum through the procedural action. Occasional modifier stacks and repeated figuratives risk purple drift and slight redundancy. The cadence generally varies, though some parallel constructions recur. Closure image is clean and not muddled by figurative overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a lost‑wax caster decoding a street‑organ card to rebraid a shamanic rope under aurora to release ancestral names. The ingenuity feels organic to character and world, not gimmicky. The final reconfiguration is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Small risk is the comfort of a guaranteed success vibe, but the myth‑tech blend remains distinctive.</comment>
