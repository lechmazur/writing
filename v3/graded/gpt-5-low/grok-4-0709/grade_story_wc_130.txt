<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation (to solve grief by “mathematics of emotion”) is precise and drives every choice, with tactile anchors (the glass eyes, the tracing). Interiority is specific and character‑particular; doubt and hope coexist credibly. The final stance (quiet hope without certainty) reads earned. Minor softness: struggle feels slightly too smooth, with little resistance beyond mood.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The ritual’s patterned build (placing eyes, tracing chips, glow → vision) yields a clear RR/CR: reconfigured meaning of Mira’s disappearance with the cost of continued ambiguity. Orientation is crisp from the outset; single scene coherence holds. A slightly firmer price on the page (e.g., risk or sacrifice during the rite) could push higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard, skylight moon, stalactite drip, and mosaic are vivid and POV‑filtered, and the environment actively shapes tactics (moonlight catchment, tracing the stone). The object‑as‑setting (glass eyes) charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Rules (subtle conjury mirroring proofs) are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth/closure vs. ambiguity) is signaled early and tightened through the ritual’s intensification to the vision. Escalation is internal but coherent under the chosen lens. The cost is felt (accepting possibility without proof), though external pressure and tangible jeopardy are minimal. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (“dovetailing” grief’s fragments; mapping feeling to pattern) arises from particulars rather than commentary, and the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. The glass eyes and mosaic accrue meaning and return charged. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant. A hair more counter‑pressure or irony could deepen complexity further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct, patient cadence that suits a “gently inventive” mind. Diction is controlled, lyrical without drift, and perception stays within Elias’s plausible knowing. Rhythm modulates as the ritual intensifies. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and largely multipurpose; momentum holds despite lyricism. Occasional abstractions (“mathematics of emotion,” “ambiguous loss”) are earned by concrete counterweights (chips as variables, tracing proofs). Minimal scaffold or repetition. A slightly leaner middle could sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—taxidermist’s eyes, a cavern orchard fed by stone, emotion rendered as proofs on a chipped mosaic—feels fresh and coherent. The turn (vision of stepping through a veil) is familiar but recontextualized by the method and objects. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off. High distinctiveness without gimmick.</comment>
