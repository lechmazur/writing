<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—transmuting vulnerability into strength—drives her tactics (journal ciphers, dance-decoding) and aligns with the calm, persistent agency on the page. Interiority is embodied via movement and tactile engagement with dice and water, not diagnostic labels. However, simultaneous contradictory impulses are lightly sketched (terror vs. composure) rather than dramatized in a present-tense pinch. The final choice feels earned, though the felt personal cost at the peak is more inferred than acutely staged.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (sunken lab, hangman’s dice, journal method), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through patterned rolls and dances to a decisive unlock. Closure lands with an on‑page change (hatches open; digital consciousnesses freed; surfacing). The cost is primarily accrued over time (isolation, risk of “doom” on wrong rolls) rather than crystallized at the final beat, which softens impact. Still, causal threads are consistent and payoff honors the taught pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The underwater lab is vivid and functionally constraining—pressure, algae-lit consoles, cracked viewports, failing generators—all shaping tactics and mood. The dice and console serve as object-as-setting anchors that charge the final action. Sensory selection stays purposeful and filtered through Elara’s priorities. World rules remain internally consistent without exposition bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape/unlock) is legible early; pressure coheres via nightly dice rolls and the ritualized dance-decoding. Escalation reads as density increase toward a final sequence entry—appropriate to the accumulative lens. A sharper on‑page narrowing or visible sacrifice at the climax would heighten cost. Nonetheless, the method forces commitment under risk, and the liberation turn is protagonist‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—encryption of vulnerability into strength—emerges through concrete practices (journal-as-cipher, dance-as-translation) rather than moralizing. The final liberation of “trapped echoes” widens the personal theme into communal consequence, adding resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively (mysterious familiarity; probabilistic fate). Slightly tidy uplift at the end trims complexity but doesn’t collapse it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s perceptual signature, modulating pressure without head‑hopping. Patterned diction (tides, web, dice) is taught and sustained, supporting the accumulative structure. No withholding undermines clarity, and narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer. A few elevated turns flirt with purple but remain voice-justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, images carry multiple jobs, and momentum is maintained despite lyric density. Figurative language is frequent but largely coherent and purposeful; minimal redundancy. The quoted journal line sharpens texture without stall. Minor opulence could be pared in peak beats to sharpen the cost edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical code-breaking via dance and probabilistic “hangman’s dice” in a drowned lab feels fresh and integrated. The synthesis of body, code, and fate produces a memorable tactic and closure image. Risks in structure and tone cohere rather than read as gimmick. Only the near-uplifted final cadence tempers the edge of originality’s cost.</comment>
