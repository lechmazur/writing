<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eron’s motive and temperament are crisp and consistent, and his tactics (silence, zigzagging, the cast, the release) align with that persona. Interiority is restrained to a fault—“His heart stirred, but he remained composed” signals conflict but doesn’t deepen it. The renunciation (releasing the echo) reads earned but the felt cost is modest. Strong competence with little genuine struggle limits depth at peak beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern breaks, density rises (constellations lurch, waves collide), the echo surfaces, and the release reweights the premise. Closure lands on‑page as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he refuses possession and restores cycle. Causality is coherent within the lyric frame; orientation is clear from the outset. The cost at closure is present but understated, keeping it just below top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid, rule‑consistent, and actively shapes choices (zigzag to avoid crescendos; using a rail spike to pierce intangible waves). Sensory specificity is purposeful, not a tourist catalog, and environmental logic evolves with events (constellations affecting wave behavior). The tool‑as‑setting and environment both charge the final image. Slightly less constraint at the decisive moment prevents a 9+ leap.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: capture the goddess’s echo within a volatile window. Escalation manifests as pattern intensification rather than direct opposition; Eron adapts with silence and timing, then faces a quiet trade‑off in the release. Pressure coheres but remains gentle; risk and tangible loss are minimal. The tightening is meaningful, not punishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Capture versus communion, possession versus letting go, and “voicing silence” cohere into a quiet ethic of stewardship. The final release reweights prior images without moralizing, and the goddess’s sorrow script adds a humane undertone. The resonance lingers, though its ambiguity is gentle rather than cutting. Earned, understated, and thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with controlled lyricism; diction and rhythm suit the surreal frame and modulate with pressure. No head‑hopping or stance slips; the narrative certainty stays within plausible perception. A slight tendency toward ornate recurrence is contained and voice‑motivated. The perceptual signature (silence as method, reading waves) feels character‑specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with mostly clean propulsion; images do double duty (garden as labyrinth and score). Minor repetition (“feral lullaby,” motif echoes) risks purple but remains purposeful. No significant scaffold or template cadence; syntax varies and reads well aloud. Clarity persists even under lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound wave garden, sleepwalking constellations, transliterated emotions, rail spike hook—feels fresh and coherent. The fisher‑quest archetype is transformed through specific world logic and a non‑obvious, quiet renunciation. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off without confusion. Distinct vision without gimmickry.</comment>
