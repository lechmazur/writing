<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (“to give rest a permanent address”) is specific and embodied, and his inadvertent stubbornness manifests in tangible endurance and risk. We get clear interior stakes without therapy‑speak, and actions align with his role as undertaker. Internal conflict is present but mostly in endurance rather than a sharp contradiction. The cost lands through exhaustion and refusal to yield, though a sharper moral trade‑off would deepen it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: package → lens refracts signals → impossible spaces entered → rites performed → transformed library. Closure is on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration: stillness earned with cost (time blur, physical toll, escalating resistance). Orientation is crisp early, and the hybrid causal/accumulative design holds. A few mid‑story compressions summarize the labor, but they don’t undercut the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underwater library is vivid and purposeful: pumps, domed glass, bioluminescent algae, and metaphysical wards all contour tactics and tone. The broken lens and the library’s architecture function as setting constraints, enabling entry into “impossible spaces.” Sensory texture is balanced and POV‑filtered through an undertaker’s regard for rest. It’s lush without drifting into tourist cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are simple and strong—quiet the distress, earn lasting rest—with a marked tightening when the anguished spirit resists and Elias must occupy even tighter voids. Pressure coheres and escalates primarily through endurance, with visible costs (fatigue, risk of getting lost in memory whirlpools). The conflict resolves a touch smoothly; a deeper trade‑off or permanent loss would heighten the peak. Still, the cadence shift toward calm reads earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motifs (lens, signals, chased stillness) accrue into a resonant meditation on labor, custody of the dead, and transforming turmoil into repose. The final image reweights prior material—stillness no longer flees—without moralizing. Insights feel earned through work rather than stated thesis, though “permanent address” edges toward explicitness. Ambiguity remains purposeful and contained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elias provides a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm fit the mood and setting, with controlled variations under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance leakage, and elisions (dream insight) are taught and paid off. Occasionally the register nears purple, but it stays legible and character‑apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and action—without much scaffolding. A few metaphors stack (“time folded like wet paper,” “chased stillness”) but cohere with the aquatic frame and don’t blur causality. Momentum survives brief summary blocks; sentence rhythms vary. Minor density bloat in descriptive clusters keeps it just shy of elite polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—undertaker in a drowned library using a broken lighthouse lens to enter impossible interstices and archive spirits—is fresh and coherent. Turns grow organically from the premise and character, with the lens’s evolving function providing a non‑obvious engine. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without gimmickry. Only the ritual sequence feels familiar in contour, slightly muting the singularity.</comment>
