<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to transmute isolation into exploration—is clear and consistently enacted through sketching, alignment, and the decision to mine logs. Interiority is sensorially grounded (breath as “elongated threads,” the compass’s warmth). Internal contradiction (shunned yet “blessed”) is present but lightly dramatized rather than pressure‑tested. The final stance shift reads earned, though the on‑page cost remains conceptual more than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, details accrete toward a Charged Poise: the glimpse intensifies into purpose and reorients her next move (archival search). Orientation is strong from the outset; causality is coherent (sketch → alignment → glow → decision). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, with cost implied via solitude and chosen commitment. The price is subtle, not sharply foreclosing alternatives, which keeps this shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observation deck’s temporal distortions are vividly rendered and meaningfully used: stretched time shapes perception, the viewport facilitates alignment, and the environment enables the reveal. Multi‑sensory touches (“creak of metal,” flicker, hum) deepen atmosphere without museum‑tour excess. The compass as object‑in‑setting charges the ending image. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal—finding a “true north” in isolation—signaled early and tightened by the glimpse that transforms watching into pursuit. The key deepening arrives when she aligns the applique and commits to the logs. Costs are understated; no concrete loss or narrowed option is paid on the page beyond accepting outcast identity as fuel. Tension is steady rather than ratcheting, appropriate to the lens but limiting peak pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Heritage, “true north,” and echoed silence braid into a coherent theme of self‑direction born from alienation. The family custom meaningfully reframes the cosmos as soul‑map; the final image reweights pariahhood as strength without sermonizing. Occasional direct statements (“turning confusion into exploration”) edge toward telling but do not undercut resonance. The ending invites reflection with a clean, image‑led answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to time and silence. Diction and rhythm modulate gently as pressure rises, avoiding head‑hopping and register drift. Refrains (“echoed silence,” temporal stretching) verge on overuse but maintain voice rather than flatten it. No dialogue is needed or missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and purposeful, often doing double duty (world and psyche). A few lines risk purple repetition (multiple invocations of silence/time stretching and “golden” motifs). Momentum holds without scaffold or obvious loops; syntax varies comfortably. The final image is clear and lands without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fusion of space‑station time dilation with a terrestrial heirloom and family cartography tradition feels fresh and specific. The “true north” motif is enacted through concrete alignment rather than platitude. While not radical, the synthesis is memorable and coherent with the ending’s reconfiguration. Risk is tasteful and controlled rather than bold.</comment>
