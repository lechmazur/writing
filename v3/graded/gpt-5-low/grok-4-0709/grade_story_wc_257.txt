<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivations are clear—Elias’s grief-charged mission and Lira’s need for redemption—but interiority leans summary-lyric over embodied contradiction. The key choice (Lira accepting the tattoo) reads credible yet almost frictionless, with limited ambivalence on the page. Elias’s Earned Stasis at the end (continuing the mission with a cost) works but lacks a sharp on-page micro-tradeoff. Strong object-reactions (locket, vellum) hint at depth that could be further dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: origami beacon → observatory nexus → vellum tattoo → curtains part → departure. Orientation is solid early, and the closure lands with a concrete act and path reconfigured. The cost is legible (pain, trust, leaving), though pressure resolves smoothly without a hard narrowing or reversal. The lens reads primarily causal with a lyric overlay and holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory, comet-light, and “curtains of intention” are vivid and functional—setting actively gates access and supplies tools (essences, light) that alter options. Object-as-setting (vellum, origami) integrates with space and stakes rather than serving as postcard imagery. World rules are consistent and learned in action. Atmosphere supports theme without overbearing symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (renewal vs. withering) is clear, and pressure coheres: Lira hesitates, then commits to a painful, identity-altering act. The escalation is steady but gentle; conflict resolves without a substantive reversal or sacrifice beyond the procedure and departure. Stakes feel intimate and appropriately scaled, though a sharper test of resolve would heighten consequence. The end forecloses an option (remaining in stasis) and opens another with felt, if understated, cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Recurring images (hair lockets, vellum map, origami coordinates, curtains) cohere around grief transmuted into renewal, and the final embedding of vellum reweights “artificial” into authentic reblooming. Occasional on-the-nose lines (“You’ve come to learn how the withered blooms again”) blunt the subtext. Nonetheless, the ending’s quiet endurance and passed-on hope produce a resonant aftereffect. Complexity is present, if not deeply ambivalent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close-third lyric voice with measured, controlled cadence; dialogue is sparse but functional and naturally placed. The perceptual signature (craftsperson’s attention to tools, materials, and ritual) is coherent. No head-hopping or stance slips; psychic distance modulates smoothly at key beats. A few heightened formulations verge on purple but remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished and descriptive with good object economy, though density occasionally swells into ornament (“subdued ardor” repeats; “genuinely artificial” courts oxymoron without always paying off). Momentum holds, but some sentences echo content across adjacent lines. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the closure image is clear. Trimming a few modifiers would increase propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—mourning jeweler in a timeless observatory using a living vellum map and origami coordinates—is striking and specific. Mentor-wanderer scaffolding is familiar, yet the material culture and metaphysics feel fresh and integrated. The conceptual play on artificial/genuine earns its place without gimmickry. A riskier complication or price would push this toward exceptional.</comment>
