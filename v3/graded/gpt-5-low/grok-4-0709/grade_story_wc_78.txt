<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crisp and embodied—he refuses to flee and chooses composition—but interior contradiction is minimal and the prophet’s competence rarely strains. Embodied details (sea‑glass eyes, kelp beard, carving under pressure) reveal him, yet we get little degradation under stress. Micro‑choices (repurposing debris; timing strikes to cloud cues) are clear. The ending earns a quiet endurance rather than a costly renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres from cloud omens → preparation → sonic counter. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—the tide harmonizes instead of shattering—but the cost reads as risk and exertion more than a felt loss. Orientation is clean and the throughline holds. A single, effective cadence shift at crest provides satisfying closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating orchard is vivid, tactile, and governs tactics: driftwood becomes instruments; apples and shells become sound sources; the sea both threatens and powers the response. The whalebone mallet and etched fractals function as micro‑setting that charges the final image. Sensory range is strong without museum‑tour excess. World rules are taught via action and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting the orchard) is legible early; escalation arrives via gathering fractal clouds and the cresting leeward tide. Agency drives the turn—he composes instead of fortifies—but the price paid remains mostly implied (fatigue, risk), not dramatized as a narrowed option or loss. The drum/whirlpool beat is a nice micro reversal. Resolution is earned and coherent, if slightly cushioned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of transforming threat into art emerges organically from the tactic of “sketched resonance” and the literal repurposing of obstacles. The final harmony reweights the premise without sermonizing, though one or two lines verge on stating the thesis. Subtext—craft as stewardship, listening as control—lingers. The closing image delivers a gentle, resonant answer rather than a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third‑person with a distinct maritime‑ritual idiom; diction (“fractaled whorls,” “euphony”) is consistent with the mythic register. Rhythm modulates well from preparatory calm to cresting action to repose. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; perception remains personally filtered. Rare elevated phrasing risks purple but generally serves tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry good density and momentum; repeated motifs (fractal, resonance, euphony) mostly accrue meaning rather than padding. A few near‑loops and adjective stacks verge on lushness, but clarity of cause/effect persists. Sentence variety and paragraphing fit the scene’s breath. The final line is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—sea‑borne orchard, weather‑oracle musician, fractal soundcraft as survival—is striking and coherent. Turns arise from prior particulars (etched designs, cloud‑reading) rather than late inventions. The risk is aesthetic, not gimmicky, and lands. Slight safety in cost keeps it just short of exceptional.</comment>
