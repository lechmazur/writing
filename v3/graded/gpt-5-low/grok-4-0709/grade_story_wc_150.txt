<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s goal and temperament are clear, and her micro‑choices (pausing to touch ribs, deciding to wander and then rebuild the sundial) align with motive. The internal contradiction (cautious yet warmly curious) is present but lightly tested. Emotional embodiment via sensory detail is strong, though the restoration at the end lands a bit tidy. The cost of belief’s return is more implied than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and the accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries (sundial base → gnomon → scrolls) reweight the stake. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: reading the lore by the reassembled sundial’s shadow reframes her doubt. Causality is coherent, though stakes rarely pinch. The on‑page cost at closure is modest, mostly time and risk rather than a defined sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and integrated—roots constrain excavation, bones redirect her wanderings, fungi guide her to the gnomon. Sensory texture is rich without losing clarity. The sundial, as tool/object‑as‑setting, charges the final image. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore faith) is clear and the pressure coheres, but escalation is gentle. The tightening arrives through the finds and the twitching root, yet options never narrow to a painful trade‑off. Coincidence is avoided, and agency drives progress. The felt price remains low.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of interrupted journeys and cyclical restoration thread through concrete images (roots through bones, sundial’s shadow, scrolls on cycles). Subtext works best in the orchard’s life‑amid‑death juxtaposition. A few explicit equivalences (“incomplete, much like her fractured faith”) blunt subtlety. The ending resonates, if slightly neat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady, diction controlled, and the lyric voice carries a distinct perceptual bias toward living detail in the dead space. Rhythm varies and tightens around discoveries. No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty. Occasional explanatory lines soften edge but don’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image‑dense with good momentum, and most lines do double duty. Minor redundancies and a few declared analogs edge toward the purple but stop short of blur. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly. No major artifacts or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” concept and the sundial‑faith coupling feel fresh and coherent. Diaspora return and ritual restoration are familiar but individualized by the setting’s tactile logic. The gnomon find via bioluminescent fungi is a distinctive beat. The piece risks a quiet, accumulative build successfully.</comment>
