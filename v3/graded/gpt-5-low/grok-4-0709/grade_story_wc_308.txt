<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and rooted in duty: he must learn to navigate without moving to restore the canyon’s pulse. Interiority is present through tactile focus on the arrowhead and the birds, but contradictory impulses are minimal; he rarely wavers from resolve. Embodied emotion appears in weathered skin, dust, and patience rather than volatile feeling. The final stance (charged poise, hope through stillness) reads earned, though the felt cost remains mostly historical and implied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from descriptive setup into the appraisal act with the arrowhead and birds, culminating in a charged poise closure. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why), and the method’s mechanics produce a pattern break (perception shifts to reading flight). The cost at closure is conceptual—choosing patience and internal alignment over pursuit—felt but soft. A single meaningful deepening occurs (decoding the flock), but causality remains low‑tempo.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bone towers, dust, echoes, and spectral ravens are vivid, consistent, and filtered through a practitioner’s sensibility. The environment materially matters: echoes, dust, and the towers’ trembling justify stillness and the acoustic frame. The arrowhead functions as a tool‑as‑setting, charging the final image. Sensory specificity is rich without losing spatial coherence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconciling the wandering pulse) is legible, but pressure is largely conceptual and steady rather than escalating. The appraisal via birds provides a single deepening, yet no option is forcefully foreclosed on the page. The price—choosing motionless navigation—is more ethos than consequence, reducing tension. The ending’s hope reweights the moment without a sharp trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stillness versus pursuit, harmony versus fracture, and reverence for ancestry cohere through concrete images (arrowhead, flock, dust). The final image reprices movement as internal gravity rather than chase, a resonant—if quiet—answer. No moralizing intrudes, and motifs recur with meaning. Ambiguity lingers productively about whether hope can withstand the canyon’s unrest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The elevated, solemn diction is consistent with the skimmer’s worldview and never head‑hops. Rhythm is controlled, with long, incantatory sentences suited to a ritualistic act. Occasional density skirts purple but remains legible and voice‑motivated. No dialogue appears, appropriately for the scene’s stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush and largely purposeful, with strong noun/verb choices and integrated imagery. Some redundancy and modifier stacking (“centuries of layered dust,” “weathered resolve,” repeated bone/echo invocations) slightly slows momentum. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. The closure image is clear and not dulled by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: harmonic stone skimming, a wandering land‑pulse, and appraisal through a flock’s patterns. The arrowhead as ancestral amplifier and the bone‑echo ecology feel original and thematically integrated. The risks are measured and coherent, avoiding gimmick. The only limiter is the low on‑page price, which tempers the sense of transformation.</comment>
