<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—inscribing a cosmic verse to transcend enforced forgetting—is clear and embodied in the thorn, blood, and moonstone dust. Panic-then-acceptance gives a credible micro-struggle under pressure. Interior stakes are specific to her craft (tide dancing in a landlocked exile). The only limit is that contradiction remains relatively simple, not deeply double-bound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual focus → observing gaps → anchoring → fledging with cost. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: spirit lifts while body remains bound, reconfiguring her fate with a visible price. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and causality reads consistent within the mythic rules. No soft reset or convenience patches.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden is more than backdrop; vines literally anchor her and charge the final image of a living monument under stars. Objects-as-setting (moonstone dust, thorn) are tactile and rule the ritual. Sensory specificity is high without tourist cataloging. The environment frames and constrains the decisive turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transcendence vs. enforced forgetting) is clear, and pressure tightens when the “gaps” pull her essence and the garden roots her. The anchoring forecloses bodily freedom and forces an acceptance that reweights her goal. The cost is legible and persists into the ending. Escalation is driven by her actions (dance, inscription) rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Memory versus ban, exile as canvas, and transformation through chosen constraints cohere and culminate in the monument image. The “gaps” motif becomes a metaphoric ethics of attention that reweights the world. A slight slip toward declarative theme in the final line (“the nostalgia ban would crumble”) trims subtlety. Still, resonance lingers through image more than slogan.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person close holds throughout with controlled diction and cadence shifts under pressure. The voice has a distinct perceptual signature (tidal metaphors, celestial lexicon) that feels character-specific. No head-hopping or stance wobble. A few high-register phrases flirt with purple but remain earned by the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world rule, image, emotion) with minimal scaffold; rhythm varies well. Figurative language is lush but mostly coherent and purposeful. Minor repetition (“obsidian grace,” “gaps”) is motif rather than loop. No clarity or simultaneity errors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—tide dancer in landlocked exile, moonstone ink, “observing gaps” as method, body-anchoring with nebular wings—is striking and coherent. Turns feel earned by the ritual logic rather than late rule drops. The final reconfiguration (monumental stasis and spiritual ascent) feels specific and memorable. Risk-taking heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
