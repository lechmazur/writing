<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation and a handful of concrete micro‑choices (choosing the atrium’s center; phrased pauses; the whispered “enough”) reveal character under pressure. Embodied feeling comes via sensory anchors (dew, breath, light) and the ache of remembered nights. Internal contradiction is mild—lonely nostalgia versus duty—so the struggle reads steady rather than riven. The cost lands as weariness and self‑sacrifice, felt but not scarring.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the hush densifies through negative space until the prophecy fades. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when and the atrium’s function), and the pattern is taught then paid off. Closure arrives on the page with the long final silence; the cost is primarily emotional, not structural, but legible. Single scene coherence, one dominant stake, and a clean cadence shift at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly realized and functionally engaged: prisms, mist, and acoustics shape tactic and tone, and the atrium amplifies the hush while later dimming in response. Sensory specificity is high without tour‑guide excess, and the environment charges the final image. The tool/body/object triad (sax, breath, prisms) interlocks in scene. Minor risk of luxuriant description is kept in check by purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit from the outset and escalates as the prophecy manifests and “fights back.” The key tightening is the voiced “enough” that fortifies the accumulating hush, followed by the longest silence. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, though the price paid is primarily internal and not deeply costly. The resolution is earned by endurance and intent rather than reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Silence-as-agency, absence as presence, and the ethics of suppressing fate cohere through image and act. Recurring motifs (dew, prisms, negative space) reweight at the end without moralizing. The eerie nostalgia infuses the cost and preserves ambiguity (peace secured, loneliness deepened). Thematic range is focused rather than multifaceted, but resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with stable focalization and a distinct sensory lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the long final pause is felt. Patterned diction (“negative space,” “vested hush”) is purposeful, though repetition edges toward mantra at times. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density and clean syntax with evocative, largely coherent metaphors. Some redundancy and adjective stacking (“quietly vivid,” repeated “negative space/vested hush”) flirt with over‑insistence. Momentum holds through description, and the final image is crisp. Minor trims could heighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The method—silencing prophecy via intentional rests—feels fresh, and the prism atrium/mist ecology is imaginative. The lone wanderer trope gains specificity through tactic and environment rather than costume. The final cadence reconfigures the premise with quiet inevitability. Slight familiarity in the drifter‑savior figure keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
