<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias’s patient, methodical temperament and goal are clear, and his micro‑choices (waiting, pricking the parchment, privileging protection over gain) align with them. The internal tension between inherited greed/vengeance and his distilled ethic is present but underplayed—never quite dramatized as a live temptation on the page. Embodied perception (rain ticks, fog, smell of damp) does ground emotion credibly. The final renunciation feels earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the rain’s ticking and ambient inputs build toward a conceptual click where the vow’s essence reconfigures. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the closure—a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend as the gutters fall silent and the ferry appears—lands. The cost (foregoing family’s greed/revenge legacy) is implied rather than concretely taxed in-scene, slightly softening impact. Single scene coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fog, ferry dock, rain gutters, and the sluggish river are sensorially vivid and purpose‑driven, shaping tempo and method. The environment functions as a clock and acoustic field that guides attention, not mere postcard. The yarn needle and parchment operate as micro‑setting objects folded into action. The final image with lifting fog and ferry approach is setting‑charged and coherent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unravel the vow and choose its ethic) is clear and tightened by the temporal pressure of the gutters slowing. Escalation is a density deepening rather than reversals; the single meaningful turn is the distilled recognition of “protection, not possession.” The price is conceptual (abandoning inherited motives) rather than felt through loss or danger, keeping tension quiet. Still, the cadence shift at the last drip is effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of stripping accreted corruption to an ethical core is organically enacted via palimpsest, river sediment, and spindrift motifs. The final choice reweights the narrative away from possession toward guardianship without sermonizing. Slight tidiness in the insight (“fundamental essence of protection”) reads more declared than wrestled with. Nonetheless, the image chain coheres and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third‑person limited voice has a distinct, consistent texture—measured, sea‑spray calm—that fits Elias’s attentional style. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sensory filtration reads character‑true. No head‑hopping or stance leaks. A few elevated metaphors recur, but they form a taught pattern rather than drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, rhythmic, and economical for a lyric mode; most sentences carry multiple functions (setting, theme, character). Figurative language is consistent and not muddled, though density edges rich in places. Minimal scaffold or loops; the prose advances without drag. The closing cadence lands without purple spillover.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The palimpsest promise literalized through a yarn needle and ambient decoding at a foggy ferry feels fresh and well‑synthesized. The mythic river guardian complicates lineage without cliché. The risk is a quiet, concept‑driven climax that avoids spectacle, executed with confidence. While the core arc is simple, its treatment is distinctive and memorable.</comment>
