<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is crystalline and sustained: deliver a message to her lost child even at mortal cost. Micro‑choices—gathering the puzzle edges, threading the amber bead, proceeding as her years unravel—align with that drive. The inner contradiction (grief vs. resolve) is present but not frictional enough on the page to create strong in‑scene push‑pull. More embodied hesitation or competing impulses under pressure could deepen her complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density and pressure build from discovery to ritual to dissolution. Closure lands on the page with clear cost—her essence fades as the conduit launches, an Earned Stasis/RR. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the causal thread from found edges to woven bridge is coherent. The single scene tightens once meaningfully at the ritual recommencement.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The orchard, bamboo, stone apples, loom, and amber bead are vivid and purpose‑driven; they shape options and charge the final image. The bead’s origin in the orchard and the physical loom modified by puzzle edges integrate setting with action. Sensory detail is lush and filtered through Elara’s priorities. Minor risk of over-symbolism is held in check by consistent world rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—get the message across—tightens as each weave drains her life, culminating in the recommenced ritual. The cost is unmistakable: years unravel and she dissolves into the bamboo’s whispers. Pressure escalates coherently without an antagonist; the environment and method serve as constraint. A single explicit moment of doubt or a near-failure turn might have heightened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of maternal devotion, memory, and sacrifice emerge organically through image and act, not moralizing. Recurring objects (amber bead, puzzle edges, loom) accrue meaning and reweight in the final hush. The ending’s image offers a resonant answer to the central question: love bridges the chasm at irreversible cost. Ambiguity remains purposeful—did the message reach?—without blurring stakes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is stable, textural, and character‑specific, with patterned diction taught early and sustained. Rhythm modulates appropriately toward the climax’s hum and hush. A few repeated phrases risk monotony, but control largely holds. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is rich and often beautiful, with high information density and charged images. However, repetition of set phrases (“stoically sparkling,” “latent sacrifice,” “raveling silence”) and stacked modifiers verge on purple at points, slightly dulling propulsion. Minimal paraphrase loops appear but do not obscure causality or closure. Tighter variation and a few strategic cuts would sharpen momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—loomwork with jigsaw edges in a bamboo orchard, amber as message vessel, time as textile—is fresh and specific. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight given the established tools and lore. Risks are taken in style and concept without losing clarity. A touch more surprising micro‑turn or rule‑implication could push it higher.</comment>
