<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive—lightening an inherited burden by decoding “what walls dream”—is specific and coherently pursued through tactile choices (listening, squeezing through ivy, handling diaries). Interiority is focused and character‑particular, though the internal contradiction (duty vs. fear or doubt) stays mostly implied rather than dramatized in a live impasse. The emotional turn at the fireplace reads earned through accumulated observation. The vow at the end lands, but the cost is largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from sound‑mapping to artifact discovery to a reweighted understanding—closure as resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clear early; single scene coherence holds. The ending’s cost is quieter (shared culpability and a reframed mission) but on the page through the “sighing corridor” and vow. A bit more consequence or narrowed optioning would push this higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: ivy muffles, the passage narrows, decay/salt inform stakes, resonators hum as micro‑setting tools. The environment constrains movement (the squeeze) and charges the final image (emerging, resonators carrying “newfound data”). Sensory detail is economical and filtered through the cartographer’s priorities. World rules feel consistent and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres: deeper entry → narrowed corridor → discovery → interpretive reveal; the diaries and negative intensify the quest’s stakes. The tightening is meaningful but low in overt price—no option is foreclosed beyond internal reweighting. Agency drives the key turn (choosing to continue, to piece the remnants). The final vow reframes rather than resolves, with modest felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, denial, and redemptive re‑mapping emerge through objects and images (echoes, charred diaries, inverted negatives) rather than lecturing. The mirror between Silas’s burden and Elara’s reframing carries strong resonance. The ending edges toward declarative (“chart not just echoes, but redemptions”), but the image base mostly earns it. Subtext of complicity and listening as care lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third filters detail through a professional perceptual signature (sound and structure). Rhythm and diction are controlled without head‑hopping or register drift. Patterned imagery (echoes, ivy, salt) supports voice. A touch of abstraction appears near the end, but not enough to dull effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with varied syntax and strong verbs; most sentences do more than one job. A few near‑redundancies and mild purple lean (“echoes that bounced like ghosts”) don’t stall momentum. Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. The final cadence is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The “corridor echo cartographer” conceit is striking, marrying sound‑mapping with post‑climate ruin in a fresh way. The charred diaries/negative are familiar devices but recontextualized through the echo premise and legacy theme. The reconfiguration to “chart redemptions” feels organic to the setup. Strong synthesis without gimmickry.</comment>
