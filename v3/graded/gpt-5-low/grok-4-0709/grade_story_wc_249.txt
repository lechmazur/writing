<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s want (reanimate a shared dream with Lir) is clear and drives concrete choices—defying the lab, drumming despite warnings. Interiority is embodied through tactile sound and the lagoon; hope and doubt coexist in the final beat. The rebellious trait meaningfully constrains her choices, though the consequence of defiance remains mostly emotional rather than situational. A sharper on‑page cost beyond risk warnings could elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rhythm and density build toward a Charged Poise closure where a faint pulse answers and ambiguity exacts a cost. Orientation is clean early, and the scene stays single‑threaded. The causal line is simple but coherent (she drums; the world answers). The cost is largely conceptual/emotional, not tactical, keeping it shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are not mere backdrop; their properties determine tactics (drumming on crystals and water) and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid, multisensory, and POV‑filtered. Rules feel consistent and learned through action. The environment actively participates in escalation and the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear from the outset and escalates via the intensified drumming and the garden’s response. The meaningful tightening arrives with the faint pulse, reweighting options and hope. Costs are implied (overstimulation, defiance, self‑doubt) but not concretely paid on the page. One more visible trade‑off or foreclosed path would deepen pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of grief/hope, autonomy versus institutional “progress,” and the ethics of shared consciousness emerge through image and action, not thesis. The recurring auroral/sound motifs reweight at the end into “hopeful lament,” avoiding neat closure. The ambiguity—“him or echo”—lands as earned complexity. A few declarative lines about the scientists flirt with telling but don’t dominate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person closely held to Elara remains consistent; diction and cadence suit the atmospheric mode. Rhythmic control mirrors the drumming escalation without losing clarity. No dialogue; interior voice carries the piece without register slips. Occasionally lush phrasing edges toward sameness but largely sustains texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and musical with strong sensory density, but the figurative load is high and occasionally repetitive (“auroral sorrow,” multiple cosmic breath images). Momentum holds, yet a few lines paraphrase adjacent content. Trim could sharpen pressure and vary cadence in the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sound‑responsive garden, neural entanglement, and “drumming on everything” as method feel fresh and coherent. The final ambiguous pulse is an earned, specific turn rather than a generic twist. Risks in image system and concept integration pay off without confusion. Small familiarity in the “lab vs rebel” frame keeps it just shy of the topmost band.</comment>
