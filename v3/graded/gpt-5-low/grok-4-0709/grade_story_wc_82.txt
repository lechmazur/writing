<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and propulsive—he wants to fold grief into cranes—and his choices (building the lantern, making the pilgrimage, performing the ritual) align. Interiority is embodied through sensory-laden craft and the paradox of hope vs. despair. The internal conflict is credible and culminates in an earned, fragile peace. Slight limitation: almost no counter-pressure from other agents keeps the emotional crucible narrow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: grief and shadow loss → build specialized lantern → journey to basilica → polish gem with recorded dreams → fold and release cranes. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: peace is gained but the detached shadow remains as cost. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph and the lens holds. No teleports or patching; all setups (amethyst, basilica) pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating tea garden and glass basilica are vividly specific and functionally integrated. The basilica’s properties and the tea garden’s essences constrain tactics and charge the final image. The “descending while ascending” environment refracts the theme and bodily experience during transit. Detail is POV-filtered and purposeful rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting grief) is steady and tightens through the decision to attempt the ritual and the peak when the gem clarifies. Cost is explicit: he releases grief-wisps and gains peace but cannot restore his shadow. The cadence intensifies appropriately in the nave sequence. Slightly limited by the absence of a complicating reversal beyond internal endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of grief transmutation is earned through concrete craft and paradox (descending/ascending) rather than sermonized. The final cranes reweight prior images into a resonant answer: peace that does not erase loss. “Some luminosities burned eternal” offers a clean conceptual toll. One line states the aim directly, but the scene-work carries the load.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and modulates with pressure without head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with lyric intensity that suits the world. Patterned images recur with intent rather than drift. Minor risk of lushness, but it remains legible and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, emotion) with clean momentum and few redundancies. The figurative density pushes toward purple in places (“luminous agony,” “radiant heights”) but retains coherence. Syntax varies and the final image lands crisply. No notable loops, scaffold, or filter stacks dulling the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lanterns that record dreams, gem-polishing with dream essence, a glass basilica, and the paradoxical physics synthesize into a singular vision. The transformation is non-obvious yet inevitable by the end. Risks in worldbuilding and tone heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The detached shadow as persistent price is a fresh, memorable flourish.</comment>
