<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and sustained—preserve a dying tactile language—but internal contradiction is minimal, with fear of the tunnel’s madness only briefly felt. His micro‑choices (entering, placing the diamond, aligning to birds) align with motive and reveal character. Emotional embodiment via “copper‑veined” imagery is vivid but leans emblematic over conflicted. A small sense of cost lands in the residual thrumming, but the trial feels largely controlled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Held under an Accumulative/Textural lens: details accrete toward a clear RR/CR—language preserved as immortal echoes. Orientation is strong, the ritual acts sequence cleanly (enter → place diamond → align to birds → stabilize). Cost is mostly conceptual (risk of madness; surrendering his living voice to an echo‑archive), which lands but lightly. The pattern taught (texture→sound via canyon acoustics) pays off at closure without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is integral: canyon acoustics, bone towers, and the tunnel’s infinite loop constrain tactics (use the fissure to align with birds; place diamond at the center). Sensory specificity is lush and purposeful across senses, charging the final image of a canyon that “sings” textures. World rules feel consistent, learned through action. The environment decisively shapes choice and the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation) is clear; pressure coheres through the hazardous tunnel and cursed diamond. Escalation arrives via the curse stirring and the need to sync with a live, shifting flock to avoid madness. The price paid is implied more than felt; success comes without a hard reversal or meaningful loss beyond residual strain. Still, one solid tightening (stabilization as the flock disperses) justifies the arc at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of translation, preservation, and transforming curse into guardianship arise organically from concrete action. The birds’ patterns reframing a language’s cadence is an earned metaphor that reweights the premise at the end. No sermonizing; the final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (texture made sound, life made echo) with a bittersweet cost. Slight neatness in success trims the lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice matches the mythic register and never leaks POV. Diction and rhythm are confident, modulating toward urgency in the tunnel sequence without losing clarity. Purposeful elisions are taught early and paid off in the ritual. No dialogue, but the narrative stance remains steady and character‑specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images do multiple jobs. Figurative language is rich yet mostly disciplined and consistent with the world’s logic. Minor repetition (“quietly articulate”) and occasional lushness slightly soften momentum but do not obscure action. Opening and final lines carry strong cadence and image resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: tactile language textures, cursed flawed diamond, and avian choreography in a bone‑tower canyon feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (mythic lyricism, conceptual ritual) heighten stakes without muddling clarity. The tunnel’s rule‑set interacts inventively with motive and method. The transformation of curse into guardian lands as an elegant, original reweighting.</comment>
