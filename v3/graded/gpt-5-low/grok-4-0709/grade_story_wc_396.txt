<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—turning empathy into actionable plans—is clear, embodied by the choice to reconstitute the orb rather than wait for the Council. Interiority is specific (child hunger, elder fatigue, warrior fear) and channeled into micro‑choices with the mirrors. Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers, so the struggle reads more as endurance under pressure than conflicted impulse. The closing stance (act regardless of verdict) feels earned though the on‑page cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the mirror‑by‑mirror process deepens pressure and consolidates purpose toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when anchored), and the lighthouse-to-attic progression is coherent. The ending’s decisive reconfiguration—orb complete, Council horn sounding, commitment to act—lands, though the felt cost is modest. Causality is intact: her empathy-driven method produces a tool that reweights options before the verdict arrives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, frozen apples, and shifting floes create a distinctive, tactile world that informs tone and urgency. The environment constrains tactics (height, cold, attic of relics) and charges the final image (beacon, horn, nascent melt). Objects (mirrors, shard, lighthouse beam) are integrated into action rather than scenic wallpaper. World rules (shadows, shard magic) remain consistent and learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging clans before/against the Council’s decision—is present with a ticking clock. Escalation occurs through the staged visions and the orb’s gradual reform, culminating as the horn sounds. The price is primarily opportunity/stance (refusing passivity), with limited concrete loss on the page. Still, the tightening is coherent and protagonist‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of transforming empathy into action integrates with plot and image (visions converted into routes, shelters, pacts). However, the explicit repetition of “map empathy onto action” slips into thesis‑speak, especially near the end, dulling subtext. The final image (orb complete, readiness to act despite verdict) offers resonance without full moral overstatement, but the sermonizing edges lower the score. Ambiguity about costs could be deepened for greater aftershock.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is steady, with controlled metaphor and a distinct perceptual signature (shadows as agency, mirrors as empathy optics). Psychic distance remains stable and apt for the accumulative pattern. Diction fits the world’s register; no head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Minor rhythmic sameness in repeated theme phrasing slightly flattens peaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with images doing double duty (beacon as metronome; frozen apples holding breath). Some repetition and near‑mantra phrasing (“map empathy onto action,” “calmly intuitive”) creates mild scaffold feel. Figurative density stays coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors, though intensity is uniform at times. Mechanics are clean and sequencing is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of lighthouse orchard, shadow‑ink empathy, and vintage mirrors as a moral cartography tool feels fresh and specific. The reconstitution ritual translates compassion into logistics in a non‑obvious way. The closure image (tool completed as verdict arrives) is earned by prior particulars. Risk‑taking in premise and imagery heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
