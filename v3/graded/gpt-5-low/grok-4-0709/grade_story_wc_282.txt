<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive and a distinct professional lens; embodied emotion via the heat‑map is effective. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she meets little resistance, so we learn less under pressure. The choices (venturing alone, scanning, following) align with motive but incur scant visible cost. Strong character particularity without a crucible to test it.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate and clean; the piece builds density toward the floating leaf and a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she claims her “voice” and moves to follow), but the cost at the end is faint. Coherent, one‑scene arc with a meaningful cadence shift, just shy of a felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective cave details filtered through a mapper’s eye; bioluminescence and geomagnetic anomalies are integrated and consequential. The environment literally alters gravity and drives the central marvel, charging the final image. World rules stay legible through action rather than dump, despite some explanatory phrasing. Spatial and sensory choreography remain coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (becoming the voice of the unknown) is signaled early and deepened by discovery. The decisive intensification is the float, which changes knowledge but doesn’t truly narrow options or extract a clear price. Pressure is mostly wonder, not risk; stakes feel conceptual more than felt. Escalation is present but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bridging old/new through a “transitional object” aligns nicely with the vocation of mapping emotions; the final image reaffirms that charge. Some explicit labeling (“transitional object,” “factually mystical”) edges into thesis-speak, dampening subtext. Still, the particulars (piezoelectric veins, altered gravity) carry the theme more than any moral. Resonance lingers as curiosity and vocation marry, without neat closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a clean, scientific‑lyric blend suited to Elara’s mind. Register shifts into exposition are mostly voice‑motivated and do not break distance. Rhythm modulates well around the discovery; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Distinct perceptual signature keeps the narration from generic awe.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong, image‑rich sentences with good propulsion and economy. Occasional redundancy and label phrases (“factually mystical,” “explained by physics but wondrous”) add a slight explanatory crust. Otherwise, diction is precise, scaffolding light, and the final lines land cleanly. No muddled metaphors or cadence templates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotional cartography meets post‑cataclysm caves and a scientifically‑charged “enchanted” fossil. The float as a physics‑based marvel avoids genre cliché. Emotional stakes could cut deeper, but the conceptual twist feels authentic rather than ornamental. Cohesive, singular vision without gimmickry.</comment>
