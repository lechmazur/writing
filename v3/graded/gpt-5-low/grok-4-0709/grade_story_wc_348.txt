<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena’s motives are clear and character‑specific, and her professional lens credibly drives her choices. Interiority is textured (foam rhythms, polymer analogies), though impulses rarely conflict on the page. The reconciliation feels a touch tidy, with little visible risk or backsliding under pressure. Still, the choice to craft and present the sculpture reads earned by prior perception and regret.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with a causal throughline: observation → insight → plan → contact → meeting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Lila touches the sculpture and both share the chrysalis, though the cost is mostly implied risk. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard structure is coherent. The decisive change is modest but legible and motivated by earlier beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The braided ravine and foam are vivid, POV‑filtered, and functionally catalytic, not postcard décor. The chrysalis as object‑setting charges the final image and concretizes transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, fitting Elena’s professional bias. The environment materially shapes the tactic (the insight that leads to the sculpture).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection with Lila) is clear, but pressure is gentle and faces little friction. The meaningful tightening is the shift from reflection to making/contact, yet no real obstacle pushes back. Cost is underplayed; Lila’s response arrives off‑page without resistance. The ending earns warmth but lacks a palpable test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Recurring images (braids, polymers, foam, chrysalis) cohere around separation becoming connection. A few lines tip into thesis (“atonement lay not in apologies alone...”), softening subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs without didacticism in the last moment. Emotional aftereffect is sincere and cohesive, if a bit safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyric, and plausibly filtered through a chemist with musical cognition. Diction and imagery maintain a controlled motif without head‑hopping. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward overdesign, but clarity holds. Rhythm modulates appropriately from reflection to decision to quiet meeting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with purposeful imagery, though symphonic/braided metaphors recur heavily. Minor redundancy (“translate separation into connection” appears in varied forms) slightly dulls momentum. Sentences are clear and varied; no mechanical errors disrupt reading. Overwriting risk is present but contained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of polymer science, foam‑pattern insight, and a resonant sculpture is fresh and specific. The estranged‑parent reconciliation arc is familiar, keeping the piece from feeling truly singular. The chrysalis as shared talisman is a strong, memorable inflection. Overall, it’s an original angle executed with restraint.</comment>
