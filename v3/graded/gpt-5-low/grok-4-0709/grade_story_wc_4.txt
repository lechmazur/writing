<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her methods (inviting villagers, curating arcs) reveal character. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page struggle; her calm competence meets minimal resistance. Emotional cost appears mostly in others (Mr. Harlan, Lila), keeping Elara’s own conflict muted. The final endurance/renunciation is gentle rather than hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring arcs/vines accrete toward a Charged Poise closure in the mural and shared release. Orientation is clean early; cause/effect is soft but coherent. The visible cost is communal—the surfacing of grief—paid in the sessions and reweighted by the mural’s unveiling. Minor softness in decisive turns keeps it below top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lavender field and rusted factory are vivid, sensorial, and POV‑filtered; vines serve as a temporal and thematic metronome. Environment materially hosts the gatherings and charges the final image by being reclaimed as the group heals. The dove gray map case and photos function as object‑as‑setting. A small deduction for limited constraint on tactical options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (collective healing via Elara’s method), and pressure deepens as more villagers engage and the vines climb. Escalation is textural rather than confrontational; options never narrow sharply, and no hard trade‑off is forced. Emotional prices are paid in recollection, not through a risky choice. Effective, but gently paced.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motifs (arcs, vines, lavender) gather meaning and culminate in a resonant reconfiguration—the mural as living puzzle. Occasional explicit statements (“transmuting our hurts into something beautiful”) edge toward telling, slightly thinning subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material persuasively. The theme lands without moral bookkeeping.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction matches the tone. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful. Rhythmic refrains (“as vines climbed”) are pattern‑taught and support cadence. Minor sameness in register undercuts peak modulation slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sensorial, and largely economical, with images doing multiple jobs. Some repetition and mild purple tendencies are balanced by clarity and forward motion. No major scaffold or figurative muddle; refrains function as motif, not filler. Final lines land with a clear, charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The “puzzle archivist” using arcs in photos to facilitate communal healing feels fresh, and the factory/lavender juxtaposition is memorable. The mural ending is somewhat expected, but the method gives it specificity. Risk is moderate and coherent, not gimmicky. Strong synthesis with a slightly safe resolution.</comment>
