<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—quietly forging resilience through combative tenderness—is clear and enacted through specific choices (ordering, coaxing, tea‑reading, the shadow demonstration). Kael’s arc from defiance to engaged agency reads, but the shift feels swift with limited interior contradiction on the page. The mirrored nervous backward-walking adds a smart behavioral echo, hinting at influence without speechifying. The final change is earned, if a touch easy, with modest felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Under a predominantly causal lens, beats link cleanly: portal arrival → tea‑geometry diagnosis → shadow object test → Kael’s engagement → reversal. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change: his exile lifts and he steps through, reconfigured by the process. The cost is largely internal—pride punctured, shadow faced—credible but not searing. No orientation debt; one scene, one dominant stake, tidy cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library is tactile and integrated: mirror shards, the ledger, the cracked window, and the swing all inflect action and tone. Tools and objects (teacup, mirrors, shadow in glass) are used to enact choices rather than decorate. The swing’s hush/creak bookends the scene and charges the final image. Rules of the world emerge through use, not exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (reversal contingent on confrontations with shadow), and pressure coheres through Elara’s tests. The key tightening arrives with the shadow-in-glass demonstration that compels Kael’s participation. However, the path from defiance to resolution is smooth; risk and price feel low and quickly surmounted. A single escalation suffices but could bite harder.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resilience through confrontation, not consolation, emerges from particulars (tea‑geometry, shard symmetries, the shadow’s return). Thematic lines verge on explicit (“Your exile reverses when you face what you fled”), softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs without a moral lecture, and the mentor’s method embodies the theme. The echo of walking backward renders an elegant, near‑subtextual transmission of resilience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice balances lyric atmosphere with functional clarity; diction and rhythm feel controlled and apt to the world. Dialogue carries status and care in tension, advancing the scene rather than summarizing it. POV stays steady around Elara with minimal leakage. Occasional heightened phrasing skirts purple but remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, image-rich, and purposeful, with strong noun–verb choices and efficient beats. Some figurative density (dust motes as dreams, geometry of leaves, repeated “combative tenderness”) risks lushness bordering on redundancy. Momentum mostly holds; a few sentences echo content without new pressure. Syntax varies enough to maintain flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shard‑mirror archivist, tea‑leaf geometry, and an afternoon shadow bottled in glass synthesize into a distinctive mythos. The mentor–exile frame is familiar, but the execution leans fresh through tactile ritual and object logic. The final reconfiguration feels earned within the invented system. Risk is confident and coherent without gimmickry.</comment>
