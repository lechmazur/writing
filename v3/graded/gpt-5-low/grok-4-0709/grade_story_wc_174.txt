<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority with credible contradiction: a polished manipulator seeking ethical repair. Embodied action with the story stick and the prototypes grounds the psyche. The renunciation of deceptive commissions in favor of risky bar puppetry reads earned by the argument’s residue. Occasional label‑like thematic phrasing slightly flattens the emotional grain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: argument → hush → object handling → plan, culminating in a conceptual turn. Closure is a decisive reorientation with implied cost (loss of income/status; Lena’s absence as price and catalyst). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). The cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally, but lands on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radar dome is vivid and functional: geodesic moonlight, acoustics, and salvage feed tactics and the final image. The campfire stick as micro‑setting/tool recurs and charges the ending. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered. While it enables rather than constrains, it meaningfully charges choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethics vs. manipulation) is established and tightens through reflective pressure into a concrete commitment. The argument’s aftermath coherently escalates to a plan that forecloses prior paths. The price is present but mostly inferred rather than dramatized under friction. Tension is steady rather than spiky, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus fabrication arises organically from the calligrapher’s craft and the reversal ritualized through puppetry. Recurring “half‑lit epiphanies” and the meteor hush reweight the final image. Several sentences state the thesis too directly (“ethical explorations”), blunting subtext. Still, the closing cadence offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction matches an urbane artisan. Psychic distance stays steady; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from hush to intent. Mild repetition of coinages (“hush,” “half‑lit epiphanies”) slightly narrows the palette.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum; images are often striking. Some purple stacking and near‑synonym loops (“meteor hush,” “cosmic dust,” “half‑lit epiphanies”) create a light glaze. No clarity breaks, but pruning could heighten impact. Final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an urbane calligrapher in a radar dome pivoting to subversive puppet shows is distinctive and coherent. The object economy (story stick → wand) and acoustic dome pay off inventively. Risk‑taking feels purposeful without gimmickry. Only the slightly declarative theme notes keep it from higher.</comment>
