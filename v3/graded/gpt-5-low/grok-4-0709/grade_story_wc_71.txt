<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—to understand why houses feel alive—is clear and consistently drives each micro‑choice (collecting, arranging, sanctifying). Interiority is specific to his perceptual bias, but there’s little contradictory impulse under pressure, so the arc feels relatively frictionless. The unlocked door beat hints at moral ambiguity but isn’t pressed for cost. The final shift reads earned if quiet, with minimal visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece tightens from observation → displaced objects → ritual → realization, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of “alive houses.” Orientation is clean early; causality within the lyric frame holds. The closure lands, though the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting and atmosphere are rich and filtered through Elias’s noticing, with recurring objects (the cottage, docks, shard) charging the final image. The environment shapes attention and tactics (finding and using the shard; the cottage’s unlocked door), even if it rarely constrains options. Sensory detail is purposeful and consistent with tone. The final quiet bay/cottage image is reweighted by the new rule of “absorbed normalities.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve/understand the houses’ vitality before normality erases wonder) is established and receives a single meaningful deepening via the displaced‑objects ritual. External opposition is minimal; pressure is largely self‑generated. The turn from collecting to sanctifying functions, but the felt price is light and no path is clearly foreclosed. The ending resolves by insight rather than tested consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thematic threads—displacement, absorption of lives, hush—are elegantly braided and the final image reweights the ordinary. However, the thesis is stated outright (“houses felt alive because…”) rather than fully implied, dulling subtext. The work invites reflection but edges toward explanatory moral at the last beat. Strong cohesion, minor over‑articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice matches Elias’s perceptual signature and stays stable in distance. Diction and rhythm modulate with the scene’s hushed intensity without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision reads intentional, not coy. A few elevated constructions verge on purple but remain legible and voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is fluent with varied rhythm and high information density; images often do double duty. Some figurative density and near‑redundant intensifiers (“hushed blaze,” “silent inferno,” “shard of hush”) cluster in the final third, lightly blurring edge clarity. Momentum holds despite lyricism. Minor pruning could sharpen the peak beat’s precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—“creeping normality noticer,” “shard of hush,” and sanctification via displaced objects—is fresh and coherent. The ritual feels inevitable in hindsight given his noticing bias and the found shard. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. Novel conceptual texture elevates an otherwise quiet arc.</comment>
