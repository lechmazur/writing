<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (cultivate the sparks) and her actions align, but internal conflict is minimal and costs are soft. Interiority leans general (“felt important”) rather than character‑specific. The “dreamless freight guard” identity never pressures choices beyond the title. The closing stance shift (cultivate → protect divergence) lands but isn’t paid through on‑page sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: dune → charm → archive → clock revives sparks → redefined role. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph. Closure is on‑page (Decisive Change plus a small Conceptual Repricing), but cost is underarticulated, keeping the turn low‑pressure. One transition (surface → archive) is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glowing dune and archive are vivid and purposeful; the dune actively guides and grants access, and the archive’s jars concretize stakes. Recurring objects (charm, clock) are integrated with the environment and charge the final image. World rules are consistent enough through action rather than exposition. Slightly more tactile constraint would push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early, but pressure never bites; the archive revives without meaningful resistance. The charm and clock work on first try, and there’s no credible trade‑off or foreclosed option. The final shift to “protect their divergence” reframes, but doesn’t cost her anything yet. Escalation reads as a smooth reveal rather than a tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong motifs (clock/time, sparks/hope, divergence) synergize into a coherent theme about tending possibility rather than fixing it. The final reweighting (“protect their divergence”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. There’s no moralizing, and the images carry meaning. Depth is capped by the low conflict and tidy success.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and controlled; the lyric register fits the piece and remains legible. Diction is occasionally generic (“otherworldly light,” “felt important”), but rhythm is smooth. No head‑hopping or stance confusion. The voice could be more idiosyncratic to Mara to elevate distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, well‑paced, and free of major artifacts; information density is solid. Some phrases are familiar (e.g., “vortex of light,” “charged with energy”) and could be sharper. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum. Final image is clear and recharged by recurring objects.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blend of a chess clock, wave‑function charm, and a “divergent archive” feels fresh and cohesive. The arc follows a familiar quest shape but with a thoughtful repricing at the end. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; minimal friction limits memorability. Still, the synthesis shows conceptual integrity.</comment>
