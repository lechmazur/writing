<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her renunciation of nostalgia gives her a credible stance. However, conflict is largely internal and lightly tested; the magic responds without resistance, so contradictory impulses don’t bite. The cost—choosing to leave—registers, but feels modest given the scale. Interiority leans abstract at key beats (“revival meant creation, not replication”), limiting character‑particular texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp, the bottle functions as a hinge, and the piece holds a Hybrid drive with an accumulative finale. Closure lands via an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she revives the cove and chooses to move on; the price is refusing comfort. Escalation is smooth rather than pressurized, with minimal narrowing of options. The causal chain (conception → lanterns/buildings → community → departure) is coherent but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paper‑Lantern Cove is sensorially vivid (cobblestones, empty windows, golden lanterns), and the amber bottle charges the environment and final image. Details are filtered through Elara’s purpose, avoiding tourist catalog. The setting doesn’t constrain tactics so much as host transformation, keeping it shy of the 9‑band. Still, the recurring object and atmosphere are tightly integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining a civilization—is declared early, but pressure is minimal and the solution arrives without friction. The single tightening is her rejection of replication, which enables magic rather than costing something on the page. The only visible price is leaving after success, which reads more like vocation ritual than a hard trade‑off. No antagonistic force or resistant resource tests her commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—creation versus nostalgia—threads through image and action, and the final lanterns offer a resonant, forward‑leaning answer. Some thesis lines are on‑the‑nose (“That was not revival; that was a lie”), dampening subtext. The bottle’s disappearance and her departure reweight the premise effectively. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The third‑person limited voice is steady, lyrical without wobble, and maintains a coherent perceptual bias. Rhythm modulates well across descriptive and transformational beats. No head‑hopping or stance drift, and elision is modest and legible. The diction occasionally generalizes at peak moments, shaving distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean lines with solid cadence; images do double duty and momentum holds. Mild abstraction and a few summary assertions (“Her purpose was greater than any one place”) blunt edge and tension. Repetition is controlled, not looped, and figurative language stays coherent. The ending image is clear and well‑placed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemist + wishless bottle + accumulative revival frame is appealing, and “working memory as method” adds a fresh angle. Execution is tasteful but safe; the transformation proceeds predictably once the premise is stated. A bolder cost or resistant constraint would heighten ingenuity. Still, the synthesis feels coherent and specific to this piece.</comment>
