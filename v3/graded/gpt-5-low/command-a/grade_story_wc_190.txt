<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elias’s mission is clear and enacted through concrete choices (steering to a quieter sector; selecting the floating garden), and Mira’s restlessness credibly softens. However, internal contradiction and cost are light: Mira’s shift feels swift and minimally contested. Dialogue carries warmth and subtext but edges toward platitude in the final exchange. The relationship dynamic is gentle and functional rather than pressurized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the vial’s shifts and environment intensify toward a calm that reweights the stake. Orientation is clean early, the single scene is coherent, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Mira leaves lighter; the vial glows). The cost is subtle and mostly conceptual (relinquishing agitation), which limits impact but remains legible. Causality is soft but continuous via the gondolier’s micro-choices and the vial’s feedback.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vivid and specific; light, towers, sea of clouds, and the floating garden shape tactics (rerouting) and mood. The storm glass as micro-setting/object is integrated and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful, not a tourist catalog, and mirrors the internal arc without heavy-handed symbolism. World rules feel consistent within the piece’s lyric register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mira’s need for quiet) is signaled early; escalation occurs as the vial clouds, prompting a course change and a garden pause. Pressure is coherent but low-intensity, with one meaningful tightening; the price is mostly the surrender of agitation. The resolution is earned by Elias’s steady method rather than a contested choice. The lack of a sharper trade-off tempers the score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (silence as space that can comfort) is organically tied to setting and object, and the ending image resonates. Yet the piece states its thesis explicitly multiple times (“Silence taught you how to comfort yourself”), which blunts subtext. The strongest moments are image-led (the vial clearing; garden hush) rather than the stated claims. Earned but slightly sermonized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in third-person with a clear perceptual signature anchored in Elias’s praxis. Dialogue reads natural and purposeful, carrying a gentle indirection. Register and rhythm fit the world; no head-hopping confusions. Minor explanatory lines about the vial’s “emotional currents” are passable within the established tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and selective, evocative diction. Occasional purple lean (“glided fluidly logical,” “mirror for the soul”) and thesis-like lines slightly flatten pressure. Information density remains strong without scaffolding or loops. The final image is clean and earned without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The storm-glass-as-silence-gauge aboard a gondola in a prismatic sky-terrace is fresh and well-synthesized. The emotional arc is familiar but animated by distinctive worldbuilding and tactility. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; they mostly pay off. A bolder felt cost or a sharper internal contradiction could have elevated it further.</comment>
