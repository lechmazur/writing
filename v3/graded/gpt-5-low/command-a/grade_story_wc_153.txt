<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her embodied responses (skin prickling, shard humming) keep her anchored in scene. The inner drive to “find the moment before deciding” coheres with the final choice to read the letter. However, contradictory impulses are muted; the path from intent to action encounters little friction, so the change lands more as fulfillment than struggle. The cost is felt but largely internal and lightly dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats tighten cleanly: wandering → condensation messages → map → pedestal letter → reading. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: she opens and reads the unsent letter, and the world audibly shifts (spirits fall silent, single note). Orientation is strong from the outset; causality is patterned rather than mechanical but consistent. The cost—confronting a buried regret—is present, though understated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are vivid and functional, guiding movement and charging the mood. The shard functions as micro‑setting/tool, constraining access to knowledge (condensation words, map) and charging the final image when it turns warm and dull. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (liquid silver moonlight, fogged windows). World rules are learned through use, not exposition, and hold steady.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: confronting the unsent apology. The meaningful tightening arrives with the sealed letter in her own handwriting, forcing a decision that narrows options. Escalation is largely internal and aesthetic rather than oppositional; there’s little resistance, but the cadence shift at the pedestal credibly raises the cost. Resolution stems from her agency at the peak beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of regret, forgiveness, and voiced apology arise organically from concrete acts (condensation messages, opening the letter). However, explicit formulations like “Forgiveness is a seed, not a harvest” and “every apology… becomes a part of the world’s harmony” slide toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The final image still resonates, but the piece occasionally tells the lesson it already shows. Ambiguity about the recipient and consequences leaves some productive space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The close third lyric voice is steady, with controlled diction and a tactile perceptual signature (roots like fingers, pooled moonlight). Rhythm modulates well at turns, and the stance remains within what Elara could plausibly infer. No head‑hopping or stance slips, and elision is purposeful. A few lines brush the abstract, but the voice mostly stays grounded in sensory cues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multi‑function load (atmosphere + action), and momentum stays intact; very little scaffold or synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but consistent with the piece’s taught lyric pattern; it rarely muddies sense. A few platitudinal phrases soften edge at the end, but clarity and cadence remain strong. The final cadence resolves motifs cleanly without overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—mangrove labyrinth, gargoyle shard, condensation messages, unsent letters—feels fresh and coherent. The redemption arc is familiar, but the specific mechanics and imagery make it distinct. Turns arise from established tools rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth comes through in a compact, original frame.</comment>
