<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation (recover lost joy) is clear and drives concrete choices: following the fog‑path, seeking the network, loading the film, painting the fog. Interiority is embodied (tears, tactile handling of tools), though internal contradiction is mild and largely summarized. The convenient prior knowledge of the “knowledge network” skims struggle, trimming depth. The final shift reads earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: discoveries accrete (fresco → path → film → network → display) and culminate in a resonant reconfiguration (she reclaims purpose by painting on fog). Orientation is solid early; cause/effect is plausible without strain. Closure lands on the page, though the felt price is modest. The single scene holds coherence and cadence through one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fog‑shrouded orchard ruins, the fresco fragment, and the mirrors/prisms system are vivid and purposeful. Environment constrains and enables action (fog as canvas; network embedded in ruins), charging the final image. Sensory detail favors visual but stays selective and filtered through Lira’s artistic gaze. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal (rekindling passion), with escalation via discovery and activation rather than direct opposition. The key tightening is the moment she commits to activate the network and then to paint with light; it reweights options but faces little resistance. Cost registers as vulnerability and relinquishing stagnation, not a hard trade‑off. Pressure stays coherent but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of memory, preservation, and art’s purpose emerge through images (film projecting lives onto fog) and are reweighted at the end. However, the explicit line “her art had never truly been about the pigments or the canvas” tips toward stated thesis. The final image resonates without neat moralizing beyond that sentence. Ambiguity remains soft but present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a calm, lyric cadence suited to the material; diction and rhythm are controlled. POV modesty holds; no head‑hopping or unjustified certainty. Compression around “fold of a daydream” is taught and legible. Voice is distinctive enough without mannerism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly efficient; fog motifs recur without slipping into muddle. Occasional redundancy and slightly purple phrasing appear but don’t derail clarity or momentum. Information density is good: most lines advance action or atmosphere. The closing image is crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Painting with light” merged with a mirror/prism knowledge network that projects film onto fog is an original synthesis. The artist‑rediscovers‑passion arc is familiar but executed with specific, fresh means (fog as canvas). Turns feel organic to world logic. Risks are tasteful rather than radical.</comment>
