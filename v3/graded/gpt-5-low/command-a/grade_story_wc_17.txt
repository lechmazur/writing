<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear drive (legacy and “what walls dream about”) and embodied perception anchor her choices, but internal contradiction is light; she rarely hesitates or pays a visible personal price. Micro‑choices—sifting ash, extracting pages, pressing the symbol—align with motive. The closing acceptance of being “their voice” is earned but low‑cost. Strong presence, modest complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, beats link cleanly: diaries → heightened lure; film strip as key → dead‑end wall → hidden chamber → reconfiguration. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (the walls want remembrance), with the film strip’s placement catalyzing the final image. Cost is felt conceptually (taking up the burden) rather than viscerally, but the before/after is legible. Orientation is clear early and the single‑scene scope holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: humidity, ivy, ash, and the waterfall frame both access and constraint. The passage narrows and dead‑ends to force the symbol discovery; the film strip’s glow interacts with space. The mirror‑window charges the final image through setting. Detail is selective and POV‑filtered rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and deepens (echoes grow louder; passage narrows; dead end), but resistance is gentle and solutions arrive without significant friction. The decisive act (pressing the symbol, placing the strip) resolves cleanly with little trade‑off. Stakes are internally meaningful yet feel safe. One clear tightening is present; cost is muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memory versus mapping and burden‑into‑purpose emerge organically from objects and actions, but the sentence “The walls didn’t dream of the past; they dreamed of being remembered” states the thesis outright, softening subtext. The scholar’s ashes offer a counter‑pressure and cautionary echo. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing beyond that line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyric third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (“Corridor Echo Cartographer”) and controlled rhythm. Diction suits the sensibility and never exceeds what this focalizer would register. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Modulation tightens as she advances without becoming purple.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is clean and propulsive, with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. A few familiar turns (“ivy seemed to watch her,” “walls breathing”) flirt with cliché, but clarity and momentum hold. No significant loops or scaffolding, and figurative density remains controlled. The final lines land crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>“Cartographer of echoes” and walls that dream of remembrance feel fresh, and the film negative as key is a striking object choice. The secret chamber/mirror trope leans familiar, but is recontextualized by the memory‑ethos. The synthesis reads specific to this world and voice. Risk is thoughtful rather than flashy.</comment>
