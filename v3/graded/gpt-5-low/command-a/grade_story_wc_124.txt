<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (aromatic caution born of grief) is clear and drives his micro-choices: refusal, reluctant purchase, touching the vial, and finally uncorking it. Interiority is particular (jasmine, rain, lanterns) and embodied. The final acceptance reads earned rather than tidy. Minor safety—no visible self-contradiction under peak pressure—keeps it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative structure holds: the vial triggers a sequence of deepening shards (greenhouse → hospital → backyard) culminating in a present-tense choice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he permits grief via scent), clearly on the page. Causality is clean and the pattern is taught early. The inciting stranger handoff is convenient but doesn’t undercut the arc.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective: neon city, lantern shop, “crystal shadows,” greenhouse of extinct blooms, and the hospital’s antiseptic. Details are filtered through scent memory, matching POV priorities. The vial functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. The greenhouse shard is more evocative than constraining, keeping this just under the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to confront grief via scent—is signaled early and tightens through the escalating visions toward the decisive uncorking. The price is emotionally legible: risking destabilizing memories he’s avoided. Pressure is primarily internal and accumulative; it could use one sharper external nudge, but the cadence shift suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (smell as an anchor for memory and grief) emerges through concrete images and the final act rather than thesis. Lila’s question returns as a reweighted answer in action. One line edges toward explicit statement (“He understood now why…”), slightly reducing subtlety, but the closing image largely earns the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and sensorially tuned to scent and light; dialogue is sparse and natural. Rhythm modulates with the visions, and diction stays within an apt register. No head-hopping or stance slippage. A hair of purple at times, but it remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and character—without slack. Figurative language is consistent (light/scent) and avoids mixed metaphors; cadence varies well. Minimal scaffold or repetition; momentum holds through scene shifts. A few lush phrases could be pared, but they don’t blur sense or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lantern-broker plus ultraviolet truth-vial is a fresh inflection on scent-memory tropes. The greenhouse of extinct plants adds imaginative texture. The core move (grief via sensory trigger) is familiar, executed well rather than radically reimagined. Strong specificity prevents templating but doesn’t reach radical novelty.</comment>
