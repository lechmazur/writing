<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clear want (survive, then discover) and a named counter‑impulse (“override her instinct to flee”), but emotions are largely told rather than embodied. Micro‑choices are summarized, not dramatized under pressure. The final shift to wonder lands, yet it lacks a felt on‑page cost or contradiction resolved in scene. Maya reads competent, but her fear doesn’t visibly degrade perception or tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single‑POV causal arc is coherent: trapped → vial memories → decoding → exit with reweighted aim. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (from survival to discovery), but the cost is soft. Beats connect via “therefore,” yet obstacles resolve without friction, muting the decisive turn. Orientation is clear early; the drive lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The underwater temple and crystal chamber create mood and recurring imagery, with the vial as a charged object. Sensory detail skews visual and abstract; water/oxygen constraints rarely shape tactile choices. Still, the space shifts (walls reconfiguring) and reveals passageways, modestly guiding action. Specificity is serviceable but not deeply lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (oxygen/time) is declared but doesn’t escalate on the page; no concrete setbacks test resolve. The unsnarling move is a single, mostly summary solution that unlocks everything. Agency exists but encounters little resistance, so trade‑offs feel minimal. The ending lacks a visible price beyond a reoriented mindset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Themes—memory, ephemerality, solitude revalued—are coherent and consistent with the object. However, they’re stated directly (“gift,” “motivation had shifted”) rather than earned through subtext and image. The final mood is pleasant but approaches sermonizing reassurance. Little ambiguity or counterpressure to deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and legible; the elevated, lyrical register is consistent. Diction tends toward abstract repetition (“gathered hush,” “lonesome splendor,” “ephemeral”), flattening texture. Rhythm is smooth but samey, with filter and summary dampening immediacy. Voice feels generalized rather than distinctly Maya’s.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clean mechanics, but abstraction and phrase reuse create scaffold and mild purple overtones. Several near‑duplicate assertions slow momentum (motivation shift and temple transformation recapped). Figurative density outpaces sensory particular, especially in peak beats. Information load is clear yet could be sharper and more concrete.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Memory‑touching vial in an underwater temple offers a promising blend, but execution leans on familiar mystical shorthand. The “time running out” frame doesn’t generate fresh tactics or costs. Some ingenuity in linking ritual ephemerality to scientific curiosity, yet the turns feel safe. Conceptual reweighting lands, just not in a surprising way.</comment>
