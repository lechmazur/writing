<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (repay a lifelong debt) and a credible internal split between longing for freedom and loyalty to the owed bond. The embodied beats—kneeling at the anchor tree, clutching the bead—show pressure on her choices. Some emotional phrasing trends abstract (“lovingly venomous,” “mournful elation”), softening edge specificity. The final step into the night reads earned, though the price remains conceptual rather than concretely felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the bead’s activation draws other spirits and reweights the debt from personal to collective, culminating in a charged-poise exit. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the object and anchor tree track throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with implied cost, though stakes never face a concrete on‑page test. No causality breaks; pressure accrues via image density rather than turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse, winter fields, and “endless night” are vivid and purpose‑driven; the anchor tree and bead function as spatial and emotional constraints. Setting integrates with action (kneeling at roots; bead light re-liming the glass walls) and charges the final image. Sensory palette leans visual and atmospheric but remains selective and coherent. Minor symbolism edge (mourning tree) is earned by use rather than solely gesture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs. debt) is signaled early; escalation arrives when the bead awakens and the chorus of spirits reframes the debt as collective. The protagonist’s agency crystallizes in choosing to step out, reoriented toward reckoning. The cost is more promised than paid, keeping pressure credible but less visceral. No major reversal, but a meaningful tightening consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of obligation, betrayal, and communal grief emerge through the bead’s resonance and the gathered dead. The final image reframes the sanctuary as threshold, offering a quiet, resonant non‑literal answer (freedom requires communal reckoning). One line states theme outright (“her debt was not just personal but collective”), shaving subtlety. Still, the motifs connect organically without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical register suited to the spectral subject. Diction is mostly precise and pattern‑aware; rhythm modulates as pressure rises. Occasional abstract descriptors dilute the mind’s edge under stress, but the perceptual signature remains coherent. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong cadence and image economy with few mechanical slips; most lines do double duty. Some purple lean and light redundancy (debt/betrayal motifs stated and restated) soften momentum. Figurative language is generally coherent; a few abstractions could be cut for sharper impact. Final line lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>A ghost bride in an alchemical orchard greenhouse with a resonant bead offers a fresh synthesis of familiar tropes. The collective‑debt turn adds a non‑obvious angle that feels grounded in prior beats. Risks are lyrical rather than structural; they pay off without obscuring clarity. Not a radical reinvention, but convincingly particular.</comment>
