<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her pivot—“we will sing not to be heard, but to listen”—aligns with her aim. Interiority is present but relatively generalized; we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond “expectantly resigned” shifting to action. Secondary characters exert minimal pressure, keeping her choices low‑friction. The final stance feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: a measured build from quiet rehearsal to performance culminates in a conceptual repricing where silence becomes victory. Causality is clean (decision → practice → growth → performance). Closure lands, but the visible price is soft, mostly conceptual rather than on‑page loss. Orientation is strong from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The velvet library, stained glass, autumn wind, and rosette create a vivid, coherently filtered space. The rosette functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it meaningfully frames and deepens mood and choices. Detail is selective and purposeful, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (preserving vanishing arts vs. indifference) are clear, but pressure remains gentle, with little real risk or loss. The escalation is a deepening of method rather than a narrowing of options. The performance provides a cadence shift, yet costs and consequences are largely implied. No decisive reversal tests commitment under strain.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of unity, listening, and reclaiming vanishing arts emerge through the ritual and rosette motif. Some lines tip into statement/moralizing (“unlearning hatred,” “true victory… in the silence they had replaced”), which blunts subtext. Still, the ending reweights earlier images without needing explanation. The piece invites reflection even if it leans earnest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person voice is consistent and apt; cadence is controlled and modulates with the choir’s hum. Minimal dialogue lands with clarity and purpose. Diction stays within a believable register for this tone, with only minor abstraction creep. No POV leakage or stance confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences are largely clean with varied rhythm, strong nouns, and purposeful imagery. Occasional purple or abstract phrasing (“mausoleum of silence,” repeated “unlearning hatred”) softens immediacy. No major loops or scaffolding; momentum holds. Final image resolves with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The “subtracting noise” tactic and the rosette as talisman offer a fresh inflection on a familiar “art vs. indifference” premise. The vision coheres without gimmickry. Emotional truth is present, though the arc is safe and avoids sharper risks or ambiguity. The closure image feels earned if not surprising.</comment>
