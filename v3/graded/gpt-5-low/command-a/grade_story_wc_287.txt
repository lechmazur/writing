<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—“to reflect light into dark corners”—drives her micro‑choices (descending, surrendering the tooth), and her gardener pragmatism reads consistently. Internal contradiction is light; curiosity vs. caution is implied but never stressed into a true dilemma. The tactile handling of the tooth under pressure helps reveal her. The emotional cost (opening herself and relinquishing the object) lands but remains modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: harbor hush → approach → recognition → exchange. Orientation is clean early; single scene, single POV. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise in the shared object/lantern moment; the cost is mostly emotional and underplayed. Causality is simple but intact, with no late rule changes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The harbor by moonlight is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility; lantern light, docks, and water rhythms integrate with theme. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain choice, it meaningfully charges the final image. Sensory texture favors visual and cadence in a purposeful way. Proper‑noun economy and spatial coherence are solid.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure grows gently (boat’s approach; matching carvings), but stakes remain largely tonal and relational. The meaningful tightening is the reveal of the lockmaster and the object match; options narrow to a vulnerable exchange. The on‑page price is soft—no foreclosed alternate path beyond keeping the tooth. Tension operates more as hush and expectancy than conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Light vs. shadow and care in indifferent spaces surface through action and images, with the lantern/object echo. Some lines tilt toward thematic declaration (“You’ve found more than just a tool... a piece of me”), edging on the nose. The ending offers a resonant, quiet answer—connection as illumination—without full moral neatness. Subtext exists in gesture and shared craftsmanship.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and close; diction is lyrical but coherent with Elara’s temperament. Dialogue is slightly heightened yet natural enough, carrying subtext and advancing the encounter. Rhythm modulates well with the hush and the approach. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line work is smooth and image‑driven, with controlled repetition (“quivering hush”) that supports cadence. A few phrases verge on purple but don’t muddle sense; minimal redundancy and clean mechanics. Sentences often do double duty (atmosphere + character), maintaining momentum in a quiet scene. The final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The pairing of a fire‑escape gardener and a lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth is fresh and specific. The luminous harbor hush plus toolcraft connection creates a distinct texture. While the arc is familiar (quiet meeting, kindred spirits), the object’s specificity and tone avoid template blandness. Risk is moderate, executed with coherence.</comment>
