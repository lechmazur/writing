<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation is clear and sustained, and her actions align with her goal. Interiority is present but leans abstract, with little contradictory impulse or genuine struggle on the page. The cost of using her long‑guarded starlight hints at depth but doesn’t force a fraught choice. Overall, credible but low‑pressure characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ritual density builds to the sealing and the crater’s “exhale.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the map pulses and the orchard hums. Cost is present (spending the safekept starlight), though it reads more conceptual than felt. Orientation and scene boundaries are clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s work. Objects-as-setting (plate, discarded items, vial) integrate with action and charge the final image. The environment mainly supports tone rather than constraining choice, keeping it shy of the highest band. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible (completing the sealing), with a single tightening via the tremor and nearing climax. Pressure remains gentle; there’s little opposition or trade‑off beyond expending the vial. The ending is earned but the felt price and narrowing of options are modest. Tension is mostly atmospheric rather than consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of patience, preservation, and mapping inner lives emerge through particulars (safekept starlight, living map). The final “world exhaled” image reweights earlier stillness with quiet resonance. Slight overtness creeps in with explicit “interconnectedness” phrasing. Subtext mostly rides image rather than statement, to good effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person close holds steady, with controlled cadence and image patterns. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; diction matches the fable‑alchemy register. Some repetitious constructions soften edge and propulsion, but clarity remains high. Rhythm modulates softly at the climax without grand flourish.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean sentences with balanced rhythm; images carry multiple jobs (tone, world, action). Minor redundancy and adjective stacking appear (“moving stillness,” reiterations of patience), slightly slowing momentum. Figurative control holds without mixed metaphors, and closure image is clear. Trimming could heighten pressure and precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—flash‑paper alchemy, safekept starlight, heartbeats as maps in a subarctic orchard—feels fresh and cohesive. The ritual sequence is familiar, but the object set and aim lend originality. The turn to a “living map” is earned by prior particulars. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural, landing solidly but not explosively.</comment>
