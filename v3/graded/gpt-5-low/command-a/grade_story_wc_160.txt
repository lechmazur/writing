<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation (harmonize village and scholars) and professional specificity give Elias credible agency. Interiority tracks through tactile actions (chain, adhesive) and embodied unease (trembling), though struggle feels low‑friction. The solution reads as aligned with his traits but borderline too tidy. A visible personal cost beyond nerves is thin, keeping the arc modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: adhesive → code → chain‑poem map → design choice → outcome. Closure lands in a decisive plan that reconfigures the central stake, but the “By dawn” acceptance compresses friction and cost off‑page. Some contrivance in discoveries (poetic chain, adhesive clue) smooths pressure. Cost at the ending is conceptual rather than felt, limiting punch.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dormant volcano amphitheater is vividly rendered and threaded through action (breathing walls syncing with heartbeat). The chain functions as micro‑setting/object that charges perception and the final image. Environment lightly pressures tactics but rarely constrains choice beyond mood and guidance. Economy of detail serves tone and stakes without tourist cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early, yet escalation is gentle and largely internal. The key tightening—realizing “To give is to gain, to break is to mend”—yields a compromise without a hard trade‑off on the page. No reversal or loss tests his commitment; opposition is summarized rather than exerted. Resolution feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of balance, unity, and compassion emerge through particulars (adhesive code; chain‑poem; compromise design). The final image recasts the volcano as unity, but the maxim (“To give is to gain…”) skirts platitude. Subtext lives in objects more than in conflict or silence with others, keeping complexity moderate. Resonance is present, if curated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with measured lyricism; sensory precision and occupational diction feel character‑bound. Rhythm modulates with pressure (breath, heartbeat) without head‑hopping. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward ornamental, but clarity holds. Absence of dialogue avoids potential flatness while preserving tonal control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean, fluent sentences with purposeful imagery; the “breathing amphitheater” motif sustains cadence. Minor repetition (trembling, breath) and a few lush lines flirt with purple but do not obscure causality. Information density is solid; scaffolding is minimal. Final lines land cleanly without expository spill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—machinist decoding compassion via adhesive and a poetic chain in a breathing volcano—feels fresh. The compromise ending is conceptually neat but familiar, damping audacity. Specific tools and motifs lift it above template. Greater risk in cost or an unforeseen constraint would sharpen memorability.</comment>
