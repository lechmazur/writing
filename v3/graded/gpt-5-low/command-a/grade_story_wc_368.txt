<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael reads as specific and embodied (dye‑stained hands, donor heart sensitivity), and his deliberate choice to approach the grieving woman aligns with his motive. Interiority is present but largely serene; contradictory impulses (gift vs. curse) skim the surface rather than driving a fraught on‑page trade‑off. The woman has texture but functions mostly as a catalyst. The ending stance feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; the piece holds a single scene and POV. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the wing, light, and “threads” build to a Charged Poise closure where Kael recommits to illuminating others. Closure lands, but the cost is soft and largely conceptual. The because/therefore chain is thin, relying more on mood than turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house and sensory detail (jasmine, beams, mist) are vivid and consistently filtered through Kael’s craft and gift. The blue morpho wing functions as a recurring object that charges images and the final moment. The environment supports tone and method more than it constrains choice. Strong specificity without crossing into constraint‑driven 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to share/receive magnetized stories—tightens slightly when the woman reveals her loss. Escalation is modest; the primary turn is disclosure, followed by gentle counsel. Costs remain abstract, with no option truly foreclosed on the page. The cadence shift at the end deepens purpose but doesn’t bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—beauty/fragility, stories as illumination—coheres via wing and sun trails. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“They show us we’re not alone”), which blunts subtext. The final image reweights the premise but shades toward aphorism. Resonance is present yet partially told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident; diction suits a contemplative artisan. Dialogue carries subtext but occasionally slips into polished wisdom, reducing naturalism. Rhythmic control is good with clean mechanics. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished, sensorial, and mostly efficient; images like “threads” and “kaleidoscope of colors” land cleanly. Occasional familiar phrasings (“we’re not alone,” “allows us to fly”) and overt symbolism soften edge and momentum. No major loops or muddle, and the final line is crisp. Information density holds without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—dye master with donor‑heart magnetism, wing as optical instrument, floating tea house—is fresh and memorable. The method of tracking sun trails is intriguing. The counsel risks platitude, tempering the ingenuity’s payoff. Still, the vision feels coherent and distinct.</comment>
