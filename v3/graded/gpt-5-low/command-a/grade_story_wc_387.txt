<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation—to honor hidden effort—is clear and consistently embodied through her handling of the whisk and attention to fireflies. Interiority is specific and sensorial, but contradictory impulses are faint; her small startle at the whistle’s echo is the closest to live tension. The final shift (accepting an inner alignment with the patterns she seeks) lands but with minimal visible cost. The net‑mender detail colors perception yet never forces a test or trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the scene builds through motifs toward a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is early and clean; the single scene holds. Closure arrives as a reweighted understanding (patterns in the world and self), but the cost is soft and largely conceptual. The whistle echo serves the lone hinge, creating a mild internal deepening rather than a decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parapet after rain, fireflies, damp stone, and the bamboo whisk are vivid, POV‑filtered, and sensorially rich. Details feel lived‑in and purposeful, especially the whisk as micro‑setting that charges the final image. The environment supports tone and theme, though it rarely constrains choices. World rules and spatial coherence remain stable and legible throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to perceive and honor hidden effort/patterns) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens. The whistle echo is a gentle deepening, not a foreclosing turn or price‑exacting test. No option is materially narrowed; resolution reads as acceptance more than a choice under pressure. The ending’s peace feels earned emotionally but light on dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres through concrete particulars (whisk craft, fireflies’ “moon paths,” net‑mending) that accrue toward a resonant, quiet answer: attention dignifies the unseen. Some lines edge toward telling (“a testament to the hidden effort”), but most meaning is carried by image and pattern. The final image reweighs prior motifs without sermonizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and not confusing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and character‑specific, with controlled diction and rhythm aligned to contemplative stakes. POV distance remains consistent with no leakage; inference reads as inference. The cadence modulates subtly at the hinge (the echo), maintaining coherence. No dialogue is needed for this mode and none is missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and musical with high information density; images often do double duty for theme and mood. Occasional purple tendencies and near‑redundant emphasis on patterns and hidden effort slightly slow momentum. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and transitions are clean. Final image is clear and not muddled by metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Net‑mender philosopher” plus a bamboo whisk as emblem of hidden craft is a fresh angle, and the firefly “moon paths” belief adds texture. The overall move—quiet epiphany via accumulative motifs—is familiar, but the object choice and occupational lens give it individuality. Risks are modest but coherent to the piece’s aims. The realization feels organic, not grafted.</comment>
