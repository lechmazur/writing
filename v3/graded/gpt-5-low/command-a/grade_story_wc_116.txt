<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (to witness without judgment) is clear and tested when she chooses to follow the swan’s map “against her better judgment.” Interiority is particular (gripping the swan, breath catching at the mirror) and her contradiction—archivist of stasis compelled into change—reads. The closing endurance/renunciation (returning to the work, altered) feels earned with a conceptual cost. Slight abstraction in peak beats limits deeper, scene‑bound contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Causality is clean: swan reveals “Burrow” → map → journey → mirror dissolution → return transformed. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the refuge erased, journals filled, and her stance reweighted; the cost is legible in the loss of the place and her ceded certainty. A few symbol mentions (undeciphered symbols) don’t affect options, but the structure holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: overgrown library, river’s “regenerative silence,” and the obsidian refuge that absorbs light. The environment constrains and charges choices (catacomb walls “guiding,” the mirror as operative device), and the swan-as-object recharges the final image. Sensory selection supports tone without tourist‑catalog sprawl. Strong, even if not radically novel.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving fragile balance versus risking transformation. Pressure escalates coherently (swan awakens → arduous transit → mirror dissolution), and the final stance forecloses an easier, untouched stasis. The conceptual cost lands, though stakes remain partially abstract rather than viscerally embodied. Agency drives the key turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Impermanence/renewal and witness vs. participation interweave through particulars (swan, river, mirror) and culminate in a quiet repricing of silence. The final line slightly overstates the thesis (“she had become the silence she sought to preserve”), softening subtext. Still, the motif work reweights prior images with resonance. Earned insight more than declared moral overall.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent third‑person limited with lyrical texture suited to the premise. Diction and rhythm are controlled; the voice modulates as pressure rises (from lush observation to compressed dissolution). No head‑hopping or register drift beyond intention. Absence of dialogue is appropriate and does not hinder propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, image‑dense, and mostly efficient; sentences carry multiple jobs without obvious scaffold or loops. A few elevated phrases approach purple but stay legible and purposeful. Momentum holds through the journey and dissolution beats. Final cadence is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While “mystic library/obsidian mirror” is familiar, the origami swan’s mechanics and “regenerative silence” give a fresh angle. The reconfiguration on return is conceptually neat without gimmickry. Not a radical reinvention, but coherent and specific to this voice. Risk‑taking is measured rather than bold.</comment>
