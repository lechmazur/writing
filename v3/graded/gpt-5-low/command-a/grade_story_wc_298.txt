<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive and contradiction (reckless idealist with fiercely gentle hands; prisoner/protector) are clear and embodied through action. Her micro‑choices (planting, following the warning, confronting the shadow self) align with values. The final endurance choice (to stay) is earned but comes a touch easily, with limited felt deterioration under peak pressure. A stronger sense of internal slippage or competing impulse at the peak would elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture and a causal spine: warning → deeper chamber → confrontation → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with on‑page cost (she forecloses freedom to remain bound). The cost is legible but not maximally pressed; the “debt due” threat resolves without a tangible squeeze beyond the realization. Orientation is clean throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is richly specific and POV‑filtered; sensory detail (earth/decay, half‑lit glow, roots between bones) integrates with action. The environment lightly constrains choice (the root’s “trammel” and pattern warning redirect her path) and charges the final image. World rules remain consistent and discovered via movement, not exposition. A single moment where terrain alters tactics more concretely would push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (freedom vs self‑bound purpose) and escalate via the warning sign and shadow‑self confrontation. The meaningful tightening is the price‑due ultimatum leading to her renunciation. Still, pressure feels cushioned: the antagonist force doesn’t force a painful trade beyond naming it, and options don’t visibly narrow beyond her ethos. The choice reads firm but not harrowed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of meaning as currency, sacrifice, and chosen bondage emerge organically from particulars (tokens, carvings, roots, the traded voice). However, the explicit line “Perhaps destinies aren’t meant to be bartered…” leans into moralizing, blunting subtext at the end. The final image reaffirms purpose but could resonate more by trusting image over thesis. Subtlety wavers at the exact closing turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close POV with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm fit mood and character. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the shadow self carrying subtext about cost and choice. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional declaratives brush against the lyric register but don’t break it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are polished with strong image economy; sensory detail serves both mood and motion. Some phrasing recurs (“half‑lit,” the destiny barter motif) and a few sentences tip toward exposition or thematic telling. No major figurative muddle, but there’s slight purple sheen and minor repetition that dampen propulsion. Rhythm remains varied and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” and meaning‑as‑currency give a fresh angle; the burned Fool card and self‑double confrontation are familiar but handled with care. The synthesis feels coherent and character‑driven rather than gimmicky. The ending choice is honest, if safe. A sharper, less verbalized final reweighting would boost originality’s afterglow.</comment>
