<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to give voice to the lost—feels clear and drives her choices (placing the globe, parsing dreams, whispering names). Interiority is tangible and embodied in the shrine’s ritual, though internal contradiction is slight and largely untested. The ghost‑whisperer competence is credible but rarely strained. The ending’s quiet renunciation (leaving the globe) reads earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dreams accrue into a coherent story, and the final image (globe clearing, names spoken) delivers a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the pattern (object → dreams → assembly → charged final beat) holds. Cost is present but modest (spent candles, dawn, emotional expenditure). The single‑scene arc is coherent and contained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Arctic ice‑shrine and candlelight are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s ritualistic focus. The snow globe as recurring object charges space and the final image. While the environment seldom constrains tactics, it steepens atmosphere and frames the rite. Sensory economy is strong without tourist‑catalog excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the globe’s truth—tightens via the serial dreams and culminates in the whispered names and charged placement. Pressure escalates in texture rather than direct opposition; there’s little active risk or counterforce. The candle gutter/dawn clock is a mild narrowing. The resolution is earned but the on‑page price remains gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memory, salvage, and the ethics of witnessing emerge through concrete particulars (melted globe, dream cameos, speaking names). The finale reweights “windows of connection” without sermonizing, producing a soft ache. A hair of sentimentality and tidy closure temper the depth. Still, the image‑led answer lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held to Elara, with controlled cadence. Diction fits the hushed, ritual frame and modulates toward the charged final image. No head‑hopping; inference stays within plausible knowledge. Occasional familiar turns of phrase keep it shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, rhythmic, and purposeful; the imagery does multiple jobs. Minor redundancy and occasional purple drift (“borrowed starlight,” “tapestry”) slightly blunt momentum. The prose still carries the accumulative build without loops or syntactic monotony. Final sentence lands crisply on image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method—reading strangers’ dream cameos to decode a relic—feels fresh within a ghost‑ritual frame, and the Arctic shrine adds distinct texture. The melted snow globe as a distorted memory device is a strong, specific anchor. Risks are tasteful rather than daring; the conflict template stays safe. Still, the synthesis reads singular and thoughtfully executed.</comment>
