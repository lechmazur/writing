<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and carried through—she enters to save a dying language and endures cost to do so. Interiority is present (“hands trembled,” “pressed on while draining”) but contradictions remain soft; we seldom see competing impulses clash in-scene beyond endurance. Actions align with motives and the choice to continue as the diamond drains feels earned. A deeper, messier inner debate would lift this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: canyon → pattern heard → humming with the diamond → language coalesces → curse drains her → shatter and aftermath. Orientation is immediate and stable; single scene flow holds. Closure lands with on‑page cost (diamond destroyed, her depletion) and a decisive change (language etched into the canyon). The path is linear with limited complication, but coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful setting: bone towers, luminescent moss, and pulsing walls do atmospheric and functional work. The tunnel’s acoustics directly shape tactics (deciphering echoes), and the final image recharges place (“etched into the canyon”). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered. A touch more tactile constraint in moment‑to‑moment movement could push higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (save the language), with escalation via rising echo density, discovered melody, and the curse’s drain. The key tightening is the cost intensifying as she speaks; the shattering diamond forecloses options credibly. Tension integrates internal drive and external pressure without gimmicks. It’s strong, if largely a single arc without reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of preservation, the cost of art/speech, and translation as communion with environment emerge organically. Recurring images (bone towers, echoes, birds) carry resonance into the charged final role shift (storyteller → “keeper of echoes”). Some lines overstate (“Her motivation was clear,” “She knew the language was safe now”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall, the afterimage is earned and reflective.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical cadence that fits the mythic register. The perceptual signature (sound/texture bias) is steady, with clean focalization. Occasional generic scaffolds and declaratives flatten peaks. Rhythm holds under pressure without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with strong image economy (“copper veins,” “jagged facets,” “flock… mirroring her rhythm”). Minor tell-y scaffolds and repeated constructions (“It was said…”) slow momentum. Figurative language remains coherent; no muddle at closure. A light trim of summary lines would tighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: translating texture to sound via a cursed diamond and echo‑tunnel, guided by bird‑flight patterns, feels fresh and integral. The bone‑tower canyon is a memorable stage, and the costed transformation is not a genre template. Risks are coherent rather than flashy. Slight conventionality in phrasing keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
