<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (“to map empathy onto action”) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (entering the mirror shop, testing each mirror, placing the fragment) align with it. Internal conflict is present but muted; she faces fears largely in summary, with little on‑page contradiction or cost. The merger of her “shadow‑laced” nature with the “courage of the anomaly” lands, but feels earned more by assertion than dramatized struggle. Strong presence, low frictions, modest depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. The sequence—fragment → mirrors reveal blueprint → pedestal assembly → lighthouse placement—tracks cleanly and orients early. Closure is a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration with the crystal reconstituted and installed, but the cost is light and the assembly happens conveniently once she sets the fragment down. Stakes resolve smoothly without a tightening that bites.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard over ice floes is vivid and returns to charge the final image; the vintage shop with shifting‑pattern mirrors feels tactile and integrated. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility and support tone. However, environment rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond ambiance, keeping it just short of the top band. Still, strong specificity and atmosphere throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring balance/empathy via the crystal—is signaled early, but pressure escalates gently rather than coercively. The key turn (placing the fragment at the pedestal) leads to an effortless resolution as other shards assemble themselves, undercutting cost. Internal and external threads interweave, yet the conflict never forces a consequential trade‑off. The final act reads earned but easy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres (empathy translated into action; understanding over victory), with mirrored images shifting from battle to mediation to unity. Several lines state the thesis directly, edging into on‑the‑nose moralizing (“to map empathy onto action,” “a beacon of unity”). The final image reweights prior motifs but avoids deeper ambiguity or counter‑pressure. Resonant, if a touch didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close remains stable and confidently lyrical; sensory filtering matches Elara’s calm intuition. Diction is consistent, though phrases like “shadow‑laced peacekeeper” and “weighted breath before reply” recur as labels rather than lived texture. Rhythm is controlled, with measured cadence fitting the contemplative arc. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and largely economical; images like rippling mirrors and rising fragments carry momentum. Occasional purple lifts (“otherworldly energy,” “a courageous anomaly”) and thesis‑like repetition modestly blunt pressure. Minimal scaffolding and clear sequencing keep flow intact. The final sentence lands crisply without syntactic clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The “lighthouse orchard” and mirror‑mediated reconstitution feel fresh, and the anomaly reframes courage intriguingly. The assembly mechanic resolving itself reads familiar (chosen‑object convening shards), reducing distinctiveness at the peak. Still, the synthesis of maritime cold, orchard bloom, and empathic blueprint offers a memorable palette. Solid originality without radical risk.</comment>
