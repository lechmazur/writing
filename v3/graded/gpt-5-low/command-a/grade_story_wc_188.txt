<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive and agency are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (dipping, spinning, arranging, reigniting) align with that drive. However, she faces little internal contradiction or doubt; resolve never truly frays under pressure. Emotions are largely asserted via lyrical register rather than embodied conflict. The ending earns a small endurance cost (fatigue, smudged hands) but not a tested renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the scene densifies from approach → ignition → communal mosaic → charged finale. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fortress moves from hush to cheering, darkness to beacon. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, though the cost at closure is modest. The pattern is taught and kept; escalation is mostly tonal rather than causal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: vines, starless night, and the dry fountain become canvas and amplifier for light. The darkness materially charges the fire’s effect and the fountain grounds the mosaic action. Details are filtered through Lira’s craft-minded perception. The final beacon image is strongly environment-charged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (defy hopelessness) with a clear tightening from solitary preparation to communal ignition. Yet resistance is soft; obstacles don’t force trade-offs beyond effort and attention. The major turn is essentially success upon attempt, with little risk of failure dramatized. The visible price remains light, limiting pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of communal renewal through art and ritual emerge organically from action (mosaic sun, shared chant, beacon finale). A few direct statements (“Tonight, we rise”) brush sentimentality but don’t derail resonance. The reprise of light against starless hush gives a clean non-literal answer. Complexity is moderate, leaning inspirational rather than thorned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled lyric cadence that modulates at key beats (approach hush vs. ignition swell). Diction matches the piece’s ritual-toned aim without register slips. The single spoken line lands cleanly. Voice feels particular to a craft-focused, ritual-leaning maker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and musical, with selective, purposeful images. Occasional abstractions and familiar phrases (“gravity of hopelessness,” “thick with anticipation”) soften edge and density. No major scaffolding or loops; momentum holds. Figurative control is generally strong, with minor purple glints.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of pyrotechnic ritual, mosaic-making, and communal chant in a vine-clad fortress feels fresh. The closure image (beaconed walls, smoldering knot) reads distinctive. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural; the piece opts for safety in conflict. Still, the craft-specific choices raise it above template uplift.</comment>
