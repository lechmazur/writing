<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to decode the mathematics of emotion and address her mentor’s ambiguous loss—is clear and drives continuous, purposeful choices. Interiority is present but leans abstract; we get little embodied contradiction beyond caution vs. curiosity. Her decision to proceed despite the warning is credible yet lightly priced on the page. The character reads specific, not stock, but peak‑beat emotional texture could deepen.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant lens: Causal. The chain—eyes → shadows → mosaic code → warm stone → journal warning → revised understanding—tracks cleanly and stays single‑POV. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration (control → harmony) with a charged final image, though the cost is mostly implied. Orientation is clear early and the one transition (orchard ↔ workshop) is controlled.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vivid and particular (stalactite drip, luminous fruit) and returns in the charged final image. The environment meaningfully participates through the mosaic stones and the singled‑out tree, though it rarely constrains tactics under pressure. Object‑as‑setting (glass eyes, stones) integrates with place rather than feeling decorative. Sensory selection favors the visual but maintains atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pressure is primarily puzzle‑driven; stakes remain conceptual and the danger manifests via a journal warning rather than on‑page consequence. There is a single deepening turn (the warning) but little narrowing of options or felt cost. Her choice to continue is earnest yet minimally tested. Tension hums but seldom tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Themes of ambiguous loss and harmony vs. control are coherent and seeded by the mentor thread. However, the climax states the thesis explicitly (“not about control but about harmony”), flattening subtext in the final movement. The images (eyes, mosaics, orchard) could bear more of the meaning without explanation. The ending invites reflection, but the moralizing edge blunts resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is steady, diction controlled, and cadence suits a quiet, contemplative quest. The voice is competent and cohesive, though it skews toward a neutral high‑fantasy register rather than an idiosyncratic signature. No dialogue is needed and none is missed. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, with purposeful detail and minimal scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs without obvious loops. A few abstract phrasings and explanatory lines in the close reduce intensity. Imagery (glowing fruit, shifting shadows) is crisp without purple accumulation. Mechanics and sequencing are solid.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—cavern orchard, taxidermist’s eyes as analytic lenses, mosaic math of emotion—feels fresh and integrated. The mentor’s hidden journal is a familiar device, but the object ecology gives it a new texture. The final conceptual turn is sensible if slightly declarative. Risk is moderate and coherent.</comment>
