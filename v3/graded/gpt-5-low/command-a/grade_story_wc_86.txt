<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motives and method (empathy, moon‑phase cadence, the drawer pull) are clear and consistently enacted, and her calm authority plays credibly against Kael’s guardedness. However, internal contradiction is light; she rarely strains under competing impulses on the page. The final acceptance reads earned but tidy, with limited felt cost to her. Kael’s shift is plausible yet somewhat swift, more stance articulation than pressured transformation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: a single negotiation scene in weather pressure culminates in a Charged Poise—agreement “to begin anew” with the drawer pull passed. Orientation is immediate and clean, and the closure unit lands on the page. The conceptual cost (pride, “I do not forgive lightly”) is present but modestly felt. Linkages are coherent, though escalation remains primarily rhetorical.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm‑worn parapet and mist are vivid and consistent, filtering perception and tone through Elara’s sensibility. The environment subtly frames “neutral ground” and charges the final image but seldom constrains tactics beyond mood and proximity. The drawer pull functions as a micro‑setting object that returns meaningfully. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful without excess cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to exit the blame cycle—arrives early, and the tightening occurs when Kael challenges neutrality and Elara reframes it, leading to his conditional assent. The price is acknowledged (“I do not forgive lightly”) but not strongly dramatized; no option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Pressure remains coherent yet gentle, more ethical redefinition than hard trade‑off. Stakes feel real but land as a calibrated détente rather than a costly pivot.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom and redefining neutrality is cohesive, anchored by the drawer pull and moon motif. Yet several lines state theses outright (“apologies and forgiveness are not currencies”), flattening subtext. The final image reweighs meaning via the shared object but edges toward declared moral. Resonance lingers, though its complexity is tempered by on‑the‑nose articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and steady; the POV’s perceptual signature (moon, mist, tactile object) feels coherent. Dialogue is clean and purposeful, with mild subtext (Kael’s guarded pride) and minimal exposition drag. Register is elevated but consistent with the ceremonial stakes. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and mostly efficient beats; key images (mist, drawer pull, waning moon) carry weight. There is occasional purple tilt and thematic reiteration that could be leaner. No major loops or muddled metaphors impede clarity. The final cadence is clean and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The negotiator using lunar phases and an antique drawer pull as a treaty relic adds freshness to a familiar reconciliation frame. The closing exchange and object‑pass image are graceful if not surprising. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; the piece prefers elegance over invention. Emotional truth holds but stops short of a non‑obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
