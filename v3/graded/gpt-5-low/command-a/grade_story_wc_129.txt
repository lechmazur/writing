<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation (belonging) is clear and consistent, and her craft grounds her interiority. However, internal contradiction is thin; she rarely struggles against herself, and most choices are low-friction. Agency exists (choosing the search, engaging others) but pressure rarely forces a costly trade-off. The final acceptance feels earned but gentle rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative structure holds: tag discovery → inquiry → extended search → Echo encounter → reweighted return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Echo marks her sculpture and she recasts belonging. The cost is implied (months of searching, vulnerability) but not strongly dramatized, and the Echo meeting veers convenient. Orientation is clean and the lens remains consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard/crater and the obsidian arbor are vivid, specific, and tonally integrated. Setting details recur and charge the ending image (arbor + tag), though they seldom constrain tactics. Sensory selection feels filtered through Lira’s sensibility as a sculptor. World rules are consistent and delivered through image over exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (belonging) is legible from the start, but escalation remains soft and largely summarized. The search broadens rather than tightens pressure, and there’s no beat where a real option is foreclosed with visible cost. Echo’s appearance resolves without a substantive test or reversal. Emotion accumulates, but tension seldom spikes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of kinship as a woven, lived practice develops through Lira’s integrating others’ stories and the arbor’s shifting patterns. The final image reweights the premise (belonging earned through making and listening). However, Echo’s line “what you’ve found is yourself” states the thesis too baldly, dulling subtext in the climactic moment. The piece resists cynicism but edges toward neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically consistent with a distinct perceptual signature (reeds, refraction, ache). POV is stable and credible; compression is purposeful. Minor purple hints appear but do not obscure clarity. Dialogue is minimal yet functional at the Echo beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line work is clean, rhythmic, and image-led with good economy. Some phrases verge on repetition or abstraction (“luminescent ache,” “web of kinship”) and momentum flattens in the summarized middle. Figurative control is mostly tight; no significant loops or template cadence. Final line/image lands clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The orchard-crater milieu and marsh-reed artistry feel fresh, and Echo’s tagging reframes belonging in a memorable image. The “you found yourself” turn is familiar, muting ingenuity at the peak. Still, the synthesis of street art, communal weaving, and object-doubling (arbor/sculpture) is thoughtful. Risks are aesthetic more than structural, and they mostly pay off.</comment>
