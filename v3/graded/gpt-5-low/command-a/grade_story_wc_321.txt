<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation drives every choice, and a few tactile cues (cold hourglass, erratic watch) anchor her resolve. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers, even when warned—so pressure reveals little new about her. The transient’s warning could have forced a micro‑hesitation; instead it glances off. The earned cost (“forever changed”) lands but remains abstract emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. Setups (hourglass, patterns, rift) pay off cleanly; stepping into the rift and using the hourglass to rewind produces a decisive change with on‑page cost (physical weakening, altered self). Orientation is strong and the single transition is legible. The resolution edges toward convenience but stays earned by prior patterning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto, shifting symbols, and rift are vivid and purposeful; the environment provides the method (reading patterns) and the entry point. The hourglass functions as a charged object that reconfigures the final image (now filled with glowing sand). Sensory detail leans visual but integrates with action. World rules feel consistent within the piece’s logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (restore the ferry/passengers) and intensifies as she chooses to enter the rift and then to reset time at personal cost. The transient’s warning offers a brief crucible; the tighter escalation comes from the physical/mental strain in the rift. The price is present but could be sharper or more consequential on the page. Still, the narrowing of options reads coherent and agent‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Resilience versus transience accrues through objects and images—the empty hourglass filling at the end reframes time and endurance without moralizing. The piece resists sermonizing and lets the final image carry weight. Some lines flirt with thesis‑sounding declarations (“Then I’ll find a way to outlast them”) but the imagery does most of the work. The aftertaste is resonant if not surprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident; diction suits the lyrical, speculative frame. Dialogue is sparse but functional and stakes‑aware. Rhythmic control is good, with occasional elevated phrasing that remains coherent to the voice. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear and paced, with purposeful imagery and minimal scaffolding. A few purple flourishes (“air shimmered with an otherworldly glow,” “kaleidoscope of colors”) and light redundancy appear but don’t impede momentum or clarity. Information density is solid; most lines do more than one job. The final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>While time rifts and relic hourglasses are familiar, the ferry‑commuter frame and the spectral grotto give the trope a fresh contour. The empty‑to‑filled hourglass is a strong, specific reweighting. Risks are measured rather than bold; the piece favors elegance over radical invention. Overall, a thoughtful synthesis rather than a revelation.</comment>
