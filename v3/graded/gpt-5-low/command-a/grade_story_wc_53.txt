<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to negotiate with her own ghost) is clear and her collecting habit yields concrete micro‑choices. Embodied beats—mud, the wheel to her ear—ground her interiority. The internal conflict (regret vs. persistence) is credible, though labels like “eroded ambitions” occasionally abstract the feeling. The final shift to seeing the ghost as guide is earned but a touch epiphanic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, objects and whispers accrete until the recorded voice reframes her aim—closure via conceptual repricing lands. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when). The wheel’s progression from hum to message to counsel provides a coherent arc. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, but present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above the clouds is vivid and used purposefully; the mud, currents, and moon modulate mood and action. The camera wheel functions as a micro‑setting/tool shaping choices and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and consistent with Mara’s scavenger focus. World rules feel stable within the piece’s lyric logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through the wheel’s escalating guidance and the voice’s clarity; the dominant stake is internal and steady. One meaningful tightening occurs when the voice reframes the “ghost” as guide. Still, escalation remains gentle and largely tonal, with limited visible cost or narrowed options. The result is satisfying but low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of regret, self‑reconstruction, and reframing one’s failures emerge organically from object work and setting. The final realization reweights prior fragments without mechanical explanation. Some lines verge on thesis (“They weren’t failures but fragments”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is real, if a bit declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Close third is steady and confident; lyric diction suits the image system and stays within a plausible perceptual range. Recorded “dialogue” is sparse but effective, introducing subtext and propulsion. Rhythm varies well without template cadence. Minor abstraction patches don’t break voice control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑forward, and mostly economical; sentences carry multiple jobs. Occasional conceptual repetition and on‑the‑nose phrasing slightly dull momentum in the final third. Figurative language is coherent and not overstacked. No meaningful scaffolding or clarity slips.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and camera‑wheel compass offer a fresh fusion; the self‑ghost negotiation avoids cliché through specific objects and textures. The arc’s turn is quiet but earned. While the self‑reclamation theme is familiar, the worldbuilding inflects it with originality. Risk level is moderate and coherent.</comment>
