<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied—he plants to let a garden reclaim a battlefield—but conflicting impulses are faint, so pressure never forces a hard trade. Interiority is lyrical and character‑specific (dead languages, bird‑guided work), yet the coachman faces little resistance. Micro‑choices (where to plant, when to stop, to leave) reveal values but don’t cost him much. The earned endurance is gentle rather than transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterned acts (planting, listening, speaking) accrete toward a Charged Poise ending as he departs, hope planted. Orientation is immediate (coachman on the jetty after the reef’s death). Closure lands conceptually but with light cost; the final carriage departure is a cadence shift more than a decisive turn. The scene holds coherence with one continuous window and a clean exit image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The jetty, salt‑rot, and wildflowers create a vivid, coherent world filtered through his task and age. Sensory selection is purposeful (salt, decay, wood, birdsong) and evolves as twilight deepens, charging the final image. The seed pods and jetty act as micro‑setting tools he uses, not mere backdrop. Strong atmosphere supports theme without over‑explaining the rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore life to a scarred place) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens; no real reversal or narrowed option tests commitment. The birds’ guidance is a gentle deepening, not an escalation. The ending is earned in tone, yet on‑page cost or a foreclosed path remains minimal. Stakes remain largely conceptual rather than felt under stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Recurring images (seed pods, birds, twilight) align with themes of renewal and concord, culminating in a hopeful leave‑taking. However, the final paragraph drifts into overt moralizing (“fertilizing the soul of a wounded land”), blunting subtext. The piece invites reflection but states wisdom rather than letting images carry it. Resonance is present but partially told.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person voice with a distinct perceptual signature (dead languages, bird‑maps). Rhythm and diction suit the elegiac mood; no head‑hopping. Occasional abstraction edges toward sermon but doesn’t break stance. Modulation from work to departure is smooth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean with varied syntax and purposeful imagery; momentum holds through the scene. Some redundancy and purple drift (“narrow vastness,” reiterated hope) slightly dulls intensity. Still, information density is decent and action remains clear. Final image is legible and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑reef elegy, a coachman speaking dead tongues, bird‑guided planting on a blooming jetty—is fresh and memorable. The concept commits without gimmickry and avoids generic templates. Lack of harder pressure limits the sense of ingenuity at the turn. Nonetheless, the imaginative worldbuilding and tactic (bird calls) feel singular.</comment>
