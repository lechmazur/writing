<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to understand and outmaneuver the signal) is clear and drives concrete choices (calibrating a counter-frequency rather than blocking). Interiority is specific enough to feel character‑particular, though internal contradiction is minimal and some traits are told rather than dramatized. The Hank exchange provides modest status pressure without deepening her flaw set. The closing endurance choice (vigilance with cost) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the beats link cleanly: mysterious signal → decision to counter subtly → successful disruption → external consequences and renewed stance. Orientation is crisp early; tools and constraints are established before use. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she regains local control while accepting ongoing conflict and social cost. The cost is on the page (sponsor loss, protests), though the climax’s danger feels relatively risk‑light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The university radio station is tactile and functional—outdated gear, subwoofer, sponsor pressure—supplying both resources and stakes. Details are filtered through Elara’s professional lens (charts, spectrograph, subsonics). The closing “ethereal glow” and charts reprise charge the final image. Slightly broader environmental pressure could have further constrained tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore control without provoking the senders) is established and tightened by Elara’s strategic choice to use a counter-frequency. Her act produces a turn (signal unravels), followed by a price (community fracture, sponsor risk) that complicates victory. Pressure remains coherent, though the protests don’t force a second on‑page adaptation. Costs are real but not punishingly acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of power, deception, and human grit emerge through her tactical restraint and the campus schism. Some lines state theme a bit baldly (“The universe was a game of power plays”), dampening subtext. The final vigilant stance offers a resonant, non‑moralizing answer scaled to the scene. More implication through image over statement could elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lightly lyrical, technical inflection suits Elara’s expertise; dialogue is functional and natural. Voice maintains control under pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. Occasional generic turns of phrase flatten distinctiveness. Rhythm modulates adequately across beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful prose with decent information density; technical terms are handled plainly. A few familiar constructions (“the room seemed to hold its breath”) and thematic tell lines reduce freshness. No major loops or scaffolding; momentum holds through the action. The final image is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blend of campus radio ephemera with cosmic “trickster” subsonics is a fresh angle, and the counter‑frequency tactic feels specific. The community schism adds texture without overreach. While not wildly radical, the synthesis is coherent and memorable. Greater risk in character contradiction or a sharper ethical pinch could push it higher.</comment>
