<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent, but Eleanor’s agency is limited to initiating the gramophone and accepting the revelation. Interiority is present yet tidy, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The emotional cost is named more than felt. The final stance shift (keeper of truth rather than savior) is earned but light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Structure is coherent with a clean two‑shard movement from room to vision and back; orientation is never in doubt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she accepts a reframed role with a painful truth. However, key turns arrive conveniently via the shadowed figure and journal, reducing causal pressure. The accumulative lens holds, but the cost is modest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: “sepia reading room,” gramophone, and golden shadows thread through action. The gramophone as micro‑setting/tool meaningfully enables the turn and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and consistent, if occasionally leaning toward familiar lyricism. Environment influences access rather than constraining choice deeply.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled (uncover the dynasty’s downfall), but the escalation is largely experiential rather than contested. The revelation is handed to her, minimizing trade‑offs or foreclosed paths on the page. There’s one tightening (music → bridge → journal), but minimal visible price beyond the stated pain of knowledge. Agency doesn’t drive a difficult choice at the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motifs of sound, standing waves, and bridges coherently support themes of legacy and truth. The ending expresses the thesis somewhat explicitly (“not to revive the past but to honor it”), constraining subtext. Resonance is present but safer than prickly, with limited ambiguity or moral friction. The image lingers, but the piece edges toward statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical, and appropriate to the material; distance control is clean. Diction is consistent with the aesthetic, with only mild cliché incursions. The brief dialogue (shadowed figure) fits tone but offers little subtextual pressure. Rhythm varies adequately without calling attention to itself.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are generally clear and economical, with a few purple turns (“scent of aged paper and forgotten dreams,” “voice carrying the weight of centuries”). Minor repetition (“eloquently silent,” “golden shadows”) nudges toward redundancy but doesn’t stall momentum. Syntax varies and read‑aloud rhythm holds. Information density is decent, if occasionally padded by ornamental phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sound/standing‑waves conduit to truth via gramophone is a fresh inflection. The shadowed figure handing over a journal is a familiar device that blunts novelty. The synthesis is coherent yet cautious, favoring elegance over risk. Emotional specificity could be sharper to elevate distinctiveness.</comment>
