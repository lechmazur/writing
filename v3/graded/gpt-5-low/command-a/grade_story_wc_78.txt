<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leeward’s desire to resolve “restlessness” via music is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (moving to the center, choosing notes, intensifying intent) align with that motive. However, internal contradiction is light—he rarely struggles or risks error—so the emotional cost of the shift reads modest. Embodied texture (bare, calloused feet; warm mallet) helps but doesn’t expose a conflicted hierarchy of values. The final peace feels earned but low‑stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through density and pattern—notes provoke cloud responses, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the scene holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is faint, more a release of tension than a trade‑off, which softens impact. Still, the cadence shift from blue hour to twilight provides a credible finish.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating orchard, driftwood circle, and blue‑hour sea are vivid and integrated into action (walking the driftwood, the orchard “joining” the music). The xylophone and mallet function as micro‑setting objects that charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond stage and mood, its specificity and consistency elevate atmosphere. World rules are coherently learned via observation and response.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming dissonance into harmony; escalation arrives as the clouds’ responsive complexity and the deliberate intensification of notes. However, no option is plausibly foreclosed; failure or cost is never materially at risk. The tightening is real (music as map, culminating pattern) but remains soft-pressure rather than a true trade‑off. Resolution is earned but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of transmuting obstacle to instrument and seeking harmony from chaos emerge through image and act. Yet some lines state thesis directly (“His motivation was clear…”) rather than letting subtext do the work, muting mystery. The final image reweights earlier material but avoids ambiguity or counter‑pressure that might deepen resonance. Still, the fractal/map insight offers a concrete thematic frame.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third‑person close is steady and confident, with a lyrical cadence that suits the fable‑like frame. Diction coheres to Leeward’s perceptual bias (listening, patterns, resonance) and modulates with the climax. No head‑hopping or stance leakage, and uncertainty is purposeful. Minor tell‑phrases appear but do not disrupt the voice’s integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean and well‑paced, with strong sensory specificity and a consistent sonic palette. Occasional redundancies and thesis‑style sentences (e.g., “His motivation was clear…”) slightly dull momentum. Figurative language is controlled and not muddled, though it edges toward overt explanation in places. Rhythm accelerates effectively toward the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The premise—tide prophet orchestrating fractal clouds with a driftwood‑and‑shell xylophone—feels genuinely fresh, with “sketched resonance” as a novel conceptual anchor. The synthesis of maritime myth, music, and fractal cartography lands as distinctive rather than gimmicky. While conflict is modest, the imaginative integration is memorable. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off coherently.</comment>
