<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara’s motive is clear and consistent—decoding the ghost’s message—and her actions (studying the program, moving deeper, humming) align. The interiority is sensorial and specific to a musician’s fixation on pauses and “in between” spaces. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or true internal friction; she rarely wavers, so the final serenity carries limited cost. The dissolution of the program reads as a price, but not a contested choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-scene, single-POV structure is clean, with clear orientation and a held accumulative/textural drive. Pressure coheres as density: sighting the ghost, humming the melody, and the environment’s response culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page—ghost’s vanishing and the program’s dissolution with Clara’s peace—offering a before/after. The cost is present but mostly conceptual/emotional, not materially constraining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and lanterns are vivid and tactile, integrated into action (sloshing water, ripples syncing with melody, light brightening at the climax). The environment isn’t mere backdrop; water damage produces the score and the lanterns’ behavior tracks escalation. Sensory selection feels musician-specific and purposeful. It stops short of physically constraining a hard choice, but it does charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking the silence by decoding the ghost’s work—is clear and escalates through a decisive intensification when Clara hums and the setting responds. Under the accumulative lens, the density rise functions as tightening, but options never truly narrow or force a trade-off beyond acceptance. The price paid (losing the program, the ghost’s departure) reads, yet it’s gentle. Still, the cadence shift is earned and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of liminality, art as conduit, and the ethics of listening rather than imposing are woven through images rather than stated. The “in between spaces” motif transforms at the end into communal resonance and closure, avoiding moralizing. Slight sentimentality creeps in with the “healing” opera house line, but the final image holds. The ghost’s composition as a gift reframes silence, achieving a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable and credibly close, with a consistent, lyrical diction that suits a musician’s sensibility. The narrative maintains modesty of knowledge and uses sensory focus as voice. A few reiterated phrases (e.g., “in between spaces”) flirt with echo, but rhythm and stance remain controlled. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and evocative with purposeful imagery; most lines carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, and motive). Minor redundancy and occasional purple edges appear but don’t stall momentum. Syntax varies and pacing tightens toward the humming and environmental response. The final line resolves by image without exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ghost-in-the-opera tropes are refreshed by the specific conceit of water damage composing a score and a tactile “wordless conversation.” The accumulative design and environmental collaboration feel organic. It’s not radical, but the synthesis is distinct and coherent. The ending’s reweighting is earned rather than tricked.</comment>
