<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—restoring faith through reconnecting with ancestral legacy—is clear and consistent, and her cautious curiosity informs choices (listening to the land, not rushing). Interiority is textured and embodied, though internal contradiction is mild (curiosity vs restraint) and never forces a sharp trade‑off. The final shift to belonging/purpose is earned but low‑cost. Absence of an on‑page human counterforce limits crucible pressure on character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean from the outset; structure proceeds from discovery to entry to revelation. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/soft causal turn: placing the sundial base opens the tomb, and the mural reweights her quest into belonging. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; pressure is gentle but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. No glaring teleports or broken setups; the causal click (base fits slab) pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” is vivid and specific; roots, bones, ivy, and the sundial are integrated into action and meaning. The environment subtly constrains tactics (purposeful wandering guided by roots; entrance under moss/ivy) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, with the setting deepening tone and theme. A rare blend of atmosphere and function without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find tomb/restore faith) is signaled early, and escalation arrives when the hollow is found and the slab yields. However, opposition is minimal; no option is truly foreclosed, and the price paid is primarily patience and vulnerability. The tightening is real but gentle, consistent with the accumulative design. A touch more friction or a specific loss would heighten consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cycles of time, diaspora return, and restoration are woven through the sundial and mural with a satisfying reprise. Some lines verge on telling the theme (“a map of faith,” “a beacon guiding her”) rather than letting the images fully carry it, which blunts subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs without a didactic moral. The emergent coherence is strong, if safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is steady, lyrical without drifting into abstract haze, and maintains consistent distance. Diction suits the character’s temperament and the piece’s mythic hush. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; rhythmic control supports the quiet escalation. A few familiar constructions appear, but cadence remains under control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, fluent lines with good image economy; sentences often do multiple jobs (world, mood, motive). Minor repetition (“not just... but...”) and a few explicit abstractions slightly reduce density, yet momentum holds. Figurative choices are coherent and largely grounded in the setting’s logic. No artifact loops or template cadences that dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and sundial‑as‑key give a fresh texture to a return‑and‑reclamation arc. The synthesis feels organic, though the arc lands on a familiar grace note of found belonging. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; they pay off in atmosphere and object integration. Distinctive enough for strong engagement, if not wholly surprising.</comment>
