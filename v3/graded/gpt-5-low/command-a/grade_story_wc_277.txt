<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—Eleanor’s compulsion to uncover truth propels every beat. Interiority skews summary and tidy (“her motivation… felt like a burden”), with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The tea scene hints at status play, but it’s summarized rather than dramatized. The closing resolve reads earned but low-cost, with little on‑page struggle to expose her flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The call prompts investigation → discovery → meeting → night return → defiant recalibration and resolve; orientation is clean. Closure lands as Charged Poise via the symbolic act and decision to publish, but the cost is mostly implied (vanished journalist) and not felt on the page. Heavy summarization compresses turns that would otherwise tighten pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory above the clouds and the glass dome are vivid and purposeful; misaligned telescopes become a plot fulcrum. Details are filtered through Eleanor’s priorities, though sensory range leans visual. The environment modestly constrains choices (access, recalibration) but rarely presses tactically. The final image integrates space and object well.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose state surveillance) is clear, but escalation occurs mostly via told discoveries. The meeting with the director should be a pressure spike; instead it’s recounted, diffusing cost. The night return and small defiance are good beats, yet the visible price remains low. Internal tension (drive vs. fear) is stated rather than tested by a consequential trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Truth vs. misuse and redemption through recommitment are coherent, with the telescopes’ reorientation offering a neat thematic image. “Orbits of regret” is evocative but functions as motif more than an engine of choice. Some lines verge on moral summary (“a testament to her journey”), softening subtext. The ending resonates quietly but avoids hard ambiguity or conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and diction consistent, leaning elevated but within character plausibility. The voice has a classic, slightly formal cadence that fits the setting. Dialogue is minimal and largely expository; subtext in the director exchange is summarized, not dramatized. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with a measured rhythm and purposeful imagery. Occasional purple or abstract phrasing (“orbits of regret,” “solemn playfulness”) repeats without adding pressure. Summarizing key beats reduces line‑level propulsion. Still, syntax varies and clarity holds through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The surveillance‑turned‑telescope conceit and heiress‑investigator pairing feel fresh enough, and the pen nib heirloom adds a nice human texture. Execution stays safe: discoveries arrive cleanly, risks are implied, and structural choices don’t push form or cost. The closing symbolic reorientation is tidy rather than startling. Solid but not transformative.</comment>
