<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—testing whether she can “mirror the sky inside walls”—is clear and aligned with her craft and perceptual signature. Interiority is textured (unsettling yet comforting stillness; obsession-driven focus), though internal contradiction doesn’t significantly complicate choices. The face-blindness is thematically resonant but under-leveraged in action. She earns a subtle shift at the end, but the cost to her is mostly implied rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens (causal spine with textural accumulation) holds: coin → safe → book → decoding → collapse → reconfigured stillness. Orientation is clear early; scene stays within a single window. Closure arrives via a resonant reconfiguration when the stillness is reinterpreted after she completes the task and escapes the shuddering building. The cost is light on the page; external collapse cues urgency but doesn’t extract a tangible price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integral: the hollowed oak, carved shelves, and condemned structure shape access and payoff (the compartment, the final collapse). Object-as-setting (coin, book, constellations) interacts coherently with the environment. The atmosphere’s hush threads the scene and charges the final image. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete the sky-book under demolition pressure) is clear, with one meaningful tightening at the discovery and opening of the safe. However, escalation is muted—“Hours passed, or perhaps minutes” blunts the live clock, and there’s no reversal beyond the late shudder. Consequences are minimal; success arrives without a trade-off besides ambient risk. Tension works but never bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of containing the infinite, beauty in endings, and limit-testing emerge naturally from objects and acts. The final re-seeing of stillness reframes the premise without didacticism, though the last line edges toward overt statement. Subtext mostly lives in tactile image-work (coin indentations as stellar code), not speech. Resonance lingers but could deepen with a clearer price.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A coherent, lyrical close third holds steady with a distinct perceptual signature (attention to micro-textures, shifting patterns). Diction suits the character’s sensibility and modulates with pressure at the end. No head-hopping or stance slippage; compression reads intentional. Occasional elevated phrasing risks purple but remains controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum and layered information; sensory choices feel purposeful and filtered through craft-minded attention. Minor echoing (“fractally precise,” iterations of stillness/beauty) skirts repetition without becoming a loop. Figurative language is mostly clean and consistent, with no mixed metaphors. The closing cadence lands without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—face-blind portraitist decoding a sky-book via coin indentations inside a tree-library at demolition’s brink—feels fresh and cohesive. The puzzle mechanism and object ecology are inventive without gimmickry. The arc’s safety (low price, smooth solve) slightly reduces the sense of daring. Still, the specific blend reads memorable.</comment>
