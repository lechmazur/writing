<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s drive to prove her theory is clear and governs her choices; the lever pulls and the final recalibration align with that motive. The internal contradiction—ambition versus responsibility—surfaces credibly at crisis and softens at the end. Some phrasing (“icy warmth”) reads label‑ish rather than embodied, trimming depth. Still, micro‑choices under pressure and the mentor memory anchor a believable shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: calibrate → pull → overload → manual struggle → precise correction → stabilization, with a clean before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: proof achieved at real risk, followed by a tempered stance. The cost remains mostly near‑miss rather than lasting consequence, limiting impact. Orientation is crisp from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The station, nexus, and bioluminescent fauna are vivid and integrated; holograms failing force manual action, making environment consequential. Sensory detail supports mood without overgrowth, and the final image of creatures settling recharges tone. Xenobiology specifics are light, but the tool‑environment nexus constrains choice. Strong economy and purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via her first lever pull causing systemic failure. The reversal is earned by a second, precise adjustment that tests her commitment. The price is felt in the station’s near‑collapse, though little persists as concrete loss, keeping the tension from peaking higher. Agency drives every major turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ambition versus responsibility and “balance” (mechanical warmth) braid the thematic spine, culminating in a tempered acceptance of cost. The mentor’s line productively reframes the tech into an ethic. Some explicit statements (“could change everything”) edge toward telling rather than letting images carry the load. The closing cadence invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady and credible, with professional attentiveness shaping perception. Diction is clean if somewhat conventional; no head‑hopping or register slips. Lacks an especially distinctive rhythmic signature, but modulation under pressure is controlled. Absence of dialogue is fine given the design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive, with minimal scaffolding and good sentence variety. Occasional cliché or redundancy (“hummed softly,” “hands flying,” “icy warmth”) and some tell phrases dampen freshness. Figurative density stays moderate and legible during peak beats. Mechanics are clean and sequencing is precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The lab‑test‑gone‑awry frame is familiar, but “time moves sideways” and the living‑world backdrop add flavor. The lever/hologram interplay and “balance” ethic are coherent rather than novel. The execution is solid more than startling. Emotional truth lands; conceptual risk is moderate.</comment>
