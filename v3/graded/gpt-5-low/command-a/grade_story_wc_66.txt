<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clara’s motive (“teach dust to tell stories”) is coherent and active, and her micro-choices—tuning the radio, transcribing, committing at dawn—align with it. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific (copyist precision, sanctuary habits), though internal contradiction is light. The final stance (resolve to use the lyrics) is earned but the felt cost is modest. Still, the character reads particular rather than generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern intensifies from static to song to glow to resolve, culminating in a charged poise at dawn. Orientation is clear early and the single scene holds. Closure lands as a threshold reconfiguration, though the on‑page cost remains conceptual rather than biting. Causality is clean with no unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The attic “ember alcove in mist,” parchment, damp wood, and the radio’s luminescence create a vivid, integrated atmosphere filtered through Clara’s sensibility. The radio-as-object functions like micro‑setting, evolving to charge the final image. Environmental detail supports tone and action without cataloguing. While constraint is soft, the space palpably frames her choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (recovering lost stories) is legible and the broadcast deepens pressure with a cadence shift when the glow spreads and the song slows. Escalation is coherent but quiet; risk and price are implied rather than dramatized. The abrupt end to the song acts as a tightening beat. Consequences beyond resolve are deferred.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around restoration, attention, and thresholds; the radio’s illicit song reframes loss into possibility. The final image (“threshold… reborn”) provides resonance without a moral, though lines like “teach the dust to tell stories” edge toward stated thesis. Subtext hums in the clandestine aura and glow-as-contagion of story. The piece invites reflection more than it argues.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third‑person close POV is steady, with a distinct lyrical texture and selective noticing befitting a copyist. Diction is elevated but consistent and controlled; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates well as tension builds then releases at dawn. Elision feels purposeful, not coy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs, and the imagery is largely precise (“hummed softly,” “mist clung to the windows like a veil”). A few ornate coinages (“thistled calm,” “ember alcove in mist”) flirt with purple but stay legible and patterned. No scaffold loops or clarity breaks, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Minor overwriting keeps it from the highest tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The “story famine” plus a copyist catching a pirate broadcast through a living radio is a fresh synthesis. The mystical‑technical blend and the archival vocation feel specific rather than templated. The turn from transcription to threshold is earned, if gentle. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural, but it pays off.</comment>
