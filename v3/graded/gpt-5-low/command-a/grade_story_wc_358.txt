<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation and competence are clear, with tactile attention to objects (the patch) revealing her values under pressure. However, internal contradiction is limited; she rarely faces a micro‑choice that costs her something beyond resolve. Emotional texture skews declarative (“Her foresight had been right”) rather than embodied conflict. The endurance/mission stance at the end reads earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: survey → anomaly → aircraft reveal → heading clue → synthesis and repricing of the disaster’s meaning. Orientation is strong from the opening and remains consistent within a single scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with the patch and the town’s silence charging the cost. The deductions are explained rather than dramatized in parts, slightly softening the on‑page pressure at the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine containers, salt‑metal air, and moonlit industrial hush are vivid and purposeful. Environment shapes causality (wind funnel) and shepherds the investigation through a tactile maze. Details stay within Elara’s professional filter, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting more strongly constrains the past accident than her present choices, which keeps it just shy of 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around uncovering cause; an authentic tightening occurs at the aircraft discovery and the dial pointing into the storm. Stakes remain conceptual—responsibility and foresight—rather than forcing a present‑tense trade‑off. Agency is mostly investigative attention and endurance. The felt cost lands, but escalation lacks a live obstacle or dangerous choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars—containers as amplifiers, the patch as human cost, silence as consequence. The final repricing (“fragility of human systems” and the mission of foresight) resonates, if a bit stated. Some lines edge into moralizing summary, slightly reducing subtext. Still, the last image reweights prior material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a steady, restrained lyricism that fits the investigator’s mind. Diction and rhythm are consistent and confident; inference reads as inference, not omniscience. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Occasional explanatory phrasing trims the edge off the voice’s distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑driven, and economical, with strong sensory anchors (“streaks of oil and shattered glass”). Minimal scaffold and good sentence variety maintain momentum. A few thematic sentences tell what the images already imply, slightly dulling the peak beats. Figurative control remains coherent without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The port‑labyrinth funneling a storm into catastrophe, paired with an aircraft lodged among containers, feels fresh. The investigator frame is familiar but executed with specificity and tactile logic. The “foresight vs. hindsight” angle is conceptually sound if not surprising. No bold structural risks, but the synthesis is cohesive and memorable.</comment>
