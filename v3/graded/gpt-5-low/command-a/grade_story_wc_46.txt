<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (share light without fire) with tactile interiority and a distinct craft ethos. Contradictory impulses are muted; serenity dominates and pressure rarely distorts thought or behavior. The mother’s maxim deepens character but the conflict remains low‑heat. The closing readiness reads earned yet lightly priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV, coherent window, and a clean accumulative/textural build to a quiet RR (readiness to share the light). Orientation is crisp; the sea glass polishing advances toward the moon‑amplified glow and departure. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (trauma and vow), subtly rendered. The lens holds, though the on‑page price is modest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto, mist, luminescent moss, and salt‑earth air are vivid and POV‑filtered. The environment contributes to the cadence shift (mist parting, moon sliver) and charges the final image. It rarely constrains choice beyond mood and light access, keeping it below the top tier. Object‑as‑setting (sea glass) is well woven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear but pressure escalates gently; the tightening arrives via thickening mist → moonlight reveal rather than hard trade‑offs. Agency centers on endurance and craft, with no option truly foreclosed. The final decision to return to the village registers, though with limited felt cost. Tension remains lyric rather than coercive.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Light vs. fire, healing the broken, and finding light “in the cracks” cohere through object and action. The final image reweights prior motifs without stating a moral, though the mother’s line edges toward explicit theme. Resonance is honest and quiet, not cloying. Ambiguity is modest but present.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical cadence that suits the meditative mode. Diction and rhythm feel purposeful without head‑hopping or register drift. Occasional lushness risks purple but remains legible. The voice modulates slightly with intensifying glow to support the close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry good flow and image density; sensory layering is effective. Some descriptive redundancy and stacked modifiers soften propulsion in the middle. No major figurative muddle, though several phrases echo similar effects (glow, mist, stillness). The final line lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sea glass as starborne conduit and a vow against fire give a fresh angle to a contemplative craft tale. The grotto/mist/moon interplay is specific and memorable, if not radical. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, with limited narrative invention. Still, the synthesis feels genuine.</comment>
