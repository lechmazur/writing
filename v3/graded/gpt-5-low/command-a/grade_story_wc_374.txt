<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s paradox—skepticism versus luminous attunement—reads cleanly on the page and motivates the micro‑choices (following the taste shifts, approaching the figure). Interiority is grounded in sensory detail (metallic vs. sweet) rather than labels. The final acceptance is credible but carries little visible cost beyond “turmoil.” Lack of friction or mistake under pressure limits depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with a quiet, lyric surface—she follows the ring; therefore she reaches the convergence; therefore she’s told she’s chosen; therefore she accepts and proceeds. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (commitment to attend the election) with a Charged Poise image. Cost is muted and mostly conceptual, keeping the ceiling below the highest band. Orientation is clear and the single‑scene window is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The lavender bluff and aurora are vivid and sensorially varied (scent, taste, temperature, visual convergence), and the ring functions as a tool‑as‑setting that shapes movement. The vortex and “where the forests converge” charge the final image. Occasional decorative phrasing (“terrestrially cosmic spectacle”) brushes purple but remains legible. Strong integration without quite constraining a decisive trade‑off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled (identity, selection, weather‑bearing) and the midpoint tightening arrives with the shadowed figure’s revelation. However, pressure is low: obstacles do not materially resist her, and the election clock is not felt as a live constraint. The acceptance is earned but largely uncontested, with minimal price on the page. Escalation reads as an information deepening more than a squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of balance, attunement, and belonging emerge through the ring and the election frame, with the final “futuristic nostalgia” line offering a soft repricing. Expository dialogue (“to become terrestrially cosmic”) states meaning where subtext could work, reducing resonance. Still, the weather‑within motif links inner life to environment convincingly. The ending invites reflection without landing a strong paradox or cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and close, with a consistent lyrical register shaped by Elara’s perceptions. Dialogue advances plot but leans expository, flattening subtext in the central exchange. Diction is mostly controlled and voice‑coherent; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythmic modulation suits the scene’s hush and then the quiet turn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, image‑rich, and largely purposeful; sensory specificity does work across modalities. There’s occasional purple density and repetition (“terrestrially cosmic,” multiple glow/aurora echoes) that could be tightened. Exposition clumps in the dialogue rather than diffusing via action. No mechanical errors; momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The emergent compass via taste, sentient forest elections, and weather‑carriers are fresh inflections on a familiar “chosen” frame. The central reveal is conventional and risk‑averse in its delivery, limiting ingenuity at the turn. Integration of object, setting, and motive shows conceptual coherence. A bolder cost or counter‑move would elevate distinctiveness.</comment>
