<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s pacifism versus pragmatic survival is credible, with a clear value hierarchy shown when she accepts the blade but vows restraint. The interiority leans abstract (“weave continuity through chaos”) rather than sharply embodied in key beats, softening impact. The relationship with Kael introduces status and moral pressure without melodrama. A cost is implied—she carries a weapon she dislikes—but the struggle resolves a bit too easily.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean, the beats cohere, and the piece holds a Situational drive: warning arrives, choice is made, haven is fortified, and the final stance is crystallized. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Elara stands with the sheathed blade and keeps the farm. The cost is present but mild, with threats mostly off‑page and no concrete test on the scene. Still, the because/therefore progression remains legible and tight for the length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass‑domed desert rose farm is vividly rendered and anchored early, with scent and color sharpening contrast to the wasteland. The environment functions as resource and constraint (a sanctuary to fortify, a dome to defend), and the ballast scrap “quiet” object charges the atmosphere. Detail is selective and POV‑filtered through a caretaker’s lens. It stops short of materially altering a late choice but it meaningfully charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—preserve the sanctuary against encroaching chaos—and pressure coheres when Kael’s warning forces Elara’s weapon choice. The main tightening is the acceptance of the blade and the commitment to stay, but on‑page cost remains mostly conceptual. Fortification arrives as montage rather than friction that forecloses options. Tension holds but never truly bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of pacifism under threat, continuity, and resilience recur via roses, the dome, and “quiet,” culminating in a poised, hopeful ending. Subtext exists in the sheathed blade and the engraved scrap, but several lines lean into stated thesis. The last paragraph edges toward moralizing by summarizing purpose. Still, the central question receives a coherent, image‑driven answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable with a controlled, gently elevated diction that suits the contemplative tone. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and mostly natural, with Kael’s lines advancing pressure rather than explaining lore. Narrative certainty matches Elara’s knowledge. Occasional abstractions flatten texture but don’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prose is clean and rhythmic with concrete sensory anchors and minimal grammatical noise. Some phrases feel generic or purple (“weave continuity through chaos,” “tranquil blaze”), and a few summary sentences slightly dilute momentum. No major loops or template cadence runs. Information density is adequate, if not brisk.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The oasis‑under‑dome and engraved ballast scrap lend a distinctive touch to a familiar post‑collapse/pacifist‑with‑a‑weapon frame. The final sheathed‑blade image is apt if not wholly surprising. Risks are modest but coherent; the piece avoids gimmickry. Emotional truth is present, though the moral calculus stays safe.</comment>
