<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s want is clear and consistently pursued, with embodied beats (trembling hands, breath work) tying motive to action. Internal contradiction is limited; she doubts little and faces minimal resistance, which softens the arc’s felt cost. Still, the micro‑choices—kneeling, trusting the glow, placing the pendant—are coherent and character‑specific. The final acceptance reads earned but tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: breath → spark → compartment → pendant → alcove → emplacement → release. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the closure lands on‑page with a resonant reconfiguration (grief/love reweighted). The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional and could be sharper, but the before/after is legible. No causality breaks or unkept set‑ups undercut the cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Twilight Viaduct in Bloom is vividly rendered and functionally used: blossoms veil the spark, the base hides the compartment, the alcove and Kwan Yin’s palm constrain the final move. Sensory detail is purposeful (wisteria fragrance yielding to damp stone) and tracks POV urgency. The recurring object and carved space charge the final image. It stops short of a truly constricting physical dilemma, but the environment meaningfully guides choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure deepens once via discovery and culminates in the emblematic act of emplacement, but the path faces little friction or trade‑off. The dominant stake (unused love) is tested through memory and ritual more than contested. The escalation reads as density/pattern intensification appropriate to the lens, though the felt price remains soft. Agency is present yet never costly beyond admission of past failure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Compassion, withheld love, and self‑healing emerge through concrete emblems (the tear, the statue, the alcove). However, the prose articulates the thesis directly (“the unused love was stored within her”), edging toward moralizing and reducing lingering ambiguity. The final image still resonates via the reweighted motif of sparks and pendant. Subtext operates, but the explicit summation blunts its echo.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is steady, image‑driven, and modulates from fog to clarity in step with the epiphany. Diction and cadence feel controlled without head‑hopping or register slips. Minor purple tendencies don’t occlude scene logic. The perceptual signature (camera artist noticing light, texture) is coherent and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum and imagery with general concision; action order is clear and punctuation clean. There is mild adornment (recurrent trembling, stacked modifiers) that trends toward over‑lush in places. Redundancy is limited and does not dull the closure image. Overall, the line carries multiple jobs with few loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The pilgrimage‑through‑light premise and wisteria‑draped viaduct give familiar mystical redemption a fresh texture. The camera obscura angle is evocative but under‑exploited tactically. The pendant/alcove mechanism is clean and inevitable once introduced, if not surprising. The synthesis feels particular and sincere without breaking new ground conceptually.</comment>
