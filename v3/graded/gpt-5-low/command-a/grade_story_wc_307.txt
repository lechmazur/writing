<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s contradiction—fear of chaos vs. duty to reveal—drives clear, on‑page choices culminating in her confession. Interiority is specific (stones, ripples, carved symbols) and aligned to motive, though a few lines lapse into abstraction. Her endurance of years of withholding credibly informs the choice. The cost is felt but remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene builds from first stone to second stone to spoken revelation, achieving a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single stake (reveal or continue to hide) sustains. Closure lands on the page with her speech, with a legible before/after. The cost is present but soft, as immediate consequences are deferred.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The floating obsidian platform and magnetic grotto are vividly rendered and functionally tied to choice—the grotto’s amplification and the ripples’ “method” channel the decision to reveal. Details are selective and purposeful (hum, starlight, etched stone). The environment charges the final image and constrains tactics (this place, this ritual). World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres as an internal conflict: whether to break her long practice of withholding. Escalation arrives via trance intensification and the second, symbol‑etched stone that precipitates speaking. The felt price is largely internal; we don’t see public blowback, which slightly mutes stakes. Still, one meaningful tightening is achieved at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Absence vs. presence and “teaching vanishing to appear” recur through image and action, culminating in the confession. Some language edges toward overt thematic statement (“The truth is not just in the words…”), but the ripple motif and final brightness reweight prior material. The epiphany is earned by the ritual and back‑and‑forth with her older self’s lesson. Ambiguity remains in the costs, inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm fit the meditative pressure, with clean mechanics and consistent stance. Minimal dialogue functions as action rather than explanation. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clear, image‑driven, and mostly economical; motifs (stone, ripples, hum, starlight) carry multiple loads. Occasional abstract statements skim purple, but momentum holds and sentences vary well. No scaffold loops or figurative muddle obscure the peak beats. Final line resolves with a charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Backwards aging fused with a magnetic grotto and ritualized ripples yields a fresh synthesis. The delayed revelation premise is integrated rather than gimmicked. The carved symbol stone and “teaching vanishing to appear” provide distinctive inflections. Risks are purposeful and coherent without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
