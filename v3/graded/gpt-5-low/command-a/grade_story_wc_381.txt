<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s goal and competence are clear, and her embodied focus (breath aligning to the brook, the wing humming) grounds her interiority. However, she faces little credible inner contradiction—determination predominates without a counter‑impulse beyond generic fear of failure. Micro‑choices exist (mapping silence, cocooning the prophecy), but no value tradeoff tests her. The final vigilance note adds cost but doesn’t arise from a conflicted internal calculus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp and the sequence coheres toward a decisive act: she seals the prophecy (on‑page DC). Cost is present but conceptual—fragile balance and ongoing vigilance—rather than dramatized loss. The throughline holds, though stakes feel declared large and paid off small.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The haven and brook are vividly rendered and functionally used (the flow as rhythm to map silence; the reflective brook in the final image). The crane’s wing as tool/object‑as‑setting is integrated and tactile. World rules are consistent and learned through action. The environment enables tactics rather than merely decorating them.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is early and coherent: hush the dangerous prophecy. Pressure escalates via resistance (“coded words thrashing”) and the wing’s rising hum to a final surge. The cost is soft—no foreclosed personal path or concrete sacrifice beyond fatigue and future vigilance—so the tightening lacks a felt price. Still, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Silence as both weapon and shield, responsibility over truth’s peril, and vigilance are organically embedded in images. The closing reprices quiet as burden and sanctuary without a moral. Some phrasing (“tranquil blaze”) edges toward declared theme, but most resonance comes from concrete events. The thematic aftertaste is steady, if not surprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with consistent distance and diction; sensory selection suits the meditative pressure. Rhythm modulates cleanly as the hum builds. No head‑hopping or stance slippage. A few elevated coinages risk purple, but voice remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and image‑rich with good momentum; most sentences do double duty. There’s mild ornamentation and phrase recycling (“tranquil,” “hush,” “silence”) but not to the point of opacity. No major loops or scaffold clutter; syntax varies. Figurative load stays legible at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “mapping silence” method, origami wing of cosmic/terrestrial provenance, and the hush‑as‑force offer a fresh synthesis. The arc is familiar (ritual containment) but personalized through tactile process and setting. The ending’s vigilant stasis is a modestly non‑obvious choice. More idiosyncratic cost or contradiction would push it higher.</comment>
