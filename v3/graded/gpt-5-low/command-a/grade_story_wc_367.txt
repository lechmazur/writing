<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The Herald’s motive (“to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows”) is clear and threads through their choices, and the panic-to-curiosity-to-exultation swing feels character‑specific. Interiority is mostly atmospheric rather than embodied; we get little concrete felt cost beyond “shadowed elation.” The accidental prophecy trait informs mindset but rarely pressures a tough internal trade‑off on the page. Still, the decisive choice to steer into the fog arises credibly from prior setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal dominance at the end: the beam slips control → Herald tests agency → gateway opens and beings emerge. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing (their routine was a bridge) plus a decisive act (steering), but the cost is soft—no sacrifice or loss beyond effort and risk. Orientation is clean from the opening. The ending reconfigures meaning, yet the price paid remains largely conceptual, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, lantern room, shimmering wick, and living fog are vividly rendered and tactically used—the height, glass, and beam mechanics shape what the Herald can do. The wick-as-tool functions as micro‑setting and charges the final image. Sensory selection stays purposeful and filtered through the Herald’s ritualized attention. World rules are consistent within the fable‑science blend.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (control the beam to face the fog’s unknown) tightens when the beam veers and the Herald must choose to steer into resistance. Escalation is coherent and crescendos at the gateway reveal, but the felt price of pushing through is underplayed—no foreclosed option or visible loss beyond effort. The external and internal threads align, though the conflict resolves smoothly. One strong deepening beat suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Bridging worlds and recasting “dawn” through “ancient shadows” emerges from object and action rather than sermon. The final green dawn reframes routine as destiny without platitude, though the “This was no accident” line leans toward telling. Ambiguity persists in a productive way (who planned, at what cost?). Resonance is solid but not profound, largely due to the gentle cost profile.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is consistent and textural, with controlled cadence and motifs (laughter, light, fog). Diction suits the fable‑science register and modulates at pressure points without head‑hopping. Occasional declaratives (“They understood”) flatten nuance but don’t break stance. Overall, a distinct perceptual signature carries the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive sentences with vivid images; minimal scaffolding and good paragraph rhythm. A few repetitions and summary pivots (“This was no accident. They understood.”) slightly dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative density remains mostly coherent; no tangled metaphors. Strong momentum with room to sharpen embodiment and trim declarative explanations.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse craft, quasi‑optical magic (total internal reflection), and a ritual keeper who laughs at storms feels fresh and integrated. The gateway/green dawn turn is earned by prior particulars. Risk‑taking is confident, though the revelation path follows familiar mythic contours. Emotional specificity could deepen to elevate originality beyond concept.</comment>
