<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara’s goal and drive are clear, and her tactile actions (adjusting the lens, scribbling notes) track with her intent. However, interiority leans abstract (“heal with words,” “bridge between worlds”) with limited contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift—accepting her own need for healing—lands but the cost is mostly conceptual and lightly felt. Stronger embodied conflict or a pressured trade-off would deepen credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single nocturnal arc where density and patterning (variable stars → constellation → telegram’s meaning) build toward a conceptual repricing at dawn. Closure arrives with a resonant insight and reweighted premise, but the on‑page cost is soft. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks, though turns are gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The observatory is vivid and integrated—the dome, machinery, and telescopes function as both mood and method. Variable stars and the equipment shape her decoding tactic, not just the backdrop. The daylily telegram and dawn reprise charge the final image. A touch more constraint (how the space limits or risks her choices) could push higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (decoding inscriptions/inner repair) are stated early, and discovery escalates from pattern to constellation to thematic plea. Pressure remains low; no option is foreclosed or materially risked, so the tightening reads primarily as understanding rather than cost. The resolution follows naturally from accumulation but lacks a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The theme of shared burdens is coherent and threaded through stars, telegram, and temple. However, it’s articulated overtly (“no burden was meant to be carried alone,” “truth that would heal generations”), tipping into moralizing in the closing stretch. Subtext yields to declaration, muting resonance. The imagery could carry meaning without the explanatory assertions.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and appropriate; diction is lyrical but mostly controlled. The voice holds an even, contemplative register that fits the nocturnal, observatory frame. Some phrasing trends generic or exalted, yet it stays coherent and legible without head‑hopping. Modulation under peak beats is modest.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear sentences with decent rhythm; imagery like “river of light” and “midnight solace” repeats but doesn’t derail clarity. Some abstraction and stock formulations dampen density, and a few lines paraphrase sentiment already expressed. Still, momentum carries and mechanics are clean. Sharper, more specific verbs and fewer thematic restatements would lift the line work.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—astronomical decoding, a pressed telegram, and healing through language—offers a fresh palette. Execution stays safe: discoveries come smoothly, and the insight lands in familiar terms. The frame is memorable but the moral calculus is low‑risk. A bolder, stranger cost or a non‑obvious final tilt would heighten originality.</comment>
