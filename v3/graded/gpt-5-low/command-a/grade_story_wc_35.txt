<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to smooth the cutting edges of memory) is clear and drives her choices, and her gift is consistently dramatized through tactile tasting and subsuming. However, internal contradiction is limited; she rarely falters or miscalculates, so the struggle feels controlled rather than contested. The brief overwhelm at the shard is strong but passes quickly. The final lightness lands, but the cost reads modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominant: pressure builds via successive encounters (etchings → central shard) and resolves with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the pavilion dissolves. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the method (tidal pools) motivates access. The closure costs are on-page (remorse flooding, tears), though the solution unfolds smoothly with minimal resistance. The because/therefore chain is adequate if understated.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The desert after rain, tidal pools, and the coral icebound pavilion are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s professional and sensory bias. Environment shapes tactics (pool analysis) and charges the ending (pavilion melting; dawn over the fortress). Sensory integration is balanced (temperature, texture, light) without tourist listing. It stops short of constraining a hard choice, but it meaningfully frames and reweights the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can she transform concentrated remorse without being undone) is clear and tightens as she moves from jagged wall etchings to the heart shard. The escalation is a clean deepening rather than a reversal, with one decisive intensification at the shard. Cost is felt but not punishing; her success feels largely assured. Still, agency drives the turn and the price recharges the final image.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of remorse, transformation, and the ethics of bearing others’ pain emerge through concrete images (etchings smoothing, shard dissolving). The final image reframes the pavilion as cyclical and eternal, avoiding total neatness. A few on-the-nose phrases (“leaving behind only the lesson”) skim close to moralizing. Overall resonance is strong, if slightly safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in taste and touch. POV distance remains stable and credible; no head-hopping or withheld knowledge tricks. Diction sustains a consistent, cool luminosity that modulates under stress at the shard. Minor elevated phrasing occasionally edges toward gloss but stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image-rich, and generally economical; sentences often do double duty for atmosphere and action. There are minor purple glints and a few near-redundancies, but momentum rarely stalls. Rhythm varies well and the final cadence lands. Figurative logic holds without mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—chef who tastes memories, tidal pools as desert navigation, an icebound coral pavilion of crystallized remorse—is fresh and specific. Turns feel earned via established mechanics rather than late rule changes. The risk is aesthetic rather than structural, but it coheres into a memorable vision. Emotional truth is present, if cushioned.</comment>
