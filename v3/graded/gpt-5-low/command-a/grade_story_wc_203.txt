<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive (compelled fixer drawn by ghosts/ceilings) is clear and drives action, and his trade-skill habits (dust, mechanics) inform choices. Interiority is adequate but low on contradiction; he rarely wavers or pays a palpable price beyond a chill and tension. The young ghost is a cue, not a relationship crucible. The final “weightless burden” note gestures at cost/duty but stops short of dramatized conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: whisper “engage” → dust analysis/ceiling attention → discovery of clock → barrel insertion → environment/ghosts resolve. Closure lands on the page (clock reanimated, cracks seal, lights steady), with a conceptual after‑cost (cracks return; ongoing duty). Stakes are modest but coherent under a causal lens; no major causality slips or teleports. The cost is felt lightly rather than acutely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus office is vivid and purposeful (sawdust/popcorn residue, flickering fluorescents, counter as ladder, ceiling tiles as access). Object-as-setting works: the mainspring/clock charges the final image and the space shapes tactics. Sensory detail stays POV-filtered through a repairman’s noticing. The circus layer adds atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens: whispers and pulsing cracks escalate to the ghost’s point and the literal reach into the ceiling. Agency drives the turn (he installs the barrel), but the risk and trade-off feel gentle; little is truly foreclosed beyond a diffuse burden lifted. The tightening is single but effective at this length. The resolution is earned, if comfortable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Repair/time/facade motifs braid into a tidy thematic arc: a fixer restores rhythm, healing surfaces that hide fractures. The cracked/whole façade and living clock reweight earlier images without moralizing; the last line’s admission that “cracks always reappear” avoids tidy closure. Subtext of duty vs. peace emerges through action rather than commentary. A touch more ambiguity or cost would deepen resonance further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is steady, third-close, with a perceptual signature grounded in a technician’s precision. Diction is controlled and fits the character; no head-hopping or stance leaks. Lyric touches (whispers, weightlessness) integrate with a practical eye. Rhythm varies enough to carry the scene without showiness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean and purposeful; images (tarnished brass, pulsing cracks, flicker/buzz) do double duty for mood and plot. Minimal scaffold and little redundancy; figurative language is restrained. A few familiar phrases (“weightless burden,” “sense of closure”) shave freshness. Cadence supports momentum through the reveal and insertion beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—elevator tech medium solving a circus haunt via horology—feels fresh and specific. The turn is earned by seeded particulars rather than a late rule change. The release-by-repair trope is familiar and the risk profile is low, tempering ingenuity. Still, the mainspring/ceiling conceit and façade motif create a memorable texture.</comment>
