<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clara’s curiosity and guardedness are clear, with the seal as a personalized tell and a credible micro‑choice arc from caution to commitment. Interiority is present but not deeply embodied; emotional texture leans conceptual over visceral. Elias’s distinct voice and status (guide/mystic) sharpen dynamics without overpowering Clara’s POV. The final decision (knocking with sugar) feels motivated by prior beats, though the cost is modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (rooftop garden, meteor shower, two characters), and the scene stays contained. Under a causal lens: Elias appears → reframes objects/stakes → offers sugar → Clara acts next morning; the closure (she knocks) is on the page. The cost is implied (vulnerability, unsealing buried truths), not strongly dramatized. The turn is quiet but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vivid and woven through action, setting tone and scale. They don’t strongly constrain choice, but they charge the conversation’s intimacy and the liminal, threshold feel. The seal as micro‑setting object helps charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (will Clara engage and begin listening/acting) is legible, but pressure rises mainly through talk rather than concrete costs. The meaningful tightening is Elias reframing the seal as a key and handing over sugar, which narrows her options. Consequence remains conceptual; the social/emotional price is understated. Effective, but low‑temperature escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of listening to built history and “agreed‑upon lies” resonate via objects (seal, sugar) and the final act, which answers with action rather than thesis. Some lines verge on didactic (“The kind that hold societies together”), but the closing image reweights prior talk. Subtext in neighborliness as portal to truth is elegant. The piece avoids a tidy moral while offering quiet purpose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV stays close to Clara with consistent distance; diction is controlled and fitting. Dialogue is clean, carries subtext, and advances the turn; Elias’s voice reads distinct without purple strain. No head‑hopping or withholding; the aphoristic lines are supported by the scene’s tone. Rhythm modulates well from wonder to resolve.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear, rhythmic, and avoids scaffolding; most sentences carry more than one job. Occasional elevated phrasing and imagery risk mild abstraction but don’t blur sense. The final lines land with efficient charge (“seal heavy… sugar in her hand”). No loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—dead‑language tutor, buildings that “speak,” and borrowing sugar as praxis—is fresh and grounded. The seal’s revaluation is a neat, specific turn rather than a generic talisman move. Risk‑taking is modest but coherent, prioritizing a quiet conceptual pivot over spectacle. Not radically new, but distinctive in its particulars and restraint.</comment>
