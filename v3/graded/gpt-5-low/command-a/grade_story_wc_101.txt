<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent (protect and unify the community), and the anonymity-to-public stance shift constitutes a credible cost. The key interior tension—valuing anonymity yet choosing to step into light—lands at the widow’s doorstep and at the arbor. Interiority is serviceable but relies on generalities rather than highly particularized thought. Minor safety in the portrayal (Mara’s competence mostly untested) keeps it short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: night runs → accidental exposure → rumor momentum → public declaration → communal buy-in, with the sacrificed anonymity as cost at closure. Orientation is early and strong; the bell is set up and paid off. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (community identity shifts; Mara’s role shifts) with a legible price. The escalation is gentle but coherent under a Hybrid lens skewing accumulative.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arbor, ridge, lanterns, and cracked terra-cotta give a tactile locus that frames the gathering and charges the final image. The silver bell functions as object-as-setting, recurring to shape and symbolize choice. Environmental specificity is purposeful and filtered through the communal stakes. It slightly lacks constraining force, but it meaningfully charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unity under sanctions) is clear; pressure tightens when anonymity breaks and Mara chooses to declare and convene. The visible cost—relinquishing secrecy under sanction risk—lands. The conflict remains low-temperature, with little direct opposition on the page, but the internal/external weave is credible. One meaningful tightening rather than robust reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hope-through-collective-action and intergenerational reciprocity emerge from concrete beats (volunteers, weaving, the bell’s renewed meaning). Some lines skate close to thesis statements (“we’re not just survivors”) which trims subtlety. The final image reweights earlier material without over-explaining. Resonance is earned but not layered into richer ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is steady and disciplined; diction fits the lyrical-quiet intent. Dialogue is brief and functional, with the widow scene adding pressure without exposition bloat. The voice is clear if not singularly distinctive. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly economical; images like “amplified quiet” and “wind whispered through cracked tiles” carry tone. Minor repetition and safe modifiers appear but do not stall momentum. Sentences often do double duty (setting and theme). No artifact loops or figurative muddle at the end.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The masked-helper-to-community-reveal arc is familiar, but the bell’s “amplified quiet” and sanctions context add flavor. The piece synthesizes tropes with sincerity rather than subverting them. It avoids gimmickry, but takes limited risk. Freshness appears in the restrained cadence more than in story turns.</comment>
