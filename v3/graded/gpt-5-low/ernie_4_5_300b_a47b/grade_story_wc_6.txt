<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—remaking a legacy of harm through care—drives concrete choices (lying about the coin, splinting, pressing for release). Interiority is embodied and particular (obsidian lagoon, sand “hissing”), and the father’s shadow is faced on‑page. The cost is mostly emotional and modest but real. Slight tidiness (she rarely falters) keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean single‑scene arc with an accumulative/textural drive culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands via the release and the final sand image, reframing compassion as charged endurance with a felt cost. Orientation is immediate; causality is coherent. The quiet stakes are earned, though not severe.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (obsidian lagoon, skeletal kelp, volcanic sand) inform action (kelp as splint) and charge the ending (the falling grain). The environment is filtered through Lira’s sensibility and anchors tone. Micro‑setting functions as a charged object at closure. Minor reliance on visual isn’t a drag given the tactile counterpoints.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around persuading Mara to let go while Lira holds her own history. The key tightening occurs at “What if she forgets me?” followed by Lira’s counter and the release. Costs are primarily emotional and thematic; no major reversal beyond that moment. Effective but gentle escalation limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motifs braid well (coin, sand, scars), and the bird’s release refracts the central question of transforming harm. However, explicit thesis lines (“Compassion… wasn’t about erasing the past”) blunt subtext and approach moralizing. The “scars sing” refrain risks neatness. Resonance remains, but subtlety is compromised.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third‑person close with a distinct lyric texture; diction and rhythm feel controlled and character‑specific. Dialogue reads natural and purposeful, with subtext around legacy and identity. Voice remains stable under modest pressure. A few aphoristic lines tilt toward authorial summary but don’t break POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: precise verbs, tactile images, and efficient beats. Figurative density stays coherent and advances mood and meaning. The final paragraph leans tell‑y, reducing propulsion slightly. No loops or muddled metaphors; cadence varies well.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The arsonist’s‑daughter‑turned‑firefighter at an obsidian lagoon with a coin talisman feels fresh and integrated. The bird‑release as moral calculus is familiar but rendered with specific, memorable textures. Risks are tasteful rather than bold. Strong synthesis without a singularly surprising turn.</comment>
