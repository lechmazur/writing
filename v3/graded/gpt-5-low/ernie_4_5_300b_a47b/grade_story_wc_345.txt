<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is crystalline and consistent, and her agency (the chalk messages, gathering, and speech) drives the action. We glimpse an interior check—she reexamines her approach—which adds a sliver of vulnerability. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or visible flaw; her saintliness limits dynamic tension. The final endurance/change reads earned but low‑cost, more affirmation than sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a Causal lens, the chain (messages → mobilization → reinforcement → nebula flares) holds cleanly. Orientation is clear and the closure lands on the page: the arch holds. The cost feels light (effort and time), with escalation largely summarized rather than pressured in scene. Still, set‑ups pay off and the ending is legible and cohesive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Luminara’s orchards, floating arches, and the nebula are vivid and purpose‑driven, not postcard filler. The arches’ decay directly motivates the plan, and the bell returns to charge the final image. World rules stay coherent and are learned through action. Atmosphere aligns with tone without bogging momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (save the arches/nebula), and pressure coheres toward the gathering. The tightening is modest: collective action succeeds without a concrete on‑page setback or price beyond labor. No reversal tests commitment; the risk stays conceptual rather than felt in-scene. Resolution is earned but comfortable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of collective care, trust, and renewal develop through recurring images (bell, nebula) and culminate in a charged final chime. Some lines tilt toward overt moral statement (“It is a promise”), dampening subtext. Nevertheless, the motifs reweight at the end and produce a gentle afterglow. Ambiguity is limited but coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The third‑person voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with clean control of distance. Dialogue is sparing but purposeful, and the brief speech advances theme and action. No head‑hopping, and inference stays within what’s plausible for the narrator. Rhythm modulates well between description and movement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are polished, image‑rich, and mostly efficient; the prose carries multiple jobs without sludge. Occasional elevated diction and thematic declaration edge toward purple but do not blur sense. Syntax varies and momentum holds through transitions. The final sentence lands cleanly on a resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>An altruistic ghost orchestrating civic action on an orchard planet via chalk messages and a butterfly bell feels fresh and specific. The synthesis of sci‑fantastic ambiance with communal labor is distinctive. The resolution is a touch neat, slightly muting audacity, but the conceptual blend and object reprise are memorable. Risk is present in the tender, non‑antagonistic approach and largely pays off.</comment>
