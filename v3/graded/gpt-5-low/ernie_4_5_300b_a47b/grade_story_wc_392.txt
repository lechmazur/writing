<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (expose Cole, reclaim agency) is clear and enacted through concrete choices (lighting the lantern, searching, reading, deciding). Interiority is specific enough—watchful calm undercut by tremor—though a few tell-y lines (“She’d been a fool”) flatten complexity. The off-page antagonist limits relational pressure on the page. The final stance crystallization feels earned, if emotionally tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Lantern → visions → suspicion confirmed → hidden files → decision creates a clean because/therefore chain; closure lands as Charged Poise (resolve to expose via facts). The hidden compartment appears conveniently but doesn’t break causality. Cost is implied more than felt, keeping this short of top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel’s damp, pressurized environment and the lantern’s brass/glass tactility shape perception and options; the hidden wall compartment is spatially legible. Weather and infrastructure after the drought subtly inform danger. The lantern as object-as-setting charges the final image. Detail is selective, mostly purposeful, and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (break Cole’s control) tightens when the lantern’s vision of Cole and the “Eliminate” files reweight risk and knowledge. Escalation is internal-external interwoven, though the immediate on-page price is light. The final commitment forecloses compliance credibly. One deeper cost or a tangible risk beat would lift stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memory-as-weapon and history’s echo (Eliza’s courage vs. present manipulation) integrate with the object and decision. The piece edges toward thesis with “not through emotion, but through empirical observation,” but the charged images carry most weight. The end revalues the lantern from chain to tool, a resonant conceptual shift. Ambiguity around consequences keeps reflection alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Close third is steady with a controlled, tactile voice; rhythmic variation suits pressure. Brief dialogue lines (“Keep moving,” “Memory is a weapon”) carry subtext and advance plot. Diction occasionally leans familiar (“smooth as oil”), but the perceptual signature (engineering eye meeting haunted history) remains consistent. No POV leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with good image economy; sensory detail works in service of scene. Some stock phrasings and minor redundancy (“watchfully calm” repeated; a few declarative summaries) slightly dull edges. No figurative muddle; actions and beats track cleanly. The final line lands with image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hybrid of a preventable-death investigator with an Underground Railroad lantern that projects memory feels fresh and coherent. Director manipulation is familiar, but the historical entanglement personalizes it. Turns arise from the premise rather than tricks. Bolder consequence or an unexpected moral calculus would push this higher.</comment>
