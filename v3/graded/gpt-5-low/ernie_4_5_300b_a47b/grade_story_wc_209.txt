<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s obsession and craft drive tangible choices (sneaking to the window, painting the negative space), and her interiority feels particular. The “quietly driven” trait manifests credibly across beats. Internal contradiction is mild—she rarely wavers—so stakes lean contemplative rather than conflictual. The endurance cost is implied (time, secrecy) more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural design coheres: postcards → window study → inscription → mural shift → cataloging → reweighted understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (communion with the hush) with a charged final promise (“final layer… unbroken”). Causality is clean, orientation is early, and the “map to the hush” through light changes is well‑threaded. The cost at closure is soft but present as ongoing, chosen obsession.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is richly and specifically rendered (amber pavilion, scaffolding, frosted etchings, violet glow), filtered through an artist’s eye. The window and changing light actively shape choices and discoveries, charging the final image. Sensory balance favors sight but remains purposeful and lived‑in. The abbey ecology and seasons subtly guide action without touristic excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure deepens via pattern density and light‑driven discoveries; the inscription triggers a tactic shift (painting the negative space). Stakes remain internal—understanding and legacy—so escalation is quiet rather than narrowing options with a hard price. Agency is steady and coherent, but no beat forces a painful trade‑off on the page. The final charged poise promises further cost rather than showing it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme integrates through images (roots/celestial charts/heartbeats; the negative space) and culminates in a resonant, non‑literal answer. The communion with darkness reframes defiance elegantly. A slightly expository line (“Flowers bloom at night not in defiance, but in communion.”) states the thesis rather than leaving it wholly in image. Subtext around secrecy, legacy, and fear of being seen (Thorn) enriches the close.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is consistent, sensory, and modulates with pressure; dialogue is spare and purposeful. Perceptual signature (an artist reading the world through light and pattern) is distinct. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm supports the accumulative build without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: vivid images (“a map to the hush,” “equation for photosynthesis rewritten in starlight”) carry multiple jobs. Prose mostly avoids redundancy and purple excess despite a lush register. Momentum holds through scene turns with minimal scaffold. Minor density risk in figurative stacking is controlled and does not blur closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of botany, stained glass cartography, and nocturnal communion feels fresh and purposeful. Risks (lyric texture, quiet stakes) cohere and the final promise image reweights earlier motifs. Familiar “artist deciphering a code” bones are transformed by specific seasonal and light mechanics. The piece maintains authenticity without gimmickry.</comment>
