<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—renew fading constellations despite the nostalgia ban—and her internal contradiction (fledge vs. anchor) governs action. Embodied beats (burning stylus, rooted feet vs. suspended leap) reveal character under pressure. Slight abstraction at times (“obsidian grace,” “study in contradictions”) keeps us a shade removed from granular, choice-by-choice interiority. Still, her final stance—choosing the in‑between—reads earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and cadence mount through dance → adhesion of dust → burning inscription → garden’s tremor → quiet resolve. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she takes the verse at cost, doesn’t topple the ban, and claims elective exile. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; cause and consequence are legible within the chosen mode. The price (pain, risk of madness, ongoing exile) sits on the page at the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden is tactile and specific (luminescent mist, pulsing moss), and the micro‑setting shapes action: the garden responds (thickening mist, dimming stars), charging the ritual. Tools and objects (moonstone dust, stylus) are integrated into the environment and finale. Description is lush yet purposeful, rarely sliding into postcard excess. The setting’s responsive physics deepen the final image without rule breaks.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—renewal under prohibition—is evident early; pressure tightens when she adheres the dust and moves to the forbidden inscription. The decisive intensification (writing the verse) exacts cost and forecloses a safer path. No antagonist is needed; internal and situational pressures interlock coherently. The ban’s momentary “waver” gives a clear peak before settling into an earned, costly refusal to overturn the order.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Yearning versus enforced amnesia, liberation versus rootedness, and the ethics of “stealing” from the cosmos thread through concrete acts, not pronouncements. The last image reweights prior motifs—the moon/sea pull, elective exile, “obsidian grace”—without moralizing. Complexity remains: she neither breaks the ban nor submits; she inhabits the charged in‑between. A touch less slogan‑ready phrasing would heighten subtextual subtlety.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is consistent and controlled; perception carries a distinct sensory bias (breath gaps, fracture‑seeking). Diction modulates with pressure (from poised observation to branding pain) without head‑hopping or stance wobble. A few recurring formulations (“obsidian grace,” binary paradox structures) flirt with mannerism but don’t disrupt control. No dialogue to test, but narrative voice bears the load effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with strong image economy; most sentences do multiple jobs (world rule + motion + mood). Minor purple creep appears in stacked modifiers and repeated antitheses, but clarity persists even in peak beats. Rhythm varies and propels through the turn into inscription; little scaffolding or paraphrase looping. The final cadence lands cleanly on an image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—tide dancing inland, a nostalgia ban, cosmic verse inscribed in living skin—feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns grow from established rules and traits (observing gaps, moonstone as catalyst). The elective exile ending is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Boldness in concept is matched by disciplined execution, with only slight reliance on familiar lyric tropes.</comment>
