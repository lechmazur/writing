<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Her motivation is clear and consistent, and small micro‑choices (placing the wing, regulating breath, committing to the ritual) track. However, there’s little contradictory impulse under pressure; she never wavers or risks a wrong tactic. The seer backstory informs motive but doesn’t complicate it in scene. The final endurance costs her only the wing, not a felt internal price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern and hush density rather than turns. Closure lands when the brook stills and the wing dissolves (RR-lite), but the cost is modest and opposition soft. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why). The because/therefore chain is thin, relying on ritual inevitability rather than a tightening choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The brook, fireflies, moss, and “haven” are vividly and economically integrated. The brook’s reflection is the ritual’s trigger, and the final image (wing crumbling, murmur resuming) is charged by place. Sensory detail stays purposeful and filtered through her practice. The setting subtly governs options (water’s edge as catalyst) rather than being a postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (hush the prophecy), but escalation is minimal and resistance near‑absent. The meaningful tightening is the moment the ripples still and the wing draws light, yet no option is foreclosed beyond the expendable wing. The success comes without reversal or visible price. Tension remains atmospheric rather than oppositional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Silence as language is a coherent thematic throughline, embodied by mapping hush to avert chaos. The ending offers calm as answer, but it’s tidy and lightly moralizing (“the world remained quiet”), limiting lingering ambiguity. Subtext exists in the fracture/constellation imagery but rarely conflicts with stated intent. Resonance is pleasant more than piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The lyric voice is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature and controlled rhythm. Diction suits the character’s ritual mindset; POV remains stable and modest. A few ornate phrases verge on purple but don’t obscure legibility. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, with varied syntax and purposeful cadence shifts around the ritual beats. Occasional abstraction (“smoothed hush,” “terrestrially cosmic”) repeats and slightly pads momentum. Figurative density remains coherent; no mixed metaphors mar the peak. Minor redundancy and ornamental modifiers keep it short of elite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The “mapping silence” ritual against a coded prophecy is a fresh angle within familiar mystic tropes. The origami wing as conduit is a nice, specific inflection and the hush aesthetic is unified. Lack of hard cost and friction tempers impact and novelty. Still, the synthesis feels cohesive and memorable.</comment>
