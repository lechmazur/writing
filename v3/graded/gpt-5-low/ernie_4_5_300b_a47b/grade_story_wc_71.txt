<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority (the “creeping normality noticer”) drives concrete choices—collecting and arranging displaced objects—revealing a distinctive mind. However, internal conflict is minimal; her certainty faces little friction. Embodied emotion lands in the hush “of attention,” but the arc lacks a palpable trade‑off. The final acceptance feels earned but cost‑light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative design holds: setup (object theory), action (arrangement), and on‑page closure (sanctification) cohere. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—hush reframed as potential made legible by the bay’s glow. The cost is conceptual rather than felt; stakes resolve without pushback, tempering impact. Orientation is crisp early; no lens slippage.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bay’s quiet, the streetlight “daydream,” and tactile shoreline work through Lira’s professional bias, and the setting choice (a place that amplifies quiet) materially shapes the tactic and final image. Recurring objects function as environment, charging the glow. Sensory detail is economical and purposeful across senses. The world’s soft rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove theory/sanctify hush) is signaled and there is one clear tightening when the air “thickens” and the shard glows. Yet pressure is gentle; no real opposing force or credible risk challenges her path. The success arrives cleanly with little cost or narrowed options. Tension is atmospheric more than escalatory.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coherent theme emerges from particulars: displaced objects as anchors, orris root “fixing” silence, hush as potential. The final realization reweights prior images, but the explicit articulation (“The hush wasn’t emptiness; it was potential.”) edges into thematic statement, dulling resonance. Subtext is otherwise strong in the glow and “listening” houses. The insight is earned by scene work rather than lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature; diction suits Lira’s sensibility and keeps a steady psychic distance. Rhythm modulates well at the glow’s crest without over‑ornamentation. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Purposeful metaphoric precision (“streetlights daydreamed,” “hush of attention”) supports the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, character filter, and forward motion—while maintaining clarity. Minimal scaffold or loops, with varied syntax and clean choreography. A few elevated phrasings flirt with purple but stay coherent and voice‑true. The final image resolves cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—perfumery’s fixative recast to “fix silence,” displaced objects as anchors—feels fresh and organic to the character. Quiet sanctification via accumulative pressure is a thoughtful risk that lands. Emotional cost is muted, slightly limiting depth. Still, the conceptual angle and particularity distinguish it from familiar “found magic” templates.</comment>
