<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s “lukewarm” power and brittle devotion are dramatized through tactile, incremental choices (tilting the bell, persisting as cracks widen). His naivete collides credibly with doubt (“And if you’re wrong?” / “He didn’t know.”). Embodied cost (shaking hands, exhaustion) grounds the interiority. Marla’s pressure is credible and reframes his stubbornness without flattening him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear causal throughline: attempt → calibration → synchronization → partial reconfiguration of the rift. The closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: “balanced… for now,” with ongoing maintenance as cost. Orientation and spatial logic are crisp from the opening. The cost is modest but legible on the page (fatigue, fragile system, constant adjustment).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct, glass heat, and niche where glass meets stone are not mere backdrop; they constrain tactics and enable the drip solution. Sensory selection is purposeful, with the sea’s hum and dawn’s light shaping tone and options. The bell as object-as-setting charges the closing image. World rules (architects channeling the ocean’s pulse) stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres: time, heat, widening cracks, and Marla’s skepticism push toward a single shot at sync. The meaningful tightening is the on‑page lock when drip matches the viaduct’s hum. Prices are present but not harrowing; risk is mostly voiced rather than dramatized. Still, agency drives the outcome without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Resonance arises from the tension between repair vs. balance and devotion vs. madness; the final poise honors fragility over triumph. The sea’s “tired of giving” reframes extraction as moral texture. A near‑moralizing line (“Madness is just devotion without a roadmap”) slightly flattens subtext. Overall, the imagery carries the theme more than the declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured lyric texture; diction matches the world’s plausibility. Dialogue is spare, goal‑driven, and distinguishes Marla from Elias without exposition. Rhythm tightens appropriately during the calibration sequence. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lean yet vivid; images like “bridge of frozen light” and the bell’s “sickly green” pull double duty for world and mood. Minimal scaffold and clear sequencing sustain momentum. A few repeated modifiers (earnest/naive/brittle) skirt redundancy but don’t sap the closure. Syntax varies and supports pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The calibration of magic via “dripping rates” against a sapphire viaduct feels fresh and specific. The “lukewarm mage” concept subverts competence fantasies in a grounded way. The partial, maintenance‑bound win is a smart, non‑obvious turn. Not radically novel, but confidently synthesized with strong integrity.</comment>
