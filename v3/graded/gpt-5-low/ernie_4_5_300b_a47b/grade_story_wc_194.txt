<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and steady—she seeks her father’s secret—and her actions align under pressure (turning the crank, following the hum, opening the desk). Interiority is specific enough (bone‑deep vibration, tears) but internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or risks a wrong move. The final stance shift (from seeking truth to stewarding a new, transparent legacy) feels earned though emotionally tidy. A bit more friction or self‑deception under stress would deepen character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under a primarily Causal lens, the beats link cleanly: crank → hum → vision → mechanism → letters → reframed legacy. Closure lands on the page as a Conceptual Repricing with a concrete act (unlocking) and a clear before/after. The cost is mostly emotional and conceptual (accepting chosen erasure), which reads but isn’t searing. A touch of convenience in the vision directly revealing the mechanism keeps it short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sepia reading room and the gramophone/desk function as lived micro‑setting; environment and tool constrain choice (frequency triggers the hidden lock). Sensory specificity is rich and POV‑filtered (golden shadows, dust, bone‑felt hum). World rules (standing waves) are taught through action, not exposition dumps. Strong integration charges the final image without over‑ornamentation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unearth the truth) is evident early; pressure coheres and tightens via the escalating sound and thickening atmosphere. The decisive tightening—the hum revealing the lock—narrows options and leads to the letters. Costs remain mostly internal and conceptual; no meaningful loss or risk beyond psychic strain. Escalation is clean but a bit safe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of power, silence, and chosen erasure emerges organically from the gramophone ritual and the letters. The final reweighting—legacy as sacrifice not failure—resonates with prior images. A few lines verge on moral summary (“The dynasty’s end was not a tragedy but a rebirth”), softening subtext. Still, the object‑driven reveal earns the insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and stable in close third; the perceptual signature (quiet between notes) coheres with sensory choices. Diction and rhythm modulate well as the hum crescendos. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elision is purposeful. A hint of purple at times, but it stays legible and character‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with varied syntax and purposeful imagery; sentences do more than one job. Minor tendencies toward ornament (“golden shadows” recurrence) don’t stall momentum. Information density stays high without loops or scaffolding. The climax/action remains clear despite lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Archive‑mystic trope is familiar, but standing waves as time‑bending memory and the gramophone mechanism feel fresh. The letter‑based conspiracy reframing avoids a simple twist and integrates with theme. Risk‑taking is moderate rather than bold; the path is elegant but expected. Distinction arises from the sensory‑sonic apparatus more than from plot novelty.</comment>
