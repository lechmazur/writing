<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—tending chaos into fragile order—drives tangible micro-choices (gathering debris, arranging, humming). Her interiority is specific and embodied (texture of the feather, cool water), though internal contradiction is soft: unraveling thoughts vs. disciplined tending. Stakes remain largely aesthetic/philosophical, limiting pressure on her psyche. The fisherman’s nod provides a relational echo but not a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held: storm debris → tending → tapestry → acceptance of impermanence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she values the process over permanence with the cost of inevitable unraveling made explicit. Orientation is clean early; single-scene day arc is coherent. Stakes are quiet but the final reweighting is on-page and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lagoon after rain is vividly rendered and supplies resources and constraints (storm debris becomes material; water responds to her hum). The setting’s sensory detail aligns with Lira’s priorities and charges the final image (amber/violet water; feather in fading light). Environmental logic is consistent and integrated into action, not bolted on. The kite, heron, and fisherman enrich atmosphere without clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (harmonize discord) is clear, with the kite-snap as a catalyst, but escalation is gentle. The meaningful tightening is more tonal than consequential; risk or loss remains largely conceptual. No reversal tests her commitment beyond endurance; the cost is the accepted transience of the work. Effective for a lyric mode, but pressure never truly narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of impermanence, tending, and beauty-in-the-incomplete recur through concrete acts and images. However, final moralization (“the act of creation mattered more than its permanence... deepest beauty”) states the thesis rather than letting the images carry it, dulling resonance. Subtext does operate in places (fisherman’s silent nod; heron taking flight). The closure still lands, but would be stronger with less declarative summation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature—syntax and diction match Lira’s contemplative stance. Rhythm modulates well from post-storm hush to warmed midday to evening dissolve. No head-hopping or stance drift; elision is purposeful. Occasional elevated phrasing borders on purple but remains coherent to voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, vivid images, and multi-tasking sentences that build mood and action together. Some metaphor density and adjective stacking approach lushness but do not blur sense. Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum holds through the day’s arc. The final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Poet weaving storm debris with a dream-drake feather to “harmonize discord” feels fresh and coherent. The kite-snap catalyst and water responding to song add distinctive texture. While not radically inventive in structure, the synthesis of object-magic, quiet craft, and process ethos reads authentic. Emotional truth is present without gimmickry.</comment>
