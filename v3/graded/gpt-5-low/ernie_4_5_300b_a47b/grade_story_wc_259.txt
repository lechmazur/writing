<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motive (pursue dangerous truth via “avoiding patterns”) with embodied beats (tremor, breath hitch). Kael provides a live crucible that sharpens stance; her final choice costs the relationship. Interiority occasionally leans into declarative thesis (“Corruption is just another pattern”), but the change—embracing the archive as seed—is earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observed shifts (hum → glow → liquid light) reweight the central stake. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: not a tomb but a seed; she chooses deeper engagement at a cost (Kael’s exit, risk of “corruption”). Orientation is clean, single scene coherent. A touch more concrete consequence would lift further.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV‑filtered (bronze prism pagoda, constellations, glowing carvings) and charges the final image (liquid gold pooled at her feet). The environment shapes choice by presenting the living archive as pressure and invitation. Strong sensory economy beyond the visual (hum, warmth) enriches atmosphere.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risk forbidden contact vs safety—tightens as the pagoda activates and Kael presses her to stop. The meaningful turn is the hum/glow sequence that forces her stance; she pays by losing Kael and accepting danger. Stakes stay mostly internal and conceptual, but pressure coherence is strong for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant images support themes of knowledge, danger, and choice, culminating in the seed/rebirth reframing. However several lines state thesis directly (“The end of innocence…”, “truth … the only thing worth fighting for”), edging into moralizing and diluting subtext. The final image still carries charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady and the lyric voice is controlled; dialogue distinguishes Lirael’s conviction from Kael’s fear and advances pressure. Rhythm modulates with intensity; no head‑hopping or stance leakage. Occasional elevated abstraction brushes against the spoken register but remains plausible for these scholars.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong cadence and image density with few redundancies; most lines do double duty. Some purple tint (“atoms of nostalgia”) repeats and a few declarative thesis lines slow momentum at peaks. Mechanics are clean; clarity never collapses.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The saffron‑veil historian, bronze prism pagoda, and “archive as seed” synthesis feel fresh and cohesive. The turn from tomb to seed is non‑obvious yet earned by particulars. Risk‑taking in diction and conceit pays off without obscuring closure.</comment>
