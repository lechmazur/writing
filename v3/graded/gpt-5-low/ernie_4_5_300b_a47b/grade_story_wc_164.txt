<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motivation and interior texture (“cheerful gloom”) shape choices from shard‑reading to the pool. Her methodical actions align with her purpose, and the internal paradox registers in body and habit. The final realization earns a modest change in stance. Cost is more conceptual than felt, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and clean; single‑POV focus holds through one coherent progression (shard → seeds → pool). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal links, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the pool. Closure lands on the page with images that reweight the premise. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it short of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The geode environment is vivid and integrated: obsidian pedestal, bioluminescent walls, and the pool of liquid light materially shape tactics and the ending image. Specifics are POV‑filtered through Lira’s sensibility. The setting both mirrors and pressures the inquiry without feeling like postcard description. It charges the final act decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and coherent, and pressure accumulates via new evidence (seeds) and the move to the geode’s heart. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑deepening rather than option‑narrowing, with minimal visible price. The pool sequence provides the single tightening and turn needed at this length. Stakes remain largely abstract, reducing tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory, forgetting, and release arise from particulars (crater glass regret, seeds, fog) and crystallize in the final repricing. A line like “Because some paths are meant to be forgotten” edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, though the pool imagery rescues it from sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, reflective, not saccharine. Strong coherence, if not layered ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical POV with a distinct perceptual signature (material‑emotional cross‑sensory noticing) maintains control. The voice modulates with pressure (hum turning lighter, walls humming) without head‑hopping or register slips. Minimal dialogue is apt and unobtrusive. Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, sensuous, and largely efficient, with images doing multiple jobs. Figurative density is high but coherent to the voice; clarity holds through the climax. Minor redundancy (“cheerful gloom,” repeated why‑questioning) does not impede momentum. Sentences vary rhythmically and carry scene forward.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Strong synthesis: a sea‑foam recollectionist, crater glass, rune‑seed cartography, and a geode’s liquid‑light heart feel distinctive and inevitable together. The final “release vs. forget” reframing is earned by prior specifics. Risk‑taking in worldbuilding reads organic, not ornamental. Only the soft cost prevents a higher band.</comment>
