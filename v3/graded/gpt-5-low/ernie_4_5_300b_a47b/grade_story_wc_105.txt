<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—capturing the sound of trust breaking tied to her father’s disappearance—is clear, personal, and drives each choice. Interiority is sensory‑particular (lavender static, green hum) and embodied through action. The internal contradiction (hurt vs. exhilaration) appears most strongly at the eruption but isn’t deeply layered earlier. Still, her actions align with motive and culminate in a credible, costly stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation and causality are strong: vials → crucible → insufficiency → root → eruption → mold → insertion. Closure lands on the page as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—she chooses to hear the absence with cost (pain, acceptance of fracture). The Hybrid lens leans Accumulative at the end, and the pressure coheres without contrivance. Cost is felt, if more conceptual than materially lasting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional: the sunken greenhouse, forge, and dead peach tree aren’t decorative—they supply tools and constraints that shape tactics. The shipwrecks provide resources (absences) and the aurora’s charged atmosphere colors perception. The anvil/forge and root materially charge the final image via the forged aid. World rules hold through tactile engagement rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via a purposeful tightening: the initial mix isn’t enough, forcing the sharper choice to desecrate the dead tree’s root. The eruption’s pain and sonic overload test commitment and exact a price. Agency drives each turn; no coincidence resolves anything. The narrowing is modest but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: absence as material, memory as mutable, betrayal as a frequency. Recurrences (forge, root, coordinates) deepen meaning without sermonizing, and the final image reweights love as audible absence. The “cells divide, memories fracture” line borders declarative but is grounded by concrete action soon after. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is confident, lyric, and sensorially coherent with Lira’s synesthetic hearing. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (the eruption tightens the line). No head‑hopping or register drift, and inference remains within POV limits. The perceptual signature—colors as frequencies—feels distinct and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; images carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, world, motive). Occasional high‑concept lines flirt with purple but don’t blur causality or closure. Sentence and paragraph rhythm vary with momentum, and scaffolding is minimal. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Collecting absences as liquid memory to forge the sound of betrayal in a drowned orchard under aurora is strikingly original. The synthesis of synesthesia, biotech trees, and shipwreck reliquary feels inevitable by the end. Risks serve character and stakes without gimmickry. The closure image is memorable and specific.</comment>
