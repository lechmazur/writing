<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (post‑ban drive to dissolve boundaries) and aligned with concrete micro‑choices (touching quartz, paraphrasing, stepping onto water). Interiority is sensorially embodied and character-specific. However, there’s little internal contradiction or friction; she meets minimal resistance, which limits felt cost. The final stance shift feels earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound/light density builds to a charged poise ending. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration when she stands on “liquid glass” and recognizes the colonnade as threshold. Orientation is crisp early; beats connect via sensed intensification rather than causal reversals. Cost is mostly conceptual, not materially priced, keeping this just shy of higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vivid, sensorial, and integrated with action. Environment actively shapes choices (the hum changes under touch; the lake parts; the threshold reframes the last image). World rules are taught through observation and held consistently. The final silence/surface image is charged by place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to rewrite boundaries) is signaled early and escalates through intensifying phenomena (humming → cracking → falling crystals). The key tightening is her risked step onto water, which reweights options. Yet consequences remain largely abstract; no palpable loss or trade‑off is incurred on the page. Coherent pressure without a concrete price keeps tension strong but not gripping.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of sacred/profane blur, art as world-making, and liberation after prohibition emerge organically from images and acts. The final threshold recognition resonates, but “the world is ours to reshape” tilts toward thematic declaration in the last paragraph, dulling subtext. The piece invites reflection, but complexity is cushioned by assured success. Strong coherence; avoid overt moralizing to elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric third close POV is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (sound/light as meaning). Rhythm modulates with pressure (hush → hum → silence) and remains legible. Diction is consistent with character’s sensibility; no head‑hopping. Occasional purple notes are largely earned by the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density and purposeful imagery; motifs recur with intention. Minimal scaffolding and few loops; momentum holds. Figurative saturation approaches the edge but stays coherent, with images echoing the boundary theme. Clean mechanics and a strong final line.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of “paraphrase as magic,” humming quartz, and post‑ban threshold is fresh and integrated. The risk of stepping onto liquid water is imagistically bold, if low-cost. The world feels singular rather than templated. Strong, specific vision without gimmickry.</comment>
