<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—seeking redemption and proof of competence—drives clear micro‑choices (following the note, trusting the knot, kneeling to ignite the lily). Embodied emotion is strong (chanting to hold loneliness, tactile handling of the knot). Internal conflict registers as risk versus guilt but resolves a touch neatly. The final stance shift feels earned though the cost is mostly internal and understated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light, chant, and sensory filtering thickens to the lilies’ bloom and a conceptual repricing of “shadows.” Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, with cost implied in owning prior failure and embracing risk. Causal throughline (mosaic note → chamber → ignition) holds without contradictions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fortress and fire‑lily chamber are vividly rendered and functionally used; space and tools shape action (note in wall, staircase, lilies as ignition field). Sensory detail is purposeful across senses and filtered through a pyrotechnic’s priorities. The recurring knot-object charges the final image. Minor symbolism edges close to overt but remains grounded in environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redeem craft/defy hopelessness) is clear and pressure coheres from rumor → note → chamber → ignition. Escalation is more atmospheric than oppositional; the key tightening is choosing to risk lighting the lilies. Price is primarily internal; external hazard is hinted (fortress shudder) but not tested. Still, agency drives the turn and reweights options credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Fire, filtering, and “gravity” recur and reconfigure meaning at the end. The line explicitly decoding “shadows” as “unlit potential” veers into on‑the‑nose moralizing, slightly dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the final image of chanting with purpose provides a resonant, non‑literal answer. The mentor motif threads theme through concrete action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinctive sensory‑practical lexicon (sulfur, kerosene, clicks of petals). Rhythm modulates well from hush to roar without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision around the mentor leaves meaning to accrue. Diction stays in character and supports pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; imagery is lush but mostly controlled. Occasional abstraction (“unlit potential”) trims the edge off the final beat but does not blur sense. Minimal repetition and no major scaffold. Sound and syntax support momentum into the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The pyrotechnic spirituality, blooming fortress ecology, and the kerosene knot as lens feel fresh. The mosaic clue and ambient awareness method synthesize into a non‑obvious but inevitable repricing. Risks in lyric density pay off without obscuring clarity. Slightly tidy thematizing keeps it short of the very top.</comment>
