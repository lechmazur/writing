<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (retrieve the key despite claustrophobia) are clear and consistent, and his internal contradiction—prudence warring with the urge to leap—registers on the page. Embodied stress (shallow breath, pressing walls) keeps emotions concrete. His decisive choices (leaping into the corridor, stabbing the wall with the compass) align with his traits. The cost is mostly fear/endurance, with limited moral or relational complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: organ → apparition → corridor twist → tool deployment → key obtained → gateway. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (key acquired) and a Charged Poise as he steps through with risk intact. Some convenience softens the climax (one jab stills the corridor and drops the key with minimal price). Orientation is strong and the single-scene structure holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cathedral’s architecture, starlight and stained glass, and the organ’s sonics shape atmosphere and constrain choices; the corridor’s “spatial mutiny” forces a concrete tactic. The compass-as-tool engaging the living wall integrates object, body, and environment in the decisive beat. Rules are learned through action rather than exposition. The final gateway image is charged by the place’s established logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (securing the key) is clear, and pressure coheres as the organ’s pull escalates into a twisting corridor that resists him. Agency drives the turn—his leap and the deliberate use of the compass to “pin” space. The price paid skews toward internal endurance rather than a tangible loss, and the resolution feels a touch easy. Nevertheless, options narrow once the corridor destabilizes, and the final step into the unknown carries forward consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prudence versus rebellion threads through choices and culminates in a quiet defiance: he steps through the gateway with “wistful rebellion” intact. The organ, compass, and living architecture work as thematic vehicles for resisting imposed structure. Insights are earned via action rather than moralizing. The resonance is solid if not deeply layered.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with controlled, lyrical diction suited to the gothic-fantastic mood; no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well at pressure points (organ swell, corridor twist, final step). A few familiar phrases flirt with purple but do not derail clarity. The perceptual signature—sensory bias to sound and space—feels character-specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lines are generally tight with purposeful imagery and momentum; the sonics of the organ and the tactility of stone read sharply. Minor clichés (“weight of silence,” “thrummed with a charge”) and a few intensifiers slightly dilute freshness. No substantive loops or scaffold bloat, and the climax is cleanly rendered. Syntax varies enough to keep propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cathedral-quest and mystic key are familiar, but the drafting compass interacting with a mutable corridor adds a fresh, specific wrinkle. The organ’s reverberation as a dimensional method feels inventive. Emotional truth is present if not radical. Overall, a polished recombination with a distinctive tactile tactic at the peak.</comment>
