<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Alaric’s motive—redeeming the abandoned covenant through the rigor of his chess‑tuned mind—is consistent and specific, with embodied moments (teeth ache, cold stone) grounding his resolve. The “thoughtfully precise” trait shapes tactics and carries social cost via exile and past mockery. Internal contradiction is light but present (his prior dismissal of the riddle versus his surrender to silence). The closing choice to use Lira’s key and plant the seed reads earned and character‑true.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: vow → placement of stone → glow → star‑map chessboard → keyhole → opening → star‑mage → seed planted. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant reframed as living practice rather than text. Cost is more conceptual/emotional than material, but exile and endurance charge the final image. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the Causal lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus and eclipse are sensorially vivid (hum that aches teeth, moss‑crusted monolith) and functionally integral to the puzzle. The basalt stone operates as a micro‑setting and tool that directly constrains options (keyhole, stardust). World rules are taught through action without dump. The setting charges the final image of the star‑seed and sustains tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently—silence to hum to glow to apparition—but the dominant stake remains largely conceptual, with limited felt risk or trade‑off. The key insertion is a strong agency beat; the “before the next phase” clock is present but not pressing on tactics. The ending’s consequence is hopeful but light on cost. One meaningful deepening occurs; a second tightening or price would lift stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in constraint, silence as language—emerges through chess metaphors that reweight the final seed image. The queen’s diagonal through the Shattered Sword neatly reframes brokenness as directional. Occasional explicitness (“beauty in the difficult”) risks stating the thesis, but it’s earned by particulars and not purely declarative at the end. The covenant’s “living” nature offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third‑person close voice is steady, textured, and filtered through Alaric’s chess‑trained perception. Diction is controlled and consistent; lyric turns feel motivated by the character’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, with subtext in the star‑mage’s acknowledgement. Rhythm modulates well from contemplative to charged without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean and efficient, with high information density and few redundancies. Lyric imagery supports mood without collapsing into purple, and syntax varies to maintain momentum. Minor abstract lines (“beauty in the difficult”) flirt with summary but are anchored by concrete beats nearby. Final image lands crisply without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of chess strategy, cosmic ritual, and a living covenant yields a distinctive frame. Turns (constellation‑board, queen’s diagonal through Shattered Sword, key forged from chess pieces) feel inevitable in hindsight. Some genre furniture is familiar, but personalization through vocation and method (translating silence) elevates it. The risks are thoughtful and coherent.</comment>
