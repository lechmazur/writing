<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s intellectual curiosity and skepticism are clear, and his micro‑choices (waiting, placing the seal down, choosing to “lie” to the building) track with his vocation. Interiority is particular (“language… felt… from his bones”), and the relationship dynamics with the woman carry subtext. Internal contradiction is modest; he moves from caution to commitment quickly with limited visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: meeting → revelation → ritual action → response forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR with the building’s voice answering and the pair’s chosen lie reweighting truth. Cost is implied risk and surrender to the unknown rather than concretely dramatized, keeping this shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, glass dome, and Leonids are vivid and purposeful; the meteor shower time‑locks the act and the dome’s humming physically pressures them. The seal functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image. Details filter through Elias’s lens (architecture as language), avoiding tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—risking awakening a sleeping building by weaponizing a lie—tightens once with the decision to act now under the Leonids. Escalation is coherent, but the price is mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete loss or irreversible cost on the page beyond tremors and dust. Still, the narrowing of options and agency at the dome read earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Truth vs. protective fictions is integrated through the “agreed lies” turning into tactic (“We lie to the building”). The idea of dead vs. sleeping language reframes the world without sermonizing. Resonance is present but not devastating; no single image re-prices the entire moral calculus beyond wonder and risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a distinct perceptual signature (architectural linguistics) and clean dialogue that carries subtext (“You’re interrogating me… with waiting”). Rhythm modulates well from rooftop calm to dome tension. No head‑hopping; elisions are purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lean, textured prose with selective lyricism (“engravings shifting like liquid”) and good sentence variety. Minimal scaffolding, strong verbs, and clean mechanics. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple but don’t blur clarity; momentum holds through the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—tutoring in the languages of buildings and lying as a ritual key—feels fresh and integrated. Familiar trappings (mysterious woman, ancient seal) are enlivened by the linguistic frame. The final beat is intriguing but not a radical reconfiguration, keeping it short of exceptional.</comment>
