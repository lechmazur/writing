<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias’s meticulousness, solitude, and data‑first mindset are convincingly dramatized, and his shift from observer to witness is earned by the pigeon note → rooftop survey → clinic → vial sequence. The internal conflict (integrity in solitude vs. public accountability) is present under pressure. Minor softness: the “defender of integrity” line leans on label rather than embodied conflict at the end. Still, actions align with motives and reveal character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: mysterious note compels investigation; rooftop detour narrows options; biohazard alarm and the doctor’s reveal deepen stakes; vial handoff produces a decisive mission. Closure lands with a before/after: he burns the note and commits to public witness (Decisive Change with a Charged Poise final image). Cost is present but light on the page; danger is implied more than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtyard and fog are vivid, functional anchors that bookend the piece, while the rooftop, trellis, and dead‑light “patch” shape tactics. The storm recorder as tool‑setting micro‑anchor constrains choices and charges the final image (“hummed softly”). Sensory selection reflects his professional bias (pressure readings, particulates), integrating world rules without dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. safety/solitude) tightens through the note, the alarm, the clinic reveal, and the perimeter lights flaring. He makes active choices that foreclose safer paths (enters zone, accepts vial, burns the message). The price is conceptually strong but not deeply felt in-body at the peak; the exit is a touch safe. Still, pressure coheres and grows under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of bearing witness, institutional silence, and the ethics of solitude emerge through particulars (recorder, fog, ash‑storm, clinic). The final image reframes his vocation from prediction to testimony. However, explicit thesis statements (“defender of integrity”) narrow the resonance and flirt with moralizing, slightly dulling subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, observational texture fitting a data‑driven protagonist; diction and rhythm modulate well from courtyard hush to zone stillness. Dialogue is sparse and functional, with the doctor’s urgency carried in few words. No head‑hopping; inference stays within what Elias can plausibly know.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean, economical lines with purposeful images (“streetlights flickered and died,” “ash instead of rain”). Minor abstractions and taglines creep in near the end (“defender of integrity”), but momentum and clarity hold. Sentence variety and information density are strong without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Familiar conspiracy/containment tropes gain freshness through the tactile storm recorder, ash‑weather anomaly, and the quiet‑to‑oppressive tonal arc. The rooftop “lateral progression” is a nice tactical inflection. Some elements (secret symbol, authorities denial) are conventional, but the synthesis feels specific to Elias’s lens.</comment>
