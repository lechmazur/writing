<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive and temperament are clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (careful wiring, patient address to the spirit) align with “gently systematic.” Internal contradiction is present but muted—acceptance versus the ticking clock could bite harder on the page. The spirit exchange reveals values under pressure without melodrama. The final Earned Stasis (choosing to finish here) lands credibly with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: the build of copper/wire/root density culminates in the dusk linkage and RR, with the visible cost of time/life. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the time skips are purposeful and legible. The climax (wire meets stone; spirit appears) is an on‑page reconfiguration that reweights all prior beats. The ending’s stasis is earned and the price is undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living pillars are vividly tactile and govern tactics—the copper must bridge oak to stone; the pillar’s heartbeat cues acceptance. Setting evolves with events (rumble, glow, hum) and charges the final image. Details are POV‑filtered through Lira’s botanical craft. The environment and tools constrain choices and shape closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: harmonize humans and spirits through a remodel before time runs out. Pressure tightens via the rumble and the risked final connection; escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. The price (pain, potential disruption, and ultimately her life) is felt, though a sharper on‑page jeopardy at the climax could heighten strain. Resolution follows from her agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of bridge‑building, consent, and pain as language emerge organically through action and image. “You build walls… we build boxes… this is a bridge” risks stating the thesis, but it’s dramatized and reweighted by the later acceptance and the final sigh. The closing hum of stone and wire offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—botanical and architectural. Dialogue with the spirit is spare, subtextual, and advances the turn. Psychic distance holds steady with purposeful compression across days. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean, image‑driven prose with varied rhythm; sensory specifics carry multiple jobs. Occasional mantra repetition (“gentle and systematic,” “brazen calm”) is purposeful, not scaffold. Figurative language stays coherent in peak beats; no loops dull momentum. A slight lushness remains under control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of living architecture, copper‑root symbiosis, and hospice‑level devotion feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The spirit interaction avoids stock beats and pays off the premise without grandiose spectacle. Risks (quiet climax, lyric register) cohere and elevate rather than obscure. The final image reframes the whole with memorable specificity.</comment>
