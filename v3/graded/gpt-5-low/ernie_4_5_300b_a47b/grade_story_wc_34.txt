<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—to speak what he cannot say aloud—drives every micro‑choice (who he writes to, the symbols he chooses, his refusal to stop in the rain). Interiority comes through action rather than labels, and grief/guilt (for brother, for Lira) gives the work weight. The contradiction (fear of speaking vs. insistence on encoding) is present but not stressed to a breaking point. The cost remains mostly conceptual; we don’t see a consequential risk beyond vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm, the sequence of messages (Lira → brother → self), and the plate/bluebell finale tighten cadence toward a Charged Poise closure. The final image—trusting a ghost to keep what rain will wash away—reconfigures the premise with a felt price (choosing ephemerality and faith over direct address). Orientation is clean from the outset and the scene stays contained. The cost is modest but legible on the page through renunciation of direct speech and acceptance of loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “misty courtyard above clouds” and the storm aren’t postcard detail; weather, stone, and the wall’s “ghost in code” integrate with action. The flower press bolt plate functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image via the bluebell. Sensory detail is selective and voice‑filtered, maintaining tone without clutter. Constraint is mostly atmospheric rather than tactical, keeping this just shy of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether Elias will risk articulation; escalation arrives with the storm intensifying and the progression of targets culminating in the self‑addressed mirror. The key tightening is his refusal to stop when rain hisses and the walls may erase him—an Earned Stasis of endurance. Stakes remain intimate and internal; no reversal or explicit external cost raises the price further. The final act (pressing the bluebell) crystallizes commitment without adding new jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as inscription vs. erasure, mediated communication vs. speech, and the ethics of letting the lost keep their mysteries. The bluebell pressed into the plate reframes the grandmother’s lore into a present choice, giving the final moment a quiet repricing of permanence. No moralizing; the last line’s “Somewhere, a ghost smiled” preserves ambiguity without coyness. The resonance is strong though not world‑tilting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A coherent, lyrical third‑person close holds steady, with diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “charcoal dipped in moonlight”) establishing a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with the storm’s beats and avoids head‑hopping or explanatory hand‑holding. No dialogue, but the interior texture carries subtext and mood. A few lush turns flirt with purple but stay voice‑motivated and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: sentences carry multiple loads (world, action, interior) with good cadence variety. Figurative density is high but coherent within the taught pattern; minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops. Occasional ornament (“driftingly alert”) is decorative rather than propulsive, slightly softening momentum. The closing image is clear and cleanly phrased.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” bridged through graffiti as intercessor, paired with a flower‑press tool reimagined as memory‑press, feels fresh and cohesive. The storm‑borne encoding ritual and bluebell coda synthesize premise and emotion without gimmick. Risks in diction and conceit pay off under control. The only limiter is the relatively gentle on‑page cost.</comment>
