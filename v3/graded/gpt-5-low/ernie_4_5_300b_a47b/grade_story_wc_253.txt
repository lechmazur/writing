<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s motive is clear—quiet creation as resistance—and her micro‑choices (choosing the spoon, narrating each step, placing it beside the bouquet) align with that drive. The internal contradiction (rebellion vs. compliance) is present but contained, yielding a credible Earned Stasis rather than a decisive turn. Embodied detail (petals disintegrating, oiling the wood) grounds her affectless posture. A touch of declarative thematics slightly smooths the edges of her conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the stepwise spoon‑making densifies pressure and culminates in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she commits to continued carving despite the mandate’s cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality is quiet but coherent. The mandate’s price (family taken) is concrete, and the final vow reframes creation as defiance with an ongoing risk. The closure lands cleanly without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Farmhouse, turbines, and handled objects (knife, wood, bouquet, spoon) are vivid and filtered through Lirael’s craft‑biased noticing. The turbines’ hum/shadow and the bouquet’s decay charge the atmosphere and final image, even if the environment doesn’t overtly constrain movement. The micro‑setting (tools and table) functions as locus of choice and meaning. A strong, economical integration with tone and action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—refusing grief erasure—tightens as she escalates the ritual from selection to polish to vow. The price is largely conceptual/social rather than immediate, yet legible via backstory and ongoing exposure to enforcement. Escalation is subtle but cumulative, fitting the lens. A more immediate on‑page threat would have sharpened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of grief’s remaking and beauty in flaws emerge organically through craft actions and inherited sayings. The bouquet/spoon pairing provides a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few lines verge on thesis (“Lightness… is not the absence of darkness”), softening subtext into statement. Still, the final cadence carries earned weight from particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, cool, and textured, matching Lirael’s performative indifference while letting image do the feeling. The quasi‑stage narration (“Today… I will carve a spoon”) is distinctive and consistent. No head‑hopping; stance and diction remain steady. Rhythmic modulation supports the accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, with strong verbs and concrete imagery; sentences do multiple jobs without drag. Minor purplish touches (“slicing the sky into fractured shards of light”) skirt excess but don’t swamp clarity. No scaffold or paraphrase loops notable; momentum holds. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The “happiness mandate” dystopia is familiar, but reframed through a minimal, craft‑ritual lens that feels fresh. The moral ambiguity of performing compliance while carving resistance is credible and specific. The spoon/bouquet dyad provides a memorable anchor. Novelty sits more in execution than premise, but it works.</comment>
