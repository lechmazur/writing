<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (to decode familial silence) and embodied pursuit through tactile action; the pacifist/listener identity coheres with the resonance tactic. Internal conflict is light—she flinches at fireworks but persists—so contradiction under pressure is modest. The shift from curiosity to empathy is earned via reading the entries, though some trait labels read told rather than dramatized. Still, micro‑choices (method shift, patient attunement) reveal values credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a causal pivot: the frequency method yields the click, leading to a reweighted understanding. Orientation is crisp early; the single-scene arc tightens around the device build, hum, and opening. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—she redefines silence and her stance—with an understated emotional cost. The chain holds without extraneous turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The workshop’s tools, window, and fireworks-inflected night are vivid and functional: they supply resources, pressure, and a charged final image. The tuning fork, wires, oscilloscope, and the clasp act as micro‑setting constraints shaping tactics. Sensory detail is balanced and POV‑filtered (flux smell, town hum). Environment meaningfully charges the ending (diary on bench, fireworks dying).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—opening the diary to understand silence—is clear, with one meaningful tightening as she abandons force for resonance under the fireworks’ pressure. The fireworks’ boom complicates but does not solve, keeping agency centered on her attunement. Cost is mostly internal (accepting inherited silences) and could read sharper, but the narrowing of options is credible. Tension rises at sentence and beat scales without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Resonance between method and meaning is elegant, but thematic statements are sometimes on‑the‑nose, culminating in explicit moralizing about “the path to empathy” in the final lines. The diary line defining silence is effective once; later restatements blunt subtext. Still, concrete particulars (radio static, hum, clasp) do much of the thematic lifting. The closing image carries feeling despite didactic phrasing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual bias toward sound and touch; modulation under pressure remains controlled. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the radio memory is integrated cleanly. Occasional aphoristic lines tilt toward essayistic tone but don’t fracture POV. Rhythm and diction suit the character’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sensory‑dense, and mostly efficient; many sentences do double duty (atmosphere + action). Minor repetition of thesis language and a few declarative abstractions slow momentum near the end. Figurative choices are coherent and avoid mixed metaphors. Syntax varies enough to keep cadence alive through the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Opening a familial diary via tuned resonance that mirrors decoding silence feels fresh and thematically integrated. Fireworks as counterpoint to quiet is familiar but used with specificity. The device build and hum‑based lock offer an inventive turn without gimmickry. The synthesis lands as personal rather than high‑concept, with authentic emotional texture.</comment>
