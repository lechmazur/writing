<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lila’s motive—protecting vulnerable voices—drives clear micro‑choices (kneeling at the fountain, following the pulse, presenting the message). Interiority is sensorial and particular, not generic. However, internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance and rarely wavers. The emotional cost lands but is modest, more tenderness than real fracture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: photo → faint pulse via hearing aid → deeper search → twin device → message → assurance to the woman. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (assurance delivered; final beep), consistent with a causal lens. The on‑page cost is felt but soft, more catharsis than sacrifice. Orientation is crisp from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atrium’s mist, glass dome, and abandoned galleries are vivid and filtered through Lila’s task‑focused perception. Objects-as-setting (photo, hearing aids) meaningfully charge the final cadence (the atrium “exhales,” the last beep). Environment shapes movement (labyrinthine west wing) and sustains tone without stalling momentum. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early: retrieve a final truth and deliver it. Pressure coheres as the pulse intensifies and narrows options toward the twin hearing aid and the apparition. The solution follows from Lila’s attention rather than coincidence, but the price paid remains primarily emotional and not especially narrowing. Escalation is present, if gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Listening as love’s afterlife is embodied through the pulse motif and the synchronized hearing aids. Subtext largely carries the meaning until a slightly explicit line (“Sometimes love is too big for words…”) leans toward moralizing. The final “echo” image is apt but states the concept rather than letting it reverberate unaided. Resonance remains, if a touch on‑the‑nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly close-third; diction and rhythm match the hush and the investigative focus. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with subtext in restraint. No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few lush metaphors push toward purple but stay legible and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines carry image and action efficiently, with varied rhythm and purposeful detail. Occasional florid touches (“spectral cats,” “heartbeat trapped in amber”) risk saturation but don’t blur causality. Redundancy is minor; momentum holds through discovery and delivery. The final beat is clean and not overwritten.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hearing‑aid pulse mechanic and “contact tracing” of hearts give the ghost-assurance premise a distinctive angle. The atrium’s lived texture and the duet of devices feel fresh and coherent. While the thematic endpoint is familiar, the method and images earn specificity. Risk lies in quietness rather than novelty posing, and it mostly pays off.</comment>
