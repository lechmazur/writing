<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nana Marisol is vivid, competent, and motivated; her insurgent past and desire to “evolve tradition” clearly drive each action. Interiority is grounded in tactile beats (blistered digging, plant-whisper hum), but internal contradiction is light—she rarely doubts or pays a meaningful emotional price. The choice to plant is swift and largely uncontested. Still, micro‑choices align cleanly with her values and reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: kite → decoding with plants → digging → hatch → vault → embryo → planting. Orientation is strong from the opening and the single-scene frame is coherent. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and a conceptual repricing (future as seed, not weapon), though cost is modest (risk of drones, potential social backlash, physical strain). The drive lens (Causal) holds throughout without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are sensorially vivid and functionally integral: they hide the vault, fuel the urgency, and become the planting site that charges the final image. Details (sulfurous mist, moss-slick rock, bubbling water) are filtered through her practical aims. The setting materially constrains and enables choices. The final glow through steam ties world and theme elegantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled (regime drones, the embryo’s contested destiny), and pressure coherently tightens through discovery to the planting. However, escalation lacks a hard test; no antagonist or obstacle forces a costly trade‑off beyond speed and physical strain. The urgency “before the drones return” adds momentum but never bites on the page. Resolution feels right but relatively easy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (tradition vs. evolution; destiny as cultivated rather than imposed) emerges organically from concrete actions and the embryo’s redefinition. Yet the final paragraphs veer into overt thesis statements (“Tradition would evolve, not die; The future wasn’t…to fear or control”), reducing subtext. The imagery itself was sufficient to carry the idea. Resonance lingers, but the moral is somewhat told rather than earned purely through implication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is steady, precise, and sensorial without head‑hopping. Diction suits a tough, observant elder with lyrical leanings, and rhythm modulates well through action and discovery. No dialogue is needed; the internal texture remains coherent under pressure. Imagery like “night‑blooming cereus” reads character‑specific rather than generic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, varied, and propulsive; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, mood, and causality). Figurative language is lush but controlled, with few redundancies and no muddled metaphors. Minor lyric excess skirts purple once or twice, but clarity holds, especially in the high‑pressure beats. The closing image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—insurgent grandmother, plant‑telepathy, volcanic springs, and a reimagined “destiny” embryo—is distinctive and coherent. Beats feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicky, and the kite decoding is a pleasingly odd catalyst. The cost could cut deeper, but the vision feels fresh and self‑assured. Risks serve meaning rather than novelty.</comment>
