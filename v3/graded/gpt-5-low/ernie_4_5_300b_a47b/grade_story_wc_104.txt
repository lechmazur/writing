<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive—recover seeds for her people—guides micro‑choices (hesitating on the star key, timing against scavengers). Interiority is embodied in tactile details (rusted cuffs, cold floor) but rarely presents true contradictory impulses beyond brief hesitation. Competence borders on smoothness, though the chain‑snap under pressure shows earned endurance. The final renunciation (sacrificing a vial to entangle scavengers) aligns with values and shows visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong causal spine: decode keys → open bench → descend to vault → scavengers close in → sacrifice vial to escape. Closure lands on the page with cost (spending a precious vial; burning the arrow’s purpose), and the constraint of time pressure is coherent. A touch of convenience—the instant rooting vines—leans toward fable but is prefigured by the vault’s quasi‑mythic aura. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; single‑POV and scope are well‑contained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival and prize bench are vivid and function as micro‑setting tools that constrain access and tactic (hidden compartment, stair, wall rubble). Sensory detail (dust, cotton candy ghost, cool earth) supports tone without detours. The environment participates in the final image (rubble, vines reclaiming space). World rules feel consistent at this lyrical register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: unlock the vault before scavengers, preserve resilience. Pressure tightens as footsteps approach, narrowing options and prompting the costly choice to shatter a vial. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (wall’s collapse drawing scavengers) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The price is legible and alters future options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resilience vs. scarcity and liberation vs. constraint braid through actions and objects (chains, arrow, seeds). The final image reweights “planting resilience” into literal defense and renewal, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few on‑the‑nose formulations (“resilience had been planted”) blunt subtlety. Still, the theme largely emerges from concrete beats rather than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited voice is steady, tactile, and biased toward tools and texture; rhythm suits rising pressure. Diction occasionally tilts purple (“liquid starlight,” “staggering grace”) but remains coherent with the piece’s mythic hue. No head‑hopping or unjustified elision; revelations match what the POV learns. The cadence tightens effectively at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and propulsive; most sentences do double duty (world + motive, object + plot). Minor flourish stacking appears but doesn’t clog clarity; no paraphrase loops or template cadences bog momentum. Strong verbs and specific nouns carry weight; punctuation and sequence are crisp. The final line earns its image without overwrite.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The carnival seed‑vault and arrow‑as‑map synthesis feels fresh, with an earned, tactile puzzle instead of generic prophecy. The instant‑growth defense skirts familiar fantasy logic but is grounded by prior setup and theme. Emotional truth (freedom through cost) keeps novelty from gimmickry. Distinctive enough to linger, if not radical.</comment>
