<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clara’s motive—redeeming her great‑grandmother—drives concrete, escalating choices (deciphering, digging, defying evacuation). Interiority is specific (salt/ozone, brittle pages) and shows a live contradiction: fear threads through her insistence on acting. The director’s brief entrance gives external pressure that sharpens her stance. The cost remains mostly anticipatory rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Under a Situational-to-Hybrid lens, causality is clear: coded stanzas → dig → retrieval → roof ritual under the clock of the jet stream. The closure lands as Charged Poise: reading the stanza with the nail warming reconfigures the stakes without resolving them. Orientation is crisp from the outset (station, role, weather), and props are kept. The cost is implied (risking disaster/defying evacuation) more than rendered, tempering impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The weather station’s brass dials, frosted glass, and the spongey green sky create a tactile, purposeful atmosphere that constrains choices (roof access, evacuation, churning sea). The copper nail functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is select and POV‑true to a map librarian’s eye. Environmental pressure coheres with theme and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (truth vs safety) tightens when the director orders evacuation and Clara chooses the roof ritual instead. The jet stream’s acceleration provides a credible clock; reading the final stanza with the heating nail is the clear peak act. The price is felt but not enacted beyond deferring evacuation, so escalation stops short of a decisive trade‑off on the page. Still, internal and external pressures interlock cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of reversal—of exile, shame, and institutional “truth”—emerges through objects and action rather than moralizing. The final act (“question the storm”) reframes knowledge and legacy without neat answers, sustaining resonance. The coffin/nail/door chain creates a satisfying conceptual reweighting. A touch more ambiguity in Clara’s complicity with institutional harm could deepen it further.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is steady, vivid, and filtered through Clara’s sensibility; diction fits both her archival vocation and the storm’s pressure. Dialogue is spare but functional, with status friction in the director’s interruption. Rhythm tightens appropriately toward the roof scene. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with strong verbs and precise nouns; images carry multiple jobs without purple excess. Minor lyric flourishes (“spongey gray”) stay legible and support mood. No notable loops or scaffold; action sequences read in clear order. The final line earns its charge without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—meteorology, archival decoding, and a coffin nail as temporal key—feels fresh and coherent. The shipwrecked codex and “question the storm” ritual avoid genre cliché while honoring internal logic. Risks (mythic-ritual in a scientific setting) heighten stakes and tone without confusion. Only the cost’s partial off‑paging keeps it from higher.</comment>
