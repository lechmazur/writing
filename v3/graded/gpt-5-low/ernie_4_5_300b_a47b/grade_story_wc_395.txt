<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s goal and tactics are clear and consistent, with concrete micro‑choices (digging past restrictions, cracking encryption, confronting Hale, uploading coordinates). Interiority is present but largely functional; she shows little contradictory impulse or visible doubt under pressure. Hale functions as thin external pressure rather than a complex relational crucible. The final renunciation (choosing flight over compliance) feels earned but light on embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: numbers → Lazarus shadow → encrypted video → revelation → alarms/drones → choice to go rogue. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she forecloses compliance and commits to the gateway hunt with risk on the page. The cost is implied (corporate pursuit, severed safety) and partially shown (drones advancing), though the escape beat is abrupt. Orientation is strong from the start, and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The archive environment is vivid (humming servers, holographic interface) and functionally integrated (encryption work, alarms, drones). The patch as a recurring object charges moments and is tactically used in the confrontation. World rules are consistent and learned through action rather than dump. While the space constrains and pressures choices, it doesn’t quite determine tactics at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are established early (truth vs. erasure) and tightened by a clear turn when the video reveals the gateway and corporate deletion. The blaring alarms and drones escalate pressure coherently, forcing a decisive stance. The price is legible but mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete immediate loss beyond danger. Still, the narrowing of options and commitment to risk read cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and institutional control resonate through objects and actions (patch, deleted files’ “shadows,” numbers as a buried message). However, some theme lines state the thesis overtly (“They’re erasing us,” “Some truths aren’t meant to be found”), reducing subtext. The final image reweights the motifs (sensed absence → resolve to remember) effectively. Ambiguity about the gateway’s ethics could have deepened complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and appropriately close, with a consistent, lightly lyric texture aligned to Lira’s profession. Dialogue advances plot but skews on‑the‑nose, flattening subtext in peak moments. Diction control is solid with a few familiar formulations. Rhythm modulates under pressure without confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear, paced, and largely efficient; images like “ghostly impressions… like footprints in snow” are apt. Some stock phrasing and minor redundancy (“brightly attentive,” “Some truths…”) sap freshness. No disruptive loops or template cadences impede momentum. The final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blend of corporate archive forensics with a vanished astronaut and numeric breadcrumbs offers a fresh inflection on familiar conspiratorial SF. The investigative beats are conventional but competently executed. Risks are modest; much relies on genre scaffolding (evil company, founder cameo) rather than subversion. The social‑memory keeper angle provides the distinctive lift.</comment>
