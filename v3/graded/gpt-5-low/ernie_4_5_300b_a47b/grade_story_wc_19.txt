<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s motive—collecting “flavors of silence” to ease claustrophobia—drives concrete choices (clinging to the trellis, returning on command, mourning, then repricing the loss). Interiority is sensory and particular (silence as honey/old wood) rather than labeled. The final change—accepting the doll’s loss and reconfiguring it as seed—feels earned by prior pressure. The father adds light external pressure without stealing agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clean early (bunker, inversion clock, trellis), and the causal spine holds: countdown → ascent → loss → return → sprout/realization. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost (the doll gone) and a new stance. The hybrid lens (causal actions with an accumulative lyric payoff) remains stable through the ending. The sprout image reweights the premise without mechanical tidy-up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bunker and trellis are tactile and pressure choices: the hour window and inversion mechanics constrain action, the hatch and vines shape tactics. Sensory specificity is high and POV-filtered (metallic bunker silence vs edible hush above). World rules (inversion, stabilizer) stay consistent and are learned through action. Setting charges the final image by contrasting confinement with emergent life.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>One dominant stake—brief escape to harvest silence versus safety/time—tightens via the live clock and the doll’s loss under reversal. The inversion hour narrows options and forces a trade-off (reach for doll vs return). The visible price (losing the doll) charges the aftermath. Escalation is clean if modest, driven by the window’s pressure rather than an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Loss becoming generative (silence as seed) resonates through concrete images, culminating in the sprout. The piece avoids overt moralizing for most of its length, though “by limiting her exposure…” risks didactic phrasing. Subtext of confinement vs permeability runs through the trellis/bunker counterpoint. The final repricing offers a quiet, reflective aftereffect without closing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (taste of silence) remains steady. Dialogue is spare and natural, carrying pressure (warnings, countdown, call to return). Diction and rhythm modulate with intensity (countdown quickens, hush slows) without head-hopping. Elevated phrases are voice-true to the world’s strangeness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry strong image density with minimal redundancy; metaphors are coherent and anchored in the world’s logic. Occasional echoed phrasing (“intangibly tangible,” “gilded hush”) skirts repetition but largely serves motif. Syntax varies and momentum aligns with scene tempo. No significant scaffold or clarity debt at the peak or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The inversion-hour trellis and “flavors of silence” premise feel fresh and integrated with character need. The doll-to-sprout reweighting is a non-obvious but earned turn. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
