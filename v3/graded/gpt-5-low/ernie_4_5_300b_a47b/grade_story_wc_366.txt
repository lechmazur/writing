<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s skepticism yields to participation, and that softening reads through embodied, trade‑off choices (stacking stones, placing the glass). Interiority is concrete and character‑particular—salt, iron, creaks—rather than label‑speak. Internal tension (dismissal vs. curiosity/need) is present but remains quiet; the cost is largely conceptual (accepting a lesser, communal light). The endurance at the end feels earned for this scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—notes, stones, and glass build a cadence that reweights the central stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lamp is still dead, yet a “new kind of light” emerges through ritual and connection. Orientation is clean; single POV, one locale, and a coherent window of days. The cost is legible: safety remains fragile; he accepts a substitute light with limits.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lantern room’s salt, iron, wind‑moan, and rattling windowpanes are vivid and shaped by Elias’s professional gaze. The setting materially pressures choice (failed lamp forces ritual substitutes) and charges the final image. Recurring objects (stones, sea glass, window) function as micro‑setting apparatus guiding action. Economy is strong; no tourist catalog drift.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (preserving a sense of safety/continuity after failure) and deepen via the iterative notes. The meaningful tightening is quiet: Elias relinquishes the “real” beam for a communal ritual, narrowing his options to endurance and attention. Cost is present but subtle; escalation is cumulative rather than sharply turning. One more concrete consequence could have heightened pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Endurance, communal caretaking, and reframed light accrue through particulars rather than thesis. The sea glass’s “song” and stones’ beacon effect build a non‑literal answer to the safety question. The phrase “a new kind of light” edges toward telling but is supported by prior images, keeping sentiment in check. Thematic afterglow lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Close third maintains a steady, briny cadence aligned with Elias’s reticence. Syntax varies, and diction suits the milieu without register slips. No dialogue, but narrative rhythm modulates well between observation and small acts. The voice remains coherent under pressure and at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean, sensorially rich, and largely free of scaffolding or loops. Occasional elevated phrases (“luminescent,” “haunted”) risk mild purple, but the imagery stays grounded in tactile detail. Momentum holds across paragraphs with efficient transitions. Final line lands by image and sound rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>While lighthouses and talismanic objects are familiar, the anonymous chain via stacked stones and the sea‑glass hum feels freshly synthesized. The communal ritual as surrogate navigation light is a non‑obvious turn. Risks are modest but coherent and integrated. The piece prioritizes human specificity over twistiness.</comment>
