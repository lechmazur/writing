<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lirael’s motive—to mend fractured history—is clear and consistent, and her method-driven choices (placing the valve, returning in intervals) reveal character. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page internal struggle; she meets scant resistance. Secondary figures (fisherman, girl) add texture but do not apply sustained pressure on her. The ending reflects endurance rather than a difficult renunciation with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the staggered‑interval structure across three sites builds meaning that culminates in the trumpet’s completion and sounding. Beats connect causally through the valve as beacon, and closure lands on the page. The price (time, patience, social reticence around the plaza) is modest but legible. No orientation debt; the mosaic pattern is taught early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Ivory harbor after rain,” the lighthouse, quay, and plaza are vividly rendered and filtered through an archivist’s priorities. The valve functions as a recurring object that charges the final image and guides movement through space. Weather and tides provide lived texture even if they lightly constrain tactics. World rules are consistent and embedded in action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stakes center on recovering communal memory; escalation occurs through patterned returns and discoveries (journal → fisherman’s testimony → locket fit). Pressure remains gentle; few options are foreclosed and costs are minimal. The final tightening is the trumpet’s completion, but the path lacks a sharp test or sacrifice. The calm, accumulative mode is coherent but low-heat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Resonance grows from concrete particulars: object returns, communal memory, and a sound that reanimates the harbor. However, the last paragraph states the thesis explicitly (“history wasn’t a line, but a mosaic”), sliding into moralizing that blunts subtext. The piece still offers a felt repricing—patience as method yields communal repair. The thematic weave is coherent if slightly on‑the‑nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Steady third‑person focalization with a measured, lyrical diction suits an archivist’s attention. Rhythm modulates between observation and action without head‑hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural; narrative certainty stays within plausible knowledge. Voice feels consistent and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear, image‑rich, and largely economical; the rain‑polished textures and nautical specifics carry weight. Minor repetition (e.g., “staggered intervals,” explanatory recap) is present but not momentum‑killing. Figurative language is disciplined and coherent; sentences vary well. Line‑level craft supports mood without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “ocean‑spray archivist” and method of memory retrieval via staged patience and a single object feel fresh. The trumpet valve as beacon bridging eras is a strong, specific conceit. While not radical, the synthesis is distinctive and purposeful. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they cohere.</comment>
