<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s goal is clear and embodied in concrete action (lifting the bell, pressing the amber sheet, choosing to sing via aurora). Interiority is particular (synesthetic perceptions), but internal contradiction and visible cost are light. Veyra’s skeptic-to-believer pivot registers but doesn’t pressure Lira’s choices on the page. The final stance feels earned, if tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: song-color density increases, the cavern transforms, and the final hymn image reconfigures the initial “sculpted hush.” Orientation is strong from the opening and the brief POV shift is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the cavern’s voice unfettered and Veyra newly aligned. Cost is conceptual rather than painful, but sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ice cavern and aurora are vivid, sensorially layered, and integral to action; the aurora functions as a tool and the cavern’s silence as pressure. Environmental change (stalactites into arches; the exhalation) charges the final image. Details consistently filter through Lira’s synesthetic lens. The setting constrains method, though not with hard logistical barriers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unfettering the cavern and certifying wonder—tightens through the swelling song and architectural shift. Escalation reads as a pattern-deepening rather than contested opposition; resistance is minimal. The synchronization with the chisel adds a faint external pressure but never forces a hard trade-off. Resolution is earned by Lira’s agency, with limited on-page price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Images carry a strong thematic arc from oppressive hush to living hymn, with wonder reframed as necessity. However, lines like “Wonder isn’t a luxury” and “truth… is essential” tilt into stated thesis, especially near the end. Subtext is otherwise present in the sculpted hush becoming music. The resonance lingers, but moralizing trims its edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical voice is controlled and sensuous, with a distinct perceptual signature via synesthesia. The brief Veyra focalization is clean and contrasts idiomatically. Dialogue is spare and functional, avoiding exposition dumps. Rhythm modulates well from hush to swell.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; metaphors (“sculpted hush,” “colors spilling like a promise”) cohere and propel mood. Minor purple tendencies surface but do not obscure sense or causality. No evident loops or scaffold, and sentence rhythm varies to suit pressure. The closure image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prism-song, amber sheet, and the “sculpted hush” concept synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame. The chisel sync adds an elegant cross-world tie. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off in a unified vision. Emotional truth is present, though the conflict could bite deeper.</comment>
