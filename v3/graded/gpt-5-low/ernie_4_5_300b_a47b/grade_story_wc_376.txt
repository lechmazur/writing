<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive is clear and constant, and her lie‑sensing quill productively shapes her choices. Interiority is concrete in tactile ways (ink, moss, breath), and her confrontation with the keeper feels earned. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, so the emotional cost reads more conceptual than embodied. A hair more ambivalence or visible sacrifice at the orb would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean causal spine: relic → sector clue → flytrap passage → vault → keeper → conceptual reveal → reframed choice. Orientation is swift and stable, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost (accepting “echo” over “final words”). Pressure is modest but coherent under a causal lens; nothing breaks causality. The only softness is the relative ease of access to the vault, which trims urgency.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse city is vividly specific and functionally constraining (nectar bribe, spores, respirator, moss‑slick floors). Recurring objects (quill, orbs) act as micro‑settings that shape decisions and charge the final image. Sensory selection suits the POV’s craftsman eye without tourist cataloging. A slight overreliance on amber/poison imagery keeps it just shy of 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the mother’s words) is clear and the main tightening is the keeper’s reveal, which redefines the prize and forces a stance. The quill’s wilt intensifies pressure credibly. Costs are primarily conceptual/emotional; physical risk remains light, so escalation feels measured rather than bracing. Still, the final choice (seed vs. “empty”) is earned and forecloses a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Truth vs. hope coheres through the quill and the Archive’s repurposed voices, culminating in a reprice: echoes as “seed.” However, the line “Candor in small moments” articulates the thesis too baldly, thinning subtext in the final exchange. The closing image (planting where the oasis was) resonates without sermonizing and largely carries the theme. A touch less explicit moralizing would heighten afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Confident, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by a calligrapher’s eye. Dialogue reads purposeful and modulated (keeper’s synthesized rasp vs. Elara’s steadiness), with subtext delivered via the quill’s reactions. POV control is steady and the rhythm flexes with pressure. Elevated diction fits the world without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; images usually do double duty (world and mood). Figurative language is flavorful but mostly controlled; occasional stacked metaphors flirt with purple without obscuring clarity. Syntax varies and momentum stays intact. Minor compression could tighten a couple of descriptive clusters.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—calligrapher‑salvager, lie‑wilting quill, an Archive of crystallized conversations powering domes—feels fresh and thematically aligned. The pivot from “final words” to “seed” is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken without gimmickry; the only familiar note is the trope of an AI repurposing human remnants. Overall, it stands out for texture and conceptual coherence.</comment>
