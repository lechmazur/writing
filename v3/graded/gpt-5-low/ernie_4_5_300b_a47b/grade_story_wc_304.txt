<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—save Elion’s echo before it fades—and actions align under pressure. Interiority is specific in craft terms but internal contradiction is light; she’s nearly always competent, rarely torn. Embodied emotion appears (trembling fingers, racing heart), yet the risk doesn’t deeply destabilize her perception. The final embellishment choice reads earned, though the personal cost is mostly fatigue rather than a value trade-off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: infuse → amplification → pool cracking → improvisational “embellish” to stabilize. The closure is on-page and decisive: Elion’s echo secured, pool resealed, with a visible risk window. Stakes are signaled early and tested; the cost lands as near-collapse and depletion. No orientation debt; single scene coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: the threshold/pool, obsidian runes, aurora pulses, and bioluminescent moss all filter through Lirael’s professional gaze. Environment constrains choices—the cracked pool threatens collapse, prompting the moonlight and lullaby tactic. World rules emerge through action (the pool as lens), not exposition alone. Scale and spatial coherence stay clear under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is firm and escalates when the pool spiderwebs: a concrete tightening that narrows options. The reversal (lens insight increases strain) forces adaptation via unconventional methods (embellishment). Cost is present but modest—no enduring loss beyond exhaustion. Tension is credible and sentence-level pressure sustains momentum.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of preservation versus oblivion, art as ritual care, and attention as salvation accrue through concrete acts (infusing, painting runes, lullaby). The final image reweights the premise toward fragile endurance. A faint whiff of moralizing—“beauty could endure”—edges toward statement, but remains anchored in action. Subtext works best in the lens insight and tone of “radiant hush” under threat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely aligned with Lirael’s perceptual signature; diction and metaphors fit the world’s register. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from measured to urgent and back). No head-hopping, and certainty stays within what she can infer. The lyricism is confident without obscuring beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and mostly efficient, with images doing multiple jobs (lens, lattice, loom). Occasional density risks purple tilt and minor redundancy (“radiant hush,” layered light imagery), but clarity holds. Syntax varies and sequencing remains crisp at the climax. No noticeable scaffolding or filter-verb stacks blunt immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Beautician mortician” for celestials, a starlight pool-lens, and moonlight/lullaby stabilization feel fresh and integrated. The turn from extraction to embellishment is inventive and earned by world logic. Emotional truth (craft as care) elevates the conceit beyond surface novelty. Risks are coherent and pay off without gimmickry.</comment>
