<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s duty-driven precision and private hesitation around his mother’s locket create credible, embodied stakes. Micro-choices (re‑lighting the burner, recalibrating the flame, angling at the obsidian’s base) reveal values under pressure. The renunciation at his mother’s niche reads as an Earned Stasis with a felt cost. Interiority stays specific to his craft and history without therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through repeated melting attempts, the draft setback, the obsidian crack, and culminates in the refusal at the locket. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he preserves a path untaken at visible emotional cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and causality is coherent within the ritual logic. The arc tightens once meaningfully around the obsidian and the final renunciation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, starlight fissure, dank air, and calcified niches are vivid and purpose‑driven, not touristic. Environment and tool constrain tactics (draft snuffs flame; starlight angle determines orientation), charging both process and the final image. Sensory detail is balanced (metallic taste, condensation slick, humming bronze). World rules are taught through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are modest but coherent: convert burdens without shattering them, with the mother’s locket as the moral pressure point. Escalation arrives via failure (extinguished flame), resistance (obsidian), and a narrowing at the locket where he chooses refusal with cost. The pressure deepens once rather than multiple turns, fitting the length and lens. No convenient rescues; agency drives outcomes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of transmuting pain into carryable pattern (“weights, not wounds”) emerge organically from craft and image, not moralizing. The final refusal reframes care as boundary setting, complicating salvation as a universal mandate. Recurring objects (lamp, niches, fractals) accrue meaning and reweight the last images. Complexity remains without faux symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical close third maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (“calcified whispers,” “shingled hush”). Diction suits the character’s vocation and the story’s mythic register, with modulated intensity under stress. Quoted lines (mentor, mother) sharpen subtext without hijacking stance. No head‑hopping or unwarranted authority.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, mood) with few redundancies; rhythm varies to match pressure. Some lush metaphors push toward purple but stay coherent and legible (“whalebone reverie” is strange yet consistent with the piece’s idiom). No major loops or scaffold; momentum holds through image‑driven action. Final lines land cleanly without summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The cosmology (fractal weaving, “shingled hush,” orientation by starlight) feels singular and integrated rather than quirky décor. The obsidian crack and the decision to leave the locket fuse craft detail with moral calculus in a fresh way. Risks in diction and concept pay off with clarity. The synthesis feels memorable and non‑derivative.</comment>
