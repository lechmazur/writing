<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clara’s contradictory impulses—skepticism versus wonder—are dramatized through micro‑choices (descending to the tile, choosing to transcribe, keeping it as a talisman). Embodied reactions (“breath fogging,” “heart racing,” “quill a blur”) anchor interiority. Motivation is consistent (seeking reflection) and evolves credibly under pressure from the tile and whalesong. The cost is modest—she softens skepticism—yet earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear within the first lines (who/where/why), and the structure holds a clean single‑scene arc with one descent/return transition. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via whalesong, the tile’s symbols, and memory influx toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Clara’s stance shift and talisman choice; the cost is subtle but legible. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vivid, economical setting work: the open tower on a sea cliff amid whale migration is sensorially grounded and POV‑filtered. The environment charges choices (night sky work, cold, proximity to the cliff) and infuses the final image with meaning. The tile functions as a micro‑setting object, evolving through use to glow and be pocketed. Constraint is more atmospheric than logistical, but it shapes perception and cadence throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to remain purely skeptical or embrace a charged unknown—is clear and intensifies as transcribing escalates memory‑flood pressure. The meaningful tightening arrives when Clara commits to transcription and then to keeping the tile. The price paid (relinquishing certainty) is understated but present; external jeopardy is minimal. Tension is mostly internal and steady rather than sharply escalating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Themes of resilience, inheritance of knowledge, and felt truth versus explanation emerge organically from the tile/Aelia parallels and whalesong motif. Subtext works best in the final constellation image of whales and stars. The line “some truths are best felt, not explained” edges into explicit moralizing, slightly flattening resonance. Overall, meaning accrues more from image than from statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a lyrical, marine‑toned texture; diction and rhythm fit Clara’s sensibility. Psychic distance modulates cleanly under pressure without head‑hopping. Prose confidence matches what she can know; inference reads as inference. The voice sustains mood without overreaching into purple excess.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are clean, varied, and purposeful; sensory details carry multiple jobs (setting, mood, theme). Minimal scaffolding; imagery is generally precise with few clichés. A slight tendency toward lyrical layering risks softness at peak beats but does not obscure clarity. The final image lands without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—astronomy, entangled memory via a tile, and whalesong as unheard symphony—feels fresh even if the core arc (skeptic opening to wonder) is familiar. The Aelia echo adds a credible lineage dimension. Risks are tasteful rather than bold. The piece commits to its premise without late rule changes.</comment>
