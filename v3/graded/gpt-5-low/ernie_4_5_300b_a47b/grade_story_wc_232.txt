<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lila’s motives are clear and character‑specific (loneliness, professional obsession, skepticism vs. yearning), and her micro‑choices (buying the atlas, following ants, touching the chip, stepping through) align. Interiority is textured with concrete memories (father’s shop, mother’s laughter). The internal conflict is present but low‑cost; she faces no credible risk beyond emotional exposure. The final shift reads earned but gentle, with limited visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: map → ants → cavern → chip → vision → reframed choice → return. Orientation is established early (who/where/why), and the single transition (vision garden) is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reinterprets the “doorway of decisions” and alters stance. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional; it lands but remains modest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vivid, economical setting—ants in double lines, ivy‑veiled mouth, bioluminescent fungi, obsidian pedestal—filtered through Lila’s sensibility. Environment guides action (ants’ path, hidden entrance, pedestal as focal constraint) and charges the final image (following the ants home). Sensory detail is purposeful and consistent. Minor reliance on familiar images (“frozen tears”) slightly tempers distinctiveness.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stasis vs. a charged choice) is clear; pressure tightens from pursuit to contact to passage. The decisive deepening occurs when she touches the chip and then steps through the doorway. However, external risk is minimal, and no option is forcefully foreclosed beyond an internal stance shift. The visible price paid is primarily internal and soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Images (maps, ants, chip, doorway) echo and reweight at the end to argue for self‑navigation and earned choice. The final paragraph’s articulation (“not a place to escape but a mirror”) edges into stated thesis rather than fully letting the images carry it. Still, the sunflower garden and return march create a resonant aftereffect. Thematic complexity is honest but safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a steady lyrical timbre; diction suits a meticulous map dealer. Brief dialogue in the vision reads natural and subtextual. Rhythm modulates well between discovery and reflection without head‑hopping. No gratuitous withholding or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is clear, paced, and image‑dense with mostly precise verbs and nouns. Occasional familiar metaphors and light synonym echoes appear but don’t stall momentum. Information density is strong; sentences do more than one job. The final image is crisp and not dulled by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: antique cartography meets a type‑foundry matrix as portal key, with ants as guiding logic and a reframed “doorway of decisions.” The portal trope is familiar, but specificity (letter molds, printer’s phrase) gives it texture. The turn to “cartographer of her own heart” is slightly safe yet earned. Overall, distinctive without radical risk.</comment>
