<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s skepticism and curiosity drive credible choices, and her embodied reactions (“throat tightened,” “hand trembled”) keep her human under pressure. The relationship with Elias functions as a crucible that complicates and then redirects her plan. The shift toward forgiveness feels earned but a touch tidy. A clearer on‑page cost for the sacrifice would have deepened the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Causal with a clean RR/CR closure. Beats link well: intention to use the tooth → Elias’s counter‑frame and second tooth → deliberate paired placement → fountain flows → conceptual repricing (“mirror”). Orientation is crisp from the opening and props don’t teleport. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the before/after is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hedge maze, crumbling fountain, and bone‑setter’s tools are tactile and filtered through Mara’s priorities. The garden’s rules (sacrifice, teeth as bridges) charge the final image and subtly constrain options. Sensory selection and atmosphere support tone without stalling momentum. Slightly more spatial pressure from the maze during the act itself could have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reconcile the garden’s uncertainty and the wound of Elias’s absence. Elias’s arrival is the key tightening that redefines the tactic (two teeth, not one). Resolution stems from Mara’s agency, but the price paid reads mostly as insight rather than a concrete loss. The conflict resolves smoothly; an added friction point would heighten consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motifs (teeth, bone‑setting, fountain) accrue into a coherent meditation on certainty, sacrifice, and forgiveness. However, explicit theme statements (“The garden’s not a trick… it’s a mirror”; “forgiveness wasn’t…”) edge into didactic, softening the subtext. The final image is resonant, if slightly explained. More implication over declaration would increase afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady and apt; the lyrical narration matches Mara’s perceptual bias without slipping into omniscience. Dialogue feels lived‑in and moves the scene with subtext (“bridge, but not to the fae. To us.”). Rhythm varies and supports pressure. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry dual duty—world and emotion—without puff. Imagery (ivy and honeysuckle hum, moss‑choked basin) is vivid but controlled, with minimal redundancy. A few abstractions near the end edge toward summary, yet clarity and momentum hold. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Combining bone‑setting as metaphoric method with changeling teeth as bridges is fresh, and the maze/garden as mirror reframes folklore smartly. The return of the missing friend at the hinge is familiar but executed with specificity. Emotional truth lands without gimmickry. A bolder cost or rule consequence would push it into the exceptional tier.</comment>
