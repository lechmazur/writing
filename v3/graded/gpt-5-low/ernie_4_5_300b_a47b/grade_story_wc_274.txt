<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lirael’s motivation is clear—her duty to the archive versus her need to expose suppressed truth—and her choice to revive Kael emerges credibly from that tension. Interiority is embodied (“ice crystals bloomed… cracking like a whispered secret”), and she makes concrete micro‑choices under pressure (sliding the letter into the panel, stepping back as fog forms). The internal conflict is present on the page rather than summarized, though some phrasing trends generic (“the truth matters”). Kael is sketched efficiently but remains reactive, limiting relationship dynamism.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the beats chain cleanly: contraband letter → archival crisis → activation → awakening → pact. Closure lands as a charged poise: they unite with the letter in hand, naming the cost (“The Council would come”). The cost is mostly projected rather than paid on the page, keeping the ending strong but not exceptional. Orientation is clear early, and scope remains within a single, coherent scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The “echoing library under snow” is vivid and sustained, with cold, glass, fog, and nitrogen shaping atmosphere. The cryo‑chamber and frosted glass integrate with action, charging images at the turn and ending. However, the environment seldom constrains tactics beyond mood and proximity; choices would be similar in another cold facility. Strong specificity without true constraint keeps this just below the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are legible—expose the truth at the risk of Council reprisal—and pressure coheres as she contravenes her role. Escalation occurs at the activation/awakening, narrowing options and prompting a public stance. The cost is asserted rather than dramatized (no immediate breach or consequence), softening the felt price. Still, agency drives the turn, and the final pact tightens the line of conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of censorship, institutional memory, and moral courage are integrated through concrete actions (revival as civil disobedience). Yet the piece leans on stated thesis moments—“Because the truth matters” and “the revolution began”—which flatten subtext. The most resonant image is the thawing chamber reweighting “frozen truths,” but the ending explains its meaning instead of trusting image. Complexity is present but undercut by near‑moralizing closure lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is steady and controlled with a consistent close third to Lirael; narrative certainty stays within her ken. Prose rhythm is measured and suits the hush; dialogue is sparse but functional, with Kael’s rough “Why?” doing clean work. Some diction edges toward stock lyricism and repetition (“dizzying quiet,” reiterated snow/echo motifs), slightly flattening distinctiveness under stress. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentences are generally clear and paced to scene needs, with a few strong images (ice cracking like a “whispered secret”). There’s mild redundancy and purple tilt (“bravely conflicted,” repeated tone labels, forecasted revolution), and a tendency to tell what the images could carry. Momentum holds, but trimming summary declarations would sharpen impact. Line‑level variety is decent though not striking.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The archivist‑revives‑radical premise is familiar; freshness comes from the snow‑bound library and the letter as literal key. The final pact image has integrity but no surprising reweighting beyond expected rebellion stakes. Emotional truth is earnest, yet risk stays moderate with several template beats and phrases. A more idiosyncratic ethical wrinkle or immediate consequence would elevate originality.</comment>
