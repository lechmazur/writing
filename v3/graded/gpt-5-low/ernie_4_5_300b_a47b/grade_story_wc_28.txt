<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias’s paradox (“gentle radical,” “aberrant mercy”) is clear, embodied by the tactile act of fitting the tessera. Interiority is vivid and specific (ash/ozone, artisan vision) and his choices align with motive. Internal conflict is more stated than dramatized, with little on‑page resistance beyond memory. The cost is largely conceptual—accepting loss—rather than a pressured sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and motifs (tessera, waves, shattered sky) build to a charged reconfiguration in the final cadence. Orientation is clean early; single scene; the act of “renaming” lands as closure. The cost (he cannot undo the fire; he renames instead) is legible but quiet. Stakes remain mostly symbolic, limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is beautifully specific—the plaza, minaret ruin, ash and ozone, shattered sky—filtered through Elias’s gaze. The tessera functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the ending. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it shapes meaning and tone throughout. Consistency and integration are high without feeling touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reframe/rename the plaza) is signaled and culminates in the placement of the tessera. Escalation is a deepening rather than a tightening; the retrocognitive visions intensify resolve. There’s little external opposition or trade‑off beyond relinquishing the wish to undo. The final choice is earned but not tested under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation versus erasure coheres through objects and acts; the last image reweights memory as an act of mercy. The artisan/daughter vision grounds the philosophy in particulars. A few lines verge on thesis (“He would rename the city”), but the closure returns to image rather than moral. Resonance lingers without neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythms modulate well. Diction is consistent with the character’s sensibility; no head‑hopping. Occasional abstractions repeat (“warm coldness”) but do not muddy perspective. Compression feels intentional and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑dense, and mostly efficient; strong nouns and verbs with minimal scaffolding. Some phrases flirt with purple or redundancy, but momentum holds and figurative logic remains consistent. Sentences vary and carry multiple jobs. The final line pays off motif without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, a shattered sky, and ceremonial “renaming” via a tessera feels fresh and cohesive. The quiet, ritualistic closure avoids genre templates. Risk is measured rather than flashy, but the object‑driven reconfiguration is memorable. A bolder on‑page complication could have pushed it higher.</comment>
