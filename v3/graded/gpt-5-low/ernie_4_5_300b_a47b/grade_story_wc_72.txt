<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (grandmother/blight) is clear and her fear-to-resolve progression is credible, especially at the pedestal and when she chooses to drink. Lumen’s “incisively kind” guidance provides a distinct relational pressure without stealing POV. Internal contradiction is present but light—she drinks relatively quickly, with limited embodied hesitation beyond the “trembling” and breath hitch. A touch more visible cost or doubt at the sip would deepen character change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: arrival → Lumen’s guidance → exploit structural weakness → ampoule → revelations → decision to drink → visible world response. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (she drinks) and a Conceptual Repricing (catalyst over cure; sacrifice reframed). Cost is present (risking poison/self) though the scene doesn’t linger on consequences. Orientation is crisp early, and the causal lens holds through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater garden is vividly rendered and constrains action (silted cracks, algae, diver suit, pressure at the pedestal). World rules are learned through action—structural weakness, bioluminescent cues, and the lab reveal. The environment recharges the ending (fountains restart, coral brightens, garden “breathes”). Detail is selective and purposive rather than postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent and escalates: find and access the ampoule, learn the truth, decide whether to ingest. The “structural weakness” beat is a meaningful tightening; the drink is an earned peak choice. The price is implied (bodily risk, reframed lineage) rather than viscerally felt. Still, the conflict deepens rather than resets, and resolution stems from Mara’s agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of nuance versus certainty emerges from particulars (guardian telepathy by impression, catalyst-not-cure, sacrifice reframed) and culminates in a charged final image. The line “To welcome nuance into a certainty” toes on-the-nose but remains diegetic and supported by events. The grandmother’s transformation and the garden-as-lab reweight prior material without didactic moralizing. Resonance lingers in the choice to keep the garden hidden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and apt; Lumen’s telepathy is conveyed as impressions that suit the voice. Diction is lyrical but controlled, with modulation at key beats. No head-hopping or withheld-known info; compression serves momentum. A slight tendency toward elevated register remains coherent with the fable-like mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient; images like “liquid starlight” and “bioluminescent algae” carry weight without clogging. Minimal scaffolding and clean sentence rhythm maintain propulsion. A few phrases verge on purple, but they don’t muddle sense or stall causality. The final paragraphs crystallize without synonym loops or template cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The living obsidian guardian, foxglove ampoule, and underwater lab frame feel fresh in synthesis. Cascading revelations are grounded in tactile action rather than summary. The “catalyst not cure” and “incisively kind” guardian add non-obvious angles. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off in a distinctive closing image.</comment>
