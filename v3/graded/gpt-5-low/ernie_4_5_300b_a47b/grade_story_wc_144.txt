<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s competence, tactile “seeing,” and earned trust in the basin give her specificity, and her mentor dynamic with Marlow adds credible pressure. Motivation is clear (get HB‑7 flightworthy for launch), with embodied actions that align. Internal contradiction is faint—“she needed more” gestures toward strain, but there’s little simultaneous push‑pull beyond craft focus. The closing endurance choice (returning to work) reads earned, if emotionally restrained.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: damaged drone → diagnostic via water → patch and recalibrate → test flight → ship ascends with drones. Orientation is crisp early; the basin method is taught and then paid off. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the ship departs; Lira recommits to the ongoing cost of the work. The cost is modest (labor/endurance rather than a hard trade‑off), keeping it short of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and integrated: mist, chains, anchor lift, and especially the basin as a tool that constrains—and enables—choice. The basin refracts light to reveal faults and recurs at the end, charging the final image and Lira’s ethos. Spatial and sensory choreography are clear and POV‑filtered through touch and sound. Strong economy, no museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (make HB‑7 mission‑ready before launch) is clear; a single tightening occurs when the problem proves deeper than a patch, requiring recalibration guided by water‑mapped oscillations. Pressure escalates coherently but gently, with no major reversal or visible sacrifice beyond time/attention. Resolution arises from Lira’s agency, not coincidence. The clock (dawn/launch) is present but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of alternate “seeing,” trust in embodied craft, and mentorship surface organically through the basin method and Lira’s sensory focus. The lullaby and mist‑softened depot create a non‑didactic emotional aftereffect; “Listening’s a kind of seeing” hints subtext more than states a moral. The final charged poise—ongoing work lit by dawn—reweights prior images without sermonizing. Slight tidiness and comfort limit complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Close third with a distinct perceptual signature (vibration/heat, sound of chains) remains stable and apt. Prose cadence modulates with the task; dialogue is spare, functional, and character‑distinct (Marlow’s gravel vs. Lira’s tactile focus). No head‑hopping or register drift. Lyric touches serve voice without obscuring action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean, economical lines with purposeful lyricism (“mist clung… like a second skin,” “iridescence flashing like liquid sunlight”) that do multiple jobs. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; syntax varies and pacing matches the scene’s calm precision. Figurative language remains coherent and grounded in the world logic. Final line rings and recycles motifs without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind artisan decoding fault patterns via water refraction to ready hummingbird drones for a storm‑piercing ship—feels fresh and cohesive. The basin method is a distinctive, character‑driven innovation, not a gimmick. Risks are modest but intentional, yielding a memorable micro‑world. The conflict frame is conventional, which limits it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
