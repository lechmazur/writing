<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific—she wants to translate texture into sound—and her tactics evolve under pressure from observation to risky activation to renunciation. The fear of oblivion surfaces credibly at the peak and reframes her earlier rigor. The final act (throwing the diamond) is an earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor ding: internal contradiction could be threaded earlier, not only revealed at the crisis.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal drive is clean: preparation → test → activation → backlash → realization → decisive discard. Orientation is crisp from the opening and never drifts; the canyon/diamond system pays off on the page. Closure lands with cost (burn, near fall, and loss of the tool/mission) and a conceptual repricing of the “curse as mirror.” The scene holds one dominant stake and closes the before/after boundary definitively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally integrated: echoes distort data, towers resonate and glow, bone surfaces and ledges tangibly affect action. The canyon’s acoustics shape tactics and impose price, charging the final image as it swallows the diamond. Detail selection stays POV-filtered and purposeful. The environment is inseparable from conflict and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently: long study → controlled attempt → momentary mastery → canyon’s counterforce → forced trade-off. The decisive narrowing is clear when the echoes threaten to drown her and the diamond burns, making the discard the only survivable choice. Internal stakes (oblivion) and external threat interlock at the climax. Slight melodrama in the shouted line, but the cost remains legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of language, loss, and translation reconfigure at the end: the curse as mirror, and “felt, not spoken” as a non-literal answer. Recurring images (veins, runes, echoes, birds) accrue meaning and shift at closure. The declaration “I am the extinction!” edges on overt thesis, softening subtlety a touch. Overall resonance lingers and invites re-reading without collapsing into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person close holds steady, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sound and texture. Diction and rhythm modulate under stress (the hum, the stilling, the roar) without head-hopping or register slips. Occasional heightened lines feel earned by the mode. Dialogue is minimal but functional and voice-consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid yet controlled figurative choices; images (molten ore skin, fractal tableau) are coherent and purposeful. Minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops; rhythm varies to match pressure. A few lush metaphors risk purple but do not blur causality or the closure image. Copy is clean and prop states track.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—acoustic linguistics via birds and a flawed diamond in a canyon of echoes—feels singular and necessary. The curse-as-language mirror reweights the piece in a non-obvious, earned way. Risks in worldbuilding and lyric mode heighten stakes without sacrificing clarity. The ending’s conceptual turn reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
