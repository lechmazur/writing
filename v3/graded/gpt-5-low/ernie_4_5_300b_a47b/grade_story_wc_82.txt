<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she crafts a lantern to hold her brother’s last words and to transmute grief. Interiority is embodied (trembling fingers, “brittle as winter ice” laugh) and actions align with motive. A credible endurance choice lands at the peak (“letting the pain wash over her”). Minor aphoristic lines flirt with neatness but remain earned by scene pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: polishing → installation → recording → cranes stir → shadow confrontation → poised aftermath. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the closure occurs on the page with cost: she faces the shadow and chooses stance, paying in “luminous torment.” The before/after is legible (flee vs transform), with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. No causality gaps or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: floating tea garden, glass basilica that descends/ascends, bioluminescent moss, lavender smoke. Tools and place charge the final image (lantern’s light, basilica shedding shards, cranes flying to spires). Sensory selection tracks POV craft and grief; world rules are learned by observation, not dumped. The environment materially reweights meaning at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform grief into durable light; face the shadow) is signaled and tightened. The key deepening is the dream recording’s painful swell leading to a live test when the shadow reenters and she chooses to meet it. Cost is visible (pain, trembling, relinquishing avoidance), and resolution is earned by her agency. Pressure coheres without overreliance on coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-through-bearing rather than shedding is dramatized via craft and final stance; motifs (lanterns, cranes, descend/ascend) reweight at the end. Subtext operates through image (cranes finally fly when grief is made light). A few thesis‑adjacent lines (“Dreams are just grief with wings”; “This was her magic…”) tread close to telling but are supported by event. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in craft metaphors and tactile detail. POV remains stable and confident; brief dialogue lines carry weight without breaking diction. Rhythm modulates well under pressure, avoiding committee voice. Minor flourish risk never obscures clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do double duty (world + emotion). Figurative language is abundant but coherent and targeted; no pattern artifacts or loops dull momentum. Syntax varies and supports propulsion toward the confrontation. A few aphoristic turns skim the edge of purple but do not blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: dream‑recording lanterns, a basilica that descends while ascending, and a floating tea garden serve a grief‑alchemy premise. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (polishing method → recording pain → cranes animate → stance with shadow). Risks in worldbuilding and diction heighten stakes without gimmickry. The final image recharges the system with originality.</comment>
