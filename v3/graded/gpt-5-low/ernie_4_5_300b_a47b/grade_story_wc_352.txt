<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—hunting “seeds of vigilance” via marginalia—drives concrete choices under time pressure. Interiority is vivid and particular (“prism‑minded archivist,” tactile tracing of grooves), with embodied fear during inversion. However, contradiction is light; she rarely wavers or pays a visible personal price beyond hurry and risk. The identity shift to “keeper of thresholds” is credible but lightly earned emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: clock → tunnels → manuscript → threshold/inversion → map → key → exit, with clear anchors early. Closure lands as a decisive change (she acquires a unique key and reframes her role), and the rule of inversion is taught and paid off. Cost is modest (time pressure and risk without loss), slightly reducing impact. The single‑scene structure is coherent and legible throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto, mist, and inversion mechanics are sensorial and functional, constraining movement (forks, low ceiling) and tactics (navigating by threshold effects). Recurring objects (watch, manuscript, key) are integrated with place, and the glow guides choices. World rules feel consistent and learned through action. Minor restraint on 9+ because the environment’s cost is felt but not punishing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the chamber and retrieve what the margins promise before gravity flips—is clear and escalates with the inversion beat. The threshold effect reweights options (ceiling becomes floor; map appears), a meaningful deepening. The price paid is primarily urgency and disorientation; no hard trade‑off or loss. Resolution stems from her agency, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ideas of vigilance, margins, and thresholds are braided through objects and actions, culminating in her redefined role. The “not in grand gestures, but in the margins” line verges on explicit moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the manuscript’s reweighting and the warm key create a resonant, earned image. Ambiguity remains productively open without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third with a distinct perceptual signature (lexicon dovetailing with her archival mind and the grotto’s strangeness). Rhythm modulates well around the inversion beat without head‑hopping or stance drift. No dialogue to test, but narrative diction remains controlled. Occasional elevated phrasing fits the chosen lyric atmosphere.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and purposeful; the watch, glow, and carvings do double duty. Minimal scaffolding and good propulsion through tight paragraphs. A few purple touches (“clandestinely luminous,” “latent blaze”) flirt with overrichness but remain coherent. Syntax varies to match tension without muddling action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archival marginalia as navigational magic, a timed gravity inversion, and thresholds as literal mechanism and theme. The guardian trope edges familiar, but execution feels specific to Lira’s methods and the grotto’s rules. Turns feel earned from established particulars. It’s inventive without gimmickry.</comment>
