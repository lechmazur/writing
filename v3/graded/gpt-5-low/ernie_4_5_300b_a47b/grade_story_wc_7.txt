<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (to coax beauty from ruin) is clear and embodied in her tactile pruning choices under pressure. The memory floods create a credible push‑pull between trauma and gentleness that guides her tactics. Internal conflict is present but relatively safe—she meets resistance, yet the plant yields without a thornier moral cost. Still, the micro‑choices (which cuts to keep; rejecting violent lineages) feel specific and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative: the scene tightens as the celestial alignment crests and her pruning reweights the plant’s essence. Closure lands via a charged poise/CR—new bud, future vision, and Elara’s plan book—showing a before/after. Cost is present (overwhelm, exhaustion, years of preparation) but not deeply biting. Orientation is clean and the one‑scene container holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse, violet light, and tools filter through Elara’s sensory priorities and directly shape action. The environment constrains tactics (shears, glass, alignment light through panes) and charges the final image of soft gold. Details are purposeful and avoid catalogue sightseeing. A slight bias toward visual textures is offset by tactile soil and embodied handling.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repattern the plant toward beauty) is signaled early and escalates as pruning intensifies during the alignment. The main tightening comes when she rejects traumatic memory paths and commits to gentler growth. The plant’s “resistance” is declared more than dramatized, so the price feels modest. Nonetheless, agency drives the turn and the alignment peak ties to the bud’s emergence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of gentle rebellion, restorative creation, and redirected memory arise from pruning choices and the final community sketches. Some phrasing skirts thesis‑statement territory (“All it took…”) which blunts subtext. Still, the closing image reweights the preceding cuts as moral stance rather than mere horticulture. Resonance lingers even if a note of moralizing intrudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is steady, tactile, and modulated with pressure; scientific diction (“synaptic plasticity”) integrates without jar. Rhythm tightens during the alignment peak and softens after, matching emotional contour. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Minor explanatory lines edge toward helpful narrator but do not break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clear and purposeful with strong verbs and sensory anchors; repetition is minimal and generally functional. Occasional elevated abstractions and concept labels risk purple edges but remain controlled. Momentum holds through pruning beats into the bud reveal. The final cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—chef who tastes memories using pruning as neuro‑rewiring under a cosmic clock—feels fresh and coherent. The knowledge fruit’s future‑memory turn is a non‑obvious but earned lift. Emotional truth (choosing gentleness under pressure) grounds the novelty. Risk is taken without obscuring clarity.</comment>
