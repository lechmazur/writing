<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motives (debt, rumor‑driven desperation, “cure for loneliness”) are specific and embodied; his jocularity under stress and the moment he swallows a joke reveal interior contradiction. Agency is shared—Lira often leads—and his background (logistician) doesn’t materially constrain choices on the page. Still, his decision to bring and offer the rock, then speak to the ghost, aligns actions with motive. The end registers a modest earned shift (ache eased; jocularity as bridge), though the price feels light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: rumor → meeting → placement of moon rock → manifestation → conceptual reframing. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: loneliness recoded as “language,” and Elias’s felt change plus the surrendered rock provide cost. The Hybrid drive leans Accumulative at the end and holds. Minor softness: the negotiation’s success feels easy, with little narrowing of options before the ghost appears.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, selective details (ivy “second heartbeat,” moss‑carpeted platform, tracks vanishing) create lived atmosphere and mirror the loneliness theme without overstatement. The station/ivy are not mere backdrop; they house and signal the ghost (ivy shivers) and locate the lever where the catalyst is placed. Environmental logic remains consistent and spatially coherent. The setting pressures mood and action but only lightly constrains choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: “cure for loneliness.” The meaningful tightening arrives when the rock keens and the ghost interrogates motive, but the scene pays a relatively low visible price to achieve reconfiguration. Elias’s agency (offering, speaking) earns the turn, though Lira engineers much of the plan. Tension is steady rather than ratcheting; potential failure feels faint.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reciprocity and rumor chains knit theme to action, and the final repricing (“loneliness is a language”) reweights the premise in a resonant way. However, the conductor’s explicit articulation borders on thematic statement, reducing subtext. The moon rock’s transformation into connection imagery earns emotional aftereffect without sentimentality. Ambiguity remains purposeful: a conversation catalyzed, not a cure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent single‑POV with a distinct perceptual signature (wry, tactile noticing). Dialogue carries subtext and function (“rumor chain’s fraying”; “polite anarchy”) and differentiates voices (Lira’s mischievous precision vs. Elias’s guarded humor). Rhythm modulates effectively as the keening begins. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and image‑rich with good sentence variety; lines often do double duty (world + psychology). Figurative language is vivid but mostly precise; a few stacked metaphors flirt with density without tipping into purple. Momentum holds with minimal scaffold. The final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: disaster‑relief fixer, rumor ecology, lunar reciprocity, and a station ghost as loneliness sink. The “catalyst” conceit becomes thematic and procedural, not a gimmick. Risks (mythic science + haunt) cohere and pay off. Mild conventionality in the clean success of the ritual keeps it shy of exceptional.</comment>
