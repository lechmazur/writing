<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (truth excavation) is clear and consistent, and her investigative competence drives choices. Interiority is particular (pattern-thinking, tactile puzzle work) but the internal contradiction at the peak (“hesitated” before the pedestal) is brief and lightly priced. The final renunciation (giving up the diamond/power) feels earned but its personal cost could be sharper. No relationship crucible on-page limits complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: orchard anomalies → cottage letters → stillpoint concept → alignment in clearing → chamber reveal → sealing choice. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the closure is an on‑page decisive change with world consequences. Slight convenience in the chamber opening and the two‑diamond mechanic is accepted because it’s foreshadowed by the “keyed”/flawed distinction. Cost is present but a touch conceptual rather than felt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vivid and functional: dust storms, radioactive grit, leaning trees, and symbol‑scored soil shape action and legibility. The diamond/object-as-setting and the etched ground markings constrain tactics at the clearing. Sensory selection matches Mara’s priorities, with strong economy. Not quite 9‑band because environment rarely forces a hard trade beyond the chamber mechanics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain the stillpoint before boundary collapse) is signaled early and tightens through discovery to an action that forecloses a path. The decoy revelation deepens pressure and reframes options; Mara’s choice resolves with consequence. The felt price to Mara remains modest, keeping tension just short of the highest band. No coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of dismantling “comfortable lies” versus embracing costly truth emerges through investigative action and the final sealing. The orchard’s unnatural fertility versus moral hazard carries subtext, and the flawed/true diamond pair refracts the idea of sacrifice. The closing sentence explicitly states the theme, nudging toward moralizing and softening resonance. Ambiguity around Crane adds a useful aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable, selective, and character‑bound; voice carries a crisp investigative cadence with controlled lyricism. Diction suits a pragmatic, pattern‑driven mind without register slips. Compression through summary (letters) stays purposeful. No dialogue is needed and none is missed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, propulsive, and image‑rich without purple excess; metaphors (“miniature suns,” “stillpoint”) align with world logic. Information density is high and scaffolding is minimal. Rhythm varies appropriately through discovery and climax. Minor familiar phrases (“felt like a pattern worth unraveling”) are outweighed by specificity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Post‑apocalyptic orchard plus physics‑adjacent “stillpoint” and diamond key offers a fresh synthesis delivered through investigative noir texture. The decoy/true diamond twist is earned and not merely clever. Emotional calculus is solid though not groundbreaking. Overall, distinctive but not radically innovative.</comment>
