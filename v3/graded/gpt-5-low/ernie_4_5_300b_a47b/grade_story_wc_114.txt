<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich, embodied interiority and a credible contradiction between quantified logic and felt weather drive her choice to leave. Micro‑choices (sneaking into the office, smudging roots deeper, taking the illustration) reveal values under pressure. The cost—abandoning status and role—is legible. Minor abstraction (“she was the lie’s keeper”) slightly flattens an otherwise specific psychology.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: discovery of the QUARANTINE file tightens pressure and motivates the decisive departure; closure lands with cost through renunciation. Orientation is swift and clean; the two‑shard structure (station → village) resolves to a single closure unit. The institutional cover‑up is mostly implied, but the on‑page beats suffice for earned change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The mountain station and aurora are vivid and purposeful, their fragility and weather charging choice and final image. The environment constrains tactics (crumbling mountain, quarantine) and supplies the pressure she refuses. Details are filtered through her professional gaze without becoming touristic. Strong sensory weave supports tone and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs institutional denial/self‑preservation) is clear; pressure tightens with the file’s reveal and culminates in leaving. The escalation is primarily internal, but the external beat (quarantine evidence) credibly forces stance. Lack of on‑page confrontation trims edge, yet the renunciation reads earned with a felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of certainty vs resilience emerges through the bearberry/margins motif and reweights at the end via the herbalist’s line. The final image offers a resonant answer—anchoring rather than quantifying—without spelling a moral. A couple of explicit theses are stated, but the imagery does most of the work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature (technical lexicon braided with sensuous noticing). POV is stable and plausible; elision is purposeful and paid off. Diction modulates with pressure, rarely slipping into grandiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet mostly efficient; images often do double duty and momentum holds. A few purple clusters and conceptual repeats (“swallowed truth,” “lie’s keeper,” “auroral sorrow”) slightly over‑announce. Rhythm and syntax vary with scene needs, and the final cadence lands clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—fault‑tolerant oracle, botanical margins, auroral weather—feels specific and memorable. Turns grow from prior particulars rather than gimmickry. The institutional cover‑up frame is familiar, but the botany and “occupying margins” inflection freshen it.</comment>
