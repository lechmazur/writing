<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (explaining absences, “obituaries for the living”) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (kneeling, not speaking, writing, following the thread) align. Interiority is textured through sensory attention rather than therapy-speak. However, contradictory impulses under pressure are muted; she rarely faces a live trade-off. The change at the end feels more like gentle repricing than a costed renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: thread → projection → encounter → repriced understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt, if gentle, cost (“lonesome splendor,” ache, acceptance). Orientation is clean early, and the single-scene frame holds. The price is modest and the apparition’s arrival is convenient, but the ending cadence is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden and the “ghost weft” are vivid, multi-sensory, and POV-filtered; the thread functions as object-as-setting and charges the final image (her hand lingering, twilight glow). World rules (the thread’s memory) are taught through action and remain consistent. Details evolve with the moment (jasmine scent during the vision), and space guides her choices. Slight lyric overlayering aside, specificity is strong and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on retrieving meaning from absence, but pressure remains low; the apparition appears without Elara risking or losing much. The meaningful tightening is the presence/vanish beat, which reweights her goal rather than foreclosing options. No antagonistic force tests her resolve, and cost is mostly tonal. Escalation is gentle but coherent for this mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme—presence within absence, healing as geography—emerges through recurring images (thread, garden, parchment) and the silent encounter. The final understanding reweights earlier material, but a few lines state the thesis outright (“explained absences were not endings but beginnings”), edging toward moralizing. Subtext works best in the unsaid exchange and the tactility of the thread. Resonance lingers, though complexity is slightly flattened by explicit statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyric third-person limited voice with controlled distance; diction suits Elara’s sensibility. Rhythm varies and modulates at the apparition, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature via tactile noticing and metaphor. Elevated register feels earned, if occasionally lush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with good momentum and multi-tasking sentences; sensory texture is deft. Some purple redundancy and slogan-like phrasing recur (“lonesome splendor,” repeated thesis lines), slightly dulling impact. Figurative density rarely muddies clarity and mechanics are clean. Trimming a few overt restatements would sharpen cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise of writing obituaries for the living and the “ghost weft” is fresh and unified with the mode. The intimate, nonverbal encounter and object-charged closure feel particular rather than templated. Risk is moderate but coherent; the piece commits to a quiet, accumulative design. Not radically innovative, yet notably singular in image-system and vocation.</comment>
