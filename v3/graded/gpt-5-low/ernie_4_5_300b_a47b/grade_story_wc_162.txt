<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—understanding her father’s codes and the maze’s drift—drives concrete choices (kneeling to read grain, following patterns, writing her own code). Interiority is embodied and specific (“feeling the grain shift,” “intuition prickled”), with a credible mix of longing and resolve. The father’s brief appearance crystallizes the relational stake without overexplaining. A slight neatness in her realization (“The fog lifts when you stop searching”) softens the sense of contradictory impulses under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of prisms, grain, and codes coheres to a charged closure: writing a new code summons a door, she steps through, and refuses to look back. Orientation is clean from the outset; the terrace and cornfield are legible and consistent. The cost registers as a relinquishment of the terrace and the search itself. Causality is poetic but traceable: observation → decoding → authored code → threshold.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prism terrace and the cornfield are vivid, tactile, and rule-bearing (alignment reveals a path; following grain alters navigation). Environmental specifics guide tactics, and the “fractured hush” tones the scene and recharges the final image. World rules (codes mapping change, drifting terrace) remain internally consistent. The recurring logbook and prisms function as micro‑settings that constrain choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes (find truth/father; reframe thresholds) tighten as the terrace aligns, she descends, interprets patterns, and authors a code that forces a step with cost. The visible price is the renunciation embedded in “not meant to be revisited” and the terrace’s disappearance. Pressure is internal but coherent and escalates once decisively. A more explicit risk of failure or competing pull could have intensified the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of sacred thresholds, necessary distance, and authorship of meaning arise from concrete acts (analyzing grain, choosing to stop searching, writing codes). The final page filling with her codes offers a resonant answer about agency and repricing of rules. A few lines flirt with thesis statements (“Sacred spaces are not places but gaps”), but they’re integrated via action. The emotional aftereffect is quiet, earned, and avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (materials, codes, pattern‑seeing). Diction is elevated but consistent and plausible for the piece’s tone; dialogue is spare and purposeful. Psychic distance holds steady through pressure. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience appears.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly economical; lines often do double duty (worldbuilding and character at once). A few metaphoric pushes risk purple (“featherly determined,” “fractured hush”) but remain coherent and motif‑bonded. Rhythm varies, and momentum carries through to the door and beyond. No scaffold loops or clarity slips mar the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—drifting prism terrace, weather codes as change‑maps, wood‑grain as navigation, thresholds as gaps—feels fresh and specific. Turns grow from established motifs, with the authored code as a non‑obvious but inevitable act. The piece takes stylistic risks without losing clarity. Only slight familiarity in “butterfly effect” nomenclature tempers the novelty.</comment>
