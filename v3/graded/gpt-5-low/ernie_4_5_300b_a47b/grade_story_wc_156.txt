<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marisol’s curiosity and “methodically playful” temperament drive the action, with tactile choices (dish angle, nickel placement, whisper) revealing character under pressure. Interiority is present and specific (grandfather’s lullaby, attention to pigments), though internal contradiction is modest. The relationship with Dr. Lysander adds a light crucible but applies limited pressure. The final stance shift (embracing curiosity) feels earned but carries a soft, mostly conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural; pattern density increases (hum → shimmer → dancers → flapper → lullaby) and reweights the stake from technical experiment to personal awakening. Causal links are clean: aligning frequencies + nickel’s surface = mural memory. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with the “next pause” charged as a chosen posture. The cost is primarily conceptual (forsaking certainty), which is felt but not deeply dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vivid and rule-consistent; its acoustics and tools (concave dish, fractal chime) meaningfully constrain tactics. Sensory details balance sound and sight, filtered through a restorer’s eye. The environment charges the final image (waiting for the next pause in that garden-state). World logic is absorbed through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (awaken the mural’s secret) is clear, with a meaningful deepening when the awakening folds back to her grandfather. Escalation is more revelatory than adversarial; tension builds through discovery rather than threat. The decisive tightening is the harmonization moment; after that, pressure eases quickly. A clearer on‑page cost or foreclosed option would lift stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of curiosity vs certainty and “nested awakenings” emerge organically via object, setting, and action. Some explicit thesis lines (“Certainty is a cage”) blunt subtlety even as they resonate. The final posture—waiting for the next pause—reweights prior images without didactic over-explanation. Emotional aftertaste is reflective and coherent with the premise.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close remains steady, with distinct textures for Marisol’s perception and Lysander’s clipped, conceptual speech. Dialogue advances plot and reveals stakes without clunky exposition, though Lysander’s explanation edges toward lecture once. Rhythm modulates well across activation and denouement. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is controlled, sensory-rich, and purposeful; key lines compress multiple jobs (“pigments mixed from crushed minerals and dreams”). Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops; cadence supports the accumulative build. A few abstract statements appear, but clarity and momentum hold. Figurative language remains coherent and in character.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound engineering as magic, a hobo nickel as acoustic prism, restoration as awakening—feels fresh and particular. Turns arise from established tools and habits rather than late rule changes. The flapper mirror beat and lullaby reweight the premise memorably. Risk is measured and integrated without gimmickry.</comment>
