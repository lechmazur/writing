<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motives are coherent and character‑specific—the net‑mender/philosopher who attends to “hidden effort”—and his micro‑choices (following the whistle, using the whisk to trace rhythm) reveal him well. Interiority is textured and embodied through work and sensory attention. However, internal contradiction and felt cost remain modest; the epiphany lands a touch tidy without a competing impulse or sacrifice on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp (who/where/when established immediately), and the scene accumulates toward a Conceptual Repricing closure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The shift from literal moon‑path following to pattern‑as‑ethos is clean, and the whisk‑as‑interface clarifies the turn. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping the ending resonant but soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The whispering parapet after rain, harbor, mist, and fireflies are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Kael’s sensibility; sensory detail is rich yet purposeful. The setting enables the vantage and the acoustics that drive discovery, and the recurring whisk charges the final image. It stops short of constraining a hard choice, but it decisively colors and channels the action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around perceiving and answering a pattern—he hears, follows, decodes, replies—creating one meaningful deepening. Stakes are intellectual/spiritual, and escalation is gentle; no option is foreclosed beyond a long vigil. The cost is implied attention and endurance, not a sharper trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—beauty as hidden labor and the holiness of unseen stitches—emerges organically from action and image (net mending → firefly code → whisk tracing light). The final comprehension reweights earlier particulars without stating a moral, though one line edges toward essay (“To appreciate hidden effort…”). Subtext lives in the dialogue of sounds and inherited craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly rooted in Kael’s tactile, craft‑shaped attention; diction and rhythm modulate with quiet pressure. POV is stable and modest in certainty, with inference presented as inference. No dialogue required; the whistled “conversation” reads as action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: varied syntax, concrete verbs, and images that pull double duty (moonlight as threads; net mending echoing pattern‑seeking). Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains coherent, with minimal redundancy. The final line lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A net‑mender philosopher decoding fireflies with a bamboo whisk is a fresh, particular synthesis, and the “hidden labor” reframing feels earned. The contemplative epiphany arc is familiar, keeping ingenuity below the very top tier. Still, the object‑world integration and tonal precision distinguish it.</comment>
