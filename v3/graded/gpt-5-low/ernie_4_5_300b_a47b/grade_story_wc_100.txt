<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation and stubborn grief are specific and embodied (calloused hands, embalming stains), and his micro‑choices (booking passage, committing to the repair, staying) track cleanly. The contradiction—undertaker of the dead asked to revive—pressurizes his stance against Marisol’s pleas. His shift is earned by dream imagery and work on the lens, though the interior conflict resolves a touch neatly. Marisol provides credible, immediate pressure without flattening into a device.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—package → dream → journey → repair → activation → staying. Orientation is clear early; the because/therefore chain holds without teleporting props. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis (he forecloses his old life to remain), with conceptual cost felt though not heavily dramatized on the page. Minor softness: obstacles to repair are light, so the price at climax is more implied than pressured.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The underwater library is vivid and tactically relevant: silted entrance, spiraled shelves, bioluminescent books, scavenged parts from clocks and compasses, and the dome’s housing for the lens. The lighthouse lens functions as a charged object that shapes action and the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias’s professional eye. World rules stay consistent and are learned in motion rather than dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (revive the city’s signal vs. Elias’s resistance to reviving) is clear and coheres. Escalation occurs via the decision to repair and the activation, but we lack a meaningful setback or costful trade‑off in scene beyond endurance and labor. The tightening is present yet gentle; danger or time pressure never truly narrows options. The resolution arises from Elias’s agency, though the price is largely conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Resonant images—coffin/city, broken lens/kintsugi repair, beacon as grief’s re‑direction—build a coherent theme of rest reimagined as belonging. Subtext surfaces in object work and vocation, but several lines state thesis directly (“It’ll guide you,” final paragraph moralizing), thinning ambiguity. The ending reweights earlier images effectively, if a touch on‑the‑nose. Emotional aftereffect is genuine without tipping into sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The prose has a distinct texture—salt‑crusted ink, books like jellyfish, “tidepool’s whisper”—and maintains consistent close third. Dialogue is spare, functional, and carries subtext; Marisol’s lines pressure without exposition bloat. Rhythm modulates between lyric description and forward motion cleanly. No POV leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with high information density and purposeful images. A few phrases flirt with purple or platitude (“Here lies knowledge. Here lies hope.”), but clarity and momentum hold. Syntax varies and avoids template cadence; no looped scaffolding. The final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>An undertaker restoring a drowned city’s lighthouse lens via kintsugi‑like repair is a fresh synthesis; the underwater library milieu feels lived‑in. The dream directive and “impossible spaces” motif add texture without gimmickry. Turns arise from established elements; nothing late breaks rules. Not revolutionary, but distinctly above-template and memorable.</comment>
