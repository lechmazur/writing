<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motivation (to prove whispers travel farther than shouts) is clear, particular, and embodied through concrete choices (stealing the cork, humming, scent‑craft). Internal contradiction (fear vs. urge; apology vs. assertion) is dramatized rather than labeled. Thalos briefly applies pressure and reframes her belief without deflating her agency. The cost is modest (risk/reprimand), keeping the change credible but not searing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: scent, hum, cork, dawn, and rain build to the village’s felt response. Orientation is crisp early and causality is clean; the lantern interruption is a single, functional tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “The proof was in the silence,” with a conceptual price of vulnerable self‑exposure. The felt cost is subtle rather than stark, keeping it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse, garden, dawn light, and rain are vivid and purpose‑driven; dawn “kissing” the cork and the salt‑air garden directly enable the method. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s priorities (herbalist, hum, scent). The setting constrains choice (height, window, light, proximity to village) and charges the final image. A hair off 9+ only because environment’s constraint is gentle rather than inescapable.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through the humming attempt and Thalos’s interruption. The reversal (expecting reprimand; receiving mentorship) deepens rather than resolves by coincidence. The visible price is light; the conflict resolves smoothly once Thalos allies with her. Tension is steady but not harrowing, capping intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (“whispers slip through cracks”) is earned through action and image—scent, hum, cork glow, and the village’s wordless reception—rather than abstract moralizing. The quiet ending reweights the premise without didactic closure. One line from Thalos states the thesis a touch plainly, but it’s grounded in character and scene. The final image lingers with emotional honesty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third voice is lyrical but controlled, with a distinctive perceptual signature (herbalist’s sensibility). Dialogue rhythms fit character and class, carrying subtext and forward motion. Psychic distance modulation during peak beats (humming, interruption, final tears) is intentional and clean. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft shows varied rhythm and high information density; images often do double duty (sea churn answering hum). The figurative register is rich but not purple; syntax remains clear under pressure. Minimal scaffold and no paraphrase loops. Occasional high lyricism skirts lushness but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lighthouse magic via “vibrations of intent,” scent‑mediated communication, and the thesis of whisper over shout feel fresh and organically fused. The fisherman/wife beat converts concept into lived effect, avoiding gimmickry. Risks (lyric diction, gentle stakes) pay off with coherence. Not wholly unprecedented, but memorably synthesized.</comment>
