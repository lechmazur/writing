<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive is clear and particular—listening to “what walls dream about”—and her tactile way of moving through the world reveals character under pressure. The fear/curiosity tension surfaces at the groan and in her steadying micro‑choices. Burning the heirloom is a credible, felt cost that earns the closing stance. The only ding is a slightly tidy epiphany cadence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene, accumulative/textural build is clean: entrance → discovery → groan → renunciation → charged reveal. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (sacrificing the negative) and the rule‑set reweighted by the locket/whisper. The ivy‑parting alcove verges on convenient but fits the taught “living architecture” logic. Orientation is crisp from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The passage is vividly sensory and purpose‑driven: damp stone, ash textures, soot‑stained glass, ivy behavior. Environment shapes access and choice (narrowing corridor, fireplace as site of reading/burning, ivy revealing the alcove) and charges the final image. Details are filtered through Lira’s cartographic, haptic bias. World rules (climate‑amplified growth, humming walls) stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to bear legacy/listen to the walls) tightens through diaries and the physical groan, culminating in the decision to burn the heirloom. The price is legible and alters the field of meaning. Pressure is mostly internal and atmospheric, but it coheres under the accumulative lens. A hair more external constraint could have heightened the commitment test.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of legacy as a living, shared burden arises organically through objects and acts (diaries, negative, ash, locket), not lecture. The final whisper—“You are the map”—reweights prior images and affirms her new stance without moralizing. Climate and memory entwine without reductive binaries. Slight risk of on‑the‑nose phrasing is offset by earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (haptic mapping, acoustics, vegetal attention). Distance stays stable; quotes from diaries are clean and additive. Rhythm modulates with pressure (quieting for the groan, crisping at the burn). No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and vivid; metaphors are coherent with the piece’s organic/architectural lexicon. Sentences do multiple jobs and avoid scaffolding; no paraphrase loops. A high density of figurative language skirts purple but remains legible and purposeful, including at the climax. The final line lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Corridor echo cartographer” amid climate‑awakened architecture is a fresh synthesis; tactile mapping and object economy feel specific. The heirloom locket reveal is familiar but transformed by the living‑structure logic. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity. The piece maintains conceptual integrity through to closure.</comment>
