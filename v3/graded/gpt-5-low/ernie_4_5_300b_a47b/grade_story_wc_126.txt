<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—break the wall of ritual silence and find beauty in the unfinished—is clear and embodied in her tactile engagement with the violin and bowl. Her acoustic sensitivity informs micro‑choices (placement, listening), though internal contradiction is mild (restlessness vs. resolve). Emotions are sensorially grounded (“scent of soil reborn,” damp strings). The ending choice is earned, with a felt social cost in risking and reshaping the community’s silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound density and spatial resonance build toward a Conceptual Repricing of the bowl (silence → potential) and the community’s hush (wall → threshold). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; scene unity is maintained. Closure lands on the page with the communal offerings and Lira’s renewed playing; the price is subtle but legible (transforming a shared grieving practice). No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the greenhouse glass, shipwreck groans, humidity, and orchard wood concretely affect sound. The mendicant’s bowl as micro‑setting/tool constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory selection is filtered through an acoustically attuned POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. World rules stay consistent and the environment directly supports the reconfiguration at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes focus on whether Lira can transmute communal grief into shared potential; pressure tightens as the music swells and the crowd’s hush turns attentive. Escalation is a credible deepening rather than a reversal; agency is central in choosing to risk breaking tradition’s silence. Cost is mostly social/emotional and might read light for some editors. Still, the shift from wall to threshold is a meaningful narrowing and reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Recurring images (bowl, silence, ash) develop a coherent theme of space‑making over silence; the final communal act reframes loss without neat repair. The explicit line “It holds potential” edges toward thesis‑speak, but it’s diegetic and earned by the scene. The piece resists platitudinous wrap‑up by rooting hope in practice (offerings + music). Resonance lingers through the charged threshold silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Lira’s perceptual signature (sound‑first noticing, tactility); rhythm modulates with performance intensity. Dialogue is sparing and purposeful. No head‑hopping or register drift; inference and certainty stay within plausible POV. The voice maintains pressure without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, action, theme) with minimal scaffold; cadence varies cleanly. Figurative language is vivid but mostly controlled; a few elevated phrases flirt with purple without derailing clarity. No noticeable loops or template cadence. Final image is crisp and earned without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—sunken greenhouse, shipwreck harbor, chronically hushed world healed by acoustics and a mendicant’s bowl—is fresh and specific. The bowl’s reconception is elegant rather than gimmicky. Emotional truth arises from concrete ritual and performance. Risk is present in the quiet, accumulative design and lands cleanly.</comment>
