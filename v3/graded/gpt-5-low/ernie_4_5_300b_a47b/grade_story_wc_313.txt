<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s vigilance and conflicted relationship with memory are concrete and embodied through tactile choices (the tin of photographs, the kneeling at the moss). The encounter with Elias’s daughter adds relational pressure that forces a revaluation rather than a neat affirmation. The final choice—to place her own photo and pivot from guarding to sharing—feels earned by prior beats. Slight neatness in the epiphany via the daughter’s exposition softens the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, discoveries (label → photos → confrontation → reframe) accrue toward a quiet but legible closure. The final image—“Let’s start here” with Mara’s photo—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (identity shift from warden to memory‑keeper). Orientation is clean early and the single scene holds. Some reliance on told revelation (Elias’s fate) modestly reduces the pressure of the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ridgeway, violet horizon, submerged town, and mossy churchyard are vivid and filtered through Mara’s professional attention. Recurring objects (label, photographs) are integrated into the geography and charge the ending image. While the environment rarely constrains options physically, it consistently steers attention and mood toward the choice. Strong sensory economy avoids tourist‑catalog breadth.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—what kind of guardian Mara will be—is clear and tightens when the daughter reframes the past and the failing dam resurfaces the town. The escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than a hard reversal, fitting the chosen lens. The price is internal (abandoning her expunging ritual and solitary identity), present but subtle. A slightly sharper on‑page cost or foreclosed option would lift this further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, memory, and communal meaning emerge through objects and acts, culminating in the shared trail of photographs. However, explicit thematic statements (“spin stories into shared meaning,” “precisely humane act of remembering”) tilt toward telling, especially in the final cadence. The resonance remains, but the moral is a shade too articulated. Subtext in the images already carries the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical without losing clarity, and maintains a steady close third focalization. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with the daughter’s lines applying pressure rather than exposition for its own sake. Rhythm modulates well between description and decision. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prose has strong image selection and momentum; most sentences do double duty. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but stays coherent and voice‑true. No significant loops or cadence templates dulling immediacy. The final line crisply recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drowned distillery, sapphire liqueur as poison/memory, and the tactile ritual of photographs create a fresh synthesis of flood‑myth and memory‑keeping. The “guardian of stories” arc is familiar but individualized by the occupational lens and object work. The reveal of Elias’s choice is thematically apt and not twist‑for‑twist’s sake. Slight conventionality in the mentor‑messenger function of the daughter tempers novelty.</comment>
