<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to read the intentions of the dead—drives her choices and aligns with her occupational habits. Interiority is present but largely steady; there’s little simultaneous contradiction under pressure. The decision to rebury the case shows an earned stance, though the cost reads light. Embodied cues (calloused fingers, gentle handling) help, but deeper friction would sharpen the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding threads incrementally reweights meaning toward the “silence between moves.” Orientation is clear early (silo, gardener, discovered case), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a quiet, credible act (reburial). Causality is associative more than adversarial; the price is primarily conceptual rather than materially felt. Still, the because/therefore of constellation and chess symbols provides enough coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful setting—cobalt silo, oculus stars—filters through Elara’s professional gaze. The oculus/constellation alignment and the silo’s pulsing walls actively charge the decoding and final image. Details are selective and integrated with action, avoiding tourist catalog. The environment subtly constrains interpretation rather than movement, which suits the piece’s mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether she will extract or honor the found history, but external pressure is minimal. Escalation occurs through pattern alignment (stars, knight, name, date, phrase), not through opposition. The choice to rebury forecloses a path, yet the price feels gentle and untested by counterforce. One more tangible constraint or loss would raise the tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Chess/time/echo motifs braid into a coherent inquiry about intentions surviving as patterns. The final phrase “The silence between moves” reframes the work as a time‑map, giving the ending resonance. A few lines verge on stated thesis (“The dead were not silent; they spoke...”), slightly blunting subtext. Overall, the theme emerges from image and action more than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyric, tactile texture that fits Elara’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates well from contemplative to intent as decoding proceeds. No head‑hopping or stance drift; diction is coherent to the piece’s tone. Occasionally leans toward lushness, but control is maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with strong imagery and clean syntax. Some purple density and echoing modifiers (velveteen, cobalt) risk over-saturation without adding pressure. Minimal scaffold; sentences generally do more than one job. Clarity remains intact through the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—grave‑gardening, a cobalt silo crypt, a time‑map tapestry keyed to stars and chess—feels distinctive. Turns arise from the established decoding method rather than late rule drops. The quiet renunciation is familiar, but the particulars give it freshness. A bolder cost or complication could elevate it further.</comment>
