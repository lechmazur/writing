<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clara’s motives (truth vs. filial loyalty) are coherent and intensify under pressure, with the nib, the memo, and the overnight investigation revealing her contradictions. The discovery of “Don’t let Clara see this” lands a personal wound that credibly drives her choice to act against her family. Emotional states are embodied (the nib biting, breath hitching) rather than labeled. Slight convenience in her competence (a dossier in one night) trims the top end.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal drive is clear: the call triggers investigation, the memo reconfigures knowledge, her handoff to the journalist leads to public fallout and a continued stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses family silence and accepts cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Some developments are summarized (“Days later, the headlines”) but do not undercut the causal chain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory and its mechanics (gears, dome, library) are tactile and character‑filtered, shaping resources and tone. The rosewood nib functions as micro‑setting/object that charges multiple beats and the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, with astronomy imagery integrated into thought. The “above the clouds” perch supports theme and choice without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose or preserve legacy) is signaled early and tightens at the 1987 memo, which forecloses denial. The choice to give the story and accept public/familial cost is an escalation with visible consequence (lawyers, mother’s plea, unplugged phone). Internal and external conflicts interlock effectively. Slight summary compression keeps it from peaking higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of truth, inheritance, and gravity recur through concrete images (black hole vs. sunlight, orbits of regret, the charged nib) and culminate in a reweighted final stance. A few lines edge toward statement (“Truth…wasn’t a destination—it was a compass”), but they’re earned by prior particulars. The grandfather’s “see beyond the horizon” ties legacy to ethical seeing without moralizing bloat. Resonance lingers beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is steady, close‑third, and textured by Clara’s astronomer lexicon. The prose modulates with pressure; dialogue is sparse, functional, and subtextual (the journalist’s line vs. Clara’s resolve). Diction remains coherent with the character’s education and milieu. No head‑hopping or unmotivated slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and economical; images do double duty for mood and meaning. The astronomy metaphors are cohesive rather than mixed, avoiding purple saturation. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum persists through summary without drag. A slight density of metaphor in a few lines keeps the ceiling just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The heiress‑exposes‑family trope is refreshed by the observatory frame and the pen‑nib throughline. The proof‑by‑contradiction tactic adds a precise intellectual flavor. While not radical in premise, the synthesis feels particular and emotionally honest. Risks are measured and effective rather than groundbreaking.</comment>
