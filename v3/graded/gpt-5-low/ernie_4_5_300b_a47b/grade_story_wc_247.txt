<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael’s motive—translating silence into music—is clear and consistent, and his actions align with that goal. Interiority is present but restrained; we get a belief system more than a live contradiction under pressure. The sadness at dawn adds a welcome cost, though his internal conflict never truly complicates choices. Lira functions well as a catalyst, but their relationship pressure remains gentle rather than transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds coherently from solitary listening to communal music, then to a charged quiet at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s silence is revalued, and Kael’s small sadness marks cost. Orientation is clean from the opening; single scene continuity holds. The only limitation is a relatively low‑risk path—no stringent constraint forces a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harbor is vivid and sensorially economical—moonlight, ropes, and water rhythms integrate with the act of “mapping silence.” The camera as recurring object charges the final image and helps anchor the environment’s logic. While the setting doesn’t force a decisive choice, it shapes the ritual and tone. Specificity stays within scene needs without touring.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Escalation operates via density: from Kael alone to duet to town, then a second round at the fisherman’s request. The dominant stake—disrupt forgetfulness by turning silence into music—tightens as community enters and responds. Cost is subtle, arriving as ephemeral joy and dawn’s fade rather than a foreclosed option. Effective for this lens, if not harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around silence as presence, memory, and translation; the camera and hand‑signs enact this rather than merely state it. The “silence is a canvas” line edges toward thesis but is supported by concrete beats. The final image (camera to heart + dawn sadness) reweights the night without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture, listening, and communal recognition.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A steady close third with a lyrical but controlled register; diction matches the piece’s sensibility. Dialogue/sign exchanges are minimal yet purposeful and subtextually aligned. Rhythm modulates well from hush to swell to hush. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clean, musical sentences with varied cadence; information density is good and momentum holds. A few familiar phrases (“liquid silver,” “the world had listened”) flirt with cliché but don’t obscure clarity. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and choreography is clear. The closing cadence lands without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mapping silence via sign to score a filmless camera’s “images” feels fresh and coherent. The synthesis of object, method, and communal awakening is non‑obvious and memorable. Risk sits in the quiet, accumulative design and it pays off at closure. Slight sentimentality prevents a higher band, but the core vision is singular.</comment>
