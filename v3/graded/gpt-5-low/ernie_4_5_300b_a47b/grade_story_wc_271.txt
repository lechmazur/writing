<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lila’s motive to reclaim agency from trauma is clear, embodied, and particularized through tactile choices (stone, salt, lavender). Contradictory impulses surface in the flinch/flashback versus the deliberate grounding. A touch of therapy-speak (“somatic markers,” “PTSD”) edges toward label-y but is justified via Mrs. Voss and prior treatment. The earned shift—being able to view the photo without freezing—feels grounded in prior beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: present-tense sensory anchors accrue to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate; stakes and scene are contained, and the gust-triggered flashback provides the key turn. Closure lands with cost—grief persists while options reweight toward resilient presence. The because/therefore is soft but coherent: trigger → grounding → stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff are vividly rendered and function as tools and constraints—the stone, wind, salt, and gates actively shape tactics and the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Lila’s needs. The setting charges the closure by becoming a somatic anchor. No static postcard syndrome; the environment participates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can Lila hold a steady, peaceful moment under pressure?) is signaled early. The escalation centers on the gust/flashback and her choice to ground, a credible tightening at this scale. The on‑page price—enduring the spike of grief without dissociation—reads clearly. Resolution is earned via her deliberate practice rather than convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of anchoring hope in realism emerge through concrete acts and recurring objects and culminate in a reweighted final image. Some direct statement (“I want to anchor optimism in realism”) slightly overstates what the scene has already earned. Still, the piece resists sentimentality by acknowledging ongoing cost. The lighthouse-keeper parallel enriches the subtext without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident; the lyric diction matches Lila’s attentional filter under stress. Dialogue feels natural and gently subtextual, especially Mrs. Voss’s ship-journal anecdote. Rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity. Occasional abstract phrasing brushes the edge of didacticism but doesn’t crack voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image-rich, and propulsive at a quiet tempo; lines often carry dual duty (action and theme). Minor repetition (“pearl of stillness”) functions as motif rather than loop, though a couple of sentences tread near paraphrase. Jargon is limited and contextualized. Final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—drone-strike wedding trauma met with somatic grounding in a windwrecked arboretum—feels fresh and organic. The lighthouse-keeper absence refracts the central question in a non-obvious way. Turn and resolution arise from established particulars rather than late gimmicks. Not radical, but notably distinctive and sincere.</comment>
