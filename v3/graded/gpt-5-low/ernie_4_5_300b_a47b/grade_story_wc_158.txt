<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (“photosynthesize pain into beauty”) is clear and sustained, and her micro-choices (venturing outside, planting the seed, finally singing) reveal an earned shift from shield to bridge. The internal contradiction—insomniac vigilance as defense versus surrender to sleep/connection—is dramatized rather than declared. The final renunciation of insomnia reads credible with a felt identity cost. Minor: the centuries glide by smoothly, slightly softening on‑page struggle in the middle stretch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the postcard’s arrival, the shell’s migration, bloom → seed → singing form a coherent density‑building pattern toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with the seed/tree and Lira’s song; the cost is the relinquishment of insomnia-as-armor and the reweighting of her practice. Causality is softly magical but consistent and legible. One scene-window with a single transition holds together cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell, bioluminescent moss, and off‑key wind are vivid and particular, integrated into action (migration, moss blooming, wind carrying poems and song). The environment charges the ending image (tree in the shell singing with the wind) and shapes how words travel. Sensory selection feels POV‑true and texturally rich. Minor: constraint is more tonal than logistical, but it still meaningfully colors choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a truce between pain and beauty—tightens through the postcard’s disruption and culminates with the planting and the first sleep. Escalation is a deepening rather than a narrowing; still, the seed’s appearance forces a trust act that forecloses the old tactic of sleepless control. The felt price is giving up the shield of insomnia; the payoff is earned. Tension is quiet and could support one sharper mid‑scene pressure beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: shield vs bridge, wind‑carried offerings, and the “armistice” reframed as coexistence rather than cure. The final image (song carried by wind) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. A single explanatory sentence (“wasn’t an end—it was a beginning”) edges toward telling, but it’s earned by the sequence. Subtext consistently rides image and action rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—maritime/bioluminescent lexicon, tidal cadences—without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from hush to lift at the ending. No gratuitous register slips; the diction feels character‑borne. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet mostly disciplined; images do multiple jobs (nebula mirroring eye bruises; moss as captured starlight). Momentum holds with minimal scaffolding, and sentence variety supports flow. A few high‑lyric clusters flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion remain intact. No notable loops or template cadences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—insomniac poet in a migrating shell, a kelp postcard catalyzing a living chorus tree—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and diction cohere with theme and closure. The magical logic is fresh without hand‑waving convenience. Minor safety: conflict remains gentle, but the originality of images offsets it.</comment>
