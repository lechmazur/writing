<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clara’s motives (prove the ghost, finish the symphony) are clear and character‑particular to a timpanist attuned to “in‑between spaces.” Her actions under pressure—dipping the program, jotting symbols, choosing commitment after the surge—align with that interiority. The embodied details (sloshing boots, chill down her spine) keep feelings concrete. The vow risks social cost (skeptics) and personal risk (the pit’s danger), making the final stance earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural drive is consistent: atmosphere and pattern recognition build to a charged vow. Causality holds—water reveals symbols; the surge destroys the program; therefore she commits from memory. Closure is on‑page with cost (artifact lost, promise made against pressure). Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the single‑scene structure stays tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vivid and tactically consequential: water both reveals the code and steals tools (bow, program), while lanterns control visibility. Instrument detritus and the timpani’s “approval” charge the final image. Details are selective and musician‑filtered rather than touristic. The environment meaningfully shapes action and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>One dominant stake (decoding/proving the ghost) escalates through environmental pressure and loss of the program. The key tightening is the pipe burst that removes a resource and forces a new tactic (memory and commitment). The price is legible but largely implied rather than dramatized with a direct counterforce. Still, the vow is an earned stance crystallization under rising pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of liminality, art as communion with the dead, and listening between movements cohere through concrete images (water‑bled symbols, floating sheet music). The ending’s promise reframes silence as charged potential. It avoids moralizing and lets motifs carry the resonance. A touch of familiar phrasing (“the theater held its breath”) slightly softens originality but not coherence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The limited POV is steady, with diction and noticing specific to a percussionist. Lyric cadence modulates with pressure (quieter observation to urgent vow) without head‑hopping or register drift. The single whispered line lands as action, not exposition. Prose confidence matches what Clara can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑dense, and purposeful; most sentences do more than one job. Minor familiar notes (“chill down her spine,” “held its breath”) appear but don’t bog momentum. Rhythm varies well, and the closure image is uncluttered. No scaffold loops or filter‑verb stacks dull immediacy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of ghost‑code with water damage and a timpanist’s ear for liminal cadence feels fresh. The flooded opera pit as crucible is memorable, and the mechanics (ink bleeding into symbols) are specific. While the haunted‑theater premise is known, execution and sensory particularity elevate it. The final promise reframes the setup with inevitability rather than gimmick.</comment>
