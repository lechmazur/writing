<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s guilt and professional complicity are clear and embodied (the trembling watch, salt‑and‑secrets air). His contradictory impulses—comfort the client via lies vs. risk betrayal with truth—play on the page and culminate in a credible renunciation. Slight convenience in his instantaneous interpretive leaps from driftwood visions softens the struggle. Still, actions align with motives and the cost is felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under a causal lens: terrace → beach search → carved revelations → decision to tell Lila forms a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure lands as a decisive change with cost (potential loss of client/trust). The “vision via driftwood” mechanic is accepted without friction and paid off. The offstage Lila limits on‑page pressure but not closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: cobalt terrace to forgotten shore is sensorially grounded and filtered through Elias’s profession. The ocean/driftwood motif does work, shaping method and charging the final image. The pocket watch as micro‑setting object furthers atmosphere and cost. Strong economy with details tied to action rather than postcard flourishes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. manufactured comfort) is signaled early and tightens with the heart‑split driftwood beat. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent; discovery forces a renunciation that forecloses his usual tactic. The price—betrayal risk and self‑reproach—is legible in the closing ascent. Lack of an on‑page counterforce (Lila present) keeps pressure just short of peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of silence/erasure versus truth accrues through concrete images (“sieved hush,” driftwood tombstones) rather than abstract lecturing. The ending reweights the premise: mercy is reframed as costly truth-telling. A couple of explanatory lines (“He knew then…”) verge on telling but do not blunt resonance. Subtext operates well in motif and choice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stable close third with a distinct, sea‑salted lexicon; rhythm modulates from lyric observation to firmer resolve. No head‑hopping or register slips. Lyricity stays character‑plausible for a reflective fixer steeped in memory work. Slight purple edges appear but are controlled by clear action beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images are fresh and coherent (barnacles, carved cedar, cold watch). Figurative density is high but mostly disciplined; no muddled metaphors or loops. Momentum is maintained through varied syntax and purposeful paragraphing. Minor tell-y pivots keep it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blend of black‑market genealogy with ocean‑kept secrets and driftwood divination feels fresh and organically tied to the moral turn. The pocket‑watch barometer adds a memorable texture without gimmickry. Stakes remain intimate yet specific, avoiding template beats. The synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
