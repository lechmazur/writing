<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clara’s motive—shaping grief through carving—is concrete and embodied in tactile choices (sharpening, the first tentative cut, placing the lion). Interiority is specific to her life with a lion tamer and the craft. The tension is mostly endurance rather than contradiction; she rarely wavers once she begins. A couple of thesis-like lines edge toward neatness but the choice she makes reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and actions accrue toward a resonant reconfiguration as she accepts “understanding, not closure.” Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the final image (lion on the sill, raindrops turned to stars) lands with conceptual cost: she forgoes forgetting and commits to carrying grief. The kettle/candle timeline provides a soft clock without undermining coherence. Quiet but legible closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The loft, skylight, rain, whetstone, and kettle are vivid and filtered through Clara’s craft-minded gaze. The environment charges the final image (raindrops as stars over the finished lion) and supports her methodical process. While setting seldom constrains options, the tools-as-micro-setting guide action. Strong economy with evocative specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: can she shape grief into something holdable. Pressure deepens as the knife is sharpened, the first cut is made, and the candle burns low, culminating in placing the lion. Escalation is a cadence shift rather than reversal, apt for the chosen lens. The cost is quiet—acceptance over erasure—but present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring particulars (containment, “here and gone,” tools, light) and culminates in a non-literal answer. However, explicit formulations (“Loss wasn’t an ending, but a transformation”; “This is how we survive”) approach moralizing and dilute subtext. The images themselves carry strong resonance independent of those declarations. Overall, emotionally honest and restrained aside from a couple of didactic lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lucid close third with a controlled lyric texture; diction suits a thoughtful craftsperson in grief. Rhythm modulates well between observation and action. No head-hopping or stance slippage, and elision is minimal and purposeful. Voice remains distinct without becoming purple.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean sentences with varied cadence and high information density; images often do double duty. A few metaphorical turns cluster (mosaic time, watercolor haze, rust-hued peace) but remain coherent. Minor repetition (kettle motif) doesn’t stall momentum. Line-level control supports the quiet climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lion tamer/widow plus woodcarving synthesis feels fresh, with “contain the chaos” grounded in tool-use rather than abstraction. The ash wood gift and final placement provide an organic twist on grief narratives. Risks are quiet but purposeful, avoiding gimmickry. Not radically new, but distinctly executed.</comment>
