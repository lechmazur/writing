<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (protect the orchard, honor vows, bridge with Mara), and actions align, but there’s little on‑page struggle or contradictory impulse; competence goes largely untested. The remembered “endearingly feisty” line hints at texture yet doesn’t force a costly choice. Embodied moments (climbing, catching the ribbon) land, though the emotional arc stays steady. The final stance feels earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ritual repair culminates in the orchard blooming, yielding a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is on‑page and legible; the before/after is clear. Cost is light (no tangible sacrifice beyond endurance), so the decisive feel is muted. Orientation is strong from the start (who/where/why).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cathedral‑orchard is vivid, tactile, and filters through Lira’s craft; climbing rafters and moss nests integrate setting with action. Environmental change (trees bursting into bloom) charges the final image. World rules feel consistent (starlight, copper, quartz) and are learned through use. Minor note: the setting rarely constrains tactics beyond climb/height.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keep orchard alive; mend a generational promise) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens—no obstacle challenges the repair. The single turn is the successful mend → bloom; there’s no narrowing of options or visible price. Agency is present but untested; persistence reads as given, not strained. The result feels serene rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of persistence over patronage and seasonal/revisable vows cohere with the craft ritual and the mother‑daughter thread. Several lines verge on stating the moral (“wisdom wasn’t found in grand contracts…”) which dulls subtext. The ribbon’s reprise adds soft resonance. Emotional aftertaste is warm but controlled, not piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Controlled close third with a lyrical tilt; diction and rhythm are consistent and character‑filtered. The remembered line is cleanly embedded; no head‑hopping. Narrative certainty matches what Lira can know. Modulation under pressure stays even, perhaps too even, but voice remains distinct.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong images and selective detail; momentum generally holds. Occasional platitude‑adjacent statements and end‑paragraph summarizing soften impact. Figurative language stays coherent without purple spill. Sentence variety and paragraphing support flow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Quartz‑eye mender, liquid starlight, an orchard threading a cathedral—these synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame. The repair ritual as seasonal vow‑work feels non‑obvious and coherent. Risk is taken in quiet stakes and accumulative closure; it mostly pays off. A sharper on‑page price would lift originality into consequence rather than charm.</comment>
