<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elric’s motives (safety via silence) and flaw (avoidance) are clearly dramatized, with micro‑choices from neglecting the bolt to tracing the stain to breaking his vow. The internal contradiction—custodian of quiet vs. necessary speech—plays on the page at the confrontation with Lady Veyra. Embodied feeling is present but often translated into lyric abstraction rather than tactile stress. The change (speaking and redefining his role) feels earned, though the personal cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: neglected bolt → wobble/scream → voided hush → staircase insight → return/tighten/speak. Closure lands as a Decisive Change paired with a Conceptual Repricing of “safety,” on the page with the bench’s click and his line. The cost (breaking an unspoken contract) is legible but soft; consequences are sketched more in atmosphere than in concrete fallout. Structure stays within a single lens and scene window with one reflective detour that redirects action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow, the greenhouse, and the spiral staircase are vivid and filtered through Elric’s task‑oriented noticing. The bench/bolt operate as a micro‑setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Environmental pressures mostly shape tone rather than tactics, but details like the healers’ hymns and cobalt dimming integrate world rules. Sensory selection is purposeful, privileging texture and cold over catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on the integrity of the pact of silence and the guests’ fragile recovery, with Lady Veyra applying acute pressure. Escalation is modest but real: a neglected routine becomes a crisis that forces a stance. The price of speaking is primarily reputational/social within the fortress rather than materially narrowing options. The tightening beat (bolt click) is a clear turn but the aftermath softens quickly into communal awe.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of safety vs. silence and communal pacts emerge coherently through the bolt and the staircase “map.” However, the line “Safety is not the absence of sound. It is the courage to listen.” states the thesis overtly, dampening subtext. The “garden not a cage” image is strong but edges toward tidy moral. Resonance lingers, though a touch more implication over declaration would deepen it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third carries a distinct perceptual signature (workmanlike reverence, hush-as-ethos). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; “You, speak.” creates a sharp status beat. Diction and rhythm hold under pressure without head‑hopping or register drift. The voice modulates from hushed ritual to declarative clarity at closure effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with vivid images (“cloth… woven from moonlight,” “shadow’s breath”) and good momentum. A few purple tendencies and reiterated abstractions (safety, silence) slightly blunt pressure, but clarity survives. Syntax varies cleanly, and sentences often do double duty (world + theme). No noticeable loops or mechanical scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt‑under‑snow refuge with a silent bellhop and a piano‑bolt crisis feels fresh and coherent. The stain-as-map and the reweighting of silence show inventive synthesis without gimmickry. Some thematic statements lean familiar, curbing the sense of risk. Still, the object-driven closure and world texture provide memorable originality.</comment>
