<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s interiority is specific and embodied (mist, coral bite, condensation tracing), and her vocation meaningfully shapes her choices. The internal contradiction—grief vs. hope, translation as equivalence vs. alchemy—plays in scene. Her decision to bring the coral to the table is motivated and reveals values under pressure. Minor safety: emotions resolve a touch smoothly without a concrete counterforce testing her flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: motifs (coral/cast/mist) accrete toward a Conceptual Repricing and a brief Charged Poise at the negotiating table. Closure lands on-page when she places the coral and reframes the talks: “This grew from ruin.” Cost is felt as risk and revaluation of her role. A slight orientation wobble (“after the anesthetic kicks in”) is unexplained but does not undercut closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The atrium and recurring objects are vivid, POV‑filtered, and charge the final image; the coral/cast function as micro‑setting constraints on meaning and action. Weather and moisture integrate tactically (condensation tracing) rather than as postcard backdrop. Specificity remains consistent with her translator lens and conflict zone context. Strong environmental-thread reprise at the end (cast hung as a “flag of fragile hope”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can meaning be regrown from ruin) tightens as she shifts from decoding the cast to intervening publicly with the coral. The meaningful turn is her choice to bring the object to the table and speak; the general’s touch confirms pressure meets resistance. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional; external stakes remain soft, keeping escalation modest but coherent. One further on‑page consequence would raise pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres: translation as alchemy, rebuilding from ruin, the ethics of listening, all carried by recurrent images that reweight at the end. Subtext in object work and gestures (general’s “It’s… sharp”) is effective. Some lines verge on moralizing (“The war ends when we choose to listen,” “The ocean heals in whispers”), slightly flattening complexity. The final image still resonates beyond a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice matches Lira’s perception and profession; diction is consistent and modulates with pressure. Dialogue is spare but subtextual and functional. No head‑hopping or stance drift; psychic distance shifts are intentional. Occasional coined abstractions (“lotus‑hearted ache”) work, though they flirt with self‑awareness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lean enough for momentum, with images doing multiple jobs; sentences vary rhythmically and avoid loops. Figurative density is high but coherent (reef/coral/ruin/healing) and largely free of mixed metaphors. Minor purple notes and aphoristic lines skim sentimentality but do not blur sense. Opening and final lines land cleanly and recharge motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—peace‑talk translator recoding a child’s cast and wielding a coral shard as diplomatic lever—feels fresh and particular. Risks in diction and motif coherence mostly pay off. A few platitudinal statements keep it just shy of the most daring band. The closure image feels earned and distinctive.</comment>
