<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (to uncover hidden truths) is clear and sustained, with credible embodied choices (entering the vortex, releasing the seed, breathing the spores). The contradiction—guarded druid who chooses to “unbend”—is dramatized rather than told. The self-reassessment around the killing reads earned, though the clarity via spores borders on convenient. Emotional cost is felt, if modestly contained for the length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: failed ritual → vortex entry via a chosen method → releasing the seed → vision → spores → reframed confession. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (acceptance of culpability’s complexity). The lens reads Causal and holds to the end. Slight neatness in the seed/spore mechanism trims the ceiling but doesn’t break pressure or cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard vortex is vivid and purposeful (decaying fruit, ozone, groaning trees) and physically constrains action (pulls her in, charges tactics). The environment directly charges the final cadence as the vortex slows “in respect.” Detail selection stays POV‑true and functional, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (face buried truth) stays coherent, with a meaningful tightening when the vision reframes her self‑image. Agency drives escalation (choosing to enter, to release the seed, to inhale the spores). The price—confronting the possibility of darkness—lands, though the conflict resolves with relative smoothness. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme of seeing beyond mirrors plays through the seed’s truth‑seeking and the reweighted “confession.” The final image recontextualizes guilt into endurance without sermonizing. A single explicit thesis line (“She had discovered what mirrors don’t show…”) blunts subtlety slightly. Resonance lingers via cost‑aware acceptance rather than neat absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third‑person close maintains a steady, character‑true lyric register; sensory diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Voice carries a distinct perceptual signature (arboreal textures, storm‑tuned noticing). Compression is controlled, with no helper‑narrator intrusions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean enough with effective images; most lines do multiple jobs (atmosphere + intent). Minor purple edges (“trees twisted like dancers,” “ghostly shapes”) remain coherent and don’t muddy action. Rhythm varies and scaffolding is minimal. The final sentence cleanly reprises and reweights the seed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—druid in a cursed orchard vortex, a carnivorous seed that hunts truth, a meditation of expanding circles—feels fresh and integrated. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule swaps. Not radical, but confidently singular and emotionally specific. The spores’ function is neat but contextually earned.</comment>
