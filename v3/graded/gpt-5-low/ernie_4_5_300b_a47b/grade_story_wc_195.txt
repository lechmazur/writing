<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cedric’s motives are clear and escalate: trauma-fed muteness → desire to “capture” the greenhouse → earned pivot to living possibility. Interiority is sensorial and character-bound, with concrete micro-choices (unsnapping, descending, shattering an orb). Internal contradiction (control vs surrender) is present but could be pressed harder in-the-moment to heighten cost. The final renunciation lands, though the emotional price remains relatively light on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture; each act (“unsnap,” descend, shatter) triggers the next turn (stage opens, chamber, reality reconfigures). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: he abandons capture for lived pattern; the greenhouse’s collapse and changed inscription make a before/after legible. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single POV holds. The cost is present but more implied than dramatized, keeping this shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: machinery, vines, glass corridors, and the puppet stage constrain choices and catalyze turns (strings → staircase → chamber). Sensory integration is strong (cold air, condensation, violet leaves), and world rules are learned through action. The recurring object-as-setting (program) charges the final image. Minor lyric flourish aside, the environment consistently drives the scene.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—break stasis and seize/reshape reality—is signaled early and tightened by agency-driven acts. The key escalation is the string break that forecloses stasis and forces descent, with the orb-shatter deepening pressure. The cost (relinquishing capture, greenhouse crumbling) is felt but could cut deeper on page. Tension scales coherently under the causal lens without coincidence doing the solving.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Patterns, strings, theater, and alchemy knit into a coherent meditation on control vs surrender. The program’s evolving text reframes meaning across beats, culminating in the inscription. One explicit statement (“The shape of possibility was not a thing to be captured”) edges toward on-the-nose, trimming subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image reweights prior material without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close is steady and character-specific, with controlled rhythm and tactile noticing. No head-hopping or distance slips; elisions are purposeful and legible. Diction balances arcane and concrete without register drift. Occasional repeated constructions (“Reality shifted…”) are stylistic choices that do not impair clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean for its lyric mode, with most sentences doing double duty (atmosphere + action). A few intensifiers and repeated metaphors flirt with purple, but momentum holds and images remain coherent. No significant scaffold loops or muddled vehicles. The closing cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marionette-theater alchemy, “possibility” orbs, and an oath-driven pattern logic synthesize into a fresh angle on agency and art. Turns arise from established props and rules rather than late cheats. It’s not wholly sui generis, but the specific constellation (program changing text, strings-as-reality) feels memorable. Risk is contained yet confident.</comment>
