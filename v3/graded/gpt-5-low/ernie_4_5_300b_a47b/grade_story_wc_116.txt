<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The keeper’s motive is clean and character‑specific—seeking silence to unhook judgment—and choices track: following each fold, hesitating at the reflective pool, then entering and later relinquishing the refuge. The inner contradiction (witness vs. letting go; archivist vs. erasure of self) surfaces at the pool (“To burrow deeper was to shed another layer of self”). Emotions are embodied through tactile traversal and the reflection beat rather than labels. Slightly abstracted self‑description in a few lines keeps it just short of peak depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece escalates via a patterned descent guided by folds, culminating in a reweighted final state. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—having paid the cost of loosening identity, the keeper returns with options reweighted and burden lightened. Causality remains coherent between folds and thresholds; the price is visible (“their grip on reality now a faint echo”). Stakes are quiet and internal, but the cadence shift on entering/leaving the refuge makes the before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely textured and purposive: the overgrown library and catacomb veins physically constrain route and tactics; the origami swan functions as a navigational tool; the backward river charges the ending. Sensory selection is apt (iron and old rain; bioluminescent fungi) and filtered through a keeper’s priorities. World rules (the refuge as state) stay consistent and are learned in action. The final image (stone wall where the river was) is charged by place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around reaching the refuge and renouncing judgment, tightening through thresholds (slick tunnel, root fissure, groaning stairs, reflective pool, rusted door). The reflection beat is the clearest price point and narrowing of options; the library’s resistance (“as if the library itself resisted”) adds mild external pressure. Cost is internal but felt, and the return reconfigures stakes. Slight softness remains in the absence of a sharper trade‑off or external consequence beyond identity loosening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of surrender, nonjudgment, and the cost of witness arise through motif and action rather than lecture, with the origami swan and backward river accruing meaning. The concluding repricing—library as bridge not chain, river gone to stone—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. One explicit thesis line (“To witness change without judgment...”) edges toward statement, trimming the mystique slightly. Overall, subtext carries through the journey and return.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The third‑person limited voice is steady, lyric, and confident, with rhythm modulating well at thresholds and the final softening cadence. Diction suits the keeper’s sensibility; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Patterned elision (folds as guide) is taught early and paid off. Elevated register is consistent and character‑plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled and vivid; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, motion) with minimal scaffold. Metaphor is mostly coherent and integrated; repetition (“crumbling peace”) is purposeful rather than churning. Momentum is maintained through concrete actions between lyric breaths. A few adjectives could be pared for even sharper propulsion, but clarity never blurs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>While the “ancient library quest” frame is familiar, the origami swan as cartography, the backward flowing refuge as a state, and the identity‑for‑silence bargain feel fresh and organically fused. The return beat (river gone, wall present) avoids easy transcendence, giving a non‑obvious, earned turn. Emotional truth (cost of letting go) grounds the novelty. Risk‑taking is measured and coherent rather than gimmicky.</comment>
