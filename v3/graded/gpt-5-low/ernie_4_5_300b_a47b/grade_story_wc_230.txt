<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are clear and consistent—protect psychological safety, test rumored cures, deploy the eye strategically—and her choices (taking Jorn to the hut, inserting the eye, choosing “to occlude”) drive the scene. Interiority is present but largely rational and controlled, with limited contradiction under pressure. The relationship with Jorn adds pressure and history without melodrama. A more visible personal cost or compromise at the end would deepen character change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: storm pressure → encounter with Jorn → move to hut → deploy the eye → ledger reveal → stance crystallization (“We occlude”). Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: choosing a strategy of truth-as-occlusion with implied risk to her hard-won safety. Orientation is clean and the single transition is motivated. The cost is mostly implied rather than felt on-page, which limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard-in-ravine and incoming storm shape tactics (urgency to reach the oak, detour to hut) and color the mood. The glass eye as micro-setting/tool is integrated into perception and action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; environment mirrors stakes without over-signaling. Strong, though the storm’s physical constraint could tighten consequences even more.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are coherent (safety vs. dangerous truth). Escalation occurs via the storm clock, Jorn’s fear, and the ledger, culminating in a strategic decision. However, antagonistic force remains offstage and prices are mostly conceptual; no option is concretely foreclosed on-page. The tightening is real but not scalding.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Compelling ideas—truth as weapon, empathy as hazard, safety as collective practice—arise from particulars (eye, ledger, market truffles). Yet the theme is sometimes stated rather than earned (“safety isn’t just a feeling—it’s a choice”; “The truth… could be a weapon”). Subtext in the eye’s paradox is strong, but final moralizing blunts resonance. A quieter closing image would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident; diction blends lyric precision with practical observation befitting a methodical forager. Dialogue is functional and moves the plot, with mild subtext in Jorn’s paranoia. A few explanatory lines flatten voice under pressure. Overall control is solid without distinctive rhythmic risk-taking.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean, mostly economical prose with vivid images (“chandelier of green”). Some scaffolding and minor repetition around the eye/textbooks undercut momentum. No major metaphor muddle or cadence loops. Tightening a few explanatory sentences would sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: truffle forager as safety‑cultivator, empathy virus world, and a glass eye that “occludes” by forcing destabilizing honesty. The ledger complicates the premise without gimmickry. The final stance is thoughtful, if a touch declared. Distinctive and memorable despite modest on‑page cost.</comment>
