<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and continuous—she must restart the pendulum to protect the village—and her occupational specificity grounds her choices. Interiority is textured (grandfather’s lesson, the ridge’s “pain”), but internal contradiction is mild; she rarely feels pulled in two directions beyond duty versus fear. Competence slightly flattens struggle, as the inscription provides a clean path once found. The felt cost (raw hands, drained focus) lands but is modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: stalled bob → discovery of rake inscription → ritual alignment → resumed swing. Closure is a decisive change with a small but legible price, and the world’s response (ridge sealing, tide easing) cements consequence. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the two‑shard structure (ridge → tower) stays coherent. The solution arrives quickly once the key is discovered, lightly reducing perceived difficulty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge, clock tower, and pendulum are sensorially vivid and integral to action. Environment constrains tactics (the Hush/pause window, slick ridge, runes) and charges the final image (cracks sealing, tide easing). Details are filtered through her occupational eye, avoiding tourist catalog. World rules are consistent and learned through motion rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clean: prevent chaos by restarting the pendulum during the Hush. Pressure coheres and deepens (the pause lengthens; “air thickening”) and her action is timely and precise. However, escalation peaks without a hard trade‑off or loss—once the method is found, resistance is minimal. The price is mostly exertion and risk of failure rather than a foreclosed option.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>“Incremental absolution” threads through object, action, and outcome, reweighted by the slow resumption of the swing. The grandfather’s “balance is a dance” primes a thematic answer realized in practice rather than sermonizing. The diegetic inscription skirts on‑the‑nose but remains earned by lineage and role. Resonance lingers in the charged image of small corrections restoring the ridge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Lirael’s embodied perceptions (salt, glassy slopes, the ridge’s hum). Diction stays coherent with her sensibility, modulating toward reverie under peak pressure without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elisions are purposeful. Rhythm supports the Hush’s density and the release of motion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and image‑rich without significant loop or scaffold; most sentences do double duty. Metaphor is largely coherent (spine, teeth, dance) and supports mood. A few elevated turns (“searing reverie,” “ethically diligent”) brush purple but don’t blur sense. The final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of tidal mechanics, a clock’s pendulum, and a broken rake handle as ritual interface feels fresh. Stakes and worldbuilding interlock with specificity rather than generic fantasy tropes. The solution’s gentleness (increment over force) offers a non‑obvious turn that fits the setup. Not radical, but distinctly imagined and integrated.</comment>
