<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motive (“Reopen the silence”) is clear and consistently pursued through concrete micro‑choices (comparing reels, aligning the sextant, listening, using holy water). Interiority is tactile and character‑particular (map framer’s eye; rain/fresco filters). Internal friction is present but mild—his pause at the tear’s edge hints at doubt without testing him hard. The closing repricing reads earned, though the personal cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: research → film comparison → alignment/listening → activation → descent → realization. Closure lands with both a decisive change (the henge opens) and a conceptual repricing (silence as language/bridge). Orientation is strong from the outset; single POV and one scene with a brief transition hold. Cost is implied (ethical/spiritual pivot) more than dramatized, keeping it under the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: rain‑scoured fresco vault, henge geometry, subterranean chapel. Tools and environment constrain tactics (sextant aligned to the vault window; holy water as trigger; rain’s rhythm mirroring the chant). Sensory detail remains purposeful and filtered through a map framer’s priorities. The final image is charged by place, not just decorated by it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reopening and correctly “hearing” the site—tightens from observation to intervention. The key turn (choosing to listen and consecrate rather than force) escalates pressure credibly and produces consequence (the hidden staircase). However, the visible price is modest; no option is foreclosed beyond a philosophy of extraction the piece implicitly rejects. Tension operates more through deepening pattern than sharp reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance is strong around thresholds, language of silence, and empathy; images recur with reweighted meaning (map tear/altar, saints, hum/rain). Yet the theme is occasionally told rather than earned—lines like “to find empathy in the unsaid” articulate the thesis overtly. The discovery itself conveys the idea well; trimming explicit moral phrasing would heighten subtext. The final cadence lingers but flirts with sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Confident, consistent close third with a tactile perceptual signature (cartographic metaphors, acoustics, precision). Rhythm modulates with pressure; lyric without losing clarity. No head‑hopping or register drift; elision is minimal and purposeful. A touch of lofty abstraction near the end slightly blunts the voice’s restraint.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are economical and carry multiple loads (image, action, theme), with varied sentence rhythm and clean choreography. Figurative language is fresh and rarely overstacked; minimal scaffold. A few abstractions (“empathy in the unsaid,” “methodically curious”) echo nearby ideas without adding pressure. The prose largely maintains momentum through concrete action and image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Combining silent‑film comparison, a cartographer’s mindset, liturgical acoustics, and a henge “puzzle” feels fresh and coherent. The bridge‑over‑barrier repricing lands as non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in yoking ritual, tech, and cartography without genre crutches; it works. Only the explicit thematic phrasing keeps it from breaking into the very top tier.</comment>
