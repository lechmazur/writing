<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lila’s motive and competence are clear and consistent, and her choices drive the scene. However, internal contradiction is limited; she meets little real resistance and experiences minimal destabilization. Embodied emotion lands in moments like her breath catching and the pendant’s clink. The final stance (a beginning rather than an end) feels earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lens: Hybrid with Accumulative dominance at the end. Orientation is clean, and causality holds: find sextant → reroute flows → projection/equation → resolve to return. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: a charged new premise (functional resurrection) and a chosen next step. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the low on-page price keeps it mid-high rather than elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The terminal’s architecture, conduits, and atrium crater shape tactics and charge the final image. Specific sensory notes (dust, hum, moonlight, flickering lights) feel purpose-driven and filtered through an engineer’s eye. The sextant as object-as-setting tightens the atmosphere. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure coheres but remains gentle: discovery, a living hum, then successful redirection. There’s one meaningful tightening when the terminal shudders and responds. Stakes stay largely conceptual; no live option is foreclosed with cost or risk beyond fatigue/time. The success reads slightly frictionless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of repurposing and hope emerge organically from action and the equation image. However, explicit thesis-like lines (“not on nostalgia, but on the courage to repurpose the old into the new”) flatten subtext and edge toward moralizing. The final image reweights prior material but states too much. The “equation for hope” is potent yet a touch on-the-nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, diction and rhythm are controlled and apt for a technically minded yet lyrical focalizer. The perceptual signature (engineering detail blended with wonder) is distinct. No head-hopping or stance slippage. The modulation from twilight hush to humming activation reads confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with selective imagery and minimal scaffolding; few redundancies. Occasional abstraction (“maze of intentions,” “equations for hope”) risks generality but is anchored by concrete action. Rhythm varies naturally and supports the scene’s turns. No figurative muddle at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of a derelict spaceport, a star‑sextant, and redirected infrastructure as “functional resurrection” feels fresh. The pendant reprise and projected formula are memorable. Limited risk in conflict and cost keeps it just shy of standout innovation. Still, the vision coheres with authenticity.</comment>
