<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirael’s habits (walking backward, shard-mirror avoidance) and vocation concretize a distinct psychology, and the visitor’s need is clean and urgent. Interiority is embedded in action (tea-leaf geometry, annotating), with a credible, quiet authority. The final decision belongs to the visitor, but it’s earned by Lirael’s method and stance. Cost is gestured rather than deeply felt, keeping this short of the highest tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: atmosphere and pattern accrue until the advice—“walk backwards”—reweights options, and the visitor commits. Orientation is clear from the start; the structure is a single coherent scene. Closure lands as Charged Poise (a chosen path with implied cost), but the on‑page price remains conceptual rather than visceral. The causality holds, though the stakes resolve into intention rather than consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and character-filtered: damp parchment, creaking swing, ivy, cracked roof, shadow caught in glass. Environmental details (light shard, the library’s hush) meaningfully charge images and the ending. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it frames the pattern-reading and final image with precision. Sensory economy is tight and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (aid for a dying village) is announced early, and pressure coheres through the consultation. The meaningful tightening is the instruction that reframes the path (“walk backwards”) and the visitor’s acceptance. However, stakes stay mostly abstract and the price is deferred; escalation is gentle and conversation-bound. The lack of a concrete foreclosed option on-page keeps tension from peaking.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reversible exile, shadow/light, and backward-walking recur in a way that reweights the closing image without sermonizing. A few direct statements (“Exile is reversible”) lean explicit, but images do most of the work. The final gesture toward light finding a new path offers a resonant non-literal answer. Complexity is present, though the moral calculus remains relatively soft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Lirael’s perceptual biases; diction fits her role. Dialogue carries subtext (“combative tenderness”) and advances the scene. No head-hopping or stance drift; psychic distance is steady. Rhythm modulates well, with only minor risk of ornament in a few lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are clean, vivid, and efficient, often doing double duty (world + character). Occasional reiterations (“She began to annotate”) and lush metaphor density flirt with excess but rarely bog momentum. Syntax varies and images stay coherent. The final image is crisp and unblurred by purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shard-mirror archivist, tea-leaf geometry, and backward-walking as praxis synthesize into a fresh mini-myth. The library’s tacit logic feels singular rather than templated. The risk is stylistic rather than structural, and it pays off with memorable textures. A sharper on-page cost could have pushed it higher.</comment>
