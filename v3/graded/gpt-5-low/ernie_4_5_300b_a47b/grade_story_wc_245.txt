<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s drive (mapping grief to hope; finding his mother’s stillpoint) is clear and embodied through tactile perception and the ring’s haptic “translations.” His actions align with motive at each turn (turning left, digging, enduring after the pause ends). Internal contradiction is light—he’s resolute more than conflicted—so the arc leans on endurance rather than a charged renunciation. Still, the felt price of stamina and time gives the ending credibility at this scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid with a dominant causal spine: the cosmic pause enables dowsing; tree→river→dig→map→stillpoint flows as because/therefore. Orientation is swift and clean, and the single POV holds. Closure lands on the page with the stillpoint encounter (RR/DC blend), with the “pause ending” tightening pressure before the final push. The cost is modest but legible (loss of the auditory guide; long, draining trek).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is sensorially specific and functionally constraining (teeth-aching thicket; Silver Vein’s inverted flow; constellations as a clock). Details are filtered through a blind tactile/haptic bias, deepening authenticity. The environment directly shapes tactics (reading trees, wading, digging), and the ring as micro-setting charges the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reaching the stillpoint/finding the mother) is clear early and tightens when the cosmic pause ends, removing the auditory advantage. Elias’s choices escalate commitment (entering the cold river, obeying “dig,” pressing on for “hours, days”). The cost is primarily endurance and sensory strain rather than a hard trade-off, but it meaningfully narrows options. The final meeting reads earned under the established pressures.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: translation between worlds (sound/feel, map/emotion, grief/hope) culminates in “the place where feeling becomes seeing.” Recurring objects and phenomena (ring, melody, inverted river) accrue meaning rather than serving as ornaments. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing and leaves a resonant afterglow. Slight neatness of reunion tempers ambiguity but doesn’t flatten complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and plausibly filtered through tactile and auditory emphasis for a blind focalizer. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (teeth ache; cold electric water; hush of constellations). No head-hopping or stance drift; inference remains within what Elias could plausibly glean via touch/vibration. Lyric compression stays legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense but efficient; images carry multiple jobs (world, mood, stakes). Metaphor is vivid yet coherent (e.g., time pooling like mercury) without choking momentum. Minimal scaffolding and no obvious loops; rhythm varies with scene needs. A few high-flash phrases flirt with purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Imaginative synthesis—ultrasonic ecology, a haptic-translating ring, an upside-down river, and an emotional map—feels inevitable in hindsight through the mother’s melody. The final repricing (“feeling becomes seeing”) reframes the premise without sermonizing. Risks (lyric density; surreal logic) heighten stakes rather than obscure them. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
