<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (salvage/“harness the ephemeral”) and contradictory impulses (smash vs. patience; flee vs. endure) are dramatized through micro‑choices under pressure. Embodied perception (algae‑slick stone, fogged glass, pressure on ribs) grounds emotion. The shift to release reads earned, though the “she’d harnessed…by letting it go” line edges toward tidy. Some cost to her original drive is implied more than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clear anchors builds to a resonant reconfiguration: she places the vial, unsnarls the hush, releases the vault, and departs. The causal chain holds (temple → fissure → chamber → pedestal → activation), with a clean cadence shift at the unsnarling. Cost is conceptual (forfeiting captured legacy) more than concrete but legible in the final stance. Accumulative/textural lens is sustained to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The underwater temple, pressure, fissure, and bioluminescence are purposeful and constrain action; the crystal vial functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image. Sensory specificity across touch, sound, and scent (lavender and saltwater) is well‑chosen. World rules are introduced via action (sound‑trapping architecture) rather than dumping. Scale stays tight to what matters.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/release before storm damage) tightens at the chamber when the hush overwhelms and she must endure rather than flee. The key reversal is her renunciation of capture for release. The price is present but understated, with the storm clock mostly atmospheric rather than tactic‑shaping. Still, escalation coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Recurring images (hush, scent, memory) build a clear meditation on control vs. release and the danger of embalming grief. The final image of the empty, radiant vial reweights prior material with quiet ache. However, explicit theme statements (“The hush was a prison…,” “not by trapping it, but by letting it go”) verge on moralizing and reduce ambiguity. Subtext remains, but some lines say what the images already show.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Focused, consistent close third with a tactile, aquatic lexicon; rhythm modulates well from hush to surge. No head‑hopping or stance slips, and inference stays within Mara’s plausible knowledge. Lyric intensity is controlled without opacity. The voice carries pressure without resorting to exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences do multiple jobs and maintain momentum; figurative language is vivid yet mostly coherent with setting. Minor density spikes and a couple of near‑redundancies around “hush” and “memories” don’t stall the beat. The closing cadence is clean and charged. No distracting artifacts or cadence templates.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of an underwater hush‑vault, a memory‑scent vial, and release‑as‑mastery feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns arise from specific constraints (sound‑trapping design; scent unlocking vision). The final repricing of “harnessing” as letting go lands as a non‑obvious synthesis. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off.</comment>
