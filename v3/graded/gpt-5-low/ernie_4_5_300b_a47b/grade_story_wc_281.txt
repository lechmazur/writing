<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—rejecting synthetic shortcuts to build an inner map—is clear, embodied (tingling wrist) and consistent. The relationship with Mara adds humane pressure and tests his stance without melodrama. Internal contradiction is mild (skeptic yet hopeful), limiting deeper fracture under stress. The closing commitment (“Then let’s show the world”) reads earned by the week of work and the geode’s “alignment.”</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details stack from geode → somatic markers → “alignment” → public-facing decision. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; causality is coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he rejects the recall path and commits to a new method with implied cost. Cost is present but soft (foregone refund/therapy; continued risk), keeping this just shy of higher bands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The studio’s ozone, acrylic, neon, and the malfunctioning rig are vivid and filtered through Elias’s priorities. The geode functions as a micro‑setting/tool charging the final image and constraining his method. Details evolve with action (from tracing facets to using it as compass) rather than sitting as décor. World rules stay consistent and economical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—self‑authored awareness vs corporate recall—arrives early and tightens when the geode “aligns,” reweighting his choice. Escalation is primarily internal and textural; external pressure (recall, refunds) remains rhetorical rather than active. The felt price is modest, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed beyond refusing the recall. Still, the deepening is clear and protagonist‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of precision vs noise and self‑attention vs engineered shortcuts coheres through geode/somatic markers imagery. Some lines slide into thesis‑speak (“They don’t illuminate pathways—they bulldoze them”), muting subtext. The final image reframes connection as inward first, then shared, without a tidy moral. Resonance lingers via the “alignment” moment linking body memory to method.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and character‑particular; diction (“willowglass hope,” “fractally precise”) builds a distinct texture. Dialogue carries goals and subtext (concern vs defiance) and advances the scene. Rhythm modulates well between description and decision. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are tight, image‑rich, and purposeful; most sentences do more than one job. Occasional reiterations of “fractal” and pill critique flirt with redundancy but don’t stall momentum. Figurative choices stay coherent to the crystal/light motif. Final beats land with clear, uncluttered phrasing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—muscovite geode + somatic mapping after a static shock, rejecting telepathy pills—feels fresh and organically motivated. Risks a quietly conceptual frame and pulls it off without gimmickry. The “alignment” beat is an original, earned intensification. Minor sermonizing keeps it from the highest tier.</comment>
