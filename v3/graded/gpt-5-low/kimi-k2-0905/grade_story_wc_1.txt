<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied: she seeks meaning rather than profit, evidenced by tracking, waiting, then renouncing the chase. Contradictory impulses (pursue the smugglers vs. honor the “pause”) are dramatized, not declared. Micro-choices—dropping beads, warming the ledger, then crushing it—reveal values under pressure. The final refusal forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: beads, frost, ledger, and ash circle build toward the renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when she steps off the path and collects the beads back. Cost is legible: she abandons the investigation and any revenge/justice vector. Orientation is firm from the first lines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon’s cold, frost, narrowing walls, and dawn enamel constrain pace and tactics and charge the ending image. Objects-as-setting (ledger, beads, obsidian) integrate with terrain to shape choice. Environmental specificity follows occupational bias (glass, glaze, kiln). The final light across the canyon rim reweights everything.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via ledger decay, frost aging, and the ash-ring schism; options narrow to push/renounce. The decisive tightening is her choice to wait at the camp and then reverse course, paying with obsidian and reclaiming beads. Stakes remain intimate but coherent; external antagonism stays off-stage yet informs her visible cost. Quiet, earned resolution under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (frost, glass, breath, pause) culminate in a non-literal answer: purpose exists in chosen stillness with cost. The “scorched testament” revalues from map to permission, reweighting prior beats. One or two lines flirt with explicit statement, but resonance predominates through image. Emotional aftereffect lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—glasswork lexicon fused to landscape—stays controlled. Rhythm modulates well, tightening at key beats (ledger flaking, dawn wait) and opening at closure. No head-hopping or register clashes. Repetition patterns read as motif rather than tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor risk of purple repetitions (“drifting resonance,” “scorched testament”) but they function as charged refrain. Syntax varies and propulsion holds; no clarity breaks or scaffold loops. The final image is sharp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a glass artist tracking smugglers by frost, bead breadcrumbs, and obsidian-as-fare, ending in renunciation. The shift from pursuit to curated stillness feels inevitable in hindsight given the taught motifs. Risks in lyric density and concept framing pay off. Distinctive vision without gimmickry.</comment>
