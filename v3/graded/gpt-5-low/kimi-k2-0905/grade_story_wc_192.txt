<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rich interior contradiction (teaches breath while practicing suffocation) drives credible choices: inviting the boy, sharing pain, and choosing to remain. Embodied specifics (scars, lung pressure) make emotions felt rather than labeled. The Earned Stasis at the end—she stays, paying the cost of isolation—reads earned. Minor ding for a few aphoristic lines that briefly flatten complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative design coheres: arrival → ritual → threshold crossing with clear because/therefore flow. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he crosses and she receives the memory of his first breath, which reweights her practice with cost. Orientation is crisp early, and persistent constraints (the ring, the scorched circle) shape tactics. Slight thematic telling in late lines keeps this just shy of 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary and collapsed roof under starlight are vivid and purposeful; the scorched circle and the ring function as micro-setting tools affecting action. Environmental detail evolves with ritual and charges the final image (the ring cooling, “frozen tears” reprise). Sensory selection aligns with urgency. A hair more non-visual texture under peak pressure could push this higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: help the boy cross versus her compulsion to self-erasure. Pressure tightens through the scars-link and threshold pull; the ritual choice to share pain has on-page cost and narrows options. Resolution stems from her agency, not coincidence. Stakes remain intimate; a sharper moment of risk or failure would deepen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motifs (breath/suffocation, thresholds, bridges/scars) braid into a coherent inquiry about release and survival. The final breath-memory reframes her practice without tidy salvation. A few explicit thesis-like lines (“Sometimes we must learn to die properly…”) blunt subtext. Otherwise the theme arises from image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>PoV is steady and confident; diction and rhythm suit a tender, grave lyricism. Dialogue is sparse, carries subtext, and advances the ritual stakes. Minor repetition of certain constructions and metaphors grazes monotony but never breaks control. Voice feels particular to this character’s noticing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are lean, purposeful, and often do double duty (world + emotion). Reprises (“frozen tears,” “loaded emptiness”) mostly feel patterned rather than redundant, though a touch of aphorism and familiar phrasing creeps in. Syntax varies and momentum holds. Figurative density is high but coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shadow keeper conceit, breath-as-threshold ritual, and scars-link method feel fresh and integrated. The final reweighting (receiving the boy’s first breath) is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks remain within a lyrical comfort zone; still, the synthesis reads singular rather than templated. Strong originality without gimmickry.</comment>
