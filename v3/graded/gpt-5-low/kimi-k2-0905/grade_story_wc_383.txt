<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives—public skeptic driven by a private excision—are clear and deepen as she chooses to break the quarantine at a visible cost (color loss). Interiority is specific (“trespassing inside a bruise,” the three-note lullaby) and her acceptance of “haunting” credibly contradicts her brand. The final renunciation (color for memory) forecloses a path and recalibrates her charmed-skeptic persona without hedging. Slight softness: the path to ritual feels minimally resisted, with little on-page struggle beyond the price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Strong because/therefore chain: shell arrives → instructions followed → gate/pond ritual → cost → public archive → personal release. Closure lands with explicit cost and a decisive change in status (unquarantined, grayscale) and social consequence (memory pluralized). The resonant object and ritual logic are taught and paid off; no unkept set-ups. Orientation is clean early; the lens holds through the final image of commuters humming.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden is vivid and functional: hedges, iron gate, foxglove, and pond shape access and ritual mechanics, not just mood. The seashell-as-tool and the garden’s response constrain and enable actions, charging the final image (blooms as archive). Sensory specificity across visual, tactile, and aural details coheres with the premise. World rules read consistent through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming a quarantined memory) tightens into a single ritual choice with a clear trade-off (color for archive). Escalation is a steady deepening—gate to tunnel to pond to irreversible payment—driven by Mara’s agency. Lack of an explicit antagonist is offset by the cost mechanic and social stakes. Pressure could sharpen with one more friction beat, but the price paid keeps the end charged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: isolation translated into communal memory, skepticism reframed as stewardship. Recurring particulars (three-note lullaby, glass, archive) reweight at the end without moralizing; “some ghosts are futures” toes the line but lands as image not sermon. The final contagion of song turns the premise into social repricing. Emotional aftereffect lingers without tidy symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control matches pressure. Lexicon and figurative reach feel character-coherent for a media-savvy skeptic with poetic bias. Shell whispers and lullaby lines modulate tone without head-hopping. No stance slippage; compression serves cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful images; most lines do multiple jobs. Lush metaphors largely hold coherence; rhythm varies to maintain propulsion. Minimal redundancy; no template cadence or filter stacks dulling immediacy. A hair’s breadth from purple in places, but clarity and momentum remain intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a bureaucratized memory quarantine subverted by a botanical, resonance-based archive with a personal sensory cost. The seashell-as-key, color-for-memory price, and communal blossoming feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks are integrated rather than ornamental; the final reweighting (memory prefers plural) is non-obvious and earned. Specificity and concept cohere as a singular artistic stance.</comment>
