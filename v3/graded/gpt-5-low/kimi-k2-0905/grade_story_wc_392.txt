<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is specific and embodied—the lantern’s heat, the “memory hit like a train”—and her watchful competence coexists with vulnerable flashbacks. Her motives are clear (preventability and breaking control) and drive micro-choices (descending, reading, choosing what to file). The discovery of Park’s hidden journal credibly deepens her conflict by implicating her father. The closing renunciation (to speak and file the full story) feels earned by the accumulating evidence and personal recognition.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean orientation and a tight single-scene structure lead causally from descent to discovery to reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses truth-telling over the death-tinged legacy and begins walking back. Cost is primarily emotional and conceptual rather than dramatized consequence, which softens the punch. The “He knew the train was coming” motif and alcove/journal turn provide the necessary tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is tactile and pressurized (rust, damp chill, darkness “like a throat”), and the alcove/topography matter for the hidden box and tallies. The lantern functions as a charged micro-setting tool that constrains perception and anchors memory. Weather/drought remnants subtly inflect atmosphere and ethics. Specific spatial details support plausibility and mood without overloading.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—preventability and moral complicity—and escalate via concrete discoveries (tallies → box → coercion details → father link). The internal conflict interweaves credibly with the investigation. The final choice forecloses silence, but the on-page price is largely internal, with minimal external risk displayed. Tension sustains but never quite crests into a sharper trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of control, complicity, and memory-as-pressure emerge through particulars (tallies as drought-weeks, “ghost signal” of the commissioner). The lantern’s historical charge reframes the ending image effectively. One explicit statement (“didn’t require death, only the courage to speak the truth aloud”) edges toward moralizing and slightly flattens subtext. Overall resonance is strong but could trust the images more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is steady, precise, and sensorially biased to metal, heat, and darkness, matching a field investigator with a haunted register. Free-indirect control is consistent; no head-hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates well between observation and pressure surges. Diction remains within a plausible lexicon for the character while admitting lyric edges.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lean and propulsive, with images doing double duty (throat/tunnel, bones-picked numbers). Minor familiar turns (“bones picked clean,” “ghost signal”) appear but do not clog momentum. No loops or scaffolding; sentences vary and carry weight. The final image returns the lantern motif cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of a “preventable death” investigator with post-drought transit politics and a historically charged lantern feels fresh. The entanglement of public ethics and private trauma is handled with specificity rather than template beats. The turn with the tally marks and hidden journal is earned, not gimmicky. The piece risks a quiet, moral closure rather than a twist, and it works.</comment>
