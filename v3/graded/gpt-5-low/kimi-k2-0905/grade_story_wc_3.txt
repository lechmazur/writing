<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—repairing what was severed and understanding presence-to-absence—drives precise, embodied choices (transcribing iron leaves, planting the seed, humming the lullaby). Her kindly methodical trait shapes tactics and voice, and grief adds contradiction without soapboxing. The mother-daughter tie surfaces as pressure, not exposition, with earned realization at the end. Minor softness: the epigrammatic neatness of “love/time” slightly smooths ambiguity at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure builds clearly from arrival to planting to blooming to reestablished archive and new plank—closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Because/therefore linkages are coherent (decoding → activation → sprout → equation → archive). Cost registers emotionally (letting the pattern replace the body), even if material loss is light. Orientation is clean from the outset; the drive lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor above clouds is vivid and functional: iron leaves click, filings shape glyphs, rails host the seed, the arbor tilts, and the final plank materializes. Environment constrains choices and charges the last image, not mere backdrop. Sensory and professional filters (cuneiform, instruments) keep specificity tight. No inconsistent rule-breaking; details evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reestablishing the archive/meaning—tightens as each tactic risks failure and yields a new layer (Morse-to-cuneiform decoding, planting, incantation, equation). The key deepening is the symmetry insight and the mother-voice arrival, which reweights options. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than visibly sacrificial, slightly softening pressure. Agency drives every turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres—presence/absence, translation as love’s calculus, haunted ambitions reframed as unfinished love—through actions and motifs (seed, runes, lullaby, mirror-sky). Subtext often hums in image (hourglass sky; grammar of the living), though a few aphoristic lines skate close to telling. The final line lands a thoughtful repricing with tenderness rather than sermon. Depth is strong, if a touch articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close carries a distinct perceptual signature (technical-poetic lexicon, cuneiform-inflected noticing). Voice remains stable under pressure and modulates with beats; the sparse dialogue is character-specific and purposeful. No head-hopping or stance slippage; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. Occasional cleverness (“love over time is velocity”) is earned by context.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is rich yet largely efficient, with multi-tasking lines that advance image, action, and theme. Figurative density stays coherent to a metallic/linguistic palette; momentum rarely stalls. Minor risk of purple at peak resonance, but clarity holds and the closure image is crisp. Syntax varies; no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cuneiform linguistics meets speculative physics on a magnetic arbor with a knowledge seed; the mirror-sky/hourglass and “grammar of the living” feel singular. Turns grow from established motifs rather than late inventions. The piece takes stylistic risks that heighten coherence and feeling. Small deductions for a couple of thesis-leaning lines.</comment>
