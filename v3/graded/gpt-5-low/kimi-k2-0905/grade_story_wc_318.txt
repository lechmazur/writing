<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Ellery’s grief-driven agency is clear and embodied: he carries the blower to the tunnel, modulates the throttle, and kneels as he reconceives what “restoration” can mean. Contradictory impulses—hope for the impossible vs. knowledge of loss—coexist and shape his micro-choices. Specific sensory anchors (marble laugh; rubber ball of light) avoid stock sentiment. A single slightly declarative insight line edges toward thesis, but it’s earned by the scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure tightens cleanly from mechanical howl to spectral laughter to a reweighted silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he cannot resurrect Quinn, but he gives absence a form that carries into the house and his wife. Causality is intact—each adjustment (throttle, listening) leads to the next beat. Cost is felt on the page: hope hurting the body, the blower dying, and a new endurance accepted.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The echo-tunnel and blower are inseparable from outcome—acoustics enable the haunting and shape tactics. Details are purposeful and POV-filtered (concrete throat, layered chords), and the hourglass returns to charge the final image. Environment constrains choice (he selects a tunnel to summon echo) and charges the ending hum. Sensory balance and specificity are high without touristic cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coaxing laughter back) is clear and escalates texturally: roar → modulated whine → laughter → blower’s death → charged silence. Ellery’s agency drives the turn (killing and then gentling the engine), and the cost is both emotional and material. The tightening forecloses resurrection fantasies in favor of a shaped absence. Pressure stays coherent and culminates in a meaningful cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Images and events carry the theme: making room for absence rather than undoing loss, with the tunnel’s hum as lasting cost. The hourglass and blower create a motif that shifts meaning by the end. One sentence explicitly states the thematic lesson, slightly on-the-nose, but the surrounding scene earns it. The final image reweights prior material without moral handholding.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Consistent close-third lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical howl as orchestra; “marble dropped onto tile”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—roar to hush—without head-hopping or register drift. Figurative textures feel character-sourced and controlled. Elision and patterning are taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet purposeful; metaphors extend coherently (sound as breath, music, body). No significant loops or scaffold; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few rich modifiers flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially through the peak beats. Final images land crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The leaf blower–as–lullaby and echo-tunnel haunting synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling reconfiguration of grief ritual. Risks (mechanical music, anthropomorphic hourglass/handle) pay off without gimmickry. The haunting is literalized through acoustics rather than supernatural shortcut. Specificity and emotional truth make the premise singular.</comment>
