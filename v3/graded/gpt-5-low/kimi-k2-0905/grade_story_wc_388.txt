<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol’s motivation is clear and specific, and her choices consistently arise from it (stealing letters, reading the orchard, humming the sign-off, choosing to hang the diamond). The internal conflict crystallizes in “she almost dropped it,” giving a credible temptation toward amnesia. Embodied reactions (Geiger’s hush, copper taste, shame) ground emotion without therapy-speak. The final renunciation—public broadcasting over self-protection—forecloses comfort with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: broadcast rumor → orchard search → stillpoint detection → letter-reassembly → resonance access → diamond playback → public hanging of the stone. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (truth accelerates rot; she accepts ongoing exposure to lies). Orientation is clear early and the lens remains coherent. Setups (sign-off tone, stillpoint, hex scars/letters) pay off precisely at the opening and final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard, radiation, stillpoint, and tools (Geiger, gloves, letters) are vivid and functional, not postcard detail. Environment directly constrains choice (moving to the stillpoint, using resonance instead of force) and charges the ending (apples browning as truth breaks preservation). World rules are learned through action and stay consistent. Sensory specificity is purposeful across visual, aural, tactile, and taste.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pressure coherently tightens: search → locate stillpoint → open chamber → endure playback → choose distribution over relief. The cost is legible on-page (pain, shame, and the orchard decaying as consequence). Stakes remain focused: whether she will weaponize or endure truth. Escalation is character-driven, not coincidental, culminating in a meaningful, irreversible act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of truth as corrosive memory and the seductive comfort of lies emerge from particulars (sign-off tone, official fragments, playback of her own voice). The final image reweights prior material: truth accelerates rot, countering radiation’s false preservation. No moralizing undercuts the resonance; ambiguity lingers about wider consequences. The orchard’s replication/letter tessellation deepens subtext without announcing thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric third-person close maintains consistent distance and perceptual bias (investigative noticing, pattern thinking). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure: from observational to compressed intensity during playback. No head-hopping or register slippage; elisions are taught and paid off (the sign-off tone reveal). The voice feels character-specific rather than generic elevated prose.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut and purposeful; images carry multiple jobs (Geiger as music and meter; hex scars as lattice and archive). Figurative density remains coherent without muddle; no paraphrase loops or scaffolding clutter momentum. Minor lushness never obscures causality or the closure image. Sentences vary in length and propulsion to fit beat needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—radioactive orchard + stillpoint + cursed diamond that replays institutional lies—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Mechanical choices (resonance access via sign-off tone; letters mirroring apple scars) are inventive and integrated. The risk to end on conceptual repricing (truth as rot) pays off with clarity and bite. Emotional specificity (her own voice among the lies) elevates beyond concept play.</comment>
