<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Singular, embodied POV; her tactile knowledge and ritual labor feel lived-in and consistent. The sacrifice—crushing the amber bead to send the message—reads as a motivated, value-driven choice with visible cost (muteness). Interiority is lyric rather than analytical, so conflicting impulses are mostly implied instead of dramatized. Still, actions align tightly with a coherent, melancholy will.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: discovery → assembly → portal → bargain → sacrifice → consequence. Orientation is anchored early (loom, orchard), and the accumulative lyric pattern is taught and held. Closure lands on-page with cost; Earned Stasis/Charged Poise is clear in her accepted muteness and ongoing weaving. No contrivance or late rule change undermines the turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard/bamboo and the loom/puzzle act as lived tools and constraints, not mere backdrop. Sensory specificity (cider rot, lichened trunks, chime through bamboo) is purposeful and continually integrated with action. Setting charges the final image (sap beads with gold thread) and shapes tactics (weaving voice into yarn, portal anchored to loom). World-rules emerge through use, not explanation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—send a message at the price of voice—is clear and tightens through assembling the puzzle into a demand. The decisive choice (swallowing the bead, winding words into thread) narrows all options and imposes irreversible cost. Tension scales via a palpable expectancy (“raveling silence”) into a charged, quiet climax. Pressure remains coherent and character-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of sacrifice, memory, and the materiality of silence accrue through concrete motifs (amber/ant wing, swallow-shaped absence, gold thread). The ending reweights prior images without moralizing, offering a resonant answer: distance is bridged by self-erasure that begets lasting maps. Purposeful ambiguity (who receives the message) deepens, rather than blurs, the aftereffect. Subtext hums in image and omission.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close with consistent diction and sensory priorities; no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure—measured build, then a compressed, metallic taste of cost, then quiet aftermath. Figurative language is apt and pattern-taught; silence-as-fabric never collapses into abstraction. No dialogue needed; voice carries action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density prose largely avoids purple excess; images stay coherent to the textile/orchard lexicon. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; lines do multiple jobs. A few ornate phrases risk overglow, but clarity and momentum hold, especially at the peak. Final cadence is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: loomwork meets puzzle-portal and silence as medium of transport, grounded in tactile, agrarian specifics. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (the bead’s staged uses; the swallow-shaped absence). The risk of high-lyric density pays off in conceptual integrity and emotional truth. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>
