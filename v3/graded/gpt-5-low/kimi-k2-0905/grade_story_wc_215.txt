<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Alden’s motive—preserving the weight of unspoken words—is clear, embodied by ritual and the box, and culminates in a credible, costly vow. The internal conflict (mend and risk vs. abandon and scatter) is present and sharpened by the fracture. Emotion is shown through tactile images (soot motes stinging, chest-pressure) rather than labels. A slight safety lies in how composed he remains under stress, but it fits his established character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: ritual → child’s jar → fracture/dream → vow and communal sealing. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—Alden refuses flight and binds himself to keeping with visible cost (lifelong burden) and on-page consequence (fracture sealing, clover scent). Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint of the fragile box and covenant shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The oasis ruins, hives, ash-wind, and stained glass box are vivid and POV-filtered, with beekeeping details shaping perception. Setting charges choices (isolation, fire-scoured world) and the final image (box in hive shell, clover returning). The object-as-setting (box) constrains options via the fracture. Sensory range (heat, soot, weight, color) supports tone without excess tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: keep the unspoken words contained or risk catastrophe/forgetting. Pressure escalates with the child’s deposit and the emergent fracture, then tightens through the dream and dawn choice. The resolution is Alden’s agency—he renounces escape and accepts the cost, earning the communal, fragile reprieve. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential, with no reliance on coincidence to resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: stewardship of silence, communal memory, and the ethics of keeping versus release. The covenant reframed as “a comb” reweights the premise without stating a moral, and the vow bridges living and dead. Recurring images (bees, smoke, weight, glass) evolve meaningfully, culminating in clover scent as shared repair. The resonance lingers with complexity: preservation entails burden and risk.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—“mute eloquence,” “tranquilly perceptive”—maintained without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well, with long sinuous sentences balanced by clear action beats at turns. Diction remains consistent with the contemplative lens, and the brief spoken line lands with earned force. No helpful-narrator overreach; inference reads as inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Imagery density is high but coherent within the beekeeping/smoke/weight motif, avoiding mixed metaphors. Lines pull double duty—worldbuilding folded into action and choice—with minimal redundancy. A few lush constructions flirt with purple but stay legible and purposeful. Final image is crisp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a stained-glass reliquary for unspoken words in a post-fire apiary ecology, with covenant-as-comb as conceptual pivot. Turns and rules are foreshadowed and paid off without late cheats. Emotional truth (the cost of keeping) grounds the speculative conceit. Risk-taking in tone and world logic heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
