<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—she collects what walls remember—and every choice (decoding diaries, using the tapestry) flows from that drive. Interiority is embodied and particular (“air tasted of cooled ember and graphite”). Contradictory impulses are subtle (solitude vs. surrendering self to the axis) but present. The final renunciation reads earned by the accumulated acts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: three diary shards intensify toward the concrete act of laying the tapestry and re-centering the world. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration—the dragons transfer, the walls carry the story, and she becomes the displaced axis. Cost is legible in her relinquishment and the blanked tapestry. Orientation is clear early and remains coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The silo library is tactile and specific (card catalogs, grain walkways, repurposed hopper) and directly constrains the final choice. The environment charges the ending image—dragons migrating into the walls and shelves humming. Sensory selection is purposeful across taste, temperature, touch, and sound. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on locating and resolving the “displaced axis” to give shelter-dreams voice, and escalate via each diary’s discovery and revelation. The decisive tightening arrives when she acts—placing the tapestry against the concrete—accepting a cost (erasure of the fragment and a shift in her own center). Pressure is mostly internal and textural but coherent and mounting. No coincidences resolve the conflict; her agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory housed in matter, the ethics of listening, and axis reconfiguration—emerges from particulars rather than pronouncement. Recurring images (bronze quiet, tilting, dragons) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a non-literal answer: she trades singular selfhood for being the center that lets places speak. Ambiguity lingers productively about cost and continuity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice filters every detail through her perceptual bias; distance and tense are stable. Diction is consistent with the character’s tactile, archivist sensibility. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible through closure. Quotations from diaries are clean and add texture without breaking focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant, with varied rhythm and high information density; images typically do more than one job. A few metaphoric stacks risk density, but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t stall. No scaffold or loop artifacts; syntax and paragraphing support escalation. The final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept and execution feel singular: a post-dream world, an archivist who listens to walls, and a tapestry that migrates into architecture. The displaced axis notion is not gimmickry; it grounds turns and the ending’s repricing. Risks in structure and diction heighten coherence rather than obscuring it. The piece would not work unchanged in another frame.</comment>
