<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, character-specific motivation (“interpret silence as possibility”) drives concrete choices—he searches despite disbelief, takes the mirror-corridor detour, kneels, and ultimately “sings” with memory. Interiority is embodied and particular (throat ache, sanding hands). The ending renunciation—walking on, not harvesting power—reads as Earned Stasis with felt cost. Minor reservation: contradiction could press harder under direct external pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: rumour → search → wrong turn → oasis/pool → halo’s redefinition → song → release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the halo reveals that silence already contains music, and he changes stance, leaving with a new obligation. Cost is on-page (lifetime of swallowed words surfaced; he forgoes salvaging the circus for an uncertain path). Orientation and object states remain clean and coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is vividly tactile and rule-bearing (mirror corridor aging, overturned car pooling rain, wind bells), and the pool-as-sky directly constrains the discovery and the musical “page.” Recurring objects (horses, bells, halo, water) charge the final image of the glowing train. Sensory selection is purposeful across sound, touch, and sight. Environment shapes and reflects choices without static cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure deepens via pattern density: rumor skepticism → discovery → revelation that voice is already embedded → choice to sing by memory and then to leave. Stakes are primarily internal but legible, with one meaningful tightening at the halo’s real function. The felt price is subtle yet present in the renunciation at the tracks’ end. A touch more external friction could sharpen the narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Silence revalued as possibility coheres through concrete motifs (bells, hush, horses’ wooden breath, pool as score). The halo’s non-wish-granting truth avoids platitude and reweights prior images. The last lines deliver a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful and invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythmic control supports escalation; diction remains consistent with the piece’s mythic register. No head-hopping or stance slips; patterned elision is taught and paid off. Voice carries subtext via image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet largely precise, with images doing multiple jobs (“water…a sheet of music only the heart could read”). Variations in sentence rhythm sustain momentum; minimal scaffold or repetition. A few stacked metaphors risk saturation but stay coherent and legible. Final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—circus ruin, halo fragment revealing latent music, water as staff, wooden horses breathing—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from seeded particulars rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth grounds the invention.</comment>
