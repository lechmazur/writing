<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mara’s duty-bound endurance versus her hatred of the orchard creates credible internal contradiction, and her micro-choices (warmth-arrows, the oil-smeared handprint) reveal priorities under pressure. The cost—continued servitude, silence, and exclusion from the path she opens—lands on the page. Moments like pocketing the sharp-edged shell “enough to cut regret” crystallize character. Minor ambiguity about “voice” (reciting vs. curse-swallowed sound) doesn’t undercut motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene causal chain is clean: time limit, mechanical threat, constraint-driven tactic, blueprint revelation, and a decisive guiding signal. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the travelers escape as frost seals her work, and Mara remains bound. Stakes are tested in the final fork beat, with her ingenuity resolving it at cost. A slight plausibility blur about vocalization doesn’t touch the closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The environment explicitly constrains tactics (can’t step on stones; birds’ razor feathers; cliffside vantage) and charges the final image (frost fossilizing her handprints). World rules are learned through action and remain consistent. Sensory specificity is vivid and purposeful (brass wings clicking, sap faces at dusk). Setting is inseparable from the choice architecture and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Pressure escalates under a live clock and patrolling antagonism, tightening options to the final fork. Agency is unmistakable: she innovates within constraints to guide the travelers without triggering birds. The visible price is continued imprisonment and silence as her handprints fossilize. The solution grows from prior limits rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of duty-as-graceless-beauty emerges through concrete acts and the earned-stasis ending. The orchard’s accusatory faces and the mechanical birds’ “prayer” wings reweight care and hostility without moralizing. Final image reframes salvation as self-erasure and continuance of burden. No didactic overlay; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV with tight perceptual bias (tools, wind, frost) sustains control under pressure. Diction is consistent and character-sourced; cadence modulates at critical beats (nut cracking, final handprint). Tiny friction around “reciting aloud” versus a swallowed voice is the only wobble. Otherwise, stance and distance remain steady.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut, image-rich, and purposeful; metaphors are fresh and coherent (warmth-ghosts, blueprint ridges). Rhythm varies, and sentences carry multiple jobs without scaffold or loops. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but remain grounded in action. The final cadence is precise and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mechanical birds, warmth impressions, and a nut-encoded blueprint synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling tactic-and-cost sequence. The piece commits to its premise’s implications without hedging. The closing reconfiguration (saved strangers; self-bound savior) reads both surprising and retrospectively necessary. Risks in imagery and mechanism pay off cleanly.</comment>
