<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lira’s contradiction—professional detachment vs. a need to feel—drives credible choices (hesitation, pressing the petal, letting the chemist go). Embodied interiority (“pulse lied often and well,” “scent bloomed like a bruise”) keeps emotion specific. The final renunciation of her armor is earned by on-page costs (absorbing clients’ pain). A few thesis-like lines verge on diagnostic clarity but don’t undercut motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clean: sensory/emotional density builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands when she sheds detachment and accepts hurt as proof of reachability—a before/after with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early; the sun’s descent and “transformation” provide cadence. No causality gaps; the chemist’s offering triggers the turn that the ending pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vividly rendered across senses and filters perception (resin, static, fossilized sap). The setting charges the final image (amber cooling to stone; cathedral of static) and frames the ritual act. Recurring objects (amber dust, petal, sap pool) evolve meaningfully. World rules (scent-as-memory, static) are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking her emotional armor to gain real empathy—tightens the moment she applies the petal. Pressure escalates as layered emotions crest and culminate in her choosing to endure rather than sell. The cost is legible: she absorbs pain and potentially undermines her own business premise. Quiet, but the cadence shift and renunciation read earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of insight vs. empathy emerges through action and image (counterfeit vials vs. “feel what they felt”). The final repricing—pain as proof of reachability—resonates beyond plot. A couple of explicit statements (“insight without empathy was just surveillance”) edge toward didactic, softening subtlety. Still, motifs (half-truths, static, amber) support layered subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent close third; sensory lexicon matches Lira’s world. Dialogue is minimal but charged with subtext and function (“You’ll feel what they felt. But not why.”). Rhythm modulates well at the peak without head-hopping. A few ornate turns flirt with purple, yet remain coherent and character-plausible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs and momentum holds. Figurative language is frequent but largely precise (“bloomed like a bruise,” “cathedral of static and scent”) with no muddled metaphors. Minimal redundancy or scaffold; syntax varies to support pressure. Slight lushness could be trimmed, but it doesn’t blur causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perfume-as-emotion with static-electric sensing and fossilized sap feels fresh and integrated. The “subsume not erase” concept reweights the emotional arc in a non-obvious way. Turns and images read inevitable in hindsight given Lira’s trade and flaw. Bold yet disciplined risk-taking without gimmickry.</comment>
