<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (finding “the frequency of belonging” tied to her vanished parents) is clear and consistently embodied through tactile choices—the descent, the pull, the acceptance of the map. The pilgrim’s presence applies gentle pressure without commandeering agency. Interiority is vivid if streamlined; contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. yearning) are implied more than dramatized. The final stance shift is earned, though the visible cost is mostly conceptual rather than materially felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is clean: arrival → invitation → press pull → revelation → decision. The accumulative/textural lens holds and closure lands via a charged reconfiguration when the printed map literally sings her name. Causality is intact, though the cost register is soft and relies on inference of departure rather than an on-page tradeoff. Orientation is anchored early without confusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, the broken astrolabe, and twilight light are sensorially precise and filtered through Mara’s professional gaze. The hand press and setting constrain action—the lever pull in this place at dusk is the hinge of the story. Recurring objects (chip, press, dome) charge the final image as she turns to the stars with the living map. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes (belonging/parents) are signaled early and tighten at the press with the lever invitation. The decisive act is clear, but resistance is minimal and external pressure is gentle, keeping escalation largely internal. The price—leaving her present life—reads as an implied cost rather than a tested choice. Still, the cadence shift at the press provides a credible deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Images (stars, frequencies, printing) coherently braid into a theme of belonging as something tuned rather than found. The final image reweights earlier details without moralizing, though lines like “It prints belonging” verge on on-the-nose. Subtext works in the tactile ritual of printing and the grandmother’s remembered charts. The piece invites reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and perspective-consistent, with professional attentiveness in Mara’s noticing. Dialogue is spare but purposeful, carrying subtext and forwarding action. Rhythm modulates effectively at the lever pull and reveal. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean and propulsive; images do double duty for atmosphere and meaning. Figurative language is vivid but controlled, with only a few repeated epithets (“perpetually surprised”) flirting with redundancy. Syntax varies and momentum is maintained without scaffolding. The final lines land crisply on image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of a type foundry matrix chip, a hand press, and cosmic frequencies inside an ancient observatory feels fresh and specific. The central turn (printing a living star-map that sings a personal frequency) is inventive and inevitable in hindsight. The originality serves character and theme rather than novelty for its own sake. Minor exposition lines slightly dull the edge but don’t undercut the ingenuity.</comment>
