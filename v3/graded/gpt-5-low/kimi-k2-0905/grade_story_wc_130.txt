<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent drive—to translate grief into motion—expressed through concrete micro-choices (aligning the eyes, sealing the astrolabe). Interiority is character-specific (primes as coping, “a conjurer does not cry”). Visible cost: relinquishing the astrolabe and seedlings to the stone, accepting ambiguity. Minor tilt toward abstraction in a few lines, but embodied beats dominate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is crisp: silence → eyes on mosaic → drip triggers opening → astrolabe indicates → projection → seedlings → resumed dripping. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: the orchard reawakens while loss remains. Orientation is clean from the opening and the lens is held. The final sealing action locks in the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard and its mechanics are vivid and functional: chips cause the slip, drip triggers the opening, tree and stalactite shape tactics. Objects-as-setting (mosaic, eyes, astrolabe) constrain choices and charge the final image. World rules are learned by doing, not told. Atmosphere and specificity serve meaning, not postcard color.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring motion/meaning under ambiguous loss) tightens through one decisive intensification when the drip catalyzes the mosaic. Agency drives turns; solutions demand trade-offs (surrendering tools, accepting limits). Cost is felt and the reopening doesn’t erase loss, which keeps pressure honest. Quiet but unmistakable escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: “solve for motion” manifests in choices, not moralizing. The integral-with-heart and “limit I could approach” reprice grief without neat closure. Final cadence sustains buried optimism while honoring cost. Symbols recur with altered weight rather than being declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a mathematical-mystic lexicon that fits the conjurer. POV distance is steady; no leakage or over-explaining. Rhythm modulates at turns (hush, drip-counting) to support pressure. Elevated diction feels earned by the world and focalizer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do multiple jobs (eyes as moons, tools, lenses). Figurative language is rich but coherent; no muddled metaphors or loops. Minor risk of lushness never slows causality or blurs beats. Opening and final lines land with precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis of math, magic, and geology yields fresh images and tactics. Turns arise from established elements; nothing feels gimmicked. Emotional truth—acceptance without certainty—grounds the novelty. Bold yet integrated choices heighten resonance.</comment>
