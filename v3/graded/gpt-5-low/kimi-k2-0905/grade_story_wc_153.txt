<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent (unsent letters, “the seam where an apology waits”), with concrete micro-choices under pressure (taking the shard, kneeling, speaking). Interiority is embodied through idiosyncratic images rather than labels. Contradictory impulses—flight vs. return—are dramatized, not told. The change (speaking the apology) forecloses a path and carries a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative-causal flow is clean: follow the medium → shard to mirror → corridor → apology → reconfigured world. Closure lands on the page with cost, and the final reconfiguration (condensation message to brother, repaired rainspout) is earned. Orientation is clear early (mangrove labyrinth at dusk, following a medium). The lens holds through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and water’s moonlit healing actively shape options (path closes behind, corridor opens, root-lungs). The shard-as-tool functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (refitted rainspout pulsing). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across senses. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to apologize and repair the sibling bond) is active from the opening and tightens through decisive steps. The pivotal choice to speak in the seam carries a price—vulnerability, relinquishing the old posture—and reweights all futures. Escalation is coherent and character-driven, not coincidental. The resolution emerges from agency, not convenience.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme of apology, return, and the ethics of choice emerges organically through recurring objects (shard, condensation, letters) that change meaning. Subtext hums in images (moonlight healing, water closing behind) rather than thesis statements. The ending reweights the premise: tenderness becomes path, not destination. No moralizing undercuts resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinctive, stable lyric POV sustains specificity without head-hopping. Diction (“fierce tenderness,” “tide-pool silver”) is voice-true and modulates under pressure. Elision is pattern-taught and paid off; certainty matches what the narrator can infer. Sparse dialogue functions as action and subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet controlled; images do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Metaphor density is high but patterned and coherent; minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops. Rhythm varies well across beats and the final image is crisp. Only a faint risk of overrichness, but it doesn’t blur causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: mangrove spirits, a gargoyle shard as conduit, and condensation-messages reframing apology as temporal seam. Risks in lyric density and mythic logic heighten rather than obscure stakes. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (window writing → condensation command → seam). The vision feels singular and memorable.</comment>
