<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (decode inscriptions before the star dims) and actions align (travel, speak petal-syllables, place the telegram, copy the inscription). Interiority is specific and embodied through insomnia and the tactile daylily/ink motifs. The line “I am the chronicler, but also the chronicled” leans declarative and slightly on-the-nose, softening complexity at the peak. The relationship with the boy evolves credibly via his constraint (constellation-speech) and release (speaking her name).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: observatory setup → star-dimming doorway → inscriptions resist → speaking/placement → healing → shared-burden reframe. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (temple’s purpose fulfilled and crumbling; she carries an echo). Orientation is clean from line one; the variable star clock adds gentle pressure. Causal throughlines are coherent without mechanical over-explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory and its tools (dome, star-charts, refractor) are vivid and used, not merely described; they constrain method and timing. The daylily-telegram serves as object-as-setting, charging the final image and physically healing the instrument. Environmental transformation (dome to desert sky) deepens atmosphere without losing spatial coherence. The final sealing of the dome and sand-walk extend the setting’s consequence into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (witness/translate before the star’s fade; transmute grief) are signaled early and tighten at the dimming doorway. Agency drives turns: speaking petal-syllables, setting the flower to “drink” starlight, placing the telegram to heal. The cost is felt conceptually (accepting shared echo; temple’s end) rather than visceral, but it reads. Tension is primarily interior/lyric, yet it escalates decisively around the star’s pulse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of shared burdens becoming shared light accrue through concrete acts (petal syllables, healing ink, the boy’s first human name). Subtext works in the reciprocal witnessing and the observatory/temple mirror. The explicit sentence on the wall risks didacticism but is diegetic and earned by patterning. The final whisper extends the ethic without collapsing into sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature (ink, petals, stellar rhythms) and controlled modulation at turns. A brief “we” moment during the liminal overlay is purposeful and legible, not head-hopping. Diction remains consistent with the narrator’s sensibility and the setting’s register. Dialogue is sparse but distinct (boy’s constellation-speech) and functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dense imagery serves multiple jobs and remains coherent; rhythm varies with pressure. Minimal redundancy; motifs recur with purpose rather than loop. No filter-verb stacks or muddled metaphors in peak beats; syntax stays clear across transformations. A few lines edge toward purple but are anchored by action (e.g., pigments “drinking” starlight tied to the next causal beat).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: variable-star Morse as ritual, daylily-pressed telegram as map and healing medium, and the boy’s constrained speech unlocking a human name. The liminal observatory/temple overlay feels inevitable once taught. Risks in lyric-mythic mode pay off with a concrete closure image. The premise commits fully without hedging or generic sentiment.</comment>
