<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mira’s interiority is vivid and particular, her loss driving a tactile, imaginative practice that yields concrete micro-choices (the loupe, the rotation, the withheld explanation). The contradictory impulses—yearning for scent yet committing to meaning without molecules—are credible and embodied. The final renunciation/refusal to explain reads earned. Minor neatness in the epiphany is balanced by specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds to a clean CR/RR: the clock “breathes,” and her stance toward loss reconfigures. However, a continuity break undermines causal coherence: she “nests” the screw back inside the base, yet later “slipped” it into her pocket. Despite that, the closure beat still lands conceptually with felt cost and a legible before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The water clock, fog, and tools function as charged micro-setting; the float and drip pattern shape perception and the final image. The clock’s mechanics and the shop’s atmosphere filter through her professional bias, with the tool charging the last beat. Strong, selective specificity; no white-room moments. High-band capped below 9 due to global gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure deepens through a single meaningful tightening: solitude with the clock catalyzes her interpretive commitment, culminating in the rotation and tacit handoff. Stakes are internal but tangible (meaning vs. sensory loss), and the cost is acceptance without cure. The escalation is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: absence as a mode of knowing, objects as repositories of human breath and time. The recurring images (drip, breath, screw, fog) reweight at the end without sermonizing. One slightly overt line (“maps of emotional terrain”) skirts didacticism but is earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third-person with a distinctive perceptual signature—tactile, mechanical, and birth-inflected—remains steady. Rhythm modulates well from hush to charged poise; dialogue is minimal and purposeful. No head-hopping; inference stays within her plausible knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-dense, and mostly disciplined; metaphors (diaphragm, newborn gasp) cohere to the birth/time motif. A few lines verge on purple but retain clarity and momentum. The continuity slip is routed to structure; line-level artifacts and loops are minimal.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—an anosmic aromatherapist reading a water clock via a midwife’s screw—feels fresh and inevitable once seen. Risks in object-centric lyricism pay off with a memorable final reconfiguration. The piece avoids template beats and delivers specific ingenuity.</comment>
