<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives—containment vs. release—are concrete and embodied through tools, jars, and the latch. Interiority is specific to her profession and grief; micro-choices (what to carve, where to place the latch) reveal values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (“cages were made to open”) surface without tidy resolution. The earned endurance at the end carries felt cost without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly; the closure lands as a charged poise with the finished carving and hung latch. Orientation is crisp from the first line, and the kettle/rain/light frame a single continuous window. The cost is legible in the blood-sawdust image and in the refusal to “close the cage” on memory. Recurring objects (latch, blank, kettle) persist to shape the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The skylight loft, rain, kettle, and tools are vivid and purposeful, consistently filtered through a circus craftsperson’s attention. Environment and object-as-setting constrain action (light angle for carving; kettle clock; the nail by the skylight) and charge the last beat. Sensory range is balanced (scent of wet asphalt, steam, sawdust) without tourist cataloging. The world coheres and evolves as the storm passes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether and how to contain Emil—tightens as carving advances from first cut to complete piece to hanging the latch. The escalation is interior but decisive under the chosen lens; the act of carving reweights grief into practice. The price is carried in revisiting the wound (“sawdust that soaked up blood”) and in choosing endurance over closure. A clear cadence shift lands with the command words and jars.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres around memory as cage/key and the ethics of opening/closing, built from concrete circus craft rather than abstractions. Recurrences (latch, commands, sawdust, “here and gone”) reweight at the end. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“memory can be both cage and key”) but is earned by particulars. The final image invites reflection without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close holds steady, with a tactile, grief-honed lexicon that feels character-specific. Rhythm modulates well across calm and charged beats; the imperative commands near the end sharpen voice. No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful and legible. Diction remains coherent with only mild flourish at peak moments.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images that do more than one job. Figurative texture is rich but controlled by recurring motifs, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal redundancy; momentum is maintained despite lyricism. A couple of elevated turns risk purple but don’t blur sense or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The widow-lion-tamer-carpenter synthesis feels singular; jars labeled with wry taxonomy and the “rust-hued peace” image are striking. Risks (lyric density, accumulative structure) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The reconfiguration via latch placement and command reprise is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth overrides any trope echoes.</comment>
