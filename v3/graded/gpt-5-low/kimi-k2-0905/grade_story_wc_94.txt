<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—archiving a censored voice—drives concrete, risky choices, from the climb to dissolving the manuscript and choosing sky over presses. Interiority is embodied (mask, scars, timer) and particular. The “furiously tranquil” contradiction plays in-scene rather than as label. Minor note: her leap to “broadcast into static” leans conceptual but remains earned by the lightning-triggered revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm/darkroom pattern tightens until the lightning overexposure reweights options and the timer’s near-final tick freezes into a charged poise. Closure lands on-page with cost (renouncing terrestrial dissemination, possible disappearance). Orientation is clear from the outset; props persist and evolve. The causal thread is lyric but legible: lightning → revelation → upward transmission decision.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, storm, telescope, darkroom, and timer shape choices and cadence, not just mood. Lightning physically alters the print to force the conceptual turn; the dome, slit, and mount constrain her actions and final alignment. Sensory specificity is precise and POV-filtered (diesel paper, halide, rain-smell). The setting charges the closing image (timer at one second; dome tracking a hole no instrument records).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving forbidden speech—intensifies through one meaningful turn: the accidental overexposure reframes tactics from print to cosmos. The timer and storm act as pressure, narrowing options and catalyzing the renunciation of earthly routes. Costs read: forfeiture of a safer path, self-erasure hints, and leaving nothing traceable but a stain. Tension is continuous though largely internal and image-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres: erasure versus persistence (“what is erased still orbits”), scars as cartography, and translation into a different archive. Recurring objects (timer, mask, dish) and images reweight at the end without moralizing. A couple of aphoristic lines edge close to statement but are grounded by scene action. The final charged poise answers the core question via image, not thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from red gloom calm to lightning shock). No head-hopping; stance remains tightly bound to Mara’s perceptions. Patterned elisions are taught and paid off (vigil/timer motif). Slight flourish risk never breaks plausibility for this educated, poetic POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and information-dense, frequently doing double duty (image plus action or theme). Occasional metaphor stacking skirts purple but maintains coherence; few, if any, paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies, and sentence craft supports momentum and hush at the end. Minor compression opportunities exist, but closure clarity remains sharp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Transmuting a censored poem into photochemical starlight via an observatory is a fresh synthesis; the lightning-induced “revelation” turns cliché risk into specific, earned causality. The timer-as-cadence and scars-as-cartography feel singular here. The final “vessel unmoored from jurisdiction” image is bold without gimmick. High-concept and human cost integrate cleanly.</comment>
