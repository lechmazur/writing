<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hoshiko’s motive (to understand why stories magnetize to certain people) is clear and drives tactile choices: aligning the wing to sun, painting it, allowing it to dissolve, and choosing to teach invisibility. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific (dye master lens), though internal contradiction remains mild; the discovery arc lacks a sharp, conflicted pushback. The decision to sacrifice the wing functions as a credible, character-rooted cost. Overall strong, if more contemplative than pressurized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: wing → projections → painting → dissolution → repurposed mission. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—becoming a channel/teacher rather than collector—with an on-page cost (dissolving the wing) and a reweighted final stance. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp by the opening lines, and all setups pay off. The causal weave is soft but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating rock teahouse, silk tethers, valley mist, and sunlit window are vivid and functional; tracking sun trails through the window constrains method and enables visions. Tools (wing, tea, brush, rice paper) are specific, tactile, and filtered through a dye master’s priorities. The setting evolves (thermals lifting, then descent) and charges the final image. Economy and purposefulness of detail remain high.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is intellectual/spiritual: grasping narrative magnetism and choosing a stance toward it. Pressure tightens through method (sun tracking), revelation (visions), and a real forfeiture (letting the wing dissolve) that narrows options toward teaching rather than collecting. Costs are conceptual and aesthetic more than visceral; still, they register. The escalation is measured but sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—vessel vs channel, disappearing inside stories—emerges organically from recurring objects and acts, not just assertion. The final realization reweights prior images (wing, dye, light) without a pat moral. A few lines tilt toward explicit articulation (“she understood now why...”), but the imagery carries most of the lift. The resonance lingers as a lived stance, not a slogan.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third-person close with a dye-master’s perceptual bias sustains across the piece. Rhythm and diction are controlled and consistent; no head-hopping or stance drift; elision patterns are taught and paid off. Absent dialogue is not missed in this mode. Elevated register fits the fable-like tone without breaking plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet largely precise; images do multiple jobs and propel meaning. Minor repetition (“valley-mist wonder,” “quietly explosive”) edges toward motif rather than loop, and figurative density remains coherent. No mechanical scaffolds or cadence templates drag momentum. The final image lands cleanly without purple blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Donor-heart narrative magnetism, a wing used as optical key, and a dye master’s praxis synthesize into a fresh, specific vision. Turns feel earned from established materials, with a non-obvious yet inevitable repricing at the end. Risks (lyric accumulative mode, surreal mechanics) heighten coherence rather than obscure it. The piece reads singular in subject and execution.</comment>
