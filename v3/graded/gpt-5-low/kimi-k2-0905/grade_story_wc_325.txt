<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to stand by the unremembered—anchors every choice, and her claustrophobia provides a credible, embodied counterpressure. Micro-choices (crawling deeper, speaking names, placing her glove over Voss’s) reveal a hierarchy of values under stress. Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (“crashing hush,” “speed of regret”). The rescue runs a touch smoothly, with little hesitation once the path is revealed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with an accumulative drive: the gold fleck’s pattern teaches the rules, each name-calling beat enacts them, and the reversal lands on the page. Closure is a decisive change with cost: endurance of fear transposes into an ongoing obligation to remember. Orientation is clean from the start, and the tide clock recurs meaningfully at the end. Causality holds—no late rule change or soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The facility’s evolving geology (“concrete giving way to living basalt”) constrains action and mirrors Mara’s internal pressure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful across senses (brine-thick air, volcanic glass scraping). The gold fleck functions as a charged object-as-setting, shaping path and final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and tightens as the tunnel narrows and the names exact a price (the gold thinning). Mara’s endurance under panic is the operative agency, culminating in initiating the return with Voss. The signal recoils rather than contests, so escalation is more deepening than reversal. Still, the pressure coheres and the cost is felt in her fear and the charged obligation at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Memory, witness, and the ethics of naming emerge through concrete acts rather than pronouncements. The recurring images—gold fleck, tide, cable—reprice themselves in the final beats, shifting “crashing hush” into ordinary surf. The last image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: remembrance as return rather than anchor. No sermonizing despite clarity of stance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically precise and stable in a close third, with patterning (“crashing hush,” “phase transition”) taught and paid off. Diction matches the character’s embodied attention and the story’s speculative registers. Rhythm modulates with pressure, maintaining legibility. Minor risk of over-lushness, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; few, if any, scaffolding lines. Figurative language is controlled and coherent to the world’s logic (phase transitions, cable-born voice). Sentence rhythm supports momentum through the crawl and release. No notable loops or muddled metaphors in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Undersea cable as haunt lives fresh here: signal as entity, codex gold as navigational physics, names as counter-technology. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight—the technicians’ fate, the gold’s mechanics, and the tidal clock mesh. Bold yet disciplined risks pay off without obscuring clarity. The final reweighting (obligation over fear) deepens originality beyond concept.</comment>
