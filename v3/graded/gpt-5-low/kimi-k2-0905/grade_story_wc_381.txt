<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—atonement for a code-prophecy that shattered his master—and his micro-choices (wing to sternum, stepping into the brook, speaking the inverse “.”, swallowing the sphere) align under pressure. Interiority is embodied through tactile, auditory, and somatic cues rather than label-thought. The visible cost—carrying the rotating hush inside his chest—reads as earned endurance. Slight limitation: internal contradiction is present but subtle; he rarely wavers, so tension skews toward ritual mastery over moral/belief friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear from the outset and escalates coherently to the decisive hush-swallowing. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the causal chain is legible: mapping → sigil → cranes → anti-sound → counter-code “.” → ingestion with cost. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the world cleared, the burden internalized. The price is on-page and persists into the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The brook setting is not ornamental; water and reflection enable replication of cranes and provide the ritual’s engine and constraint. Sensory specifics (moonlight glazing, cricket code, cold grip) are purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image (brook resuming its narrative, birdsong “without code”). Rules remain consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (hush the prophecy) is signaled early and tightens when the prophecy fights back via cricket drums, forcing a high-cost tactic. The inverse utterance and swallowing constitute a narrowing of options with a felt price that alters his future. Internal and external threads interweave cleanly without coincidence rescues. The only minor limit is that the opposition remains conceptual rather than embodied, keeping the pressure lyrical rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: tranquility as mastery of fire, not its absence; silence as an active, burdened craft. Recurring images (cranes, brook, code, period) deepen and reprice by the end without moralizing. The final acceptance of carrying hush is a resonant answer to the initial question of how to quiet coded prophecy. Ambiguity remains meaningful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a strong perceptual signature; syntax modulates with pressure and remains legible. Diction coheres to the character’s ritualized lens and avoids register slips. Purposeful elisions (the “.” as spoken) are taught and paid off. No head-hopping; POV certainty matches what he can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet disciplined; images do double duty and momentum rarely stalls. Repetition (“terrestrially cosmic,” “tranquil blaze”) reads as motif rather than loop, and figurative logic holds. Minor density surges flirt with overrichness but do not obscure action or closure. Rhythm supports escalation and soft landing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: mapping silence as cartography, code-prophecy resisted by a spoken period, origami cranes replicating via reflection, babies crying in binary. Risks (conceptual antagonist, extreme lyricism) heighten stakes and cohere under the chosen lens. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established rules. Freshness resides in both conceit and emotional cost.</comment>
