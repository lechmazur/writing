<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mireya’s motives (duty, grief, truth-telling) drive each turn, and her micro-choices under pressure—trading future details, choosing to broadcast—are costly and character-specific. Embodied reactions (“sand closed over my ankles like shackles”) keep emotion concrete. The internal contradiction between filial loyalty and public duty culminates credibly in the final decision. A slight neatness in how swiftly she deciphers the lagoon’s “encryption” keeps this shy of perfect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: lagoon summons her grief → she infers its rules → barters future for past → obtains proof → broadcasts during the peace accord. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: she forecloses safer futures to publish the truth now. The price is on-page (“futures closing like doors,” risk of crucifixion). Orientation is solid from the zeppelin tilt onward, and the drive lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, dunes, and floating library are vividly particular and consistently filtered through her professional and personal stakes. Setting constrains and enables tactics: the lagoon’s retrocognitive trap forces barter; the zeppelin and loudhailer make the public reading possible, charging the final image. Details like shells-as-grammar and cannons for the peace accord integrate world rules with action. Sensory texture is rich without disorienting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens from discovery to barter to the mother’s confession, culminating in a risky public act timed against the accord. The trade of future for past is a meaningful deepening that narrows options and creates felt cost. Stakes are coherent—truth versus personal and political safety—and resolved via protagonist agency. Minor convenience in her swift system-building is outweighed by sustained escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as encryption, testimony versus repression, the intimate cost of truth. The lagoon’s rules and the shell grammar externalize the ethics of archives without sermonizing. The final image—speaking names above the very lagoon that once swallowed light—reprices the whole premise with social and personal cost. Ambiguity remains around the mother’s betrayal, enriching the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first-person voice with a professional’s perceptual bias (“civil-rights archivist,” “isolation protocol”) and sensuous metaphors. Distance control stays steady; elision serves pressure rather than obscuring it. Rhythm modulates effectively from discovery to proclamation. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density and image economy; lines often do double duty (world + theme). Figurative language is lush but coherent to the conceit; minimal redundancy. One or two phrases flirt with purple (“liquid night under day”), yet cadence and clarity hold, including at closure. Mechanics are clean; momentum never stalls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—retrocognitive lagoon that encrypts within witnesses, shells-as-grammar, a zeppelin library broadcasting testimony—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from character and established rules, not late gimmicks. Risks (lyric density, high-concept rules) pay off and heighten stakes. The final reconfiguration is fresh and memorable.</comment>
