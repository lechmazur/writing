<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (to understand healing) drives concrete choices—kneeling, winding, writing, planting. Interiority is specific and embodied (ink-stained fingers, aching joints), with a credible cost in relinquishing her vocation. Internal contradiction is present but soft (devotion to explained absences vs. returning to the world). The final renunciation reads earned by prior acts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: images and acts compound toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Set-ups pay off (thread as presence; explained absences becoming presences; planting the last inch). Cost is legible in relinquishing the work and identity she’s built. Orientation is crisp from the first line and the ending cadence is clean.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden, fountain, leaf-pattern paths, and harbor horn are vivid and purposeful. The environment charges the final image (paths spelling her words; thread planted in soil) though it rarely constrains tactics. Object-as-setting interplay (thread/garden) is strong and felt. Sensory selectivity aligns with the lyric pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting absence to presence) tightens as faces appear, portals open, and the thread shortens. The meaningful narrowing occurs when the thread reveals herself and she chooses to plant the final inch, foreclosing her prior path. The cost—identity and profession—reads on the page without melodrama. Pressure grows coherently under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of chosen endings, presence/absence, and healing emerge through action and recurring images with a resonant reweighting at the end. Occasional explicit statements (“never been about death… choosing one’s own ending”) slightly over-announce what the images already carry. Still, the final seed-planting reframes the premise with emotional clarity. Subtext persists in the portals’ curated memories.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stable close third with lyrical diction and a distinct perceptual signature; compression is purposeful and legible. Rhythm modulates well, especially around the faces/portals and the horn’s call. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what she can infer. Voice is confident without overreaching register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax and varied cadence; images often do multiple jobs. Minor over-explicit lines and a few abstract nouns (geography of healing) flirt with summarizing theme but do not stall momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent across beats. Final line lands with image-based resolution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a living-obituary writer harvesting a palace weft-thread of presences in a shadowed garden where absences convert to portals. The self-as-first-client turn feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric accumulative mode, metaphysical mechanics) are executed cleanly. Concept and image-set feel singular and memorable.</comment>
