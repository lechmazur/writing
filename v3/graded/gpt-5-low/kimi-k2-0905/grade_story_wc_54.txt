<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Alya’s motives and methods are concrete and consistent, and her choices (rerouting flows, mapping with the sextant) drive the piece. Interiority is specific and embodied (“Pressure times area equals possibility”). The main limitation is a lack of real inner contradiction or friction; she meets few setbacks and remains serenely competent. The final renunciation—choosing repair over escape—lands but without much visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and a coherent Hybrid lens holds: accumulative texture married to causal steps (find core → reroute glycol → birds/fountain animate → realization). Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the inward-facing meridian reframes the “maze” and the terminal gains a “heartbeat.” Cost is modest but present in the foreclosed fantasy of departure and the acceptance of ongoing labor. Set-ups (sextant, pictographs, canal) all pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terminal is richly particular and tactically relevant: dry pumps, choked filters, glycol lines, and the brass birds directly constrain choices and produce effects. Environmental details evolve causally (pressure equalizes; birds generate wind that lifts tickets; fountain trembles). The setting charges the ending image (equations fluttering in the breeze of resurrected wings; “cathedral” heartbeat). Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through Alya’s professional gaze.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (revive flow/hope) and escalation proceeds via functional deepening (from mapping to rerouting to system revival to holographic ethos). However, resistance is minimal—valves open, welds hold, and success arrives without a significant reversal or forced trade. The fountain tremor and drone reboot add texture, not pressure. The ending is earned by agency but the price paid remains light.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of reclamation over perfection and repair over escape emerge organically through action and image (the sextant as inward compass; the maze reframed as test). The hologram’s lines risk explicitness but feel grounded in-world and are earned by events. The final inward-pointing meridian and “measure what returns” provide a resonant non-literal answer. Thematic integration is sustained without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is confident, consistent, and character-filtered; diction and metaphors align with a technically minded yet wonder-driven focalizer. Brief dialogue is natural and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well between precision and image without head-hopping. The voice maintains control under peak beats (activation, fountain) without slipping into explanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and efficient; many sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, action, theme). Metaphoric density is high but coherent to the voice, with minimal redundancy or scaffold. A few stacked images flirt with purple, yet clarity and propulsion are not hindered. The final image is sharp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—carnival-ghosted spaceport, hydraulic resurrection, sextant-as-compass inward—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “maze of intentions” reframing is non-obvious yet well-seeded. Risk-taking in tone and imagery heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. The piece commits to its premise without retreat into cliché.</comment>
