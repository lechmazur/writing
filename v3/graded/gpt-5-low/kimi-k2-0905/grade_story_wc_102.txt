<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and specific (to find where unused love is stored), and her choices—unfolding the camera, initiating the breath ritual, surrendering the bead—align and intensify under pressure. Interiority is embodied (purple-tasting breath, hairline fracture) and avoids therapy-speak. The man is a resonant mirror with limited depth but functions under pressure. The final renunciation (giving the bead and distributing love) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: breath, projection, and petals accrue to a concrete threshold (the door on the ground glass) and reconfigure options into the orchard. Closure lands on the page with cost (relinquishing the tear, facing withheld kindness, a healed fracture). Orientation is clear within the first lines (who/where/why), and every turn grows from prior particulars. The final cadence (distributing droplets) reads as an earned stasis/CR.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The viaduct and wisteria are not decorative; scent and petals thicken with breath, and the environment literally produces the door image. Tools-as-setting (camera obscura, ground glass) constrain tactics and charge the final images. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, integrated with action. The closing modulation (air becomes considerate) reweights the space.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform unused love before it rots the heart) tightens through a clear deepening: synchronized breath → glowing projection → door → orchard of withheld kindness. The cost is emotional and tangible (surrendering the bead, confronting complicit moments). Pressure remains coherent without an antagonist and is protagonist-driven. Gentle tempo but unmistakable narrowing of options toward a single healing act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through enacted images: storage as posture, breath as reciprocity, forgiveness as distribution. The orchard of withheld kindness is an earned symbolic field, not declared moral. One explicit line (“storage is not a place but a posture”) edges toward telling, but it's supported by concrete action. The final transparency shift reweights the premise without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice filters every detail through a singular perception; cadence modulates with pressure (thickened breath to cooled knitting). Dialogue is minimal but freighted with subtext and advances stakes. No POV slippage; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. Rhythm supports the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (petals as time, breath, and tenderness index). Lyrical richness skirts purple but remains legible and propulsive; minimal redundancy and no figurative muddle at the peak beats. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean. A few intensifiers could be trimmed, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Camera obscura + breath mechanics + wisteria ecology synthesize into a fresh ritual logic. “Pilgrim of sparks” and the foggy lucidity tone feel singular, not ornamental. The door-on-condensation turn and the orchard of withheld kindness are inventive yet grounded by prior beats. Bold choices heighten meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
