<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Chen’s desire to “transpose life into a new key” is precise and motivating, with credible, embodied conflict between spycraft habits and a longing for erasure. The micro-choices—palm the film, plant the fortune, time steps to the lens—reveal values under pressure. Dialogue with the keeper cleanly registers status and history without overexposition. The renunciation (leaving) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: fortune-writing and microfilm maneuvers lead to planting the message and orchestrating departure, culminating in the skiff escape. The lighthouse-as-darkroom and the prophetic line reweight choices into a resonant, on-page closure with cost. Orientation is firm within the first lines, and the accumulative/textural lens holds. The final image (island “inside” him) closes with a decisive stance shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse, Fresnel lens, rocky island, tide, and skiff are tactile and used as tools and constraints (lamp exposure, timing moves to lens rotation, sea pressure). Environmental details evolve with action, not as postcards, and the lithophone insight charges the ending. The setting literally shapes tactics and the final image. Specificity is high and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-erasure vs. staying as spy/sage) tightens through the prophetic line and the charged plant of the fortune/film. Escalation is a textured deepening rather than sharp reversal, but it narrows options credibly toward the skiff choice. The cost—identity shed, ties cut, risk on open water—is felt. A slightly soft external squeeze keeps it shy of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Open secret,” light as confession, and music/key motifs interlock to ask how truth operates in plain sight and what it costs to escape one’s own pattern. The prophetic line recontextualizes the body/stone relationship into an existential price at the end. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars and charged images. The final chord in “key of salt and departure” reweights the whole.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with a distinct sensory lexicon (optics, film, scores) is consistent and confident. Dialogue is natural, subtextual, and advances pressure (“Ever think the light talks?”). Psychic distance shifts are measured and apt, with no head-hopping. Voice modulation under stress remains controlled without slipping registers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (lamp as shutter; combers as negatives). Figurative threads are coherent (light/film/music), with minimal redundancy. A small risk of motif saturation never muddies clarity or momentum. Rhythm varies and punctuation is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of fortune-cookie espionage with a lighthouse-as-darkroom and the “open secret” aesthetic feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, extended metaphor system) pay off in closure without obscuring sense. Turns emerge from character logic, not gimmickry. The final reconfiguration is memorable and specific.</comment>
