<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mireya’s motives are clear and character-particular: an engineer who listens to ice and solves through resonance. Under pressure she faces a credible moral calculus and forges a third path, which reads as earned by prior setup (her trained hearing and tool use). Embodiment is strong (bowing, syncing heartbeat, heat of the key) and avoids therapy-speak. The only limiter is that the personal cost at the end, while present, is relatively light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene causal drive is tight: Echo cracking → shadows manifesting → choice between harms → third-path act. Closure lands on the page with a decisive reconfiguration (teaching darkness to listen, artifact healed) and a felt price (worn key, emotional exhaustion, future duty). Orientation is clean early and the pattern holds. Slight softness stems from a near-costless resolution for the town, though the narrative does register loss.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, the key, and the Echo operate as integrated setting-tools that constrain choices and charge the final image. Soundscape and material textures guide tactics (listening through iron, matching glacier memory). Environmental pressure escalates (calving ice) and shapes the act that resolves the scene. The final starglow spiral reweights place, object, and theme elegantly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (town’s nightmares vs. marina’s collapse), and escalation is coherent to a sharp trade-off. The third-path solution is protagonist-driven and grows from established means (vibrational matching), not luck. Cost is present but modest, tempering the severity of the climax’s price. Tension works at line and image scales with one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mercy, listening, and absolution emerge organically from action and image rather than statement. The final transformation—darkness taught to listen—reinterprets threat and community memory without moralizing. Recurring motifs (spiral, whale, ice) shift meaning at the end in a resonant way. Complexity persists: salvation requires wear, duty, and ongoing vigilance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, sensuous, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature tied to sound and material. Lyric density rises under pressure without losing clarity. POV distance stays steady; no head-hopping or register drift. Cadence modulates well from incantatory setup to decisive action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (tools as conduits, ice as memory). Figurative language is rich but coherent; no mixed metaphors muddy the peak beats. Syntax variety sustains propulsion and avoids loops or scaffolding. The closing lines land cleanly without purple spillover.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Whale-bone absolution, frequency-teethed key, and “teaching darkness to listen” feel fresh and inevitable within this world. The problem-solving method (vibrational matching of glacier memory) is inventive and character-rooted. Risk-taking in tone and concept elevates rather than obscures clarity. The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
