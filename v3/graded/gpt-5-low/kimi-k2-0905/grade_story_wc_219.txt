<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is sharply defined and enacted: a skeptic testing a hypothesis about “return as reaction.” The spore-induced nostalgia creates credible inner contradiction that she resists without melodrama. Embodied perceptions (cyanotype rinse, paper-cut blood) individualize her interiority. The final renunciation (burying the amber, walking on) reads earned with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: sculptures → activation → spores → collapse → burial → walk-away. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses the myth of return and reframes it as chemical decay with cost (loss of path/tower). Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and set-ups pay off (convergence chamber; “map of returns”). No causality breaks; the tower’s response follows established premises.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, spiral stair, and lichen-rust scents are vivid and purpose-driven. The environment constrains action (slick stair, convergence chamber) and charges the final image (tower exhaling, path gone, amber buried). Sensory hierarchy reflects her scientific bias. World rules (emotional resonance calibration) stay consistent and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—testing the chemistry of homecoming—tightens through the amber’s activation and involuntary spore reaction, forcing a stance. The cost is palpable: she rejects belonging’s myth, lets the tower die, and gives up the “map.” Escalation is a clear deepening rather than reversal, appropriate to this lyrical mode. Agency drives the peak beats (pressing amber, entering the chamber, burying the shard).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of nostalgia vs. belonging and homecoming as reaction emerge organically from objects and events, not sermonizing. The offworlders’ “map of returns” is reweighted at the end into a record of decay, offering a resonant answer. A minor direct thesis line (“I am here to prove…”) risks baldness but is counterbalanced by strong image-led payoff. The final walk preserves ambiguity while making the cost legible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice fuses scientific lexicon with lyric image in a consistent, character-true register. Rhythm varies with pressure (measured ascent, breathlike collapse), and focalization is clean. The single recorded line feels diegetic and purposeful. No head-hopping or register drift undermines control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is tight, image-rich, and mostly double-duty; metaphors cohere (cello of bone, lung exhale) without purple spillover. Sentence variety sustains momentum; no scaffold loops or synonym churn. Information density is high yet clear, especially in the spore beat. Minor flourish density never blurs causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: emotional-resonance sculptures, fly amber as “map of returns,” and homecoming framed as chemical reaction. Beats reconfigure familiar SF contact tropes through a distinctive lens. The offworlders’ failed catalyst insight lands as inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking feels purposeful and integrated with closure.</comment>
