<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear, mounting motivation—paid to remember versus ordered to forget—culminates in a costly, character-driven choice. The contract’s prohibition and her mother’s erasure generate credible internal conflict that surfaces in micro-choices (lying to security, accepting the bargain). The sacrifice of her identity for the truth reads earned and specific. Minor note: interior contradiction is more implied than dramatized in dialogue, but it still lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: hashtag → patch chord → crawler → coordinates → server farm → bargain → irreversible reveal and broadcast. Closure is on-page with cost (loss of employment/identity) and a reconfigured world (public exposure). The bargain is a persistent constraint shaping the decisive act. No orientation debt; the lens holds cleanly to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the archive’s tools and the polar server farm constrain tactics and enable discovery. Object-as-setting (the patch) and the crystal Blocks shape choices and the final image (empty Block 73; numbers etched into skin). Sensory and tonal specificity (cold, hums, static) amplify stakes without bogging pace. World rules remain consistent within a lyric-sci-fi frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the Aurora truth versus personal erasure—is established early and tightens through the security lie and biometric bargain. The decisive choice forecloses her old life with visible cost that charges the ending. Escalation is protagonist-driven rather than coincidental. Pressure coheres from first clue to public broadcast.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and commodified grief emerge through action and image (ghost posts, humming blocks, trending lullaby) rather than moralizing. The lullaby/absence motif deepens into a conceptual repricing: she becomes the archive, distributing memory across the crowd. The final chord/blank user reweights prior material with lingering, non-tidy resonance. Complexity holds without forced “both-sides” framing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature: technical terms and metaphors feel native to the keeper’s mind. Distance and certainty remain consistent; no head-hopping or withheld-knowns gimmicks. Rhythm modulates well from investigative glide to charged climax. The voice carries subtext (corporate euphemism vs lived loss) without exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do multiple jobs. Lyricism is rich yet mostly restrained from purple excess, and metaphors cohere to the memory/data field. A few stacked intensifiers brush the edge of lushness but do not blur sense or pace. Final images are sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a corporate memory keeper, grief-click economies, audio-to-map sleuthing, and a polar “frozen” archive crystallize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling turn. The patch’s micro-tech and the numbers motif are specific and re-purposed in surprising ways. The risk of lyric-tech compression pays off with clarity and consequence. Emotional truth undergirds novelty.</comment>
