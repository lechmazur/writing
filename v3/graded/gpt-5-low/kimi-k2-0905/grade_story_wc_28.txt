<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Asha’s interiority is specific and contradictory—former evangelist of universal access reshaped into the Iron Cradle who chooses to forget. Tactile choices (counting forty-nine tesserae; selecting which memories to release) align with motive and reveal hierarchy of values. The renunciation of her prior stance lands with cost (names she won’t carry; theft of the stone; departure). Minor abstraction in phrasing appears but does not undercut motivation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the night-long work of arrangement tightens meaning, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where forgetting becomes an earned mercy. Orientation is clear from the opening (who/where/when), and the closure is on-page with a visible price. The footprint exit and stolen stepping stone crystallize the before/after. The causal thread is quiet but coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The plaza, minaret, shattered sky, and tesserae are vividly rendered and function as constraints—the chipped stepping stone’s pattern literally guides the method. Astronomical charts, constellation of the Merciful Judge, and the 49-piece ritual charge the final image. Environment and recurring objects shape tactics and closure. Details are selective and POV-filtered rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to hold justice and mercy—intensifies as she relinquishes specific memories and reconfigures the mosaic. The all-night labor is the deepening beat; the choice to remove the original stone and leave the city marks cost and forecloses a path. Internal conflict resolves into a new ethic without neat absolution. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Thematic arc—mercy through chosen forgetting—emerges from concrete acts (tesserae, constellation fractured into arms, multi-valent final figure). “Empathy’s armor” risks abstraction but is earned by the tactile ritual and reweighted imagery. The final communal expansion of the mosaic offers resonance without sermon. Counter-readings (complicity of forgetting) remain plausibly alive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person closely held to Asha, with consistent register and a perceptual signature oriented to touch and pattern. Rhythm modulates between dense imagery and clean declaratives at turns (“The fire had proven her wrong with the efficiency of a blade.”). No head-hopping or stance slips; purposeful compression reads confident. Elevated diction suits the mythic framing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry dual duty—image and meaning—without purple excess; sentences vary in length and propulsion. A few abstract coinages (“map of forgetting,” “empathy’s armor”) are balanced by concrete counters (book/child/flame/seed). No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors dull key beats. Final cadence lands clean without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: archivist-ruins ritual, retrocognition, and the ethics of selective forgetting refracted through mosaic craft. The constellation fractured into arms and the charged theft of the stepping stone feel singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risk sits in making forgetting a mercy; the piece commits and pays it off. The legend coda widens the frame without genericizing it.</comment>
