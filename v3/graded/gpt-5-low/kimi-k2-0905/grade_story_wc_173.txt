<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lys’s motive (defy the lullaby) is clear and embodied, and her choices under ritual pressure reveal value hierarchy and cost (refusing passage, remaining to sing). Contradictory impulses register in “alarming serenity” and her pulse as “betrayal,” giving her interior conflict texture. Micro-choices—selecting threads by scent, pressing the plinth, stepping into darkness—track cleanly to motive. The renunciation at the gate reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Single continuous arc with tight cause-and-effect: arrival → ritual → unlocking → dispersal of echoes → refusal to leave → new role. Closure lands on-page with cost (contract burns, she stays; city wakes to unsettling freedom). The accumulative ritual deepens into a decisive act and a resonant reconfiguration in the closing image. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the drive lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sanctuary, plinth-veins, and snow-laden courtyard are vivid and purpose-driven; environment responds to her actions (snow hisses back, tiles reveal predecessors) and charges the final image (garden of glowing silhouettes). The “bodily poetic” is spatially mapped, constraining the ritual. World-rules are learned by doing, not told. The setting’s specificity heightens stakes and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (thwart the lullaby) is clear from the outset and tightens through the knot-work to the mirror-dark core. The unlocking is a turn that narrows options; surrendering the echoes forecloses an old life while awakening the city. Visible prices—blooded footprints, refusal of escape, unsettling freedom—mark escalation and consequence. Agency drives every step.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of consent, commodification, and collective awakening emerge through concrete images (echo-lanterns, hollow statues filled with light). The final notion that “freedom, too, can be a terrifying lullaby” reweights the premise without moralizing. Recurring motifs (echoes, lullaby, mercury tears) accrue meaning and pay off at closure. Ambiguity is purposeful and fertile, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without losing clarity. Patterned repetition (“Between sigh and smile”) is taught and purposeful. No head-hopping; stance and distance remain stable. A touch lush, but voice remains character-true and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; momentum rarely stalls. Occasional luxuriance in metaphor risks saturation, but coherence holds and there are no paraphrase loops or muddles at peak beats. Syntax varies and carries propulsion. Final images are sharp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of “harvested echoes,” a prism sanctuary, and the “bodily poetic” ritual feels singular and necessary, not ornamental. Turns grow from seeded particulars (mad weaver’s method, iambic blood) to an inevitable yet fresh reconfiguration. Risks in tone and image pay off with conceptual integrity. The ending’s reorganization of constellations into her true name is memorable and non-obvious.</comment>
