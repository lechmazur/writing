<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific (reconnect and apologize for a mistakenly exorcised sister), and it drives concrete choices. Interiority is embodied through music-saturated perception and hesitation around releasing the drop. The relationship moment with the ghost carries real pressure and a felt cost (emptying the miracle, letting go). Slightly mannered metaphor-speak risks smoothing contradiction, but the final “I was wrong” lands clean.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: induced currents, archive hum, and orchard clock build toward the drop’s release and the apology. Closure lands on-page as a resonant reconfiguration: she empties the miracle, releases the sister, and archives the bottle with a cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and causality stands (current guides to folder; bottle aligns; ghost appears). The final tree’s low E ties consequence and world back into the action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archive, wiring hum, and orchard pressure shape choices and cadence throughout. Objects-as-setting (bottle, manuscripts, fluorescent lights) directly constrain action (guiding hand, aligning frequencies). Sensory selection is purposeful and biased by the protagonist’s musical lens. The closing images (empty bottle filed, dimming currents, lilac bloom) are charged and earned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is consistent: risking the last drop and her public identity to make amends. Escalation tightens via hesitation → invocation → ghost dialogue → apology as chainsaws roar, foreclosing the option to keep the miracle. The price is unmistakable (empty bottle, released sister, public misreading). No contrived reversals; turns come from her agency and the live clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres around grief, silence, and “imperfect miracles,” evolving through action rather than thesis. Recurring images (rest, tie, hum, lilac) shift meaning at the end, answering the central question with a resonant, non-literal release. Dialogue carries subtext (“Play the rest; that’s where I live.”). The piece resists tidy moralizing while delivering an emotionally precise aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with a precise musical lexicon holds steady under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and status-aware, advancing the core conflict. Psychic distance and focalization remain clean. Rhythm modulates well as the scene tightens (quiet hum to saws’ 4/4).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level control is strong with high information density; most metaphors are coherent within the musical/electrical motif. A few lush stacks verge on excess, but they don’t blur causality or closure. Sentence rhythm supports momentum from hush to crescendo. No loops or scaffold clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>“Gossip-column exorcist” plus induced currents and an archive-temporal clock is a singular blend executed with integrity. The perfume’s “imperfect miracle” and the musicalized environment feel non-derivative and necessary. The final reweighting (keeping echo, releasing soul) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in voice and concept heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
