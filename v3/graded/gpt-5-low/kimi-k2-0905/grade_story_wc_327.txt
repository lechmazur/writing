<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied—she fears the curse but fears silence more—and her choices escalate credibly from descent to speaking to swallowing the diamond. Internal contradiction (terror of the curse vs compulsion to preserve language) acts in scene. Micro-choices reveal values under pressure: no ink, body as recorder, accepting “one life for many voices.” The cost lands clearly as she calcifies while still conducting the symphony.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly: each beat densifies sound/texture until the decisive act (swallowing the diamond) reconfigures the world’s options. Closure is on-page with cost: she becomes a statue and the language gains continuance; the diamond becomes a beating heart. Orientation is clear early (canyon, bone towers, last speaker dead). Setups (bird-pattern method, heron crack, echo-tunnel) all pay off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: bone towers as wind flutes and the spiral echo-tunnel actively shape tactics and the recording method. The environment charges the final image (towers learn to speak without wind; echoes promise a living lexicon). Sensory detail is purposeful across touch/sound/light; the skull dome, reed textures, and unglazed pottery mouthfeel ground the abstractions. World rules stay consistent through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve a dying language at the price of self) tightens through a clear intensification: the curse “seeping” slows her heart even as phonemes clarify. The key reversal is her active choice to speak the first word that widens the crack and then to swallow the diamond, foreclosing survival for legacy. Costs are unmistakable and permanent; agency drives every turn. Pressure remains coherent and mounts under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of translating texture into sound, and of sacrifice as conduit for communal memory, emerges organically via objects and acts (feather-cloth, ink refusal, body-as-phonograph). Recurring images (heron/starlings, crack/light, bone/echo) shift meaning at closure without moralizing. The final promise reweights the premise: language becomes migratory texture carried by listeners, not dependent on bodies or rivers. Complexity persists (curse as gift and loss) without tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is singular, controlled, and sensuously precise; rhythm modulates with pressure (from patient setup to incantatory climax). POV stays stable, with certainty matched to felt perception; lyric elision is taught and paid off. Diction (“mud-slip,” “knapped-flint sorrow”) feels character-specific, not generic high style. No dialogue needed; the interior cadence carries subtext and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is rich and largely disciplined; imagery layers without muddle and sentences do multiple jobs. Density is high but controlled; a few stacked modifiers flirt with excess, yet clarity and propulsion hold, especially through the climax. No looped scaffolding or mechanical cadence; syntax varies and lands emphatic turns cleanly. Final images are sharp and unblunted by figurative clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>A strikingly original synthesis—translation via textures, bone architecture as instruments, a cursed diamond as phonemic engine—feels inevitable by the end. Risks (lyric architecture, conceptual premise) heighten stakes and cohere through charged callbacks (heron wing, echo-tunnel). Turns are earned from seeds, not late rule changes. The vision reads singular and memorable.</comment>
