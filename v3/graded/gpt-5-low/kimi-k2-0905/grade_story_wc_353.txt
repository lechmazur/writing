<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ilay’s motive is vivid and embodied—“to create music in a silent world”—and every micro-choice (mapping crack-pitches, slowing her heart to the wood’s pulse) aligns with it. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (the interval-counting, tool craft, and breath-mirroring). There’s little contradictory impulse beyond reverence vs. urgency, but the restraint at the end (“She does not cheer”) reads as an earned renunciation. The cost is modest but felt in stamina, concentration, and a disciplined refusal to break the spell.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: analysis → tuned strums → the statue and grove respond → stored anthem. Closure lands on the page as a Charged Poise: the world reconfigures from mute to conversant, with the insulator glowing and tomorrow’s wire “ready to carry” the song. The price—Ilay’s bodily recalibration to “arboreal time,” trembling knees, and a vow of restraint—registers at the ending image. Orientation is clean from the outset; no causality gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grove and its tools (alder, copper, insulators) are not backdrop; they constrain tactics and charge the final image (fungal webs “listening,” the dulcimer carved from the grove, the insulator storing anthem). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across senses (resin scent, winter-cold wood, shiver of needles). World rules feel consistent and learned through action. The environment’s logic directly enables the resolution.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via density and responsiveness: silent mapping to first ping to the grove’s answering, culminating in the statue’s breathy alto. The dominant stake (reviving song) tightens with the risk of overplaying versus coaxing; her choice to go “softer, softer” is the key narrowing. Cost is present but gentle; there’s no antagonist, yet the design holds under an accumulative lens. The stored anthem and her restraint make the consequence tangible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: empathy as technique (“empathy in motion”), the ethics of listening, and restoration without triumphalism. The final image reweights prior motifs—wire, voice, grove—into conversation rather than spectacle. No moralizing or thesis-speak; resonance lingers in the idea that sorrow can become comfort. Complexity is held through restraint and craft.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-POV voice is exquisitely controlled: diction and rhythm match Ilay’s artistic mind (interval naming, tool lexicon). The lyric mode is taught early and maintained without head-hopping or register slips. Psychic distance tightens during peak beats (the breath-matching, the millimeter mouth opening) with confidence. Dialogue is minimal and apt (the soft counting), carrying character rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet functional; figurative language is consistent with the wood/wire/music ontology. Sentences vary rhythmically, and almost every line advances image, world, or pressure. No loops or scaffold; the lyric precision avoids muddle at the climax. Slight risk of saturation is managed by purposeful, scene-bound images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—telegraph insulators as instruments, a tree-statue voiced via stress-crack tuning, empathy as craft—is striking and specific. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the story’s logic. The dulcimer of alder and copper, fungal webs “listening,” and the stored anthem give it a singular stamp. Boldness is high without gimmickry.</comment>
