<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear (to quiet guilt), and her choices—RESTORE, then RELEASE INSECT—align under pressure. The temptation to “BECOME LULLABY” briefly spotlights a credible counter-impulse. The cost is present but a bit soft; we intuit forfeiture of her voice-as-lullaby rather than feel it viscerally. Still, interiority remains specific and earned through tactility (stylus, chain, itch of her constellation).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single-scene causal spine reads clean: tether → projection → RESTORE → tightening letters/chorus → new menu → RELEASE. Closure lands on-page with a decisive act (slicing, inking mute star, choosing RELEASE) and conceptual repricing (the lab cultivates, not stores, lost sounds). The lens holds as hybrid with a causal backbone supporting a lyric texture. Cost is legible if not monumental.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: antique-furniture console, wet-ink letters, and paper chains physically constrain choice. Recurring objects (amber, stylus, console) are integrated into action, not mere backdrop. The lab’s logic stays consistent and charges the final image. Atmosphere serves theme without tipping into museum-tour description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—absolving guilt—tightens through escalating pressures: the lab responds to her inputs, then binds her, then reframes the menu with higher-cost options. Her final refusal of self-erasure to instead release the insect is an earned resolution. The emotional price is present but understated, keeping the climax more elegiac than harrowing. Still, the choice clearly closes a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: how systems feed on guilt and how forgiveness requires release, not substitution. The insect-lullaby-constellation triad reweights meaning at the end without moralizing. The “lab cultivating lost sounds” realization deepens the ethical frame. Resonance lingers in the quieted collarbone and clear amber.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third-person is steady, with a confident, image-driven cadence that tightens at turns. Diction stays coherent to the piece’s metaphoric logic (“meteor hush,” “haunted firmware”). No POV leakage, and distance modulation matches pressure. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density lines mostly carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme) without syntactic slog. Figurative language is consistent and avoids mixed metaphors; no evident loops or scaffold. Momentum is preserved even in lush description. A few ornate phrases flirt with saturation but never blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—lab of lost sounds, haunted firmware, constellation tattoos as sleeper code—feels singular and inevitable in retrospect. The menu mechanics and antique-console letters translate concept into concrete pressure. Risks in tone and worldbuilding pay off cleanly at closure. The final reconfiguration (release vs. self-sacrifice) avoids the obvious choice.</comment>
