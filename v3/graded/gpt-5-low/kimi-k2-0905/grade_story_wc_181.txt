<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s compulsion to “pursue forbidden knowledge” versus preserving her past is clear and escalates credibly through concrete micro-choices (plucking galaxy-fruit; retreating to the bathroom; inscribing the drain). Interiority is particular and embodied via vivid, character-filtered imagery rather than labels. The contradiction—self-preservation vs. mandate—drives an earned transformation into “the catalog.” Minor limitation: emotional texture leans conceptual at peaks, slightly muting felt vulnerability.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, causality is patterned and coherent: inquiry → revelation → cost (pages erase) → reconfiguration (“Index,” the page, identity shift). Orientation is taught early (who/where are clear) and the closure is a conceptual repricing with on-page cost. The cameo-to-drain act creates a clean because/therefore cadence inside the lyric design. A hairline abstraction at the very end keeps it just shy of the 9.0–9.4 tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard and the bathroom pod are not postcard backdrops but active constraints (telepathic pressure, plumbing-xylem linkage) that shape tactics and the final image. Recurring objects-as-setting (cameo, drain, “Index” door) charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered, with strong non-visual textures (petals chiming, lullabies). World rules stay internally consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are sharp and escalate: inquiry yields knowledge whose cost is pages vanishing, forcing a tactical pivot to the bathroom chrysalis and a decisive inscription. The price—loss of past kindnesses—lands on the page and informs the final move. Resolution is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of simple refusal. Tension is more conceptual than visceral, but remains coherent and tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres—inheritance, authorship, and the price of knowledge—through recurring images that reweight meaning at the end. Subtext operates through the grafting motif and the drain-as-fertilizer turn. However, explicit thesis lines (“nonlinear inheritance is simply complicated love arriving early,” “Knowledge is not forbidden…”) edge toward moralizing, slightly flattening resonance. The ending still offers a strong non-literal answer via the curator becoming the catalog.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent with a single, close focalization; diction and rhythm modulate purposefully. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off (mirror corridor, “Index”). Brief dialogue is stylized but functional. A few conceptual flourishes border on over-articulate certainty, but the perceptual signature remains clear.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double duty (cameo as tool and thesis mold). Rhythm varies and supports momentum; syntax is clean and purposeful. Occasional lushness risks purple, and a couple of aphoristic sentences compress complexity into neat statements, but clarity and propulsion hold. No significant metaphor clashes or loops impede the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—astral orchard, nonlinear inheritance as familial graft, bathroom-as-chrysalis plumbing to xylem—is fresh, cohesive, and risk-forward. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight and arise from established motifs rather than rule-dumping. The final reconfiguration (“The curator is the catalog”) elegantly reframes all prior material. Boldness heightens stakes without obscuring legibility.</comment>
