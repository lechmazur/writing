<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, motivated interiority drives choice: Mira chooses to “unbend” an event despite shaken confidence. Contradictory impulses (confidence flickers; uncertainty steadies) operate simultaneously and inform action. Embodied cost shows in station power drain and gravity slackening, with an earned acceptance of uncertainty as a stance. The relationship to her mentor and the pen reveals character under pressure without hedging flaws.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with a clean accumulative arc culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: the wrong seeds become “early,” reweighting prior beats. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with coherent causal touches (anomaly flares → edit attempt → environmental cost → revised scroll). Orientation is anchored early (who/where/what) and exploited by closure. Cost is on the page via power/risk and the acceptance of uncertainty as operational principle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The environment and tools constrain and charge choices: the anomaly twists causality and physically weighs on her, and the iridium pen functions as micro-setting/tool. Sensory specificity—viewport touch, recycled air taste, gravity slacken—filters through her professional attention. World rules remain consistent and learned through action (filaments, quantum buffer). The final image is charged by setting (anomaly’s lullaby; warmth through boots).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover meaningful signal/repair error) tightens when the anomaly flares and tomorrow’s coordinates arrive, forcing a risky edit. The edit exacts a visible price (power drain, gravity loss) and narrows options into acceptance of uncertainty as working method. Resolution flows from her agency rather than coincidence. Stakes remain intimate but clear and scaled to length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of uncertainty as discipline emerges through concrete acts (naming filaments, pruning metaphor) rather than moralizing. Recurring images (seeds, garden, pen, filaments) reweight meaning at the end. The mentor line deepens, not explains away, the insight. The closing “strange comfort” reframes error as fertilizer without neat absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction suits Mira’s role and stakes. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure (from tense anomaly flare to softened landing). Brief dialogue lines carry subtext and do not break POV. No head-hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphor; most lines multitask (world, action, theme). Figurative language remains coherent to the premise (gardening, filaments, hinges). Minimal redundancy and clean syntax; the closure image is crisp. Slight richness borders on lush but doesn’t obscure sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of comm-garden horticulture, causal filaments, and an iridium editing pen feels singular and inevitable. The tactic of “unbending” relationships to edit history is conceptually distinctive and dramatized. Risks in voice and concept heighten coherence rather than blur it. The final reconfiguration earns its strangeness.</comment>
