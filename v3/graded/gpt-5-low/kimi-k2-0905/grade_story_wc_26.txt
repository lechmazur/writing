<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—preserving an unshareable shape of hope—is clear and consistently enacted through micro-choices (rubbing the stone, threading reels, setting it between projectors, choosing absorption over release). Contradictory impulses (archive vs. surrender, shareable market vs. private vow) surface in scene, not summary. The embodied cost—becoming the last dusk and locking her own shadow—is credible and earned. A few explicit insight lines (“She understood…”) flirt with telling, but they’re anchored to concrete acts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, events intensify logically: stone warms → archival comparison → stone metamorphosis → library tremor/release → choice to internalize and lock. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on-page cost (career-ending recording, self-absorption of shadow, locking it away). Orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the first paragraph and remains stable. The final reconfiguration reweights the premise of shareable dreams with a personal embargo that feels inevitable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds and its orchid-shelves are vivid, sensorial, and integrated into action (petals opening to release archived dreams, orchids “listening” to her pulse). The river stone functions as object-as-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. World rules (dream market, aerial archive) stay consistent and are learned through observation and use. The environment meaningfully shapes the climax (projection beams, balcony, vault) rather than serving as postcard backdrop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether hope will be commodified, discarded, or personally borne, and tightens at the metamorphosis and balcony contemplation. The decisive narrowing—pressing the stone to her sternum and then locking the shadow—forecloses alternatives with a felt price (self-vanishing, career closure). Escalation is primarily internal but remains legible and consequential. A true antagonist is absent, yet the internal/external weave (dream market, sinking world) keeps the stakes live.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of attention, commodification, and the ethics of preservation emerge through concrete acts (reel comparison, private archive vs. market). The recurring stone/hope motif shifts meaning across beats, culminating in a non-literal but resonant answer: hope survives as unshareable charge with cost. A couple of explicit thematic sentences risk overstatement but are earned by image-driven scaffolding. The final afterimage recontextualizes earlier details without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature (attention to dusk hues, archival mechanics, orchid-breath). Distance remains stable; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure—measured early, more charged at metamorphosis and closure—without losing clarity. Purposeful elision and patterning (“softly, deliberately”) are taught and pay off at the key turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: images carry multiple jobs, syntax varies, and momentum persists despite lyric density. Figurative language remains coherent and context-consistent (orchids as shelves, dreams as pollen). Minor repetition (“softly, deliberately”) functions as motif rather than scaffold. No looped paraphrase or muddled metaphors dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-commodified dreams, a living library-orchid, a memory-charged stone, and an “unbound shadow”—feels singular and earned. Turns arise from established particulars (archival method produces the metamorphosis and choice), not late rule changes. The final choice reimagines familiar preservation tropes with a fresh ethical calculus. Risk-taking in worldbuilding and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
