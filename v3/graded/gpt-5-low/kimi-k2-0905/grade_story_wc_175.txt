<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—honoring overlooked histories through a transient memorial—is clear and embodied in specific actions. Interiority is textured (“weightless yet somehow anchoring,” the grandmother’s dictum), though internal contradiction is light. Her micro-choices (knotting faster, stepping back to let it lift) align with motive and reveal cost. A minor slip: “moth wing” vs. “the one whose twin wing she carried” introduces a small identity fuzz that blurs her ethical tension.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration as the butterflies arrive, shroud, and lift the memorial. Closure lands on-page with cost—she relinquishes the wing/memorial and descends changed. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (who/where/when anchored), and setup pays off in the final spiral. The causal-softness fits the chosen lens without breaking coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto above the clouds, “transiently rooted” cloud-soil, and lightning-scarred log are vivid, sensorial, and integrated with action. The environment constrains choices (must work before roots dissolve) and charges the final image as the memorial lifts into open sky. Details are POV-filtered and purposeful (moss, mineral taste; wire catching sunlight). World rules feel consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—creating a memorial before dissolution and migration—tightens as butterflies arrive and test her creation. The meaningful deepening is the living shroud and lift, which forces her to accept loss for fulfillment. Cost is legible without an antagonist. Escalation is quiet but consistent with the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of “temporary permanence” and honoring suppressed histories emerges through concrete images (wire cathedral, memorized banned books, cloud-rooted ferns). The final image conceptually reprices memory as weightlessness with cost. Occasional direct statements (“I’m building this for the histories that dissolve,” grandmother’s aphorism) slightly reduce subtlety but remain earned by scene-work. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and apt. The single line of dialogue is spare and subtextual. Psychic distance modulates cleanly as pressure rises. Voice stays coherent, avoiding register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-rich, and generally efficient; figurative density enhances rather than muddies. Momentum holds with varied rhythm. A noticeable line-level flaw appears at the end (“of the bl”), breaking finish-line polish. Minor redundancy in thematic phrasing occasionally grazes purple but doesn’t stall clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—esoteric realist, cloud-rooted grotto, wire memorial, monarch migration—feels fresh and specific. The “interrupted cadence” resolving to fluidity is an elegant, non-obvious turn. Risks in world-making and tone cohere and pay off at closure. Small identity fuzz around moth/monarch wings slightly tempers the impression of seamless ingenuity.</comment>
