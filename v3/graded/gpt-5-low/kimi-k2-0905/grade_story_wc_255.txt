<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Milo’s desire to see color grounds the piece and evolves credibly into a renunciation (“Milo never painted again”), giving the arc a real cost. His micro-choices—accepting the marble eye, collaborating, then smashing the work—align with that deepening. Rosa’s motive is less interior but legible through action and status: she proposes the trade and replies via plant-arrangements. Some aphoristic lines skirt telling, but the emotional turns still feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: trade → plant-dialogue → eye-vision → collaborative making → deliberate shattering → planting the reed. Closure lands with cost and reconfiguration (CR): Milo’s renunciation, the shared spiral/shard garden, the returned eye. Orientation is strong from the first line (who/where/when). Each beat follows from the prior with motivated “therefore” logic despite the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The courtyard, kiln, greenhouse, ash, and glass objects are tactile and used, not toured; they shape choices (plant communication, smashing in the courtyard, reed planting). Recurring objects charge the final image: marble eye, reed tongue, shards, and dying plants converge to embody the thesis. World rules (phoenix ash, glass dust rain) remain consistent within the fable-logic. Atmosphere and specificity are integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (how to see/define beauty) but tighten through concrete acts: the trade, the experiment with the eye, the collaboration, and the conscious destruction. The price is palpable—smashing their own work, Milo’s refusal to paint, returning the eye. Pressure builds via pattern-dense exchanges (plant messages) rather than antagonism, consistent with the lens. A minor softness: external jeopardy is low, but the internal cost carries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres and reweights prior images at the end (“we are most alive where we are broken”), enacted through shards and arrangements. However, several explicit thesis statements risk over-articulation (“we trade our wounds…”) where the images already do the work. Subtext still lives in the barter of “failures,” the plant-code, and the violent color revelation. The resonance lingers despite a touch of moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is assured, image-driven, and consistent in a close third centered on Milo, with brief but motivated access to Rosa’s stance. Rhythm modulates well across beats, from tactile action to lyric compression. Diction sits naturally for this fable-lyric register without register slips. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext in the single “Trade you.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is vivid and economical; images often do double-duty (ash as tone, tool as setting). A few aphoristic lines verge on purple, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. No scaffold loops or mechanical cadence; syntax varies with intent. Final images are clean and charged without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concertina reed tongue, “bartered awakenings,” color-violence seen through a borrowed marble eye, and plant-arrangement dialogue feel strikingly fresh and organically interwoven. The spiral of shards and dying plants is an unexpected yet inevitable culmination. Risk-taking (smash-the-art climax, colored rain consequence) heightens coherence rather than posturing. The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
