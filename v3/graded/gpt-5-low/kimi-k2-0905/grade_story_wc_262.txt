<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (recover the lost chorus/unused love) and embodied actions (psychometry, scratching lyrics) reveal character. Interiority is vivid without therapy-speak. Slight softness: limited contradictory impulse or resistance—events flow toward success with minimal internal friction. Emotional cost appears, but the path is relatively smooth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: each beat layers cinema-ritual to a resonant closure. Setups pay off (film, booth, balcony, envelope), and the final reconfiguration (letter gains text; love “projects”) lands on the page with cost. Orientation is clean from the opening. A minor convenience aura remains around the projector animating, but it fits the taught logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Orion Palace and projection booth are tactile and consequential—tools and layout dictate tactics (reel, lamp, balcony door) and charge the final image. Recurring objects constrain choice and meaning (film strip, cigarette case, window, screen). Weather integrates with tone and action. Strong POV-filtered detail avoids postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding/activating stored love via lyrics) tightens through decisive acts: initiating the read, inscribing new lyrics, and testing the projection. Emotional price is paid in relinquishing the blank letter’s status and the ash-in-pocket epilogue. Escalation is more deepening than reversals, but it coheres under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of archive, projection, and the conservation of love develop organically through concrete acts and images. Final images reweight the premise (film threading into the chest; rain as applause). However, the explicit thesis line (“Love is never unused...”) edges into moralizing and trims ambiguity at the finish. Despite that, resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is confident, consistent, and textured with a distinct perceptual bias (cinema lexicon). Rhythm modulates well from hush to crescendo. No head-hopping or stance slippage; taught uncertainties pay off. A few high-flare images crowd together, but control remains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; most lines carry multiple jobs (image, theme, action). Occasional density stacks (“storm without rain...applause,” “pigeons like white sprocket holes”) flirt with purple but stay coherent and evocative. No loops or scaffold; syntax varies with momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Psychometry in a vintage cinema to recover a mother’s unsent love is a fresh synthesis with strong image logic. Key turns feel inevitable in hindsight (scratch-then-project; balcony door ajar). Bold, cohesive world-rules for the magical tech elevate without gimmickry. Minor conventional comfort in the “message completed” beat is offset by the inventive staging.</comment>
