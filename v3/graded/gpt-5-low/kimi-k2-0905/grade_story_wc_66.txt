<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mila’s motives are precise and consistent—smuggling narrative through music and dust—and her micro-choices (rosin ink, copper filaments, choosing to transmit, refusing to flee) align. Interiority is embedded in task-focused perception, not abstract labels. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (diligence/caution versus insurgent risk), so the emotional cost skews conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Still, her endurance at the end reads as earned stasis with credible stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterned nights of listening, a solstice deadline, then the on-page broadcast that reconfigures the hall and the inspectors. Closure lands with cost—inspectors are transformed and Mila risks exposure while choosing to keep copying. Setups (pirate code, rosin-dust ink, dial/antenna) pay off causally in the climax. Orientation is clear early and remains stable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The concert hall, ember alcove, mist, shortwave dial, rosin, and copper stands are vivid and functionally constrain choices. The hall’s acoustics and dust become the method and battleground; the dial’s afterglow charges the final image. Sensory detail is balanced (taste of iron, hissing dial, tactile rosin). World rules are taught through action without exposition dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: get contraband story back into the world under surveillance. Escalation is clean—the deciphered code, the solstice window, the antenna build, the transmit choice—culminating in inspectors’ intrusion. The cost to Mila is implied more than suffered on-page, keeping the peak from maximal bite. Still, the narrowing window and presence of inspectors provide real tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of narrative resilience against censorship emerges organically via material acts (rosin, copper, dust) and encoded intervals (minor thirds/tritones). Subtext—making the “forgotten motes” speak—reprices art as insurgency without moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: ordinary silence becomes a cloak for ongoing stories. Ambiguity lingers productively in how permanent the change is.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, assured lyric voice filters perception through musical labor and outlaw craft. POV remains tight to Mila; quoted lines from the broadcaster deepen texture without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure—measured early cadence, swelling at the broadcast, then a poised diminuendo. Diction is consistent and character-apt for a copyist steeped in music.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; images do double duty (e.g., “mist curled like forgotten sheet music”). Figurative density stays coherent with few mixed metaphors; momentum rarely stalls. A slight tendency toward rhapsodic stacking in the climax skirts purple but remains clear. Sentence and paragraph rhythm carry propulsion to the charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—pirate broadcasts encoded in intervals, rosin-ink dust learning to narrate, inspectors inhaling story—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The world logic follows through its own inventive premises. Emotional truth sits inside the craft acts rather than on declarative rails.</comment>
