<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lina’s motives and contradictions are vivid: terror vs. tradition, superstition vs. scholarship, love for her brother vs. the risk of repeating the past. Her micro-choices under pressure—timing the twelfth stroke, holding breath despite pain—track cleanly to an earned shift. Embodied emotion is specific (iron taste, knee ache, needles in lungs). Master Jomei’s calm presence adds pressure and a counterpoint without stealing agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene arc with a clear clock (kettle plume) and a clean closure where the rune’s function reverses and grief is reconfigured into language. The superstition is seeded via backstory and paid off causally in the present. Cost is on the page (pain, risk of inversion, broken quill). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density crests at the twelfth stroke and releases.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating tea platform, kettle, mats, and storm aren’t postcard details; they constrain tactics and charge the final image. The no-railing tradition and imminent typhoon heighten risk; the kettle plume literally governs timing. Objects evolve (quill splits; platform rises), tying environment to change. Sensory detail is purposeful across senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finish the rune without inversion to transmute grief—tightens under the storm-and-plume clock. Escalation centers on breath and the twelfth stroke, with visible costs and narrowing options. Agency drives the turn; luck doesn’t save her. The final release (speaking the brother’s name, rock rising) reads as earned consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of scars becoming stories emerges through action: crystallized breath turning to sentences, then spoken into a listening storm. Recurring images (breath, steam, silence, crystal) reweight meaning at the end without platitude. The teacher’s line flirts with explicitness but lands as ritual invitation, not moral. Resonance lingers with the quiet aftereffect of naming and lift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A controlled close-third lyric voice with distinct perceptual bias: craft and weather are filtered through breath and grief. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head-hopping; brief dialogue carries subtext and status cleanly. Figurative patterns are taught early and sustained with intent. No stance or tense slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do double duty (world-rule and emotion). A few lush metaphors cluster, but they cohere around the crystal/breath motif and don’t blur causality. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the peak beat. The final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Tea-ceremony rune-work on a floating rock as a grief ritual feels fresh and integrated. The superstition-as-method and the crystallized breath turning into sentences are inventive and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without gimmickry. Emotional truth drives novelty rather than the reverse.</comment>
