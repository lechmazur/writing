<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and contradictory—the “rational” forager who distrusts “rational,” fearing the quiet more than the noise. Micro-choices under pressure are clear (mixing the cure, hesitation, then choosing to drink differently). Embodied detail (scent forcing truth, heat of the eye) grounds emotion. Slightly clinical phrasing (“psychological safety”) grazes therapy-speak but is thematically integrated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single-scene structure is clean, causally linked, and situationally pressured toward a decisive stance. The spill, the rising film, and consent condition force a reconfiguration, not a tidy fix. Closure lands on the page with cost: she foregoes the fantasy of silence to carry others more gently. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/after-virus), and the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The orchard-ravine, storms, rope ladder, and “roots like nooses” shape action and constrain options (branch fall, rising film). Sensory specificity is rich yet purposeful (storm taste, truffle scent as involuntary truth). World rules are learned through use, not dumps. The setting charges the final image and the protagonist’s choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mute the chorus vs. hold it) tightens through one meaningful turn: the failed cure becomes a witnessing trial requiring consent. External pressure (storm, falling branch, encroaching film) interlocks with internal hesitation. The final decision has visible cost and reweights tactics. Coincidence complicates (the branch) but does not resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: secrecy vs. witnessing, cure vs. care, safety as holding rather than occluding. Recurring images (occlusion, eye, truffle truth, storms) reprice at the end without moralizing. The final hush reads as earned stasis with cost, not erasure. Minor explicit phrasing is offset by strong subtextual images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature; rhythms modulate with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but charged (“Don’t,” “I will occlude you”). Diction blends sensuous with conceptual in a character-consistent way. No head-hopping or stance slips; elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density; images carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, causality). Figurative language is bold yet coherent; no mixed metaphors or scaffolding loops. Syntax varies with momentum; line endings land on strong nouns and verbs. The closure beat is crisp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: empathy-virus ecology, truffle truth, and a smuggled glass eye converge into an unexpected but inevitable reconfiguration. Risks (lyric density, invented rules) heighten stakes and cohere. Turns feel grown from planted specifics rather than clever grafts. The final repricing is memorable and singular.</comment>
