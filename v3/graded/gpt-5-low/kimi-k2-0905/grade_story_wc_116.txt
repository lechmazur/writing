<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—she comes to “witness change without judgment,” reinforced by the past failure with the war chronicle. The final renunciation (becoming the next fold/swan/silence) is earned by the library’s rules and her accrued practice. Interiority is sensory and particular, though contradictory impulses are muted; she accepts, rather than wrestles deeply on the page. The cost—self-erasure—lands, but with little on-page resistance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly from the opening touch of obsidian to the lectern and mirror-water. Closure occurs on the page with cost: the book closes over her hands, memories flatten, and she becomes the next silence. Set-ups (swan, library’s refusal to be forced, regenerative blankness) pay off in the final transformation. Orientation is firm early and the cadence tightens toward the reading pit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The overgrown library’s rules actively constrain choices (scrolls regenerating into blankness, the war chronicle turning to saplings) and charge the final image. Recurring objects—obsidian, origami swan, mirror-water—are integrated with environment and action. Spatial and sensory specificity are vivid and filtered through the keeper’s practiced attention. The setting is inseparable from the premise and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around whether she remains mere witness or becomes the silence that underwrites the library’s order. Escalation is an accumulative deepening: the swan’s last unfolding, the map, the pit, the lectern, the book’s command, culminating in self-erasure. The library’s prior refusal to remember functions as the decisive constraint, and the price is unmistakable. The tension is quiet and ritualized rather than combative, but it narrows options effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, curation, and the ethics of witnessing emerge through concrete acts and the library’s regenerative logic. The swan/book line—“To witness is to fold the world into a shape that holds no weight”—edges toward thesis, but it’s diegetic and reweighted by the transformation. The ending reconfigures the premise: witness becomes infrastructure, with a real cost. Resonance lingers without a moral spelled out.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature sustains through the piece. Diction and rhythm are consistent and modulate gently toward the climax; no head-hopping or stance drift. The voice integrates world rules through image rather than exposition. A slight uniformity of cadence keeps it just shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High-density imagery remains coherent and purposeful; refrains like “across the drift of untold seasons” and “crumbling peace” feel patterned rather than redundant. Syntax varies enough to maintain momentum, and sentences often do multiple jobs. A few metaphor stacks approach saturation but do not blur causality or the closing image. Line-level control is strong with no visible mechanical errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The transformation of the witness into the library’s silence via origami/swan mechanics and “regenerative” rules feels fresh and internally inevitable. Familiar fantastical-library tropes are reimagined with specific, integrated motifs (moon-berry ink, mirror-water, obsidian scales). The final reconfiguration is conceptually bold and earned. A touch more surprise in the emotional calculus could have pushed it higher.</comment>
