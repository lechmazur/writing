<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motive evolves credibly from professional mapping to confronting inherited culpability; her micro-choices (following the echo, opening the hatch, descending) are consistent with her “sensitively perceptive” trait. Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“legacy’s burden” rising like a swallowed stone). The ultimate endurance/renunciation—becoming the corridor—lands with felt cost. Slight passivity at the end reads earned rather than convenient, but it limits peak complexity of contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: discoveries layer (diaries → lineage → tunnel → final negative) to a conceptual repricing closure where she is absorbed into the archive. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when) and the rules of the world cohere. The cost is on-page in the transformation and later corroborated by the fresh negative and institutional reposting. No causality breaks; each beat is a “therefore,” not an “and then.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: the ivy-veiled passage, flood-changed campus, and negative-lined tunnel constrain movement and supply the governing mechanism (building-as-camera). Environmental specifics (shutter/passage, storms as flash, dripping corridors as trays) actively shape options and the final image. Sensory detail stays purposeful and POV-filtered through an acoustics professional. The final breathing room charged by ivy and brick closes the thematic loop.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping echoes versus being taken by legacy—tightens through tangible turns: the family reveal, the hatch, the tunnel, and the self-in-negative. Agency drives escalation (she keeps going despite warnings), and the price is unmistakable. The conflict is more existential than adversarial, but pressure coheres and deepens under the chosen lens. A single credible tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: legacy as a living archive that demands witness, inheritance as complicity, and architecture as memory. Recurring images (negatives, ivy, breath) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image reframes knowledge rather than explaining it, leaving resonant unease. The notion that “walls dream” is answered by her becoming the dream’s negative space.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident close third with a strong perceptual signature—acoustic and material metaphors—remains stable and apt. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, from hushed listening to the charged final collapse of sound. Purposeful lyric elision is taught and paid off with clarity. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical; figurative language is original and controlled (“storms as flash powder,” “negatives humming”). Information density is high with minimal scaffold, and sentence rhythm supports momentum. A few lush metaphors cluster, but they remain coherent and legible. The closing lines are clean and unsmudged by syntactic tangle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The building-as-camera conceit, acoustic cartography, and silver-halide archive synthesize into a fresh, inevitable logic. The lineage twist avoids cliché by embedding in craft and environment rather than fate-speak. Risks (lyric density, non-literal closure) heighten stakes and cohere. Key turns feel earned in hindsight, especially the shutter/passage redefinition.</comment>
