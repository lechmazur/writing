<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The performer’s contradictory past (informant turned forger) and present micro-choices (labeling “dirge,” offering the carved feather, planting stems) reveal a coherent, morally fraught drive. Interiority is implied through precise action and narrated tasks rather than abstract labels. The officer adds relational pressure and a status inversion (scratched badge) that sharpens her stance. Emotional cost is quiet but legible in her risk under the silence ordinance and in the earned, not-guaranteed lightness.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: whittling, narration, turbine-hush, crow exchange, officer’s entry, planting, and the log’s final repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: rebellion (feather in turbine), planting skeletal stems, and the sky’s single tear reweight grief/lightness with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear from the opening (porch, turbines, mandate aftermath). The price—legal risk and the chosen endurance of hush—is on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The turbines and porch aren’t backdrop; wind steals shavings, powers the hush, shreds petals, and receives the wooden feather, directly shaping tactics and the final image. World rules (silence ordinance; spectrum monitoring) are learned through action. Sensory specificity is vivid and purposeful across sight, sound, and touch. The setting charges the last beats (flag on the turbine fence; audience-like exhale) with lived consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to make hopeful noise within the “remade hush.” It tightens at the officer’s challenge and the crow’s demand, with the feather-lodging as a small but concrete rebellion that risks penalty. Escalation is understated but clear: solitary defiance → co-conspiracy → public planting/flagging. Costs are subtle (legal, communal memory), yet felt; one could want a slightly sharper on-page consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring acts (whittling, narration, planting) that reframe grief as soil under coercive silence. The crow’s line and the feather’s repurposing evolve meaning without sermonizing; “lightness possible, though not guaranteed” lands as earned poise. Moral ambiguity is lived, not declared, complicating consolation with complicity. The final image reweights the premise rather than stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with a cool, performative distance; diction and rhythm flex with pressure (e.g., officer’s entrance, crow’s pronouncement). Dialogue carries subtext and intention, distinguishing speakers without strain. Magical realism (talking crow) integrates cleanly into the established register. No head-hopping; stance remains steady and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is tight and image-dense without slurry; metaphors (turbines as three-armed giants; bouquet as apologies) cohere. Repetition is purposeful (“Item:” lists; log entries) and propulsive. Minimal scaffold or echo lines; information density remains high. A few lush moments flirt with purple, but they serve cadence and do not blur action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A striking synthesis: post-mandate hush, compliance officer host, narrated mundanity, a crow asking for a carved place for guilt, and turbines as hush-engine. Turns arise from these specifics rather than template beats, and the rebellion is inventively minor yet weighty. The final repricing feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in tone and image heightens coherence and stakes.</comment>
