<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied—he aims to translate silence into music—and his actions align: signing, subtracting noises, culminating in the final chord. The charisma reads via concrete reactions (dogs, drunks), not just labels. However, interior contradiction is minimal; he functions more as archetype than conflicted person. The renunciation—leaving, being forgotten—lands but lacks an on-page internal struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design is taught early and held: he moves counterclockwise, subtracts sounds, intensifies to a final signed arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s listening is reweighted and the note lingers with cost (erased noises, his effacement). Causality within the poetic frame is tight—each deletion lightens the world and sets up the chord. Orientation is clean from the opening image; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor is tactile and operative: moonlight makes afterglow legible, maritime machinery and sounds provide the materials he subtracts, and the water becomes “sheet music.” The camera and capstan function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Details are selective and purposeful across senses (salt, rust, vibration). The environment constrains and enables tactics, not just decorates.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—can a voiceless figure return music to a silenced town—and pressure deepens through systematic deletions to the culminating chord. The meaningful tightening is the shift from local subtractions to gathering all mapped silences into one act. Cost registers conceptually (loss of familiar noises, his anonymity) rather than viscerally dangerous, which slightly softens edge. Still, agency drives the turn and the outcome is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: silence refigured as communal music via embodied acts (signing, erasures, the note’s lingering). The recurring camera and capstan concretize “emptiness wound forward” into song. One line borders on thesis (“silence, properly mapped, is only music waiting for permission”), shaving subtlety. Nevertheless, the final reweighting—town learning to listen for what’s removed—resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature and confident omniscient distance that never leaks. Rhythm modulates cleanly from hush to swell; images are precise and consistent with maritime diction. Elision is purposeful, and assertions are earned by sensory proof. No dialogue needed; the narration carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet disciplined: metaphors cohere (music, mapping, maritime) without muddle, and sentences do multiple jobs. Variations in syntax keep propulsion; no paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter. Pacing breathes at the roof-top climax and tightens into the closing cadence. Word choice is specific and fresh without thesaurus strain.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—sign language mapping silence via a film-less camera to generate communal music—feels original and inevitable once revealed. Recurring objects and maritime logic synthesize into a singular vision. The risk of high-lyric abstraction pays off with clarity and a charged final image. Emotional truth underwrites the conceit, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
