<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are specific and coherent: reconcile a violent legacy through horticultural practice. Interiority is embodied via tactile actions (grafting, weaving with her own hair) rather than labels. Internal contradiction (hunter’s eyes, mother’s ethos) is present, though the struggle lands more as serene resolve than contested brink. The final planting forecloses vengeance with an emotional cost that reads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each beat builds toward the morning planting and the auditory pulse of roots. Orientation is clean from the outset; the throughline from finding the scrap to integrating it to planting is motivated. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (acceptance of the father’s death and transmutation of his life into the garden). The night’s labor provides the single meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cracked glass dome, desert light, blood-fed roses, and workbench procedures are specific and filtered by POV. Setting charges the final image (planting at the crash spot under the cracked dome’s dawn). Environmental logic (grafting to withstand harshness) integrates with theme. Sensory balance and purpose-driven detail keep it from postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (continuity over chaos) is clear, and pressure deepens through the choice to weave the father’s relic into living tissue. Escalation is quiet but present: discovery → decision → overnight labor → consecrating plant. Cost is chiefly emotional/ideological, not contested by active opposition, which keeps tension strong-but-gentle rather than acute. Still, the earned stasis at dawn reads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transformation over retribution emerges through particular acts (sheathed stem, songs, blood-bright blooms) and culminates in the roots’ “pulse.” The canvas-as-violent-life transfigured into growth is a resonant answer without overt moralizing, though one line edges toward thesis (“to weave continuity through chaos…”). Subtext around forgiveness inhabits color shifts and horticultural method. The final image reweights prior material convincingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyric texture; metaphors (engraved quiet, tranquil blaze) feel voice-integrated. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for this reflective horticulturalist. Rhythm modulates from atmospheric opening to steady-making in the night work, then hush at dawn. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are polished, with strong verb choices and layered images doing multiple jobs. A few elevated phrases risk purple but remain coherent and anchored in action, avoiding metaphor tangle. Minimal redundancy; momentum is steady despite lyric density. The final sentence cleanly recharges objects and mood without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—horticultural pacifism as active transmutation of a bounty hunter’s relic—is fresh and specific. The sheathing of canvas into thorns and “inculcating plants with values” feel boldly non-obvious yet earned by the world. Risks (lyric register, high-concept botany) heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. The closure image is distinct and memorable.</comment>
