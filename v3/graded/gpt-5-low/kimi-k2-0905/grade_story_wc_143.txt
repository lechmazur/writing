<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear—capture the last blooming before UV sterilizes them—and her choices (splitting the sand, waiting through the blush, timing the shutter) align under pressure. Interiority is specific and embodied, balancing duty with grief (“wondered if curiosity was just another form of mourning”). The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis with visible emotional cost. Lack of on-page relational pressure keeps it just shy of the absolute top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the causal spine holds: sand timers → terminator wind → anemone bloom/closure → shutter clicks. The live clock tightens options and the closure lands on the fossil imprint and crimson flush with cost. The accumulative/textural lens is consistent and paid off. No dropped set-ups; the hourglass grain and film camera both return decisively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lunar summit, terminator wind, feldspar vein, and Earthrise lighting are vivid and constraint-bearing; UV risk and electrostatic gusts shape tactics. Tools and micro-setting (antique camera, regolith, basalt shard) charge the final image. World rules are coherent and taught through action. The environment meaningfully determines what can and cannot be done.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document extinction before the UV cutoff) is clear and escalates via the chemical blush and wind, narrowing her window. The tightening shift when the buried half-grain goes pink forces her stance and triggers the final shots. The cost is extinction witnessed rather than prevented; her agency is endurance/attention under a ticking clock. A moral trade-off is implicit, not overtly dramatized, which slightly limits peak intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Time, witnessing, and abandonment cohere through the hourglass grain and Earthrise motifs, reweighted at the fossil imprint. “Curiosity as mourning” reframes her vocation without sermonizing; the final image answers with a charged, quiet refusal to let them vanish unmarked. One explicit line (“witnessing could be a form of resistance”) edges toward telling but is earned by scene pressure. Resonance lingers beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical single-POV voice with a distinct perceptual signature—technical diction braided with elegiac imagery—holds steady under pressure. Rhythm and syntax modulate well as the clock tightens. No head-hopping or register slips; compression remains legible. The voice feels singular and character-bound.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut and purposeful; images like “bioluminescent regret” and “letters never meant to be mailed” are fresh and coherent. No evident loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors; information density stays high without purple sprawl. Cadence tightens around the shutter clicks. Minor refrain (“purposefully curious”) reads as intentional patterning.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lunar anemones, antique film, a stolen hourglass grain used as dual chemical timers—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and lyric density pay off with clarity and emotional truth. Turns and payoffs arise from seeded particulars rather than late rule changes. The piece avoids stock space-age beats by focusing on elegiac documentation.</comment>
