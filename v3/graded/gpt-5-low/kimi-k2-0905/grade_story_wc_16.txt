<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (restore trust) is clear and her “carefully reckless” paradox governs choices under pressure. Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and steady-handed action despite fear. The renunciation—leaving the ink well—reads as a principled cost. Complexity is solid though the absence of a live interlocutor limits relational crucible depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: translation attempt → archive resistance → restitution vow → chorus consent → renunciatory exit. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reprices the premise from translation to restitution, and the archive hum alters the city’s options. Cost is present (risk of guards, tool forfeiture) though not stress-tested by a direct clash. Orientation is clean from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The archive is vivid and active—snuffing candles, exhaling scents, revealing the mural—and it constrains tactics, pushing Elara toward restitution. The glass ink well and lectern sigil function as charged micro-setting objects shaping the ending image. Sensory palette is rich across sight, sound, smell, and taste with POV-driven selectivity. World rules are coherent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (trust before sealing) are signaled early, and pressure tightens via environmental hostility and an implicit countdown. The meaningful turn is Elara’s choice to offer restitution, which earns consent and forecloses keeping the ink well. Costs are felt, if understated; no antagonist confrontation, but agency drives the resolution. Tension scales sentence-to-scene without loopiness.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of trust as covenantal harmony emerges through concrete acts (signatures descending, mural unsewn) rather than abstract sermonizing. The final image reweights language as relational promise, not mere code. A few declarative lines (“Trust would rekindle...”) brush the didactic, but the piece largely earns its insight through scene. Subtext of restitution versus extraction resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV with controlled rhythm and precise lexicon fits an arcane linguist’s mind. Psychic distance remains steady, modulating with pressure without head-hopping. Diction and cadence carry image-rich momentum while staying legible. The single spoken vow is purposeful and subtext-laden.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and varied syntax. Recurrent metaphor (“symphonies of truth”) edges toward repetition but functions as motif rather than padding. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; images cohere and propel. Minor purple glints are balanced by clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of linguistics, prismatic ink as promises, and an animate archive feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The restitution pivot transforms a familiar “forbidden vault” frame into a moral recalibration. Risks in lyric density and conceptual worldbuilding pay off cleanly. Final reconfiguration (the archive humming into the city) is memorable and specific.</comment>
