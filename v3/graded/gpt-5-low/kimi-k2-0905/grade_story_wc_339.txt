<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Mara’s contradictory impulses—an engineer’s compulsion to quantify versus the grieving woman’s need to relinquish—are dramatized in concrete choices (the notebook ritual, the final release). Elias applies precise pressure without hijacking agency. The renunciation carries visible cost: she consigns her notes to dissolution and leaves Elias behind. The arc feels earned from the early analytic stance to the narrative confession.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: details and motifs tighten toward a charged release. Closure lands on-page with cost when she cracks the globe and lets the plane fall, a reconfiguration of her premise (from physics to contract/story). Spatial and procedural anchors are clear early, and the final image reweights prior beats. No causality breaks; the persistent underwater constraint and presence of Death shape tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken library is vivid and functional, constraining motion and enabling images (lectern, dissolving books, pressure gauges). Setting charges the final act—releasing an “air” object to the seafloor within a drowned archive. Tool/object micro-setting (snow globe, atlas) integrates with choice. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, avoiding cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to keep seeking an equation or accept release; it deepens with Elias’s “contractual” prompt and the buried “1914” confession. The decisive act (letting brine in) narrows options and exacts an emotional price. Internal and external stakes braid cleanly. Minor note: the conflict is almost entirely interior, but it still escalates convincingly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action and image—artifact vs. absence, physics vs. narrative—culminating in a resonant final acknowledgment. The snow globe and the library recur with reweighted meaning. Slight on-the-nose phrasing (“mass times acceleration equals story over time”) edges toward meta, but doesn’t sink subtext. The melancholy aftereffect lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely tracks Mara’s perceptual bias; diction is controlled and apt for her analytic-poetic mind. POV remains stable; brief dialogue carries subtext and pressure rather than exposition. Rhythm modulates well at the peak choice. No head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are richly figurative yet precise; imagery often does double duty (magnesium flakes as unread telegrams). Momentum holds with minimal scaffolding and no loops. A few high-concentration metaphor stacks flirt with purple but maintain clarity and logic. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of a drowned library, Earhart’s spectral transmissions, and an intimate Death is striking and coherent. The “physics of letting go” reframed as narrative/contractual truth is an inventive turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and premise pay off without gimmickry. Specificity elevates beyond trope.</comment>
