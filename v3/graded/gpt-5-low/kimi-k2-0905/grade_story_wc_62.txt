<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, rooted motivation and a consistent interior logic carry the piece; the carver’s patience and guilt accrue credibly. The grandmother’s challenge (“carve absence into presence”) productively exposes a blind spot. Internal contradiction—craft as solace vs. avoidance—surfaces, though it’s voiced more than dramatized in micro-choices. The closing renunciation/redefinition feels earned, if more conceptual than behaviorally contested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; discoveries tighten toward the chrysalis enclosure and dawn emergence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost (she repurposes her tools and role). Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and set-ups (ribbon, poems, headstones) pay off. Minor reliance on exposition in the middle doesn’t undercut the on-page closing turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse, storm, glass, and the oak-through-glass architecture are vivid and integral, not postcard. Environment and recurring objects constrain and charge choices (chrysalides on tools, headstones entwined in roots, the chrysalis enclosing her). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; “thundering calm” reads as weather-body concordance. The final image is inseparable from place and tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular (understanding collective grief) and pressure coheres as the mentorship intensifies to the chrysalis. Escalation happens through pattern-density and cadence rather than reversals, appropriate to the chosen lens. The cost is an internal renunciation and reorientation of craft, legible on the page. External antagonism is minimal, but internal pressure is credible and mounting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (“how we carve absence into presence”) emerges from concrete acts: poems as shrouds, headstones titled with traded poems, metamorphosis as memorial. The ending reframes grief as transformation rather than inscription without stating a moral. A few lines verge on overt thesis (“each poem traded at dinner was a small death”), but most resonance is image-led. The poem quotations risk sentimentality yet are functionally integrated into the swarm and memorial logic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with a steady, character-filtered texture; diction and rhythm modulate with intensity (storm → chrysalis → dawn). The grandmother’s voice via wingbeats is a distinct inflection that fits the register. Minimal filter-verb scaffolding and no head-hopping. Occasional declarative thematic lines slightly flatten the otherwise controlled voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense but clean, with multi-function lines that advance image, theme, and action. Figurative language remains coherent to the established motif set (stone, wings, glass, chrysalides). No significant loops or cadence templates drag momentum; repetition of “thundering calm” is purposeful. A few generalized abstractions could be trimmed for maximal sharpness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone craft, spectral mentorship via butterflies, poem-trading as communal chrysalis—is fresh and organically interlocked. The chrysalis enclosing the protagonist is a memorable, earned intensification. Familiar elements (butterflies/grief) are transformed by specific vocational and communal practices. The piece risks bold lyricism without obscuring clarity.</comment>
