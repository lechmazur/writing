<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority and embodied choices (not looking at the echo, dipping the quill into hush, stepping into her outline) reveal a driven, singular mind. Motivation (to map an endless night) is consistent and escalates credibly under time pressure. The contradiction—urgency vs. stillness—glimmers but isn’t fully dramatized as a live struggle. The self-cost at the end reads earned but slightly abstracted from psychological friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: star dimming → mapping deepens → threshold drawn → star winks out → she enters the map. Closure lands on-page with credible cost (self-becoming coordinate; world dissolves), satisfying a conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the single-scene structure coheres. A hairline gap: stakes are cosmic and lyrical, not tested against a concrete counterforce beyond the clock.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory world: salt-slick stone, wind through crenels, lightning without thunder, echoing stairwell. Environment and objects charge the final image (booklet’s glow, fort dissolving, the star as live clock), effectively constraining tactics. The fort’s physical pressure is more atmospheric than tactical, but the hush’s “physics” function like setting rules. The dissolution of place at closure reweights everything with purpose.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finish the map before the last star dies) is clear and tightens steadily. The “clock” escalates, culminating in the irreversible threshold drawing and self-entry. Costs are legible (self-erasure into the map; sealing the world into endless night’s terms). Conflict remains primarily internal and metaphysical, with minimal counter-move beyond time and hush density.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of memorializing absence, cartography vs. oblivion, and self-sacrifice accrue through concrete acts (symbols for hush, trading motion for stillness). The final reconfiguration—becoming the first coordinate—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Recurring motifs (pebbles as eyes, gold leaf as scripture, thunder parenthesis) deepen rather than decorate. A touch of grand abstraction lingers but is anchored by particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, assured lyric voice with consistent perceptual signature and controlled cadence. Image density is high but pattern-taught early and maintained under pressure without head-hopping or stance slips. Psychic distance and tense are stable; elisions serve effect. A few lush runs flirt with saturation but remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors doing double duty (symbols as cartography and ontology). Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum; minimal scaffolding or loops. The figurative intensity is near-continuous, risking purple in spots, but coherence and clarity hold through the peak. Final image is crisp and unblurred by metaphor muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: “ambered hush,” mapping silence into ink that won’t dry, stepping into one’s outline—memorable and conceptually cohesive. Risks in diction and cosmology pay off with a distinctive vision. Turns feel inevitable given the established rules. Slight familiarity in the trope of self-sacrificial apotheosis is outweighed by executional originality.</comment>
