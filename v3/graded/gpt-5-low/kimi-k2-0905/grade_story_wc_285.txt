<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—he serves the crossing and accepts the price to “distill complexity into essence”—and his choices (threading, walking, swallowing the sphere) align. However, interior contradiction is muted; he rarely hesitates, so the change reads more acceptance than struggle. The girl’s pressure is effective but she functions as embodied promise, not as a fully contending character. Emotional embodiment is present (seat tingling, weight of the sphere) but remains largely lyric, not conflict-scraped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern builds around gutters-as-clock, fog, thread, and palimpsest until a crisp reconfiguration—the sandbar and identity shift—lands with cost. Closure is on-page and costly: coach/identity surrendered, map erased, sphere taken under the tongue; options reweighted as he becomes “no longer coachman.” Orientation is clean from the outset, and the live deadline (gutters stop) credibly tightens the turn. The final image conceptually reprices every prior crossing without soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fog-bound river, ticking gutters, invisible plank, and sandbar are not décor—they shape tactics and constrain choice. Recurring objects (needle, thread, coach seat) function as micro-setting and decisively charge the final image. Weather and water materially affect action and timing; the world’s rules stay consistent within its lyric logic. Specificity is selective and purposeful, threaded through action rather than pausing it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: complete the crossing before the gutters fall silent and distill a life into essence. Escalation deepens via the threading choice, the walk over absence, and the silence turning point; cost is the dissolution of coach and profession. Agency drives key beats (he threads, walks, accepts the droplet) though resistance is minimal, trimming felt jeopardy. The price is visible and enduring at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres—promise, ferry, thread, and essence converge into a resonant repricing of labor and story. The final act (tucking the sphere under the tongue) offers a charged, non-literal answer. A single line approaches thesis-stating (“every promise is a ferry…”) which slightly overarticulates what the images already earned. Subtext nonetheless survives, anchored in the object-work and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, unified lyric voice with precise rhythm and recurring diction (“palimpsest,” “spindrift,” “percolate”) taught early and sustained. Distance control is steady; elision serves pressure and pattern rather than withholding. Dialogue is spare but purposeful, carrying subtext. Elevated register fits the mythic mode and remains consistent with the chosen narrative stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong with high information density; images often do double duty. A few sentences stack metaphors (“percolate through ambient awareness of a forgotten kettle”) edging toward purple, but clarity holds. Rhythm varies and propulsion is maintained; no paraphrase loops or cadence templates dull the peak. Final images are clean and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of ferrywork, palimpsest, needle-thread cosmology, and a life distilled into a mouth-held sphere feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and conceptual frame pay off, avoiding gimmickry. Turns arise from seeded elements (gutters, seat-map, needle) rather than late conveniences. The vision reads singular and committed.</comment>
