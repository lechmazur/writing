<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ansel’s motive—repair time while “storing wonder in the cellar of reason”—is specific and enacted through concrete, expert choices. Interiority is vivid and embodied via his attentional habits and tool-use rather than labels. The inner contradiction (wonder vs. reason) runs under pressure and resolves in the earned renunciation of duplicating the key. Minimal friction: process unfolds with little resistance or mistake-making on the page, keeping the struggle mostly textural rather than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear accumulative-causal chain: study reflections → discover echo-scalloped metal → reverse-assemble feeding silence → release of lost hours → sealing/locking the artifact. Orientation is early and stable; the lens holds through a quiet but decisive transformation. Cost is legible at the end (echoes remain in stone; a key “he would never duplicate”); closure reads as both Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing. No set-ups are abandoned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern is not decorative; its reflective delays and quartz veins directly enable the method and charge the final image. Specific sensory texture (light at crepuscular angles; “calipers of shadow”) aligns with a locksmith’s eye and shapes tactics. The environment constrains seeing (peripheral focus) and houses the priced-away echoes, which deepens the ending’s resonance.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore time) is present from the outset and tightens via methodical deepening rather than overt reversals. The meaningful turn arrives when silence is fed back into the mechanism and the boy-image releases hours, followed by the renunciatory lock. Price and consequences are quiet but unmistakable. Slight softness: little on-page jeopardy or failure before the solution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres around the ethics of harvesting/keeping time and the tension between wonder and reason. Recurring images (reflections, echoes thinning, tools) accrue and reweight at the end without moralizing. The final cellar-and-key choice offers a resonant, non-literal answer about stewardship and limits. The single quoted line on “wonder” fits voice and doesn’t undercut subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is singular, precise, and consistent, with a locksmith’s perceptual bias shaping diction and metaphor. Rhythm modulates with pressure; lyric density is controlled and legible. No head-hopping; the one line of dialogue is in character and catalytic. Purposeful elision (e.g., the boy-image) is taught by the pattern and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (“calipers of shadow,” “percussion craters”) and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language remains coherent to the established physics and craft; no mixed-metaphor muddle in peak beats. Syntax varies and propels; no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Line-level choices sharpen, not blur, the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Echo-to-torque and peripheral-delay mechanics feel freshly imagined and character-specific. The reverse-engineering with silence and the ethical “storage” of wonder create a non-obvious but inevitable synthesis. Risk-taking in image logic and method elevates without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration (a mirror trained on the future, an un-duplicable key) is memorable and earned.</comment>
