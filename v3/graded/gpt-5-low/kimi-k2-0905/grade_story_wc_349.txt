<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The vendor’s motive—mapping absence to find where stories begin—guides concrete choices (pricing by what’s left behind, bottling absence, the final self-erasure). Secondary characters (boy, librarian) apply pressure that reveals her duality as merchant and custodian. Interiority is mostly enacted through image rather than self-report, but the costed final choice reads earned. A touch more embodied feeling at the tilt moment could sharpen the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sale thickens absence until the library tilts, forcing a decisive act. Closure lands on-page with cost when she drinks the moonlight and becomes the door; the final shattering bottle reconfigures meaning (Conceptual Repricing plus Decisive Change). Orientation is clear from the outset; no causality breaks. Setups (bottles, parole, scales) pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: glass orchard, scales, clouds pressing, and sagging branches all exert pressure on choices. Environmental shifts (tilt, storm notebooks) directly escalate stakes and charge the final image. Details are selective and integrated through the vendor’s praxis. World rules stay consistent and are learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes escalate coherently as absence accumulates and destabilizes the library, culminating in her renunciatory act. The librarian beat sharpens pressure by demonstrating systemic cost when memory intrudes. The decision to self-subtract clearly forecloses a path and resolves the accumulating strain. The tension is mostly conceptual rather than visceral, but it tightens decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of absence as genesis, memory versus narrative, and commodified beginnings develop through events and objects rather than lecture. The line “Stories begin where memory ends; I sell the scissors” edges toward thesis, but the scene earns it and the ending reweights it. The door-outline transformation offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature sustains across turns. Dialogue is sparse but effective and subtextual (“priced by the gram of what you leave behind”). Voice modulates with pressure (from hush to tilt to shattering) without head-hopping. Diction is elevated yet consistent with the world’s logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High-density imagery remains coherent and purposeful; lines often do multiple jobs (world, action, theme). Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep momentum. Occasional flourish risks purple but doesn’t blur causality or the closure image. The final cadence is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—vendor of quantified absence in a glass-orchard library—feels singular and inevitable by the end. Bottled moonlight, parole-words, mirror-ledger, and door-outline recombine in fresh, specific ways that drive choice and closure. Risk-taking heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. The last image smartly transforms prior motifs into a new premise seed.</comment>
