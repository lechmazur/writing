<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (return to restore a collapsed faith), and choices consistently reveal character under pressure (excavating, aligning the sundial, using a rib as gnomon, teaching the hymn). Interiority leans lyric but remains embodied (“sundial base pulse… remembered the shadow”). Contradictory impulses (exile’s distance vs. the island’s gravity) are present but not deeply contested on the page. The caretaker adds light relational pressure without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative build that pays off causally at dawn: discoveries (light mapping, mirrors, moving roots) culminate in the sundial-ritual that restores the prayer house. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/why), and the world’s rules accrue consistently. Closure lands decisively with felt cost (she foregoes leaving again) and a reconfigured status quo (a singing orchard-chapel). No dead patches or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and functional—roots through bones literally guide action and constrain choices (root-road to the ridge, the tomb as worksite). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (myrrh air, oxidized-copper eyes). Recurring objects (sundial base, rib) charge the final image and become architecture. World rules stay coherent and are learned through doing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring faith/place) tightens through pattern: mapping light at noon, the mirrors’ generations, moving roots, then the dawn test. Agency drives the turn—she makes the gnomon from a rib and chooses the site/time. The price is a renunciation (she never leaves) and the need to recruit voices. Tension is mostly spiritual and textural rather than perilous but remains coherent and cumulative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of interrupted journeys and communal faith rebuilt through ritual and memory emerges organically from action, not thesis. The mirrors’ fractured selves and the root-road concretize diaspora return and ancestral suspension. The final cadence reweights prior images (shadow, song, bones) without moralizing. Ambiguity (miracle vs. ritual technology) enriches rather than blurs meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and character-filtered. Dialogue is minimal but pointed (“rebuild or rob?”) and advances stakes via subtext. Psychic distance is steady; elision patterns are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density prose carries multiple jobs per line with clean syntax and momentum; images are fresh and coherent (“bell tower that rang without a tongue”). Figurative saturation is rich but mostly avoids muddle; a few lush clusters push purple without tipping into opacity. No loops or scaffolding; prosody supports escalation and breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a “catacomb orchard,” a sundial made whole by a rib gnomon, mirrors that sing generations into the air—fresh and inevitable by the end. Risks in imagery and myth-logic are fully integrated into character stakes and closure. The rebuild turn surprises yet reads earned in hindsight. Distinct vision avoids template solutions.</comment>
