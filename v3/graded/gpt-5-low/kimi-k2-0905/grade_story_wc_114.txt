<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation (“she needed its exact weight”) drives concrete actions under pressure, and the duty-to-protect vs. bodily cost contradiction feels alive. Micro-choices (smudging, going outside, erasing leaves) reveal a hierarchy of values without tidy rationalization. The final renunciation/expulsion reads earned. A hairline distance from fuller relational pressure keeps it just shy of flawless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens holds; the closure is an on-page decisive change (expelling the stone) with visible cost and a reconfigured world-state (aurora dimming, antenna stilled). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the pattern of instruments/weight is taught then paid off. Because/therefore causal threads (seed swallowed to protect valley → weight escalates → smudge/erase → expulsion) are clean. The cost is legible in the body and the “temporarily innocent” valley.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station and its tools are tactile and consequential (barograph, anemometer, rain gauge as burial site), charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“chlorophyll sorrow,” “anemometer…counting heartbeats”). Environment constrains choices (cold, snow, instruments) and shapes tactics. World rules remain consistent within the lyrical mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through “heavier,” the rootlet piercing, and the auroral escalation. Agency culminates in the deliberate erasure-smudging and the decision to expel and bury, with a palpable price. Internal and external pressures braid effectively. The only slight limit is the absence of a second antagonistic presence to torque the crucible further at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of truth’s weight, protection vs. erasure, and the cost of innocence emerge through specific images and acts rather than statements. The botanical illustration’s shifting meaning reweights the premise at the end; the logbook entry reframes truth as measurable sorrow. Ambiguity is purposeful (“temporarily innocent”), avoiding moral tidiness. Resonance lingers without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature and disciplined rhythm. Diction coheres with the oracle’s vocation and sensory bias; patterned elision is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or stance wobble. Density modulates well under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with few redundancies; images often do double duty. A handful of metaphors verge on lush but remain coherent and purposeful. Momentum holds through sentence variety and clean sequencing. Minor purple pressure in places keeps it just under the highest band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fault-tolerant oracle + weather instrumentation + truth-as-weight is a fresh synthesis executed with confidence. The laurel illustration’s transformation into map/wrapping shroud is ingenious and inevitable in hindsight. Risky, lyrical choices heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The conceptual integrity is strong and memorable.</comment>
