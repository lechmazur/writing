<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (guardianship, ritualized befriending of uncertainty), with embodied, character-specific perception. Contradictory impulses—homesickness versus duty—play out in the approach/retreat ritual and the final refusal to cross. Micro-choices (offering/taking back the pendant; leaving it on the ice) feel earned. Slight softness in overt struggle keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; the garden-to-threshold ritual tightens into a clear Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Closure lands on-page with cost: she renounces crossing and surrenders the pendant. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the final image reweights earlier motifs without breaking the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrally functional: frost, mist, and hedge-labyrinth constrain tactics (waiting) and charge the boundary. Environmental rules are consistent (frozen match) and culminate in the pendant-on-ice image. Sensory selection stays POV-true (rosemary as parchment; breath as commas), fueling tone and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (friendship with uncertainty vs. passage) are clear and deepen when the warm twin garden appears. The tightening is quiet but unmistakable: the offer to cross is live, then refused with cost (relinquishing the pendant, embracing uncertainty). Escalation is primarily accumulative rather than confrontational, yet coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring particulars (light’s boundary, waiting as method, object-soul debate) rather than sermon. The pendant’s Morse and the line “to make friends with uncertainty…” verge on explicitness but still feel diegetic and image-driven. The ending reconfigures the premise: she wears the boundary as second fur—conceptual repricing with emotional charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyrical third-person carries consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature. Diction, rhythm, and image patterns are confident and modulate with pressure. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off; no head-hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is dense yet purposeful; images do double duty without muddle. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax maintain momentum in a quiet mode. A few near-aphoristic lines flirt with overstatement but don’t blunt the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a feral librarian, frost-as-text, uncertainty as companion, and “boundaries of light” woven into tactic and theme. Risks (high-lyric density, conceptual frame) pay off with an original, inevitable-feeling ending. Freshness is rooted in specific, coherent world-logic rather than ornament.</comment>
