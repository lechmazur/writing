<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—protecting the tower from forgetting—drives every micro-choice (adding the black stone, nudging the glass, bottling the sound). His fear the keeper has stepped over the rail creates a credible internal contradiction (solitude versus connection). Interiority is concrete and character-particular (“the sound was the feeling of safety trying to fit inside metal”). The endurance at the end feels earned, with loneliness as a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of silent exchange tightens when the lamp dies early, catalyzing his ritual responses. Closure lands as Charged Poise with the overhead stone’s click confirming the keeper’s presence, reweighting his burden. Stakes cohere from first line through final image; cost is on-page (he cannot fix the light, only witness and preserve). Orientation is clean and the single-scene flow is seamless.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room, Fresnel lens, brass rail, and sea glass are tactile and POV-filtered; the environment shapes what he can do (rituals instead of repairs). Sensory detail is precise (wet iron, old hymns; rust smear on the top stone) and specific to a keeper’s world. Recurring objects charge the final image, especially the sea glass’s warmth in his palm. The setting and objects constrain choice and inflect meaning rather than serving as postcard décor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates when the lamp dies earlier than expected, deepening his fear the keeper is gone. His agency produces the key tightening (answering with a fourth stone, bottling the glass), and the late auditory confirmation reconfigures his options to continued endurance. Stakes remain intimate but consequential (memory versus erasure); the cost is an ongoing vow rather than a fix. The tension stays taut without false dramatics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of witness, memory, and the ethics of keeping versus saving emerge organically through ritual and image. The final act—holding green warmth in his glove—reprices “protection” as preserving felt memory, not restoring function. Symbolism accrues through particulars (stones’ specific markings, “mute Morse”) and resists tidy moralizing. The quiet ending lingers with conceptual and emotional charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and unmistakably filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Diction (“salt-ghost,” “charged poise of the stones”) is controlled and purposeful without slipping registers. Rhythm modulates with pressure—longer cadences for memory, clipped for apprehension—and no head-hopping occurs. Elision and metaphor are taught early and maintained with clarity to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, motive) and rarely repeat. Figurative language is rich yet coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors; the “safety trying to fit inside metal” is fresh and precise. Minor density peaks remain legible and propel rather than stall. No scaffolding or cadence loops interfere with closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—a silent, ritual correspondence via stones in a failing lighthouse—is distinct and deeply integrated. The anonymous exchange transforms familiar lighthouse tropes into an intimate ethic of keeping. The closing auditory click is a non-obvious yet inevitable reconfiguration. Risk-taking in tone and object-ritual pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
