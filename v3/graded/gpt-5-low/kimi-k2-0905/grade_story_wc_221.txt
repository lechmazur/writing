<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael’s grief, guilt, and ritual drive clear micro-choices (returning to the sealed deck, opening the hatch, accepting the out-of-phase corridor, taking his mother’s hand). Contradictory impulses—fear vs. longing, skepticism vs. need—are embodied in tactile beats (the frost window, the pencil roll, the crawlspace). His final choice is earned by the compass/voice/maps escalation. The visible cost—abandoning the baseline world, leaving the jacket—reads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and anomalies stack causally (needle twitch → voice → light → hatch → maps → corridor → hand). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the shutdown rules constrain later turns. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the station’s “abandonment” is repriced, and Kael forecloses his prior stasis. The cost is legible in the parting artifacts (jacket, sketchbook) and implied severance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and specific (frost-rimmed window, shutdown intercom, coffin crawlspace, starfield lag) and it constrains choices (sealed deck; maintenance hatch; light “that should have died”). Recurring objects-as-setting (compass, deck, hatch) charge the final image and the rules stay consistent. Time dilation and phase-rotation are shown through physical phenomena, not exposition. Atmosphere sustains and deepens theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (what to do with grief/“true north”) tightens through concrete escalations: anomaly recognition → discovery of hidden maps → corridor apparition → acceptance. Agency peaks in the decision to enter the crawlspace and to take the offered hand; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The price—leaving the ordinary frame—is felt, with a credible renunciation encoded in the jacket/sketchbook leave-behind. Quiet but clear escalation under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motifs (compass, maps, silence, time stretch) evolve into a coherent theme: reorienting grief as exploration. The mother’s “true north” maxim reweights earlier images at closure, though the explicit caption edges into stated moralizing, slightly blunting subtlety. Subtext mostly carries the insight through action and image (the corridor of constellations, the folded deck). The ending lingers with earned resonance despite that overt line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“starfield temporally stretched,” “whale song heartbeat”) remains stable and precise. Voice modulates under pressure without register drift; the brief dialogue is character-true and scene-active. Patterned diction (echo/silence, compass/true north) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight: images carry multiple jobs and the rhythm breathes with the scene. Figurative density is high but coherent and not redundant; key metaphors (folded corridor, letters-late photons) remain consistent. No loops or scaffold, and sentence variety supports momentum. Minor lushness risks purple but never obscures sense or causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of SF grief-ritual with time-phase mechanics and an heirloom compass that becomes a relational bearing. The maintenance-hatch star maps and the folded corridor feel surprising yet inevitable. Risks (lyric density, conceptual repricing ending) pay off cleanly. The final artifacts recontextualize the world with memorable specificity.</comment>
