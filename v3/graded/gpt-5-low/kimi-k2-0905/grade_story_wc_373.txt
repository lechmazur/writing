<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation and contradiction are vivid and credible: she wants proof of corrosion yet aches to be stopped. Interiority is concrete (the fob’s tail digging half-moons; heartbeat in the horn) and her micro-choices accrue to a costly renunciation. Jonah’s presence applies quiet pressure without stealing focus. The final trade reads earned by the waiting and rehearsal of betrayals.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative design holds cleanly to closure: the sunrise deadline governs a steady tightening. The decisive handover and the “small wet click” land cost on the page, reconfiguring the relationship to father and object. Orientation is established immediately under the pier with a clear goal and rule-set (truce of hush). No causal cheats; the absence itself is the engine.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The pirate market under the rotting pier is tactile and dynamic: lanterns, rising tide, barnacled pilings, crates taking water. Environment constrains behavior and cadence (submerged market, dawn light spearing through cracks) and charges the final image. The fob functions as micro-setting/tool, shaping choices. World rules are learned through action (phonograph bottling emotions) without dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recording the break of trust before dawn) is signaled early and tightens through the waiting, tide rise, and non-arrival of the father. The earned cost is the relinquishing of the heirloom and the conceptual loss it records. External opposition is mostly atmospheric and internalized, which slightly softens edge, but the clock and hush enforce pressure. The sunrise beat credibly narrows options to a single, costly act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of silence as currency and trust as recordable rupture emerges through concrete particulars, not thesis. The truce of hush, the widow’s tear, and the labeled cylinder align into a resonant repricing of love and loyalty. The ending reweights prior images (lantern gold, fallen-star jars) without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in the relief/emptiness mixture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct first-person lyric voice sustains pressure with controlled rhythm and image (black moon horn, calm lighthouse eyes). Diction stays character-coherent, with no head-hopping or stance slips. Elision is purposeful and taught; no withheld facts for cheap effect. A few lush metaphors flirt with excess but remain legible and voice-driven.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs (world, mood, motive) with minimal scaffold; sentence rhythm paces the vigil. Figurative texture is rich yet mostly precise; the “small wet click” is economical and potent. Minor repetition (“false starts,” imagined rescues) is purposeful rather than churning. No mechanical or clarity errors; density is high but controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The emotional phonograph, moonshine fob truce, and tidal pirate market synthesize into a singular vision. The final reweighting (trust as an audible artifact) feels inevitable from planted rules. Risks (lyric mode, quiet non-confrontation) heighten stakes instead of obscuring them. The piece avoids template beats and carries authentic strangeness with human truth.</comment>
