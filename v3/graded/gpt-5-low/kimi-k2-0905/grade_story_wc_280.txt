<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Casper’s need for “one more ovation” is vivid and consistent, and his choice to tie the coin to the quince and weave echoes shows motive under pressure. Interiority is concretely sensory (tastes of iron curtain weights), and Lila’s brief presence acts as relational pressure. The internal contradiction (applause vs. “possibility”) is present but lightly tested; success comes smoothly. The cost—Lila’s disappearance as he regains form—lands but could cut deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear: ritual → maze → orchard stage → weave → heartbeat → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration/near-decisive change (ghost’s outline sharpens; carries an “endless encore”). Orientation is clean early, and causal links are consistent within the magical rules. The felt price (Lila gone; his encore now a burden he must carry) keeps the ending from a soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is lush and purposeful: hedge maze constrains access, orchard stage and quince tree are used as tools, and the environment literally applauds. Multisensory specificity (echo-scents, floral chords) is filtered through a synesthetic perspective. Recurring objects (coin, thimble) charge the final image and tactics. World rules stay stable and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and tight: reclaiming identity/possibility through performance. Escalation arrives via intensifying ritual (press, flip, tie, weave) and the pressure of aligning 1923 with now. The reversal/tightening is modest but real when Lila instructs and the timeline folds to a single heartbeat. Opposition is largely internal/ambient, so cost feels more elegiac than punishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory-as-performance, grief as architecture, and nostalgia as generative power emerge through concrete acts. The final image (carrying an “endless encore”) reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext in Lila’s counsel (“make them feel time is a song they almost remember”) coheres with the method and outcome. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a believable perceptual signature; synesthetic diction feels character-rooted. Dialogue is brief, musical, and functional, with clear status dynamics. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping or register breaks. Rhythm modulates well through the peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; sentences propel rather than stall. Lushness skirts purple but remains coherent and purposeful; minimal redundancy. No figurative muddle at the climax; cadence supports the accumulative lens. Minor compression might tighten a line or two, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a stage ghost’s ritual artistry, a synesthetic seamstress, a hedge-maze orchard, echo-scents weaving time. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the coin’s properties and the orchard’s rules. Risks in concept and diction heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The applause-from-leaves and thimble spin seal memorability.</comment>
