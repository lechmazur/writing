<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear motive (rescue the grandmother’s promise) and a coherent inner logic; pyromania reframed as revelation is compelling. However, contradictory impulses are muted, with few micro-choices under pressure beyond finding and pressing the tapestry. Interiority is vivid but leans explanatory rather than dramatized conflict. The final identity shift feels earned but low-friction on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative structure lands a conceptual repricing: arson as preservation and the false libraries exposed. Orientation is clean early; the thread from artistic ciphers → fragment → revelation → collapse tracks. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, though the archive’s collapse gives an on-page price. One tightening (descent to fragment to glow) anchors closure effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is rich and purposeful: soot, lavender-sulfur perfume, warmth in the tapestry, and subterranean air shape perception and choices. The archive and its physicality constrain movement and enable discovery (niche, false wall, heat-activated messages). Recurring objects charge the final image. Vivid without excess world scaffolding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering the promise/truth) is maintained and escalates through discovery to revelation and physical collapse. The meaningful deepening is the tapestry’s reweave and identity substitution; it narrows options by ending the search and triggering the archive’s collapse. Still, tension remains mostly conceptual; danger and trade-offs are lightly felt. Resolution is agentive and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic spine is coherent—destruction as revelation, truth preserved through burning—and the final image reweights prior motifs. Yet the piece states its moral explicitly in several places (“some knowledge must be burned clean”), reducing subtext. Strong image-work (torch of knowledge) keeps it from didacticism entirely. Resonance lingers but could trust implication more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent single-POV lyric voice with a distinct diction (“volcanic tenderness”) that threads the piece. Rhythm and stance hold; compression works for the mode. Some over-explication and motif repetition edge toward sameness but do not break control. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line-level prose is mostly clean and propulsive with sensuous precision. Occasional purple density and thematic telling create minor drag and redundancy (reiterating the same insight in adjacent lines). Figurative language stays consistent but is frequent. The final cadence lands clearly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: arsonist as archivist, chemical-coded artworks, and a tapestry that reweaves identity. The angle feels fresh even if the “truth through fire” theme is familiar. Turns arise from established motifs rather than late rule changes. Boldness is thematic rather than structural, but it coheres.</comment>
