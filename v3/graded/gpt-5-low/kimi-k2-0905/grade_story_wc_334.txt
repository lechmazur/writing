<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and embodied: curiosity versus the anesthesia of forgetting. The micro-choices (headlamp, kneel, read bruises, refuse the exchange, cut the mushroom) track a credible internal conflict. The remembered line from her mother turns the dilemma without feeling convenient. Slight softness remains because the return of memories carries more sweetness than on-page pain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain from detection → sextant → temptation → counter-ritual. Closure lands as a decisive change (refusal to forget and recovery), with a conceptual cost (loss of numbing). Patterning of Pleiades and the ring pays off the setup. The resolution feels slightly easy emotionally, trimming the felt price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Tools and objects (sextant, ring, headlamp) are inseparable from setting and tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Mara’s folklorist attention. World rules are learned through action without expository clog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reclaim memory without surrendering to forgetfulness. Pressure coheres and tightens toward the exchange at the glowing ring; her scalpel choice forecloses a path. The cost is present but more conceptual than visceral. No extraneous reversals; escalation is elegant and sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of habit, memory, and curiosity interlock with concrete motifs (Pleiades, bruises, sextant). The final reweighting—choosing wonder over erasure—resonates. A line edges toward thesis statement (“curiosity is just memory trying to find its way home”), slightly tilting into telling. Nonetheless, the lyrical images do most of the thematic work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, confident lyric voice with a folklorist’s perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure and stay within plausible lexicon. Quoted lines feel organic and texturally integrated. No distance slippage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; nearly every line carries image, action, or implication. Figurative language is original and mostly controlled, with minimal purple drift. No loops or scaffold; cadence varies purposefully. Minor lushness in the closing third slightly softens edge without obscuring sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—folklore fieldwork as memory retrieval in a drowned orchard of ships and stars—feels genuinely fresh. Recurring objects transform meaning with inevitability at the end. Risks are taken without gimmickry, and the world logic coheres. Only the ease of the recovery tempers the overall audacity.</comment>
