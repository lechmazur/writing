<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira’s motives are specific and competing: professional duty to verify/return versus moral appetite to end conquest, sharpened by the cereus’s imperative. Her embodied conflict (“mulberry ache,” roots around ankles) renders the choice felt rather than abstract. The final act forecloses a path with visible cost and aligns with her earlier micro-choices (coffee reading, placing the violin). A hairline quibble: her acceptance of potential famine is briskly handled, leaving a slight ethical aftertaste underexplored.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: research → observatory return → coffee divination revealing the origin and cost → time pressure → decisive performance → immediate world-scale consequence. Closure lands on the page via a decisive act (playing) with explicit costs (failed harvests, dynastic collapse) and a charged final image (puddle reflecting only Lira). The drive lens reads causal with no contradictions, and the time limit (“before the promise loses its glow”) shapes tactics. No orientation debt; the early anchors pay off at the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is sensorially vivid and functionally constraining: midsummer hinge, moonlight refraction, and a dome that literally cracks under the note. The ice-violin’s materiality and the cereus’s physical rooting link environment to choice and cost. Details are selective and POV-charged, avoiding tourist catalog. The final image is inseparable from place and objects.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are declared early and tightened by the live clock and the coffee-stain revelation, culminating in a single, high-cost decision. Internal and external pressures interlock (telepathic plant urging vs. empire-scale consequence). The cost is legible and alters the world-state. Slight softening: the famine/ethical calculus flashes by quickly, but tension remains coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of ownership, memory, imperial extraction, and the ethics of restoration emerge organically through objects and choices, not moralizing. “Perforation” evolves from forged signatures to destiny, reweighted by the last line’s “perforated destinies.” The ending offers a resonant answer—action over neutrality—with a conceptual price that lingers. Ambiguity remains (gratitude and warning from plants), enriching the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lush, and consistent, with a controlled lyric register that feels character-bound. Psychic distance remains steady; focalization never leaks, and certainty matches what Lira can infer. Rhythm modulates appropriately at the climax without losing clarity. A few dense metaphor clusters flirt with overrichness but stay legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful images doing multiple jobs, and clean sequencing. The prose skims the edge of purple in places but avoids muddle; metaphors cohere to ice, propagation, and perforation. Minimal scaffold and no loops dulling momentum. Final cadence is crisp and well-cut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Ice-crystal provenance, plant telepathy, coffee-cartomancy, and a velvet observatory cohere into a singular, non-obvious synthesis. The turn—using an archival act (verification) to commit a subversive performance—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece follows its implications boldly to a charged, costly image.</comment>
