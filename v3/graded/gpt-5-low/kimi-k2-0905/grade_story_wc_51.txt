<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific (gather burdens to stabilize the valley), and internal conflict culminates in the earned confession about her sister. Micro-choices under pressure—orienting breath, tilting the burner, touching sheets, deciding to speak—track to motive. Emotional embodiment is conveyed through tactile ritual and blood on the wick rather than label-speak. Slight abstraction keeps some feeling mediated by image rather than lived sensation, but the cost lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held; beats build from ritual to pressure (sputtering flame, closing grotto) to confession and release. Closure is on-page with cost (blood, confession) and a decisive reconfiguration (violet flare, opening to starlight, valley settles). Orientation is clean from the first line; no lens ambiguity. Set-ups pay off (the burner, hush, lattice, burdens) without convenience.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, recursive geometry, and the burner function as lived setting that constrains options (heat needed, silence tightens, seizure risk). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, with recurring objects charging the final image (lamp left as a “small sun”). World rules are learned through action (calcifying notes, density threads) and remain consistent. Setting directly shapes the protagonist’s tactics and the story’s cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (maintain the valley’s integrity) is tied to a clear, escalating constraint (failing flame; grotto will seize). The reversal arrives when her usual method fails, forcing the higher-cost choice: confessing her own burden. Price is legible (blood, emotional exposure) and alters options, enabling the final opening. Pressure remains coherent and tight under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of grief’s weight, communal burden, and the necessity of personal surrender emerge organically from ritual and consequence. The final images (forgiveness reflections; leaving the burner as sun) resonate. However, the closing sentence states the moral too explicitly, reducing lingering ambiguity. The story otherwise avoids sermonizing and lets images carry meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is singular, controlled, and consistent, with a tactile, precise lyricism. Diction and syntax modulate with pressure (from reverie to violet flare) without losing clarity. POV distance is stable and credible for this mythic-fable mode. No dialogue is needed; the prose itself acts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet purposeful; images multitask and propel momentum. Figurative language remains coherent to the world’s logic (sound to calcified sheets; density threads). Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing sustain clarity. Slight saturation of metaphor is well-patterned and taught early, so it doesn’t blur the peak beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concept and imagery feel fresh: “shingled hush,” fractal weaving of burdens, air calcifying via sound. The ritual mechanics and the ethical turn (pay with one’s own weight) synthesize into an inevitable yet surprising resolution. Risks in diction and worldbuilding heighten stakes and coherence. The final reweighting (forgiveness reflections; lamp-turned-sun) is memorable and specific.</comment>
