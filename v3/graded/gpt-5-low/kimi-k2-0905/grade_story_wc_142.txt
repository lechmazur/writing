<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority (the stone chip, breath-counting, color-scanning) and credible contradiction (“part of her wanted…unchanged, part…to survive at all”). Micro-choices under pressure—painting the new symbol, convening the meeting, endorsing reorganization—align with motive. The mooted extreme option (scuttling) is raised but not dramatized as a contested scene, softening the crucible. Secondary characters add texture but don’t apply individualized pressure back on Lina.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and strong; causality holds: branding cues → graffiti signal → midnight assembly → overnight reorg → inspectors’ retreat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: privatization is postponed; the final symbol “we are still becoming” reframes endurance at cost. The price is present but conceptual—postponement, not victory—keeping it shy of the very top. The accumulative/situational drive is consistent through to the charged poise ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: raft-city mechanics directly shape tactics (swapping barges, repurposing venues) and the inspectors’ bafflement. Sensory detail is specific and POV-filtered (calliope echoes, popcorn smoke, surveyors’ orange). Recurring objects (stone chip, calliope) charge the final image. The world rules stay consistent and are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve versus sell—remains coherent, with a meaningful tightening via the collective redesign that forecloses a passive path. Escalation is protagonist-driven (graffiti signal, plan execution) and yields a tangible beat (inspectors withdraw). The cost is partial and deferred, acknowledged in “merely been postponed,” so the pressure never truly bites down on a sacrifice. Still, the internal and external conflicts interweave effectively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of ownership, commodification, and adaptive survival emerge organically from particulars (graffiti codes, mocking logos, dissolving poem-prizes). The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “we are still becoming” and a city “unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved.” One sentence edges toward thesis-statement clarity, but overall subtext carries the load. The stone chip motif elegantly reframes heritage as living, not static.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close holds steady, with a strong perceptual signature (metaphoric calliope, tactile noticing). Rhythm modulates with pressure; exposition is baked into image. A single register blip (the sudden “投射的火花”) reads slightly foreign to the established diction but doesn’t disrupt coherence. Dialogue is minimal yet purposeful (meeting declaration) and never breaks voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is tight, vivid, and economical; metaphors tend to be apt and layered (“gaslight…tiny waves frozen mid-crash”). No scaffold loops; sentences do multiple jobs. Mild purple pressure is controlled, and the late multilingual spark slightly jars but doesn’t obscure sense. The prose propels without clutter and releases cleanly into a charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The raft-carnival against privatization, with graffiti as insurgent cartography and tactical layout-swaps, feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, symbolic coding) pay off and cohere. The final reweighting—change as performance rather than capitulation—lands with originality. Emotional specificity prevents the premise from reading as allegory alone.</comment>
