<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crisp and embodied: the translator chooses to “unknot by naming” despite anesthetic haze and guilt. Contradictory impulses—numbness versus accountability, flight versus staying—coexist and resolve in a costly endurance. The relationship with the boy acts as the crucible that forces the confession and the choice to stay. Actions align with motives, culminating in the charged discharge note.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: motifs (coral, spiral, droplets, notes) intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the final alignment of coral and cast and the added discharge line, with a felt emotional price. Orientation is clear from the outset (field hospital atrium at twilight, translator, boy). The before/after is legible: shared anxieties reweighted from shrapnel to sediment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting and constraint, shrinking the world to “cot, coral, and child.” Environmental details (droplets as syllables, banana leaves, glass roof) are woven through action and charge the final image. The coral fragment acts as object-as-setting, literally aligning with the cast to close. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, guided by the narrator’s professional lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting meaning and relieving shared guilt—tightens as decoding reveals personal culpability (birthday, mistranslated market). The meaningful turn is the narrator’s confession and decision to stay, paying emotional cost. Pressure escalates through image density and revelation consistent with the accumulative lens. The resolution is earned and leaves a charged stasis rather than a neat fix.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: translation as moral act, reef memory, children’s ledger of adult failure. Subtext runs in images (spiral, fish, droplets) that reweight at the end without sermonizing. The “lotus-hearted ache” evolves from wound to dew-bearing endurance, offering a resonant answer about repair through naming. Complexity remains intact, avoiding moral simplification.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and steady under pressure, with precise rhythmic modulation. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext and motive (“Unknot them,” “I unknot by naming,” “stay”). Diction suits a translator’s sensibility and remains consistent despite morphine haze. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet controlled; metaphors (reef, spiral, shrapnel-to-sediment) are coherent across beats. Density is high but purposeful, with few redundancies and strong propulsion for a lyric piece. A couple of lines edge toward thesis-y, but they’re earned by scene pressure and don’t dull closure. Syntax and paragraph rhythm support the accumulating cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—war translation ethics refracted through reef ecology and children’s confessions—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects turn in surprising, organic ways (coral aligning with cast; droplets translating steps). Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reweighting avoids cliché and feels singular.</comment>
