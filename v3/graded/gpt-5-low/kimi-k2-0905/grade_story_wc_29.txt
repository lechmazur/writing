<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive and method are clear and consistent, with embodied stakes (SWR needle kissing red, kneecap howl) showing credible pressure. Her readiness to “sacrifice certainty” for chaos creates a small but convincing internal contradiction. Cost is present but modest—strain and only a temporary win rather than a deeper personal loss. The single-POV interiority is specific and avoids stock therapy-speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: arrival → setup keyed to the moon → probes hit → counter-wave → adversary adapts → tactical pivot → peak → hush. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: the carrier folds “for this orbit,” harmony only paused, cost acknowledged on-page. Orientation is crisp within the first lines (who/where/when) and the ticking clock (02:17) tightens options. No teleporting props; constraints (generator, tower, SWR window) shape every move.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Environment and tools actively constrain choice: the antique tower, SWR limits, photocell-moon trigger, and generator define tactics and timing. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-colored (“vinyl dust,” “sodium lights”). World rules (ionospheric skip, 37 Hz) are shown through action. The final image is charged by place and tools (hand on cooling transmitter; charts tucked), not decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates: the town’s division intensifies as the probes arrive. The tricksters’ adaptive frequency hop forces a meaningful, risky pivot to “chaos meeting chaos.” Price is felt (equipment stress, narrow sky window, only a temporary reprieve), though personal sacrifice remains light. Tension is maintained at sentence and scene scale without reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of interference vs. consent, media contagion, and humility under uncertainty emerge from concrete beats, not lecture. The glacier record pivot reframes “interference” as caretaking, culminating in the closing reprisal about listening back. The final assertion (“interference…another word for love”) edges close to a thesis statement but is mostly earned by prior images. Ambiguity remains—victory is provisional, which deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyric-technical voice matches a scientist/DJ’s sensibility, blending astrophysics with tactile grit. Distance control stays steady; no head-hopping or register whiplash. Rhythmic modulation under pressure (shorter, punchier lines at the peak) supports action. A few lush metaphors flirt with excess but remain coherent and voice-true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with crisp propulsion; most lines carry multiple jobs (world, pressure, character). Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors align and don’t muddle action. Minimal redundancy and no scaffold loops; syntax varies with scene needs. Technical jargon is accurate enough for plausibility and never clogs clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—cosmic troll subsonics, a university radio hack, glacier pops as counter-chaos—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The moon-triggered photocell and 37 Hz threshold give unique specificity beyond trope. The risk of lyrical sci-fi gimmickry is avoided by tight causal integration. The final reweighting (interference as care) feels earned and distinctive.</comment>
