<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, character-particular interiority drives each beat: she wants to “discover the texture of time” yet fears the cost of being unmade into the keystone. Embodied affects (sap pulse, chalk smell, lilies) keep emotion lived-in rather than labeled. The renunciation at the door is earned by prior impulses and actions with visible cost. Slight abstraction at times keeps her contradictions from cutting even deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Structure coheres under an accumulative/causal hybrid: halo hum → maze descent → keystone reveal → ring rip → corridor/door → renunciation. Orientation is swift and clean; the pattern of intensification is taught and paid off. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with clear price on the page. No teleports or rule breaks; causal lines are crisp for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is tactile and rule-bearing, constraining choices (hyperbolic hedges, hourglass hawthorn) and charging the final image. Sensory specificity is rich across senses and filtered through her vocation. The object-as-setting (halo, photographs) integrates with place to shape tactics. World logic is consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mastery vs. acceptance of time—tightens as photographs disintegrate and the maze folds back, then spikes at the door’s price. Each turn increases cost and narrows options (ripping the ring collapses geometry, forcing a threshold choice). The final renunciation forecloses a tempting path. Tension operates on image and decision scales without coincidence doing the work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: memory’s mutability vs. the urge to fix it; living time over observing it. The halo and photographs reweight at the end, recasting loss as generative. One explicit line (“not to be observed but to be lived”) brushes close to stating the thesis, but it’s grounded in action. The last image resonates without moral tidy-up.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm stay controlled under pressure. Imagistic registers (“periscope,” “helical well,” “serrated”) feel of a piece with her designer-mind. Distance and stance remain stable; no head-hopping or unearned certainties. Slight lushness risks over-saturation but rarely blurs sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs and propel momentum; metaphor chains remain coherent. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentence rhythm varies for breath and surge. A few stacked images flirt with purple but maintain clarity, especially at the climax. Final lines land cleanly with charged precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: living bridge botany, hyperbolic geometry, a moon’s halo shard, and celluloid time-rings feel startling yet inevitable together. Turns arise from established rules and desires rather than late conveniences. The keystone/door choice reframes the premise with conceptual integrity. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
