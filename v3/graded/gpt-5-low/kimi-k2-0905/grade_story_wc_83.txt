<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Grief-fueled agency is clear and contradictory: the narrator both harvests “unused potential” and condemns himself as “death’s accountant.” Concrete micro-choices—smashing breakers, aligning the telescope via a fall—derive from this wound. The renunciation at the end (choosing death to redirect a strike) is earned and costly. Embodied details (ribs, taste of cake-dust) keep emotion specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Coherent hybrid drive: causal beats (harvesting → breaker sabotage → geode depletion → final jump) are braided with accumulative images that reweight meaning. Closure lands decisively with on-page cost: the fall that re-aims the telescope by .003 degrees to avert a future strike. Orientation is clean from the outset; constraints (cooling breakers) shape timing. Setups (geode cost, perturbation logic) pay off in the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating observatory is vivid and functional—transparent floor, helium sacs, quantum telescope—and directly constrains choices. Circuit breakers, drift, and railing materially affect tactics and the ending image. The desert below and thin air charge the final fall. Specifics feel integrated rather than postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (ethics of harvesting vs saving lives) tighten as geode mass dwindles and time pressure increases. The breaker sabotage is a meaningful turn that forecloses safer paths and escalates moral cost. The final self-sacrifice is an earned, high-price resolution. Internal and external conflicts interlock without coincidence solving anything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around commodified grief and the ethics of potential; motifs (geode, observatory, cooling) evolve in meaning. “Death’s accountant” risks explicitness but is anchored in concrete action and later reweighted by the self-sacrifice. The last image reframes the premise as a conceptual repricing of “unused potential.” Ambiguity lingers without muddle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric first-person voice balances technical diction with sensory specificity. Rhythm varies and tightens appropriately under pressure. No head-hopping or stance slippage; elisions are taught and paid off. A hint of lushness flirts with purple, but line decisions remain legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do double work (cake-dust as grief/fuel). Some figurative richness is stacked, yet coheres and doesn’t obscure causality. Minimal scaffolding and no loops; syntax varies to match escalation. Final lines land crisply without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—perturbation theory as moral calculus, harvesting unrealized futures via a geode, and re-aiming war by self-erasure—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without sacrificing clarity. Specific details and ethical tension distinguish it from genre templates. The closing reconfigures prior images with authority.</comment>
