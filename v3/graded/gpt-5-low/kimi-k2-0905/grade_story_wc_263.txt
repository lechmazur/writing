<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Embodied motivation is clear and intensifies—from tracing meteors to dismantling the mount to self-sacrifice—with tactile micro-choices under pressure. The backstory shard (teachers, chalk cupboard) sharpens motive without derailing the scene. Internal contradiction (fear vs. compulsion to remember) is present, though the figure trends archetypal rather than individuated. The final renunciation reads earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clean: syllabic meteors → warning → dismantling → reconfiguration → dissolution. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early and the closure lands on-page with felt cost. The sequence holds coherent pressure without causality breaks, and the final image reweights the premise decisively. The “ghost meridian” payoff sustains consequence beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The tundra, aurora archway, and brass equatorial mount are specific, lived-in, and constrain choices (cold, weight, aurora height triggers timing). Environmental elements charge the closing image (emerald point above her heart; dark glass circle). Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered. The tool-as-setting integration is exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free creativity vs. soul-colorblindness) is signaled and deepens decisively at “Create—or—perish.” Agency drives escalation: she abandons the instrument and herself. The price is unmistakable (self-dissolution), though the cosmic stakes are stated a touch abstractly. Pressure coheres and tightens to a single meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of recovering suppressed creativity emerges through concrete acts (dismantling a tool of looking to become the lens). The final image conceptually reprices “rest” as sacrificial creation, with resonance in the travelers’ epilogue. One explicit line (“every artist… colorblind in the soul”) edges toward didactic, but the imagery does the heavy lifting. Subtext rides recurrence (archway, stars, calendar) rather than lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, distinctive lyric voice with stable close focalization; metaphoric density modulates with pressure. Diction fits the visionary stance and remains consistent. No head-hopping or stance drift, and elision is purposeful. Cadence sharpens at key beats without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise, with multi-function images that move story and theme. Minor copy slip (“She tilt the tube”) and occasional purple edging don’t blunt clarity. Rhythm varies and propulsion holds through the climax. Figurative logic stays coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The self-orrery, aurora as ink, and dissolution into a “ghost meridian” feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its conceit without hedging, transforming familiar “artist vs. suppression” terrain. Risks heighten stakes and coherence rather than obscure them. The closing mythos (travelers, dark glass) elegantly extends the design.</comment>
