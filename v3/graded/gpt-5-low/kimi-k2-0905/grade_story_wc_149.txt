<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motives: the bride seeks repayment without harming the innocent, and the boy shifts from terror to understanding. His offer of blood and her refusal reveal layered values under pressure. Interiority is distilled into concrete images (frost on lashes, bead in heart) rather than labels. Minor: the bride’s inner conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized in on-page hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: bead’s pulse → nightly visitations → confrontation → fruit-ritual → release. Closure lands decisively with visible cost (orchard withers, the bride disbands), and options reconfigure for the boy (seed to plant, dawn). Pattern is taught early and paid off in the final image. No orientation debt; the lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse/orchard is vividly realized and functionally integral: steam, runed fruit, and endless night become the mechanism of payment. Environmental rules remain consistent and culminate in the dome’s dissolution. Recurring objects (bead, fruit) charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ancestral debt vs. innocent heir) escalates via the bead’s accelerating pulse and the seventh-night confrontation. The boy’s offered blood vs. her guided alternative is a meaningful tightening that forecloses an easier path. Cost is explicit and lasting. Slight softening of direct antagonism, but pressure remains coherent and rising.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, debt-to-gift transmutation, and ethical repayment emerge organically through image and action. “Debt is a vine; it finds any sun” risks aphorism but is earned and reframed by the final seed/stranger gesture. The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Resonance lingers with conceptual repricing of obligation across lifetimes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric third-person voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent; metaphor and syntax modulate with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext and stakes. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays stable while flexing for intensity. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do multiple jobs (world, motive, and pressure). Figurative language is rich yet coherent, with few near-repeats. Rhythm varies to carry momentum into the climax and landing. Very slight risk of saturation, but clarity never suffers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard as debt-currency and the bead-as-heart-seed synthesize into a fresh, inevitable system. Risk-taking in image logic (steam, starlight, silver fruit) serves character and stakes rather than ornament. Turns arise from established rules and choices, not late gimmicks. Memorable and specific.</comment>
