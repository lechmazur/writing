<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rowan’s motive—repair as both craft and grief-work—is clear and drives each micro-choice, from testing gears to risking the mirror. Doubt and longing contend on the page (“his own heart ticked irregular”), giving his final step through the workshop door emotional charge. The cost is legible: he loses the way back and accepts custodianship. Slight neatness in the late realization tempers the edge but stays earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: prophecy → failed gears → mirror discrepancy → forged key → opened door → irreversible crossing. Closure lands on-page with cost (doorway vanishes) and a reconfigured role. Orientation is crisp by the first paragraph, and the lens holds to the end. No teleports or unkept set-ups; the mirror rule is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The frozen library and mirror-hall are vividly tactile and integral to action; the environment literally enables the repair tactic. Sensory detail is selective and charged (rime, auroras, bronze breathing), and the mirror’s physical logic stays consistent. Setting constraints shape the final image and choice. No tourist catalog; details are filtered through a locksmith’s priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking to learn repair’s rhythm—tightens when the gears fail and doubt rises, then deepens with the mirror’s “better drafts” discovery. Agency drives the turn (aligning and healing the broken key), and consequence follows (no return door). Pressure remains coherent and grows to the decision to walk into the workshop image. The cost is personal rather than perilous, but it is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Repair-as-forgiveness emerges organically from the craft actions and the mentor loss, culminating in the “forgive the gear that slipped” pivot. The mirror’s “stored better versions” reframes fate and craft in a potent metaphor. A slight explicitness in the line “to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped” edges toward thematic statement. Still, the closing image of overlapped ticks reweights prior images with earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically consistent, image-forward, and character-specific to a clockwork mind under cold beauty. Rhythm modulates with pressure—lush at entry, tightened around the key-making, then expansive at closure. No head-hopping or stance drift; free indirect control is steady. Diction choices (e.g., “escapements,” “umbra”) stay within plausible lexicon for this world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet purposeful, with images doing double duty for world and emotion (“bronze swell as though breathing”). Occasional stacked modifiers verge on purple but rarely blur sense; momentum holds. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. Final beats are precise and sonically controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—lunar-eclipse locksmith, mirrors as repositories of discarded better drafts, key healed by reflection—is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from invented logic rather than convenience. Emotional truth (grief transmuted through craft) grounds the novelty. Risk-taking in image and world coheres without gimmickry.</comment>
