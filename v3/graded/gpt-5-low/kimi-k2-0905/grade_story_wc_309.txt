<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—escaping quantified wonder to find the sacred—drives every choice and tightens under pressure. Contradictory impulses surface credibly: fear and failure vs. stepping onto the mist; pragmatism vs. sacrificial partial solution. Embodied emotion (“a negotiation between doubt and surface tension”) keeps him specific and flawed. The final renunciation (destroying his badge/route) is earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain with an accumulative texture: balcony to mist stair to algorithm clampdown to keystone bargain to badge-sacrifice, landing in an earned stasis. Closure arrives with a visible price—no route upward, loss of credentials—while reweighting the premise. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the lens holds through the end. The last image crystallizes the before/after without mechanical tying-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire, algorithmic sky, and mist stair are not scenery; they constrain tactics, escalate risk, and charge the ending. Sensory specifics (“smelled of lilacs and printer toner”) feel purposeful and character-filtered. World rules (licensed winter, drones, luminance quotas) stay consistent and learned through action. The environment directly shapes the ending’s options and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—autonomy vs. automation—tightens when the spire begins sealing air and again when Elian forgoes return by fusing the badge. Agency drives turns; coincidence complicates but never resolves. The felt cost is unmistakable (stranding, invisibility, lost status) and the partial-solution ethos reads earned. Slightly quieter middle beat between the algorithm clampdown and the badge decision keeps this just below top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and choices: sacredness in small folds versus quantification. The keystone’s visions and the paper boat reconfigure meaning without didacticism. A hint of overt statement appears in “continued automating wonder… quantity was the same as grace,” which edges toward telling. Still, the final repricing (“darkness felt exactly bright enough”) resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice marries arcane and contemporary lexicons (“lilacs and printer toner”) without register clash. Psychic distance is steady; focalization stays tight to Elian’s perceptions and limits. Rhythm modulates with pressure—nimble during peril, expansive at closure. No head-hopping or unearned certainty.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet purposeful; images do double duty and momentum rarely stalls. Metaphor is abundant but coherent and scene-true; minimal repetition or scaffold. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean. Slight saturation in figurative texture at peaks prevents a perfect score but does not blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of automation, magic, and bureaucratized wonder, with surprising particulars (barcoded snow, luminance quotas, badge-as-shackle reversed). Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, especially the partial-solution ethic and the badge-opal fusion. The closing image risks quietness and wins through conceptual repricing. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>
