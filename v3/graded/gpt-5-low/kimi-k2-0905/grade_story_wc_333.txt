<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and charged—freeing an idea from fear—and contradictions (conviction vs. hesitation over surrendering her name) surface at the gate and mirror. Bodily, particular interiority (“tremor of improbable longing,” ribbon as DNA) avoids therapy-speak. The decisive change—breaking the mirror and ingesting the ink—reads as earned and costly. Minor note: the competence is near-flawless; a touch more slippage under pressure could deepen texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/causal hybrid, each move links: Vega’s hint → gate confession → corridor → mirror → shatter → reconfigured constellation/name loss. Closure lands clearly with felt cost (anonymity, scar, “each step erasing a year”). Orientation is crisp from line one; the pattern is taught and paid off. No dangling setups; the price persists into the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nexus, seven gates, ivy-ear keyhole, and star-guided corridor are tactile and purposeful; environment governs tactics (no key, a confession via hair/ribbon). Recurring objects (ribbon, mirror) charge the final image (scar as tuning string, Vega refigured). Sensory choices match urgency and remain POV-colored. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake announced early and tightens meaningfully at the mirror: freeing the idea requires a trade-off (shattering self-image/name). Pressure builds coherently; the “erase a year per step” deepens cost en route to the decisive act. Resolution arises from her agency, not coincidence, with consequences that endure. Stakes remain intimate yet visceral, avoiding inflation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme—voice vs. fear, naming vs. freedom—emerges organically through locks, DNA, mirror, and ink without moralizing; the single spoken line reconfigures meaning rather than explaining it. The final constellations/Keybearer image offers conceptual repricing with a legible cost (anonymity, tuned scar). Recurrences (ribbon, longing, Vega) evolve in significance. Ambiguity is purposeful, not muddy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (warmth cue, breathless shard at shatter). No head-hopping; certainty matches what she can sense. Patterned elision (lyric leaps) is taught early and remains legible through closure. The voice feels singular and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density lines mostly do multiple jobs; images cohere (keys/ink/stars) and propel rather than cloy. Minimal redundancy; micro-cadence varies well. A few lush metaphors flirt with overload but stay internally consistent and clear at the climax and ending. Proofing and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The locksmith-as-liberator of unsaid ideas, star-coded hints, and the mirror-to-ink metamorphosis synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling arc. Risks in tone and imagery heighten stakes without obscurity. The ribbon-to-scar and Vega-to-Keybearer turns feel uniquely this story’s. Emotional truth undergirds the invention.</comment>
