<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marisol’s interiority is specific and consistent—her “clerical error” waivers and the prayerful study of the locket reveal a principled anonymity that drives each choice. The relationship with Beto evolves under pressure without surnames, sharpening her values. The final relinquishing of the locket is a credible, costly act derived from her ethos. Minor note: her flaw set (self-effacement vs. desire to celebrate) could have pressed her harder.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: band-shell to library to wharf, with the envelope as causal spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she trades her mother’s photo (real cost) to keep the cycle moving and logs the night as “value immeasurable.” Orientation is clean and the final cadence reweights the opening motifs. No causality gaps; coincidence (Beto’s history) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The breezy library, star-ceiling, and gull-wing card drawers shape tone and enable the pivotal meeting; the Wharf of the Lanterns and the clipped beacon charge the ending image. Details are selective and POV-filtered (broker’s manifests, harbor rezones). The environment meaningfully charges the final image and the motif of navigation. Minor: the library could more explicitly constrain a choice, but its atmospheric function is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Quiet stakes tighten effectively: discover envelope → choose night delivery → legalize receipt → surrender locket. The visible price is the locket’s loss and the commitment to anonymity. Pressure is situational rather than adversarial, yet coherent and deepening. A sharper on-page obstacle might have amplified cost, but the ethical calculus reads.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cycle-of-compassion theme emerges through concrete acts (waivers, misaddressed donation, receipt drafting, locket handoff) and charged images (lantern as baton). The ending offers a non-literal answer—compassion as freight that must change carriers—without sermonizing. Brief aphoristic lines are earned by prior scene work. Resonance lingers beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical third-person closely tracks Marisol’s sensibility while allowing Beto’s gentle, off-key warmth. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sensory images feel character-specific and maritime-aware. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual. Modulation under pressure is steady without flattening into uniform music.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines perform multiple jobs; metaphors (“card catalog drawers like gull wings,” “conductor’s baton”) are apt and coherent. No noticeable loops or scaffold; syntax varies with good propulsion. A couple of thesis-adjacent phrases risk overstatement but remain supported by image. Copy is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The blend of harbor logistics, nocturnal library, and an old pier with an NGO link is fresh; the mistaken-address envelope as social conduit is deft. The locket handoff as moral freight is a non-obvious, inevitable-feeling turn. Risks in tone and lyric density pay off without obscuring closure. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
