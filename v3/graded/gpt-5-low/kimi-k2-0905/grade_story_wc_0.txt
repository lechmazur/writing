<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motives (silence, calibration, grief) drive concrete choices—she ignores the storm, works by headlamp, and reframes her stance at the end. Interiority is specific and embodied (“humidity… like a guilty conscience”; cobalt fire on the wing). The final renunciation—no longer outrunning storms—feels earned by on-page causality. Minor risk of thesis-forward articulation slightly tempers the rawness of the interior conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: data-gathering, storm pressure, power loss, and the 03:17 convergence build to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, why), and props/actions track cleanly. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis—choosing to face storms minute by minute—with a felt cost in risk and relinquishment. No major causality gaps; the single-scene arc tightens once meaningfully.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is tactile and consequential: shattered panes, humidity, failing lights, and incoming rain all shape tactics and mood. Tools and micro-setting (slide, forceps, portable synchrotron) constrain behavior, charge images, and anchor the final cadence. Weather pressure is not decorative; it modulates decision-making. The closing image of ongoing collapse reweights the story’s premise.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stakes—calibrate an algorithm and renegotiate her relationship to catastrophe—are clear and interwoven. Escalation is subtle but real: storm threat, light failure, time compression, and the convergence ping force her to commit under pressure. The visible price is endurance and risk (staying through storm, relinquishing the urge to flee), scaled appropriately for the length. A slightly gentle external jeopardy keeps it short of peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: butterfly scales mirror neutron star decay; growth/decay as dance partners accrues subtext. The final choice reframes the “drama vs. change” argument with an earned calm. Occasional explicit thesis lines (“drama is optional; change is not”) risk overstatement, diluting subtext’s power. Still, the closing image delivers a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined close third voice integrates scientific lexicon with lyric precision without breaking plausibility. Rhythm modulates with pressure (storm, blackout, convergence) while staying coherent. Minimal filter clutter; stance remains consistent and character-true. Slightly essayistic lines peek through but don’t fracture the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is vivid and efficient; images carry multiple jobs (atmosphere, theme, character). Figurative density is controlled, with few redundancies and no mixed metaphors that blur sense. The prose accelerates at key beats without slog. A couple of explicit abstractions soften the edge but do not stall momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a portable synchrotron reading butterfly scale dust to map neutron star decay inside a storm-ruined greenhouse. The local/cosmic braid feels inevitable in hindsight and not gimmicky. The final reweighting avoids genre cliché and deepens the premise. Bold choices heighten meaning while staying legible.</comment>
