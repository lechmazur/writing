<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A singular, embodied POV with concrete tactile obsessions makes her feel particular and lived-in. Her choices (stepping into the loom, opening the locker, swallowing the cube, redirecting her vocation) arise from a coherent craft-ethic and grief. The contradiction between maker-as-mapper and maker-as-instrument of harm lands with felt cost. A touch more on-the-page hesitation or risk in swallowing the cube could have deepened the micro-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens holds: accumulative lyric pattern teaches early, while causal beats (shard→loom→locker→note→realization→vow) progress cleanly. Closure is on-page as a decisive reframing and renunciation with cost. No orientation debt; transitions between bays are legible and purposeful. The data cube’s ingestion resolves swiftly; one beat of resistance or consequence would have sharpened stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is richly tactile and POV-filtered; the bay’s variants pressure choices (zero-g locker, skylight dawn) and charge the final image. The shard and bay operate as micro-setting constraints guiding action. World rules are taught via action; no dump. Occasional lyric excess skirts density but remains clear.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering withheld truth—tightens through the shard’s compulsion and the locker reveal toward the moral cost of complicity. The meaningful turn is the recognition that her maps funded the cover-up, leading to a renunciatory decision. Pressure is coherent, though external jeopardy remains low; the cost is primarily conceptual/emotional. A small on-page risk or loss at the locker/cube beat could elevate the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s mass and the ethics of mapping accrues through recurring motifs (weave, redirect, weight) and reweights at the end. The note risks aphorism, but it’s integrated by the cube ingestion and the final vow. Subtext around weaponization of perception and complicity is strong without sermonizing. Resonance lingers in the charged decision to chart consequences.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a precise sensory lexicon and patterned diction (“redirect,” “cyclically spontaneous”) that pays off. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping, clean modulation under pressure. Rhythm varies with action and quiet beats; images feel character-bound. No register drift despite high lyric density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with mostly efficient sentences; images do double duty for world and theme. A few stacked metaphors approach purple but stay coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy; cadence supports momentum. Minor tightening around repeated “cyclically spontaneous” could sharpen without losing motif.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The “sensory map maker” premise, shard-as-tuning-fork, and loom of parallel bays synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling arc. The locker and self-penned note twist avoids cliché by folding complicity inward. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The redefinition of mapping as moral cartography feels original and earned.</comment>
