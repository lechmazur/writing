<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—to restore shared balance through Tempris—is clear, embodied, and culminates in a costly, character-driven sacrifice. Interiority is specific (his broken bell, the tug in his chest) and his choices escalate credibly from listening to offering his heartbeat. The main limitation is a relative paucity of contradictory impulses; he rarely wavers or resists, which slightly smooths the emotional contour. Still, the final renunciation reads earned and particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned walking, keystone strike, and the imbalance in the north ward culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration with real cost (he becomes the tenth bell). Orientation is clean from the opening (“Beneath the ancient archway of Viremont,” predawn). Each beat coheres causally under the lyric logic, and the price is on the page (the fork shatters; Elian fades). The final image reweights the premise without handwaving.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: archway, cobblestones, keystone, and bell towers are not postcard details but tools that shape tactics and closure. The environment literally constrains method (heel-toe on basalt pavers; striking the keystone) and charges the final image. Sensory selection is distinctive and aligned to a tuner’s perception, with non-audio “pressure behind the eyes” textures. World rules (Tempris) are learned through action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reviving the town—tightens through an elegant escalation: gathering rhythm, awakening memory, then hitting the snag of the north ward’s anchored sorrow. That obstacle forces a higher-stakes choice: give his own heartbeat and shatter the tool, paying a visible price. Agency drives each turn; no coincidence resolves the core problem. The ending’s cost charges the stasis (Elian as the tenth bell) with ongoing pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of communal memory, restoration through rhythm, and self-offering emerge from particulars (footsteps, keystone, heartbeat). Subtext knits the civic and the personal—healing a place requires giving the matching wound within the self. Slight deduction for a closing line that edges toward aphoristic (“proving that what is rebuilt through rhythm remains”), which skims close to stated moral. The resonant images otherwise carry the meaning without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic auditory absence, “moonlight tastes”—is controlled and consistent. Distance stays stable; no head-hopping; elisions are purposeful. Rhythm modulates with pressure (measured heel-toe cadence to the keystone strike to the quiet final poise). Diction is precise and character-apt for a tuner-mystic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut despite high figurative density; images tend to cohere with the bell/memory motif and carry information. No paraphrase loops or mechanical cadence runs; sentences vary and propel. A few stacked metaphors flirt with lushness, but clarity and pressure remain intact, including at the close. Proofreading and syntax are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—healing a town by tuning its “bones” via footsteps and memory—is striking and executed with integrity. The turn where Elian offers his own heartbeat and becomes the tenth bell feels inevitable yet non-obvious. Specific inventions (Tempris, keystone chorus mouth, bellflower-clappers) elevate beyond trope. Risk-taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
