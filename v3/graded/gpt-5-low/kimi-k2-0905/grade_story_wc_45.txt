<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—repairing a shattering in her certainty—is specific, embodied, and consistent, escalating from guilt to a costly acceptance. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. yearning to re-enchant) operate simultaneously and guide micro-choices (following the briar path, inserting the tooth, choosing silence with villagers). Her final stance forecloses a path (corrective certainty) in favor of an earned practice (preparing splints), with felt cost. The changeling functions as a relational crucible without stealing her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: images and choices build to a conceptual repricing where mistakes become navigational lights. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and set-ups (tooth, hedge maze, bone-setting) pay off causally at the sundial and constellation map. Closure lands on-page when she sets the tooth and refuses to correct the villagers, crystallizing cost and new praxis. No causality gaps or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden and maze are tactile, sensorial, and instrumental: they reveal a new path, freeze time at her verdict, and physically guide the decisive act. Recurring objects (tooth, bones, sundial) function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. World rules are consistent and learned by use rather than exposition. Atmosphere deepens theme without heavy-handed symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to metabolize a grievous error—tightens meaningfully at the briar’s unveiling and the sundial’s frozen hour, forcing a stance. The act of placing the tooth and choosing communal silence shows agency and cost, though pressure remains primarily internal and lyric. Moral calculus (“If the lie had saved...”) sharpens the turn without tidy absolution. Escalation is subtle but legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete acts and images (splints → constellations; fractures as guidance), culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer. A few aphoristic lines (“every mistake is a seed”) flirt with didacticism but remain character-sourced and fable-appropriate. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing and leaves plausible counter-readings. Emotional aftereffect is earned, not asserted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s craft and skepticism. Psychic distance and diction remain steady; brief dialogue carries subtext and advances stakes. Rhythm modulates well between lush description and decisive action. Minor aphoristic notes prevent a clean 9+ but do not disrupt control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs; imagery is vivid yet coherent and rarely strains. No paraphrase loops or scaffold; syntax varies and supports momentum toward the closure image. Occasional stacked metaphors remain consistent with the world’s logic and don’t blur sense. Punctuation and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Changelings, bone-setting, and constellations are synthesized into a fresh moral calculus that feels inevitable in hindsight. The sundial-vertebra and tooth-as-star are striking, specific, and thematically integral. Risk-taking in premise and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
