<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Her drive to reach the birthplace of echoes is cleanly tied to grief and the mother-daughter pendant, and her choice to surrender future minutes reads as an earned, painful trade. Interiority is specific (cadence, breath, ledger of borrowed time) rather than generic. A faint softness remains around the exact magnitude of the “future minutes” loss, but the cost registers.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (rooftop canals, pendant, giant’s nap), and the causal chain holds: cadence → reverse flow → upstream pursuit → aviary → price → doorway → retrieval → reset. Closure lands on the page with cost (“carrying her unspent future” away, pendant sealed), producing a decisive before/after. The accumulative pattern is taught early and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system, iron aviary, and giant-beneath-city are vivid, sensorial, and rule-consistent, discovered through purposeful action. Environment and tool constrain choices (walking “upstream,” timing with the nap, the aviary’s location) and charge the final image. Details stay character-filtered and avoid tourist listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (reach the birthplace of echoes to retrieve the unfinished syllable), with a meaningful tightening at the aviary when the price is named. Agency drives escalation—she chooses the left spiral, works the cadence, and pays with future time—and consequence is legible. The ethical calculus is compact but sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around grief, time, and the art of completion, rendered through cadence and echo rather than moralizing. The pendant’s Möbius shift and the final syllable entering her chest reweight earlier images with emotional clarity. The last lines redirect her vocation from elegy to threshold without didactic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—breath counts, ledger metaphors, craft-inflected noticing—without slippage. Rhythm modulates with pressure (counted breaths vs. soaring images) while staying legible. No head-hopping or register drift; elisions are purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density prose remains controlled, with images that do multiple jobs (wisteria eyelids, clock-hand aviary) and minimal scaffolding. No paraphrase loops or figurative muddle at peak beats; syntax variety sustains momentum. A few lush lines flirt with excess but don’t obscure causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—rooftop canals, giant’s nap, time-sculpting cadence, aviary of echoes—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight through the pendant’s mechanics and grief calculus. The “interrupted cadence” concept is both engine and theme, not ornament. Risks in worldbuilding and lyric register heighten stakes without confusion.</comment>
