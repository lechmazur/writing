<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyra’s motive—to articulate unspoken needs before they’re erased—is clear and consistent, and the echo confrontation externalizes her internal contradiction. Her trembling smear and ultimate choice to open the bolt plate show micro-choices under pressure with a credible cost (renouncing containment). Depth is strong though not deeply variegated beyond the encode-vs-release axis. Still, the renunciation feels earned and character-specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and tightened through painting → echo → activation → communal release. Closure lands on-page as a conceptual repricing: from encoding as preservation to encoding as communal release, with the cost of emptying her plate. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/clock), and thunder’s arrival functions as a paid-off live timer. No causality breaks; each beat flows from the prior choice or rule.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, balustrades, cloud-ladders, and lightning/thunder environment are vivid and functional, not decorative. The setting constrains time and action (the interval between lightning and thunder; marble that “drinks” sound; balustrades as harpstrings) and charges the final image. The flower press as tool-object integrates with space and weather (ozone, copper resonance). Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (speak needs before thunder erases them), and pressure coheres as the echo accuses, forcing a re-evaluation. The decisive tightening is Lyra choosing to open and empty the bolt plate, foreclosing her prior preservation tactic. Consequences are felt (loss of hoarded petals and self-encoding), though the danger remains mostly conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the escalation aligns with the chosen lens and reads earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of communication vs containment and belonging through shared code accrues through concrete acts (graffiti glyphs, moths, the final glyph of mouth-to-ear). The echo’s accusation and the communal surge embody subtext about self-erasure and witness. One sentence edges toward tell (“Lyra understood then...”), slightly softening the implicitness. The final images reweight prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is assured, sensuous, and consistent, with disciplined rhythmic modulation that supports pressure. Dialogue is minimal but charged, carrying subtext and advancing turns. Diction and imagery feel native to this world’s lexicon and Lyra’s sensorium. No stray head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with layered images doing multiple jobs; most lines advance action, mood, and theme concurrently. Lyric figuration is frequent but pattern-taught and controlled; only minor risk of saturation in a few stacked metaphors. Syntax and paragraphing vary to maintain momentum. The ending images are clear, not muddled by purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis: encoding needs as graffiti in a storm-clocked aerie; “ghost in code” animating as bioluminescent moths; flower press plate as copper shield/palette. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the piece’s rules, not gimmicked. Bold but coherent risks elevate stakes and resonance. The final glyph is memorable and thematically necessary.</comment>
