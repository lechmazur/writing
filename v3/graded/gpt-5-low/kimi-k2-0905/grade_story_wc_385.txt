<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s drive—to understand echoes and avoid becoming one—grounds every choice, and the descent/singing decisions are cleanly motivated. Interiority is concrete and character-specific (“taste the iron in a stranger’s blood memory”). The relationship crucible with the moth-silk weaver (mother) tightens the emotional stakes. One slightly declarative insight (“Understanding struck like cold water: unfinished departures loop”) trims mystery but doesn’t undercut earned change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Structure is lucid: shell-guided descent → gallery encounter → revelation → decisive farewell song → felt reconfiguration at the rim. Causality reads as accumulative with purposeful beats; the closure lands on page with cost (letting go of the mother’s echo and Lira’s identity shift). Orientation is early and steady, pattern taught and paid off. The fused shell as closing object locks the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon, corkscrew cavern, and moth gallery are vividly selective and pressure choices (singing to breathe, descent route, echo mechanics). The seashell functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail spans taste, scent, sound, and texture with POV bias. The final absorption of sound by cliffs ties environment to theme and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates: the canyon’s interrogative echo forces a deeper confrontation, culminating in the farewell act that forecloses looping. Agency drives the turn (pressing shell to cocoon, choosing the cadence). Emotional cost is legible in relinquishing the haunting for travel. Tension coheres without contrived reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—endings vs. echoes, finishing departures—emerges through specific images (moths weaving residue, cliffs absorbing voice) and the enacted farewell. Subtext in the canyon’s “question” reframes the motif without over-explaining. A few lines flirt with aphorism (“endings are portable”), slightly polishing the insight. Overall, resonance lingers via the door-not-haunting image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature tied to sound and tactility. Dialogue is spare and loaded, advancing stakes (“I echoed because I never finished leaving”). Distance stays steady; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure from descent to closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, action). Figurative language is coherent to the sound/echo lexicon; no mixed metaphors muddy the peak. Line rhythm breathes where needed and tightens under pressure; no loops or template cadences. The final lines land cleanly without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Moths weaving echoes, a shell that teaches coordinates in dreams, and the “progressive disclosure of goodbye” synthesize into a fresh mythos. The turn from haunting to chosen travel feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in lyric density and invented cosmology pay off with clarity and consequence. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>
