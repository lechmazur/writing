<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, character-particular motive (companionship masked as pedagogy) deepens into a credible acceptance of custodianship. Interiority is specific and embodied through tactile rituals (sugar, seal, steam) and the narrator’s architectural listening. The renunciation—accepting the burden of “keeper of agreed upon lies”—forecloses easier solitude with a felt cost. Minor note: the internal contradiction is vivid but rarely contested on-page beyond acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: meteor signatures → seal pressed → revelation → transfer → charged poise closure. Closure lands cleanly with cost: the tutor’s dissipating, the building’s “welcome,” and the narrator’s new role. Orientation is crisp (rooftop, Tuesday ritual, meteor shower) and causal links are legible without over-explaining. The decisive reconfiguration is on the page, not summarized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower are not postcards; they constrain meaning (garden as weight, meteors in hexameter) and tools (gargoyle edge, seal contact) that charge the final image. Object-as-setting (desk seal, thermos labeled “sugar”) functions as micro-setting that shapes choices. Environmental rules are consistent and learned through action. Sensory economy is sharp, with smell (jasmine), texture (wrought iron), and sound (stone grinding) doing work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens in one meaningful deepening: the tutor’s true nature and transfer of duty raise the cost and foreclose casual companionship. The interrogation of the gargoyle functions as the catalytic test; the building’s confession reframes the stake. Stakes remain interior but consequential, with endurance and role-assumption as agency. A touch more on-page friction before the handoff could intensify felt risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme—memory vs. renovation, needed fictions, and custodial truth—emerges organically via motifs that reweight at the end (“stay” moving from lie to charged poise). Subtext is active in rituals (borrowing sugar, thermos label) and the building’s “accent of foundation.” The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: agreeing to the lie as vocational duty. Slight repetition of “agreed upon lie” toes the line but feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A singular, controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature (architecture as grammar, meteors as hexameter) sustains across turns. Psychic distance is steady; lyric compression is taught and paid off. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue-lite execution still conveys subtext and pursuit through action and image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and purposeful; most sentences carry two jobs (image + meaning) with clean propulsion. A lush figurative density risks purple in spots but stays coherent to voice and moment. No loops or scaffolding dull closure; key beats are dramatized, not summarized. Minor over-insistence on a few motifs is the only drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: linguistics of architecture, meteors as Latin meter, and the ceremonial economy of “borrowing sugar” feel non-derivative and necessary. Turns are earned in hindsight (the tutor’s summoning logic reframes earlier companionship). Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable yet surprising.</comment>
