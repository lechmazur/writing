<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Scraps’ motivation—retired from finding bodies yet compelled to collapse distance—is specific and consistent, driving key choices (identifying the riddle’s answer, leading the search). Interiority arrives through scent-translations and embodied action rather than labels. The Kite–Scraps relationship acts as a crucible in the archive scene. Slight limitation: we don’t see much contradictory impulse beyond the initial tug back to old work.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: cylinder → riddle → leaf pressed to cylinder → coordinates → journey → rescue. Orientation is clear early (Half-mast, scrapyard, post-war dusk), and the closure lands on-page with a conceptual before/after. The cost is more resonant than grueling; the rescue comes relatively easily once the method is discovered. Still, the lens holds and the cadence tightens credibly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The scrapyard, cracked wasteland, and archive are vivid, multi-sensory, and filtered through Scraps’ nose. Objects-as-setting (leaf, cylinder, player) constrain choices and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. The orchard smoke at the end reweights the world’s rules with earned specificity. Spatial choreography remains legible from perch to hut to subway car.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the brother/translate distance into closeness) is signaled and sharpened by the riddle’s terms. The decisive tightening is Scraps’ intuitive move—pressing the wax leaf to the spinning cylinder—foreclosing passivity. External cost is light; obstacles on the trek resolve without a significant setback. Nonetheless, agency drives the turn and the ending image carries emotional price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres: distance vs. closeness, memory vs. ruin, translation as love and survival. Recurring images (leaf, grooves, wild hush) accrue meaning and shift at the end without moralizing. The final line reframes home as naming/knowing, a resonant non-literal answer to the central question. Purposeful ambiguity lingers in a satisfying way.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person maintains a distinct perceptual signature rooted in scent and sound; diction is controlled and consistent. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and charged with subtext (“it speaks only in riddle”). Rhythmic modulation supports pressure without confusing focalization. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined, with images doing multiple jobs (moonlight through wax as memory, map, and method). Occasional density flirts with purple but remains coherent and propulsive. No scaffold loops or template cadences, and the closure image is crisp. Minor metaphor stacking could be trimmed for breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a scent-reading bloodhound decoding “secret texts” in grooves, a wax-preserved leaf as both oracle and tool, and a post-war hush as tonal engine. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once the sensory logic is taught. Risks (lyric density, conceptual method) heighten rather than obscure stakes. The piece reads as singular rather than templated.</comment>
