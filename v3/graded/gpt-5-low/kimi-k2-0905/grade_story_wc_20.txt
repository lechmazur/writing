<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Aurelia’s motive—redeeming names, especially Caelum’s—drives concrete, escalating choices (staying behind, attempting the kintsugi, accepting calibration over cure). Interiority is specific and embodied (tears adding a twentieth ounce; steam, rust, and gold as tactile correlates). The conflict between following the party and returning to the foundry is credible and resolved with cost. A slight tilt toward aphoristic closure (“names are not chains…”) risks neatness but remains earned by prior action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design is taught through “limits” that structure cause-and-effect toward a felt reconfiguration. The closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing: redemption becomes calibration, and she re-enters the world with a new price paid. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the foundry and coin through-line binds beats. Cost is on-page in the acceptance of loss and the coin’s anchoring as measurement rather than amulet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry, anvil, scales, rust, and alembic are sensorially vivid and functional; the place supplies tools and constraints that shape tactics. Weather and heat alter action (steam hissing, cooling gold), and the setting charges the final image (“coinless yet resonant,” gold-lit cracks). Details stay POV-filtered and purposeful without turning into a catalog. World rules feel coherent within the factually mystical register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are focused on whether grief can be transformed into a durable practice; pressure tightens via the named “limits,” the risky weld, and the coin’s reanimation. The decisive move is to calibrate rather than undo loss, foreclosing the fantasy of reversal. Internal and external conflict interweave—alchemy as grief-work—and the price reads in what she carries forward and what she leaves. Slightly soft on external opposition but strong for this lyric form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of rupture, value, and the weight of names emerge through enacted images (scales, gold seam, balancing Libra/Scorpio) rather than lecture. The final repricing of “redemption as calibration” reweights all prior motifs with resonance. A couple of thesis-like lines edge toward explicit statement, but they’re integrated into character voice and earned by the scene’s labor. Subtext hums in the foundry’s history and the communal names she speaks.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and steady, with controlled rhythms and a precise lexicon that matches the alchemist’s sensibility. Psychic distance and stance remain stable; no head-hopping or register drift. Patterned diction (“limits,” “factually mystical”) is taught early and pays off. Compression never muddies focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, layered images doing multiple jobs, and varied sentence rhythm. Figurative density clusters around a coherent field (weight, metal, balance), avoiding muddle or mixed metaphors. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding intrude; momentum holds through lyric beats. A few aphoristic closures risk gloss, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemy, kintsugi, and the measurable weight of names feels fresh and inevitable by the end. The “factually mystical” frame and limit-exploration method are distinctive and integrated. The final re-entry into the world with calibrated regret avoids tropey resurrection arcs. Risks in form and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
