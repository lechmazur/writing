<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rich, specific interiority (“feral nostalgia,” jealousy of past selves) anchors credible contradiction and choice. Her job ethic versus surrender to erasure culminates in a felt-cost act: letting the scroll vanish. Micro-choices (feeding the stove, writing soot lines, placing the scroll in snow) align with motive and pressure. The character’s renunciation reads earned without tidy resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: the grave, the scroll’s commands, and footprints compress into a charged final act (erasure and acceptance). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: choosing continuation by erasure and leaving the stone as an unread monument. Orientation is clear early (cabin, mountain night), and the intentional mid-sentence finish coheres with the thesis. Cost is legible on the page in the sacrificed words and foreclosed certainty.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and instrumental: stove heat, soot as ink, wind/page, moonlit snow enabling physical erasure. The cabin and mountain repeatedly constrain options and charge the closing image (stone, snow-scar). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“cedar smoke,” “blue glass” snow). World rules are consistent and learned through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to respond to time’s wheel after seeing her own grave—tightens through the scroll’s imperatives and the footprints. The meaningful turn is her decision to lay the scroll in snow, sacrificing narrative control. Pressure remains coherent; no deus ex machina, only her agency under a mounting pattern. The price (acceptance of erasure over preservation) is clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of narrative versus entropy emerges through concrete acts (writing in soot, sparks as spent words, erasing the scroll). The final choice reweights meaning: erasure as continuation, mapping the wheel instead of escaping it. Lines like “The mountain… only wants its minerals back” risk directness but are earned by the on-page struggle. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric-close third holds steady; diction and rhythm embody “jaded wonder” without register slips. Compression and patterned images are taught and paid off; no head-hopping. The quoted self-address is character-true and escalatory, not exposition. Voice modulates with pressure toward a clean, charged cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is taut, image-dense, and varied in rhythm; most sentences do multiple jobs. A few metaphor stacks verge on lushness but remain coherent and purposeful. No notable loops or scaffolding; action order is clear. The intentional incomplete last line deepens cadence rather than obscuring closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Singular synthesis: ranger-cabin archivist of leaked dreams, birch bark contract with erosion, and time as wheel feel fresh and integrated. Risks (lyric density, meta-narrative stakes, mid-sentence ending) heighten stakes and coherence. Turns grow from established images (scroll commands, footprints, snow erasure) rather than late rule-changes. Emotional truth lands with specificity, not template cleverness.</comment>
