<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Her motive—preserving “the weight of small moments” before demolition—drives concrete, costly choices, culminating in surrendering the locket. Interiority is embodied (ink, tide, planks, the boy’s absence) and contradictory impulses (public duty vs. private attachment) converge credibly. The maternal echo with the drowned boy deepens stakes without sentimentality. Minor slip: the decisive act feels slightly idealized rather than messily fraught in the instant.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear and held: mounting time pressure (engines, security, dawn work) leads to a resonant reconfiguration when she “plants” the record and sacrifices the locket. Closure lands on page with cost (empty cuff, reconfigured home scene). Orientation is crisp from the first line. The copper tube covenant image unifies causality and concept.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The jetty at twilight, salt, pilings, engines, and gulls are specific and tactile, shaping options (speed, secrecy) and charging the ending. Objects-as-setting (ink, locket, copper tube) constrain choices and carry into closure. The atmosphere is purposeful, not postcard. World rules remain consistent and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: preserve memory before erasure. Pressure coheres and tightens (clock, security) toward a meaningful trade-off—she forecloses keeping the locket. The internal and external strands braid effectively. Slightly soft on immediate jeopardy, but the ethical price is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory as covenant and artifacts-as-verbs are embodied through action, not just asserted, and the final duet reweights prior images. The whispering of the boy’s name and the “planted” archive avoid tidy moralizing. A couple of overt thematic lines (“artifacts become verbs”) nudge toward statement rather than pure emergence. Overall resonance lingers with earned ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with stable close third, strong perceptual signature (workmanlike reverence, tactile noticing). Dialogue is sparse but sharp, carrying subtext (“planting them”). Minor diction glitch (“she steep the locket”) registers but doesn’t break control. Rhythm modulates well under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density; images often do double duty. A few purple-leaning phrases and one grammatical slip (“she steep the locket”) slightly scuff the surface. Repeated motif usage is purposeful, not looped filler. Cadence supports momentum from jetty to home.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist premise, covenant reframing, and the copper-tube planting feel singular and inevitable. The final transference of the locket is a fresh, earned turn. Risk-taking in diction and structure heightens coherence rather than showiness. Emotional truth grounds the novelty.</comment>
