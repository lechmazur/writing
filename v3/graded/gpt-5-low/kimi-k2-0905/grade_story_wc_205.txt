<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Aurelia’s motive is vivid and specific—steal the shard to reimagine a failed revolution—and her choices (the mirror tactic, the final smash) align cleanly. Interiority is textured by embodied detail (“air grew warmer, as though sorrow itself were being tucked into bed”). Internal contradiction is present but understated; she moves from regret to serene resolve with minimal on-page friction. Still, the sacrifice lands as earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: shard found → storm threat → devised mirror-covering → confrontation → decisive smashing with transformation. Closure is on-page with cost: Aurelia dissolves; a new crystal-civilization hums. The accumulative lyric cadence supports a coherent throughline without ambiguity in rules. No orientation debt; single-scene pressure tightens logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and mirrored palace are sensorially rich and tactically determinative: mirrors amplify the storm and must be covered. Recurring objects (shard, drapes, mirrors) shape choices and charge the final image. World rules about “visible time” are learned in action, not dumped. Scale and specificity feel organic to the voice and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wrest meaning and future from collapse—tightens via the oncoming “visible storm” and the rival archaeologist’s intrusion. The mirror-covering is a strategic adaptation under pressure, and smashing the shard is a clear, costly turn. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly without contrivance. Prices paid (self-erasure, foregone artifact) reweight the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of revolution, memory, and the ethics of reflection accrue through action and image rather than sermon. The “mirrorless” idea reframes both politics and time without tidy moralizing, and the verses-as-seed literalize how art founds a polity. Counter-reading (sacrilege vs creation) is held in the archaeologist’s altered stance. The final reconfiguration resonates beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive lyric third-person holds steady, with rhythmic control and precise diction supporting pressure. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and subtextual (the order to “drop the artifact” doubles as judgment). Brief modulation to the archaeologist’s perception stays outside his interior while remaining coherent. Voice feels singular, not committee-smooth.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The prose is lush but disciplined; metaphors remain coherent to the invented physics of visible time and glass. Momentum rarely flags; sentences do multiple jobs without scaffold or loops. A few high-color phrases flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion hold at climax. The final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>SF-concept and lyric-political fable synthesize into an original, inevitable-feeling closure. The mirror tactic, poem-seeded crystal, and “visible time” storm feel fresh and character-true. Risks in diction and conceit heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and pays it off.</comment>
