<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-POV interiority is vivid and embodied: the janitor’s duty (“keep the silence from rusting”) strains against his compulsion to kneel, listen, and speak to meteors. His choices escalate from observation to communion to renunciation (leaving lantern and station), with a tangible price. The vision-question (“being small enough to burn… brave enough to change”) credibly reframes his grief. Minor note: conflict remains largely internal, but it’s textured and specific enough to carry.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of attention → lantern anomaly → Perseid fleck → cosmic vision → reconfigured stance. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he relinquishes the tool and job, leaves the dome open, and accepts a new costed equilibrium. Orientation is clean from the first line; causal beats are legible. The epilogue with new scientists reinforces the before/after without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The dome, telescope, mirrors, and lantern are tactile and charged, with dust as “miniature galaxies” filtering POV. Environment constrains action (arranging mirrors, open dome) and charges the final image (yellow afterimages on glass, shard on the road). Sensory selection feels trained by his role and grief. No white-room gaps or postcard gloss.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can attention and care reconfigure grief into a usable stance—tightens through a clear deepening: lantern reflections → responsive glow → embedded fleck and vision → relinquishment. The Perseid storm and the rock’s question heighten pressure and cost. Resolution stems from his deliberate renunciation and reorientation of the instruments, not coincidence. The pressure is quiet but unmistakably builds under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: vulnerability as atmosphere rather than armor is earned through concrete encounters with meteors and the station’s stillness. Recurring objects reweight meaning at the end (glass becomes invitation; afterimages as a heart). The piece invites layered readings (ecology of attention, stewardship, grief) without sermonizing. One explicit thematic line risks overstatement but is supported by image and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and POV-consistent; diction (“keep the silence from rusting,” “primal elegance of shared orbit”) matches the character’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially across the vision beat and the quiet renunciation. No head-hopping, and elisions are purposeful and legible. The prose feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images do double duty for mood and plot. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and anchored to action and objects; minimal purple drift. Syntax varies; momentum never stalls. Final images are crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “cosmic janitor” premise, lantern that hoards star-memories, and the reframing of bravery via burning feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, quiet stakes) pay off with a distinctive synthesis. Turns arise from established pattern and character attention. The piece avoids generic space mysticism through specific, idiosyncratic choices.</comment>
