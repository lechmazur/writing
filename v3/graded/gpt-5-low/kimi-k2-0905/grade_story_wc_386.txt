<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marrow’s motive (salvage something pure; protect fragile ghosts) is clear and consistent, and her choices (staying, analyzing, descending, lifting the globe) align. Interiority is concrete but largely lyric; contradictions (truth-weaving vs. the living’s demands) are implied rather than dramatized in a pressure exchange. The emotional cost surfaces at the end (carrying the weight; leaving the mirror), though internal conflict could be sharpened on the page. Strong, but not yet blisteringly specific under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: dream → shrine analysis → glacier crack corridor → recovery → surface reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the “pure” thing is recoded as transmissible knowledge, with the cost of bearing it and relinquishing the mirror. Causal-seeming beats are coherent with clear before/after options (windows sealing; wreck collapsing). The constraint of time/ice and the hymn’s release charge the final choice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier and shrine are tactile, sensorially distinct, and constrain action (cold candles, ice adhesion, crack opening a singular path). Recurring objects (snow globes) and “borrowed starlight” charge the final image. Environmental rules stay consistent and evolve with events (glacier sealing, corridor, silt-collapse). Atmosphere is integral rather than postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (salvage before digestion) is signaled early; pressure tightens when the shrine splits and windows begin to close. Agency is present (she persists, follows the corridor, lifts the globe, leaves the mirror), and the cost is felt. Escalation is more numinous than visceral, which slightly softens urgency. Still, the glacier’s timetable and sealing windows provide a credible squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The theme of connection-through-wreckage accrues via windows, cameos, and the reweighted globe; the final image reframes rescue as translation and stewardship. Subtext (truth as careful weaving; cost of carrying others) is embodied rather than told. No sermonizing; the hymn and mirrored faces do the lifting. A hair more friction in her truth ethic would deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Close third with a distinct, cold-luminous texture; diction is controlled and consistent with Marrow’s perceptual bias. Patterned lyricism is taught early and maintained; no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm flexes with pressure (quiet accumulation to charged retrieval and release). A whisper more abrasion under peak stress could push this higher.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are tight, image-dense, and multifunctional; repetition serves motif rather than padding. Figurative language is rich without incoherence; no mixed-metaphor tangles at the peak. A few consecutive image-lifts risk purple but remain legible and purposeful. Momentum is sustained; no scaffold loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Wreck-diver ghost whisperer + glacier shrine + cameo dream-analytics is a fresh synthesis executed with integrity. The “pure thing” reveal smartly subverts the expected relic into transmissible knowing, earning inevitability in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. Memorable images feel singular rather than templated.</comment>
