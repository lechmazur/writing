<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mireya’s motivation is clear and consistent, and her choices (decoding, building, relinquishing the moonstone) drive the piece. Interiority is mostly implied through sensorium upgrades; true internal contradiction is light, keeping emotional pressure gentle. The transformation reads earned but low-conflict; competence dominates. The communal assist adds warmth rather than pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: rising leaves → rune map → monument-building → release of the last moonstone fragment → mirrored arbor and restored equilibrium. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she gives up the final fragment of the lens and accepts an unpaid office. Setups pay off (grandmother’s lore, moonstone’s promise, hush as dialogue with prophecy). Stakes cohere and the because/therefore chain is intact within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor and silver-barked micro-ecology are vivid and purposefully integrated—floating leaves, catwalks, and runes shape action. The moonstone and leaf serve as object-as-setting, constraining tactics and charging the final image (the mirrored arbor). Sensory specificity (peat, pollen spirals, root whispers) tracks with Mireya’s role. World rules are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes escalate through density rather than confrontation: decipher → communal monument craft → surrender of the moonstone fragment. The decisive act (releasing the fragment) carries cost and resolves the pressure on the grove. Tension remains gentle, but the pattern tightenings read as meaningful under the accumulative lens. No antagonist is needed; the grove’s “dialogue” supplies coherent pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, reciprocity, and communal care emerge organically via images and acts (tiny monuments, mirrored arbor). Subtext works well in the hush-as-dialogue conceit. However, the explicit folkloric moral “Remember with kindness...” edges into stated thesis, slightly flattening the afterglow. The final cadence still resonates through image rather than argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“pollen spirals,” “root whispers”) remains steady and credible to Mireya’s vocation. Rhythm varies appropriately; diction is lush without opacity. No head-hopping or stance wobble; elision is purposeful. The voice modulates toward softer radiance at the climax without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high information density, clean syntax, and purposeful image work. A few phrases verge on ornamental repetition (“emerge transformed always”), but momentum holds and clarity remains strong. Figurative language is coherent and supports world logic. The closing image is cleanly rendered without scaffolding or paraphrase loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The concept—seed sorting in a skyborne arbor with upward-falling leaves, rune-maps, and memory monuments—feels fresh and internally committed. The moonstone dust’s final dispersion reframes prior beats with inevitability. Risks (lyric accumulation, non-antagonistic pressure) pay off without sacrificing coherence. Emotional truth is specific, not generic, especially in the tactile communal crafting.</comment>
