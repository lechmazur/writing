<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lark’s motive—turning entropy into “blooming resistance”—is specific and enacted, and his molt provides embodied vulnerability that sharpens choices. Interiority is textured without therapy-speak; the bones/skins metaphor maps cleanly to his contradictions. Marin’s status shift from CO to co-builder adds credible pressure and reciprocity. Minor softness: Rourke’s quick concession trims the felt cost of their risk a touch.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal crest: their rebuild and bluff directly avert immediate shutdown, landing a resonant reconfiguration with cost (burning selves, risking discovery). Orientation is clear early—who, where, when—and the catwalk/flashlight beat tightens plausibly. The grant outcome is asserted, but the closure’s charged poise (card inscription, sealed tin) reads as earned. No material causality breaks despite a slightly convenient guard reversal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The rusted library is tactile and operative: broken roof moonlight, potbellied stove, warped shelves, catwalk, and sirens all shape choices. Objects-as-setting (coffee tin, intake forms, dictionaries) charge the final image and tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered, not touristic. Environment constrains and enables in ways that matter to the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the library against carceral erasure—tightens when footsteps and flashlights erase the option to flee. The choice to stand, present order, and weaponize bureaucratic optics is a credible narrowing with a visible risk. Internal and external conflicts braid (self-molt instability under guard scrutiny). Slightly low friction in Rourke’s rapid buy-in keeps this shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through action and image: composting old selves into light; building a spiral nest; paper cranes as clandestine breath-instructions. “Beauty from anarchy” risks literal statement but is mostly earned via concrete tasks and subtext (audit optics as leverage). The final card—“Co-conspirator of light”—reprices identity and resistance without moralizing. Counter-readings (institutional co-option vs genuine change) linger productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close is steady and character-specific in diction and noticing. Dialogue is succinct, goal-driven, and layered with subtext (audit talk as code for survival). Rhythm modulates under pressure without head-hopping, and figurative textures feel native to Lark’s mind. The prose maintains confidence without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme) with few redundancies; cadence varies well. Figurative language is rich yet coherent to the scene’s physical logic (green flames, luminous fracture). Minor risk of purple is managed by momentum and specificity. Mechanics and sequencing are clean through the climax and closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Molting personas in a prison-library salvage, with a false-bottom tin and audit-savvy bluff, feels distinctly imagined and thematically integrated. The rebuild-as-spiral choice and paper-crane tactic are inventive without gimmickry. Turns arise from established premises, not late rule changes. The piece takes bold tonal and conceptual risks that heighten stakes while remaining legible.</comment>
