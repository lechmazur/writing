<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s grief-driven motive (atonement for the missed call) is concrete and consistent, and her polymer-thinking perceptual lens personalizes interiority. Micro-choices—following the smallest braid, pocketing the chrysalis, later leaving the sculptures—reveal a credible hierarchy of values. The contradiction of maker’s control versus relinquishment lands at the end with visible cost (pockets empty). Slightly more on-page friction during the lab phase could deepen struggle under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ravine observation → insight → build → installation → relinquishment. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she forecloses possession and lets the river keep touching people, with cost legible on the page. Orientation is crisp from the start, and the time jumps are clean and purposeful. The linkage from insight to resin design to public encounter reads coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The braided ravine’s physics and islands shape tactics (placement on three islands as a chord), and the chrysalis functions as a charged recurring object. Sensory detail is specific and POV-filtered (foam grammars, shale, 440 Hz), enriching mood without cataloging. The world logic (micro-actuator, heat-trigger) integrates plausibly at this length. Final images are inseparable from place, satisfying the 9+ constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure accrues through increasing commitment: observation to invention to public installation to renunciation. The cost—giving away the artifacts and not staying to harvest the payoff—reads as an earned stasis. Escalation is more textural than adversarial; there’s no antagonist, but the internal atonement stakes tighten credibly. A single additional pinch of resistance (technical or ethical) could raise the felt squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The braid/polymers/music triad coheres into a nuanced meditation on connection versus loss without stating a moral. Recurring images (chrysalis, braids, concert pitch) shift meaning by the end, reframing absence as transmissible resonance. The final act of relinquishment offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Sentiment is checked by specificity—no sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is controlled, image-driven, and consistently filtered through a chemist’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates with pressure (calm observation, then purposeful synthesis, then charged release). Technical diction appears sparingly and in character. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multi-function density; figurative language is vivid yet coherent to the braid/resin/music web. Minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies with good propulsion. A few highly ornamental phrases flirt with purple but remain controlled and legible. Final images are crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original fusion of polymer architecture, river braiding, and haptic audio memorials feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risky, lyrical execution pays off in a concrete public-art closure. The chrysalis-as-mold turn is fresh and thematically integral. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat into abstraction.</comment>
