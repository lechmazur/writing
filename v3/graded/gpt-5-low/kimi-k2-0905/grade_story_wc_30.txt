<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character-particular motive (“preserve wonder in routine”) animates concrete choices: opening the brass rib-cage, deploying the lunar net, smelting identities, and planting the creel. Interiority is specific and embodied (boots hiss, gears tick), with credible contradiction (guardian and transformer). The felt cost—accepting mutability and leaving a hollow “shaped exactly like tomorrow”—lands. Slight remove in lyric distance keeps us just short of peak intimacy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: lunar tide and sliding catalog create a live pressure that tightens toward planting the creel. Closure reads as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she anchors now, promises later release—cost felt in the hollow and in binding the archive to seabed. Orientation is clean from the outset; set-ups (net fluctuating, catalog drift) pay off in tactics and ending image. A hair more on-page jeopardy could lift to 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the tidal atrium and moon-phase tech constrain choices (timed net mesh; water lapping the steps), and the environment charges the final image. Objects-as-setting (creel, net, brass body) shape tactics and closure. Sensory specificity is purposeful across sight, sound, and touch without tourist catalog sprawl. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent storms of forgetting by consolidating identities) is signaled early and tightened by the moon’s descent. The decisive tactical deepening—smelting into a ribbon and planting the creel—forecloses alternatives now in exchange for later release. The price is conceptual and felt rather than peril-driven, but it’s legible and coherent with the lens. A sharper external hazard beat would intensify pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of wonder preserved through ritualized acceptance of contradiction accrues through specific acts, not lecture. Recurring images (net, ribbon, creel, wintersun) reweight at the end into a stance: guard the unfinished so motion can resume. The line “memory kept by water is story” edges declarative but harmonizes with enacted stakes. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a coherent perceptual signature; diction and rhythm match the metal-organic focalizer. Elision is taught and consistent; no head-hopping. The litany functions as voice and tactic. Minor uniformity of high-register tone in peak beats keeps it just shy of transcendent modulation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: varied syntax, strong verbs, and images that carry multiple jobs. Figurative density is high but coherent within a single motif field (tide, brass, moon), avoiding muddle. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding undermine momentum. A few flourishes verge on ornate, but clarity and propulsion persist.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—a tide-driven archive where identities are smelted by a gearwork librarian into a mutable ribbon—is fresh and internally necessary. Risks in concept and diction pay off with coherent implications and a memorable final reconfiguration. Emotional truth (custody vs freedom of story) grounds the novelty. Slightly gentler stakes temper outright audacity.</comment>
