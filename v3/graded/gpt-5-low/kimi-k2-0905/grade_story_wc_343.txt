<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (to chart where language meets landscape) is concrete and drives her choices from cargo-deck curiosity to the engine-room reading. Her embodied loneliness (“invited everywhere and nowhere”) adds human pressure without melodrama. Internal contradiction is modest but present—risking exposure of her mother’s scrap to a skeptical crew. The ending credibly shifts her social position and agency without over-tidy absolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Hybrid leaning causal—lights dim, need a tale, Lira decodes patterns and reads, the ship reignites, community reconfigures. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ship and crew cohere, a new charted route appears, and options change (“Now let’s give her a destination”). Cost is subtler than ideal—her vulnerability and the risk of failure are felt but not deeply taxed. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The airship’s mechanics and spaces (cargo grates, engine galley, sweating copper pipes) constrain tactics and supply the solution vector (story-fueled light-feed). Recurring objects (running-lamps, hopscotch board, starlings) charge the final image and inform Lira’s choices. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered; world rules (light-feed on stories) are taught through action, not exposition. The setting is integral without museum-tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—prevent Aurelia from becoming a ghost and escape social marginality—is signaled early and tightens as lamps fail. The crucial turn is Lira choosing to read the translations aligned to hopscotch spirals; the starlings’ helix confirms escalation. The price is primarily emotional and reputational; while effective, it could cut deeper. Resolution arises from her agency, not luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Language as navigation and story as fuel thread cleanly through concrete events, culminating in “Murmuration Passage.” Subtext—belonging versus isolation—modulates from “sociable isolation” to a shared horizon without moralizing. A few lines flirt with overt thesis (“Ship needs a tale bright enough to burn”) but remain diegetic. The afterimage of hope is earned by prior particulars rather than declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely tracks Lira’s perception with consistent diction and rhythmic control; no head-hopping. Dialogue is spare, distinct, and functional, carrying subtext (“got one?” as a dare and invitation). Psychic distance tightens under stress without register drift. The prose modulates heat and breath effectively through the engine-room climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are vivid and efficient, with images doing double duty (chalk marks as syllables; starlings as currents). Occasional flourish density skirts purple but stays legible and purposeful; no mixed metaphors that blur sense. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax maintain momentum. The final cadence returns motifs without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Airship powered by stories, a phrasebook of dead dialects translating light, and hopscotch as a cartographic cipher feel fresh and organically interlocked. The starlings’ double-helix as embodied resonance is a deft, non-obvious turn. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads singular, not templated.</comment>
