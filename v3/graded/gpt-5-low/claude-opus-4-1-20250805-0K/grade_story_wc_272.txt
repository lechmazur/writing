<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Marina’s motivation (recovering an artistic self under a reality that won’t hold still) is clear and intensified by concrete pressures. Her interiority is specific—charcoal from the dead beacon, glass falling upward, “three faces”—and her contradictory impulses (grief for the old way vs. necessary descent) play simultaneously. The redesign choice is earned by prior beats with a felt cost (“cracked and luminous with grief”). Minor reliance on rhetorical questions doesn’t undercut the embodied arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: walls “closing,” cards shifting, sketching as untangling, culminating in the beam’s blaze. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration: she reframes fragmentation as wholeness, with the cost of relinquishing her former seeing. Orientation is solid (who/where/when) by the first paragraph, and the final question-image combo lands on the page. No causal slips or unearned reveals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse library and its objects (tarot, dead beacon, salt, shattered window) are vivid and purposeful, constraining tactics and charging the ending. She uses the setting materially (charcoal from the beacon, sketching on cards) and thematically (a forgotten library inside a lighthouse becomes an engine of re-seeing). The final beam reweights every prior detail. Sensory specificity is high without tourist-catalog sprawl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she reclaim artistry within a fragmented reality—tightens as the environment presses and the cards’ logic reshapes options. The meaningful turn is her choice to redesign by untangling, which forecloses clinging to “what was there.” Cost is legible (social loss, grief, acceptance of darkness). Pressure is more internal than adversarial, but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (truth through fragmentation; darkness as another kind of light) emerges organically from action and image rather than thesis. The tarot/Lighthouse motifs accrue and reprice in the final image, avoiding sermonizing despite rhetorical questions. The epiphany is earned via on-page struggle and tactile choices. Slight explicitness in the last question remains lyrical, not didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature with controlled rhythm and image logic; POV is stable and modest in knowledge. Rhetorical questions serve voice and pressure rather than hedging. Diction and cadence modulate as stakes tighten, culminating in the charged final image. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined, with images doing multiple jobs (“glass fell upward,” “cards showing all possible states”). Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops; momentum holds through dense figurative work. A few stacked metaphors approach purple but remain coherent and purposeful. The final beats are clear and clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>While “artist reconceives seeing” is familiar, the tarot-in-lighthouse frame, upward-falling glass, and method-as-untangling yield fresh synthesis. Turns feel inevitable from seeded particulars, not grafted. The risk of high-lyric density pays off in a precise closure image. Conceptual integrity holds without gimmickry.</comment>
