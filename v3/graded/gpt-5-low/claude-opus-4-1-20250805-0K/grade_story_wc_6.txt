<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is particular and embodied—her firefighter competence refracted through inherited fire—yielding credible contradictory impulses (kinship with flame vs. refusal to feed it). The on‑page ritual is a micro‑choice sequence that reveals values in action. The earned shift from grief to recognition feels motivated by prior beats. A slight tidiness in self‑articulation (“scars can sing”) trims the ceiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: the ritual gathers objects and memories toward a Charged Poise closure (the talisman tied, “ready”). Orientation is clear early, and each step causally builds to the reconfiguration. Cost is emotional and conceptual—foreclosing being defined by the father’s blaze—visible in the tear‑offering and chosen burden. Quiet but fully legible cadence shift at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic sand are not postcard décor; they supply material (black sand) and charge the final image. Environmental textures (wind shifts, ripples, kelp) are filtered through a firefighter’s sensorium and shape the ritual’s pace. The closing reflection released to sky returns setting as active agent. Specific, lived details avoid generic coastal tropes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reframing legacy—tightens via the ritual’s assembly and the father‑shadow cloud image. The deepening (warehouse rescue memory) reweights the present act and raises the internal price. The resolution is an endurance/renunciation with felt cost rather than a reversal, appropriate to this length and lens. Slight softness in on‑page pressure keeps it just below the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: “take what burned you and bind it to what cooled you” becomes literal craft and moral calculus. Recurring images (sand, coin, thread, clouds) reprice meaning at closure without over‑explaining. A couple of near‑thesis lines flirt with moralizing but the images carry the weight. The final tone offers a resonant non‑literal answer: transformation, not negation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature (reading wind like fire). Diction is lyrical but controlled, modulating gently into the charged final cadence. No head‑hopping or withholding; elisions are purposeful. Elevated phrases fit the character’s reflective mode and setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences vary rhythmically, with high information density and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is mostly clean and coherent to the motif set (fire/water/sand/metal). A few coined abstractions (“unyielding compassion,” “scars can sing”) edge toward purple but do not obscure action or closure. Momentum holds through the reflective passages.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The arsonist’s‑daughter‑firefighter frame is familiar but individualized through the specific ritual mechanics and volcanic micro‑setting. The grafting concept and object triad (thread/coin/sand) feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth is particular rather than templated. Risk is taken in the quiet, ritualized structure and it pays off.</comment>
