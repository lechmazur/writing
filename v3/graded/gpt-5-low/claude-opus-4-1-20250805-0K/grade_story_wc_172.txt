<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s motives are clear and textured: she engineers ruin to enact covert preservation, with embodied contradictions (“proof that even monsters could mourn”). The secrecy, black‑market purchase, and calculated cruelty toward the land and displaced people reveal a coherent, troubling ethos. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy‑speak, though on‑page struggle is ritualized more than contested. The final renunciation (entombment vs revival) lands as an earned endurance with visible moral cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through thunder’s approach, the egg’s planned cracking, and the sealing under engineered heat. Closure is a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights destruction as preservation with undeniable cost (diverted rains, displaced people, buried futures). Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single‑scene structure is clean. Minor reliance on summary (shell companies, Smithsonian theft) supports rather than replaces the present action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt flat is not backdrop but instrument: its mineral and acoustic properties dictate the tactic (burial) and charge the ending (“eternal echo”). The dried river‑crack map and acoustic fossil beds fuse worldbuilding and choice. Weather and satellites act as extensions of setting that determine options. Specificity stays in service to mood and action without tourist cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: to enshrine an extinct line’s “song” at the cost of orchestrated drought and displacement. Escalation is subtle but present under the accumulative lens: approaching thunder, the egg’s deliberate fracture, and the heat‑fusion seal narrow options and fix the cost. The conflict remains primarily ethical rather than adversarial; it still tightens credibly. A slightly stronger on‑page test or resistance could raise charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The paradox of salvation through ruin is woven through concrete acts (starved rivers as maps; burial for resonance), yielding a resonant, unsentimental aftertaste. Recurring images (thunder, cracks, salt) shift meaning by the end. A couple of near‑thesis lines (“monsters could mourn,” “archive of absences”) edge toward overt statement, slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Still, the final image accomplishes a robust conceptual repricing without a tidy moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third‑person close tracks a controlled, precise mind; diction blends scientific and corporate registers that suit Vera. Rhythm varies with pressure, and image selection reflects her priorities (algorithms, acoustic resonance, satellite redirection). No head‑hopping or stance slippage occurs. A few expository clauses are brisk and voice‑coherent rather than helpful‑narrator.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are clean, propulsive, and information‑dense; metaphors (“archive of absences,” “acoustic fossil beds”) feel integral rather than ornamental. Repetition (thunder diverted) is purposeful, not looped. Minor tell phrases are efficient and do not blur the closure image. Overall polish is high without purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—manufactured drought revealing migration routes, acoustic fossils, and a billionaire archivist of absence—is striking and feels inevitable by the end. Risks (moral inversion, lyric‑technical blend) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise avoids template beats and follows its implications with cold logic. The closing charged poise image is memorable and singular.</comment>
