<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kova’s motive is clear and sustained, and her calm discipline under stress (voicing silence while her “heart hammered”) yields strong, embodied interiority. Contradictory impulses surface via the ice‑bell fear she ignores, showing credible micro‑choices. The transformation—echo fusing with her voice—reads earned, though the on‑page cost is subtle rather than biting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: pattern‑break window → silence‑casting → echo’s testing → dance → reweighting at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a legible constraint (timed liminal bloom) and a price in discipline/identity shift. Orientation is clean by ~120 words; no causality slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden, sleepwalking constellations, and rail spike are specific, tactile, and rules‑consistent; Kova navigates “spaces between feelings,” constrained by the environment. The tool (rail spike) and setting actively shape tactics and charge the final image (cooling spike, winter flowers). Sensory selection fits her vocation and pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is tight and escalates coherently: rarity/clock pressure → echo’s circling tests → bite → yielding by choice. The cost reads in endurance and risk (ignoring warning bells, sustaining silence while the spike burns), though the loss isn’t sharply dramatized beyond strain. The tightening is real and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: pattern breaks enable capture; some songs persist by changing mediums. The final message reweights the premise without moralizing, and the charged reprise (humming a “feral lullaby” that blooms winter flowers) resonates. Slight explicitness in “some songs never die” trims mystery but not impact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV with consistent diction and selective noticing tied to craft and pressure. Rhythmic control under peak beats (dance, phosphorescent rain) remains legible; no head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (voicing silence) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent imagery; metaphors (flowers from resonance, emotions into material) stay rule‑true. Line rhythm varies and propels; minimal scaffold or loops. A few lush phrases flirt with excess but maintain clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis—fishing for whispers in a sound‑garden under sleepwalking constellations—feels inevitable once established. Recurring objects and methods (rail spike, voicing silence) drive both tactic and meaning. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
