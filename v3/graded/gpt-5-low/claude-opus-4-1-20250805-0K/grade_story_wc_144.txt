<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya’s competence and worldview are vividly embodied through tactile perception and decisive craft choices. Her blindness reframed as advantage reads specific rather than generic inspiration, though internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely wavers. The relationship with Chen offers light pressure and mirroring but doesn’t force a choice or reveal deeper fault lines. The final endurance—returning to the bench—feels earned, if low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: damaged drone → diagnostic via mist/water → delicate patch under a live clock → launch and release. The clock (“twenty minutes”) tightens options, and the fix leads directly to the ship’s departure. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: she releases the drone and returns to her craft, reframing blindness and purpose. Cost is modest (time pressure and precision risk), keeping the peak from a higher band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot is not decor—it supplies the sensory medium and tools (prismatic tubes, droplets) that enable tactics and shape the final image. Environmental specificity is high and POV-filtered through sound and vibration. The setting constrains method and charges the ending as drone hum merges with the ship’s horn. Rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is present early and coherent: fix the beacon before departure. Escalation comes via the countdown and the precision-demanding patch, with a clear tightening when the membrane requires exact pressure. However, jeopardy feels controlled; few reversals or visible costs test her limits. Resolution is earned but not hard-won enough for a higher score.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of reconfigured perception and the beauty of repaired systems emerges through action and image (droplet acoustics, ultrasonic pulses). The line “Beauty isn’t just visual” edges toward explicit moralizing but is supported by scene work. The final stance—helping others find their way while she reclaims hers—resonates without grandiosity. Complexity is modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on sound, vibration, and tactility. Dialogue is functional, natural, and subtextually frames competence vs. skepticism. Occasional omniscient touches (“Chen watched in amazement”) don’t disrupt control. Rhythm and diction fit the piece’s calm under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clean, purposeful sentences with strong sensory economy; technical detail serves character. A few heightened phrases verge on purple but remain grounded in action. Minimal scaffolding and no disruptive loops; momentum persists through the repair sequence. Final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mist-as-sensory-interface and water-acoustic diagnostics feel fresh and integrated, not gimmicky. Hummingbird drone and prismatic tubes synthesize world and theme with specificity. The arc is familiar (expert under time pressure) but the sensorial twist and quiet closure give it distinctiveness. Risks are controlled and coherent.</comment>
