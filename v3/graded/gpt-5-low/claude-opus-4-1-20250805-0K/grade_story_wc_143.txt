<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Vera’s motivation—document the last wisp before evacuation—is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (descending, setting the chemical timer, placing the hourglass). Interiority is specific and embodied in tools and environment rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (duty and melancholy at retreat) are present but remain subtle rather than sharply contested. The Earned Stasis of leaving with photographs and leaving the hourglass lands credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, orientation is immediate (1979, Luna Station Seven, Tycho) and the pressure tightens via the six‑hour burn, the 14‑hour terminator, and the last supply rocket. Closure arrives on the page with a felt cost: she documents the final sublimation, places the hourglass, and departs. The causal chain is modest but coherent—preparation leads to capture leads to renunciation. The final image reconfigures the premise into a charged farewell without mechanical over‑tie.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lunar environment is vividly rendered and functionally constrains action (vacuum, cold, terminator, persistent footprints). Tools and objects (Hasselblad, chemical compound, hourglass) operate as micro‑settings that charge the final image. Details are selective and POV‑true, avoiding touristic lists. The setting’s hush and earthlight modulate tone and tactics through the vigil.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing the last emergence before the ice exhausts—is signaled early, with countdown forces (chemical timer, supply rocket) shaping tactics. The meaningful tightening occurs as the vapor finally appears and passes, foreclosing the possibility of future documentation. Cost is conceptual and emotional rather than physical, but it’s legible in the renunciation of the outpost. The conflict is quiet yet coherent for this scope.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of retreat, endurance, and the valuation of curiosity accrue through recurring images (hourglass, earthlight, footprints) and culminate in a resonant parting gesture. A few lines edge into explicit moralizing (“accountants couldn’t quantify,” “when humanity remembered its courage”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the final placement of the hourglass reframes the premise without stating a moral. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Vera’s technical and reflective sensibility; diction feels specific to her expertise and solitude. Psychic distance modulates cleanly, with image‑driven passages tightening under pressure. No dialogue appears, and the narrative stance remains stable and plausible. The final cadence matches the established rhythm without ornament overload.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, action) with high information density and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked; rhythm varies to suit hush versus action. No loops or template cadences blunt momentum. The closing image is crisp and unblurred by mixed metaphors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—1979 lunar wind‑down, a crater inspector’s vigil, a centuries‑old hourglass with a primordial grain, and a regolith‑chemistry timer—is fresh and integrated. The hourglass recontextualizes exploration time with tactile elegance. The piece risks a quiet, concept‑forward closure and sustains it without gimmickry. Emotional truth emerges through specific actions rather than familiar space‑opera beats.</comment>
