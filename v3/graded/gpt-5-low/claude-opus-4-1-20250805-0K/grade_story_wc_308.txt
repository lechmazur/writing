<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Yula’s motivation—mastery through stillness—feels specific and earned, with the cost of centuries embodied in dust and endurance. Her micro-choices (pressing the arrowhead to her sternum, syncing breath/heart to the pulse) align with her traits and escalate commitment. The internal contradiction (youthful movement vs. aged stillness) is dramatized rather than summarized. A slight remove remains—no acute moment of doubt undercuts her poise—which keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density increases (vultures → synchronization → swallows → voice return), culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where her own voice closes the circuit. Closure lands with visible cost—300 years of stillness—and a charged poise: “I am still here.” Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when established). The final beat reweights all prior material without mechanical tying-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon of echoes and bone towers do active story work: they store time as acoustics, constrain tactics (stillness as navigation medium), and make the final return of her voice plausible and inevitable. The arrowhead functions as micro‑setting; carvings map onto birds’ patterns to shape choices. Sensory specificity is high yet purposeful. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and tightens through pattern intensification: the wandering pulse draws in, vultures spiral, synchronization narrows options to a single poised act. The reversal—discovering the pulse is her own voice—reconfigures stakes from seeking origin to accepting endurance. Cost is felt in the relinquished path of movement. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of stillness as the deepest navigation emerges organically via echoes, birds, and the arrowhead’s lineage; no moralizing. The final “I am still here” conceptually reprices time and mastery with understated ache. Recurring images accrue meaning rather than decorate. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting reflection without blur.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature—acoustic thinking, avian pattern‑reading—without head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening toward the closure. Diction is controlled and character‑bound. Minimal dialogue lands with subtext and cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet disciplined; images (“libraries of sound,” “marrow and memory”) are vivid and mostly non‑redundant. Occasional lushness skirts purple but doesn’t blur causality or closure. Sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum. No notable scaffold or loops dull the ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Bone towers preserving death songs, navigation through stillness via avian patterns, and a self‑returned voice fuse into a singular vision. Risks in concept and diction pay off with coherence and felt stakes. The synthesis feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. No reliance on template beats or borrowed imagery.</comment>
