<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific—her dual craft (beautician/mortician) coheres with the goal to preserve the “last spark.” Interiority is present but mostly in service of atmosphere rather than conflicted choice, so ambivalence remains thematic more than felt. Micro‑choices (measured breath, hiding movement within aurora) reveal values under pressure. The final stance (choosing liminality) reads earned but lightly priced emotionally on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds as the Silence rises; cadence tightens into the chip’s song and the charged poise ending. Causality is clean—harvested chip → infusion → alignment of patterns → protective bubble—as the grotto freezes. Closure lands via Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: they accept an “eternal almostness,” with visible cost (loss of the grotto, foreclosed return to ordinary life). Orientation is crisp from the opening; no lens ambiguity at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: aurora’s motion conceals her actions; the skyborne grotto and frozen entrance constrain options and charge the final image. Details are selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. Environmental rules remain consistent and learned through action. The aurora and chip recur to shape tactics and the end’s image, meeting the 9‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve a final spark against the encroaching Silence) is clear and escalates when the Silence reaches the grotto. The tightening beat (chip’s song forming a bubble as the entrance freezes) narrows options with a legible price—choosing suspension over motion or death. Agency drives the outcome through technique under pressure. Internal conflict remains more conceptual than dramatized, modestly limiting intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of preserving the liminal “radiant hush” between beauty and death emerges from concrete action, not sermonizing. The profession fusion reweights the final image without tidy moralizing; the last line resonates. One explicit articulation (“why she had been chosen”) edges toward thesis but stays anchored in scene. The closure reframes life/death as charged poise with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mira’s measured consciousness under threat. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (chip’s song, the Silence’s advance) without head‑hopping. Brief dialogue aligns with tone and advances the beat. No register drift or POV leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, clean syntax, and purposeful imagery. A few lush phrases flirt with purple but remain coherent and scene‑driven. No looped scaffolding or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—mortuary cosmetology applied to a dying star amid a physics‑like Silence—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tactics (finding patterns in static; hiding movement within aurora) concretize novelty beyond surface shimmer. The ending’s “eternal almostness” is a non‑obvious, resonant choice. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
