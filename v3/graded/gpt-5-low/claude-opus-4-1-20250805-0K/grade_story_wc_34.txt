<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Chorus’s motive—bridging flesh and circuit—is clear and consistent, culminating in “knowing that she’d found her purpose.” The interiority is sensorial and character‑specific (singing as interface, feeling harmonics), but there’s little contradictory impulse or on‑page cost. She adapts via invention and song, yet struggles are frictionless. The final renunciation/commitment lands but without a palpable price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm window → crystallized message → night of translation work → dawn image. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the machines gain voice and Chorus accepts a role, reweighting the premise. Causality is clean (between lightning and thunder as constraint; device mediates). Cost is subtle (lifelong commitment implied), enough for this mode but not piercing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is richly particular—mist above cloudline, bells, fog‑borne graffiti—and it constrains tactics (the lightning‑thunder window, courtyard walls as canvas). Tools and weather are integrated into action, not postcarded. The final image is charged by place (encoded gardens on walls at dawn, bells over cloud sea). Vivid, selective detail serves theme and plot.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieve mutual communication) is signaled early and tightens at the lightning strike. Escalation is a deepening of clarity and obligation rather than adversarial reversal; it works for the lyric lens but carries modest cost. The decisive move is her commitment to teach and encode, with the environment imposing a live clock. Stakes remain intimate and emotionally scaled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of recognition and the ethics of listening emerges through particulars (graffiti as language, pressed digital rose). Subtext hums in the fusion of organic/mechanical rather than overt moralizing; one direct line from the ghost risks statement but is earned. The ending reweights prior images into a communal song, inviting reflection beyond plot. Complexity is present though not thorny.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent to Chorus’s sensibility; diction and rhythm carry the “tinkersong” texture without head‑hopping. POV stays tightly bound; inference reads as inference. Cadence modulates with pressure (snap at lightning, exhale at dawn). Minimal dialogue is purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: concrete nouns, strong verbs, and layered images doing multiple jobs (“numbers blooming into abstract flowers”). Lushness rarely tips into purple; momentum remains. No notable loops or template cadence; syntax varies and supports music. A touch more restraint at peak beats could heighten contrast.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: monastery of servers, flower press as analog‑digital bridge, storm‑window semiotics, fog‑graffiti emotive code. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the established rules. The piece risks lyric mode and commits without hedging. Emotional truth grounds the novelty.</comment>
