<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mei’s motivation—becoming the conductor of unheard symphonies before exhaustion—stays specific and embodied through tactile choices (arranging fortunes in a spiral, raising her arms). Contradictory impulses register (deadline vs. fatigue; dismissal vs. compulsion). Interiority is character‑particular, filtered through music/time perception rather than generic labels. The cost is subtle but present: isolation, job loss, and surrender to a non‑linear identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts via dawn, the live clock, and orchestration of fortunes into music. Closure lands as a charged poise: “chronologically home at last,” with the conducting crest collapsing the before/after of time. Cost is felt in the acceptance of a life outside linear norms and the impending collapse into sleep. Orientation is clean early (Mei, glass spire, frozen lake, dawn), supporting the lyric structure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, and nautilus segment are vivid and purposeful, not postcard. Environment charges the final image (spire resonances; horizon folding) and subtly shapes what’s possible at the crescendo. The nautilus functions as micro‑setting/tool, constraining her method and sensibility. Sensory detail remains filtered through Mei’s musician‑of‑time lens.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (conduct before exhaustion) is clear and tightens through the live clock and the dawn intensification. The fortunes’ lift and the horizon’s fold provide a single decisive deepening that narrows her options to now. Cost is present but not foregrounded; the escalation is emotional and formal rather than adversarial. The resolution grows from her agency (conducting) rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory as prophecy, art as temporal architecture, and “chronological homesickness” resolved through creation. Recurrent images (nautilus, mirror, fortunes) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer—home as a stance in time—without telling us what to think. Ambiguity is purposeful and rewarding rather than vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The close third‑person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled diction and cadence that quickens toward the crescendo. Perceptual signature is distinct (music/time metaphors) without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision is taught early and paid off cleanly. The brief whisper fits the texture and does not dilute the voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images do more than one job. Figurative language is lush but coherent and thematically unified (spirals, mirrors, music). No paraphrase loops or cadence templates bog momentum. A few stacked abstractions flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fortune‑cookie divination fused with nautilus‑mapped memory and a mirrored dawn horizon is a fresh synthesis. The unheard symphony conducted from fortune slips is striking and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and imagery heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits to its premise and follows through at the line and image levels.</comment>
