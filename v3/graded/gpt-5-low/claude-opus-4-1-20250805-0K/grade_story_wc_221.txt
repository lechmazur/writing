<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira’s motivation—to guide the temporally scattered—flows cleanly from her identity as “blessed pariah,” and her choice to embrace that role feels earned. Interiority is specific (the rice paper, grandmother’s craft) and embodied through tactile contact with the compass. The internal conflict (isolation vs duty) is present but under-pressured on the page. Still, her renunciation of ordinary contact to become a fixed point registers as a credible, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers memory, object, and present action toward a Charged Poise closure. The decisive act—pressing the map to the compass—reconfigures the station’s options and brings crewmates into legible motion. Cost is inferable in the chosen isolation and acceptance of pariah status. Orientation is clear and the pattern taught early pays off at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The observation deck and the gilded compass rose are specific, tactile, and integral, constraining choices and charging the final image. “Starlight remembered in gold” and the time-dilated void deliver atmosphere that’s not mere postcard. The setting enables the solution (mapping time via the station-as-constellation) rather than decorating it. World rules remain consistent through action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure accrues via the shift from curse to tool and culminates in a single, meaningful tightening: using the sketch as a temporal map. Stakes are coherent (souls adrift vs orienting them) and the choice forecloses a path (touch and ordinary relational life). The escalation is quiet and could bear sharper resistance, but the cadence shift at activation lands. Cost is present as accepted isolation and responsibility.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“True north” reframes from direction to identity, integrating family ritual with the sci‑fi premise in a resonant way. Subtext operates through the compass, rice paper, and station‑as‑constellation, culminating in becoming a lighthouse for others. One line edges toward moralizing (“Sometimes the only way home...”), lightly flattening ambiguity. Overall, the thematic turn feels earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, lyrical without slipping into abstraction, and tightly filtered through Kira’s navigational sensibility. Diction (“starlight remembered in gold,” “temporally stretched like taffy”) has a distinct texture and remains legible. Psychic distance stays steady; the grandmother’s remembered line fits the register. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong line craft with varied rhythm and high information density; images generally carry multiple jobs. A few phrases recur (“echoed silence”) and the lushness approaches purple in spots, but clarity holds. No noticeable scaffold loops or template cadences dull momentum. The final line cleanly recharges the motif without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar SF elements (time dilation, station disaster) are freshened by the intergenerational sketching ritual and the compass’s remembered light. The station‑as‑constellation map is a pleasingly specific synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk is quietness over spectacle, but the conceptual turn is confident. Emotional truth anchors the novelty.</comment>
