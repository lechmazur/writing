<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation—she recovers erased histories through exacting craft—and her micro-choices (lamp placement, meticulous charting, restraint) align consistently. Interiority is credible but largely single-note belief; there’s little contradictory impulse or fray under pressure beyond hand-ache. The monk’s silent presence provides gentle social pressure but not a crucible. The final renunciation (switching off the lamp; accepting an endless task) reads as earned endurance with modest on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the overnight ritual densifies toward dawn, and the cadence shift at sunrise delivers a resonant closure (lamp off, notepad closed). Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, when anchored). The cost is understated but legible in physical strain and the conceptual defiance of official records; the captured “texture of time” reweights what preceded. Quiet but coherent structure; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth, fountain spray, and fluorescent lamp are vivid and purpose-driven; the environment and tool shape how she can listen (refraction, humidity, dawn timing). Details filter through her professional bias, avoiding tourist catalog. The setting charges the final image (sun overwhelms the lamp; tea with the monk) and coheres with the theme of living memory. World rules remain consistent and organic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering erased histories) is present early and the pressure tightens as dawn nears and the hum strengthens. Escalation is a density increase rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. The felt price (fatigue, restraint, the acceptance of unending work against institutional erasure) is present but subtle. One meaningful deepening lands at the dawn threshold.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory versus official forgetting emerge through concrete acts (charting refractions; gold‑leaf margins as protest). The ending reframes “invented histories” as restorative labor without sermonizing. Subtext in the monk’s silence and the trees’ “knowing” sustains complexity and lingers. No tidy moral; the return promise keeps the cost open.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the character’s perceptual signature (instrumental noticing, disciplined diction). Psychic distance remains steady; no head‑hopping. Minimal dialogue fits the piece’s restraint and does not break register. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure (quiet intensification toward dawn).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with strong image economy; very few redundancies. Lushness occasionally approaches purple but remains coherent and purposeful (e.g., “manuscript written in living wood”). No figurative muddle or cadence templates dulling momentum. Final lines land cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a “gilded‑leaf stationer” recovering erased histories via a fluorescent lamp’s hum refracted through a bonsai sanctuary feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The occupational detail is idiosyncratic, not quirky garnish, and it integrates with stakes and method. The quiet ritual frame risks smallness but pays off with conceptual bite. Distinctive without gimmickry.</comment>
