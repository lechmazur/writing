<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, compelling interiority and embodied emotion (vibration through the floor; frozen tears). Motivation—translating silence into music—drives tangible actions. Minor shortfall: little internal contradiction or risky choice under pressure; grief and wonder coexist but rarely collide. Still, reactions to Kepler’s forks and Indigenous knowledge reveal character with specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: iterative experiments (62 Hz, 432 Hz) build to a conceptual repricing—she hasn’t lost music, only its medium. Orientation is crisp in the first graph; single scene coherence is strong. Cost (hearing loss, survivor grief) is legible in the final dawn image. Closure lands without resorting to mechanical summary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory, aurora, thermal rig, and tuning forks are vivid and purpose‑driven. Tools and environment constrain tactics (pressing a fork to glass; reading heat signatures; heating system at 62 Hz). The setting charges the ending’s image (dawn light, frost, brass case) and remains filtered through Mira’s expertise. Sensory selection is tight and character‑specific.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming music through thermal response) is clear, and pressure deepens through concrete trials (fork to glass, 432 Hz choice). The escalation is lyrical rather than adversarial but registers as a decisive intensification by night’s end. The price is internal (accepting loss while reframing it), though no option is visibly foreclosed beyond grief’s endurance. Earned cadence shift at dawn supplies sufficient tightening for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resonant theme—music beyond sound, decolonizing humility toward plant “spirits,” grief transmuted into attention—emerges from specific acts. The closing reprices earlier images (heat as sheet music; “orchestra” of plants). Slight ding for explicit thesis lines (“The world needed to know…”) that edge toward moralizing. Subtext largely holds in images and method rather than statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled close third with a distinct perceptual signature (scientist‑poet). Rhythm modulates well between precise technics and lyric image; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Diction suits Mira’s expertise and altered sensorium. No dialogue needed; the voice carries action and subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax and purposeful imagery (“prismatic symphonies,” “sheet music…written in degrees”). Minimal redundancy; metaphors align with the established physics of the scene. Lyrical register is lush but disciplined, rarely tipping into purple. Final image is sharp and unfussed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Thermal orchestration of Arctic flora via tuning forks is fresh and integrated; the conservatory and Indigenous frame avoid tokenism and feel lived. The synthesis of grief, science, and non‑auditory music lands as both inevitable and surprising. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
