<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kael’s drive (to manage the burden of a transplanted, story‑magnet heart) is specific and embodied through his dye‑maker perceptions and careful handling of the morpho wing. The donor reveal sharpens his internal conflict (gift vs. weight) and his “Teach me” plea is a credible, motivated micro‑turn. Emotional texture is clear without therapy‑speak, and the relationship with Chen applies gentle but real pressure. Cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally, which tempers the peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds from summons → donor reveal → demonstration → vow to “illuminate.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael reframes his role from absorber to conduit with the charged final image. Orientation is clean and the single scene is coherent. The cost is present but subtle, leaning more on implication than a concrete forfeiture.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house, sun trails, and chains of woven light are vivid and POV‑filtered through a dye master’s sensibility. The morpho wing functions as micro‑setting/object, charging the final moment. While the environment guides tone more than constraining choice, it’s integrated and specific. World rules feel consistent and learned through action (tracking sun trails, light scattering through scales).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether Kael will be crushed by accumulating stories or learn a releasing method; pressure tightens meaningfully at the donor reveal and the wing demonstration. The decisive stance (“illuminate rather than absorb”) is earned but the escalation remains gentle, with minimal on‑page cost beyond conceptual risk. No antagonist is needed, but the conflict stays primarily internal and instructional. The final commitment does foreclose the passive path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—beauty as caution, transformation without possession, gift as continuation—emerges through concrete particulars (dyes speaking, wing scattering light). The “iridescent caution” motif reweights the ending image effectively. Some explicit thematic articulation by Chen edges toward didactic, slightly reducing ambiguity. Still, the resonance lingers without a moral spelled out.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature suits a dye master; diction is consistent and dialogue feels natural and purposeful. Voice modulates with pressure (quiet intensification at the donor reveal and the wing’s prisming). No head‑hopping; focalization is steady. The lyricism supports rather than obscures action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied rhythm; images (sun trails, woven light, starlit tea) are precise and not redundant. Figurative language is rich but largely disciplined, avoiding mixed metaphors. A few phrases approach purple, but they don’t blur sense or stall momentum. The final line cleanly recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑transplant “story magnetism,” a dye master’s synesthetic craft, a floating tea house, and the morpho wing as praxis—feels fresh and singular. Turns arise from established elements rather than late rule changes. Risk is taken in committing to a quiet, lyric resolution that still lands. Only the soft pressure keeps it from the very top band.</comment>
