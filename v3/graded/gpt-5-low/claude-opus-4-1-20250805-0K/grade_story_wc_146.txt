<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The bell tuner’s goal and methods are clear and consistent, and her patience manifests in on‑page teaching and restraint. However, interiority is minimal; she reads as a mythic agent more than a conflicted person. Thomas and the mayor function as foils rather than pressure sources. The final renunciation (leaving) feels earned but low-cost emotionally on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the communal rhythm densifies, triggers visible changes (bells, arch, fountain), and culminates in a stable cadence after the tuner departs. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Millhaven keeps its heartbeat without her, with an implied daily cost. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught early then paid off. The lack of a sharp on‑page price keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: archway, bell towers, fountain, and cobblestones are not décor but instruments and constraints of the town’s “music.” The ebony tuning fork/arch keystone reprise charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and woven into action. World rules (magic via rhythm) remain consistent and learned through observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the town’s heartbeat—is signaled early and deepens as more townsfolk join, leading to structural repairs as consequence. Escalation is coherent but gentle; skepticism never truly bites, and the mayor’s resistance poses little on‑page pressure. The tightening occurs through density of participation rather than hard trade‑offs. Cost is implied as ongoing ritual rather than a felt sacrifice in-scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of harmony, communal memory, and intention emerge organically from the walking rituals and the town’s repair. The line “Cities aren’t made of stone” tips toward didactic, but the recurring music/stone imagery keeps resonance grounded. The ending’s “wild hush” and continued dance provide a non‑literal answer that lingers. Slight explicitness keeps it just shy of higher.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The omniscient, fable‑like voice is confident, rhythmic, and consistent; dialogue is sparse but functional and character‑specific. Diction matches the mythic register without register slips. Modulation toward the close is controlled and fitting. No head‑hopping or stance confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful; imagery (“tone hung in the air like a promise,” “wild hush”) is vivid without purple excess. Minimal scaffolding and good momentum for a lyric piece. A few near‑echoes (reiterating the town’s harmony) are thematic rather than redundant. Final cadence is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—rebuilding a town via choreographed footsteps and sonic harmony—is fresh and elegantly executed. It synthesizes folk-magic and civic life in a distinctive way, with the tuning fork and arch keystone creating memorable turns. Risks a fable echo but maintains unique specifics and logic. The conceptual reweighting at the end feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
