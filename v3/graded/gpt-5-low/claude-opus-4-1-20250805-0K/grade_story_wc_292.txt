<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—honoring and completing Lydia’s covert mission—drives concrete choices (decoding, refusing evacuation, broadcasting). Interiority is specific (“spongey dread…wet wool”) and contradicts action in a credible way as certainty hardens under pressure. Her micro‑choices with the nail and map table reveal priorities without safety‑hedging. The only minor shortfall is limited on‑page cost to her relationships or self‑image beyond the declared responsibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: nail → projection shift → decoded routes → storm escalates → beacons appear → decisive broadcast. Closure lands as a decisive act under risk, with a charged final image (nail aligning with the storm). Orientation is solid within 120 words, and the hybrid causal/situational lens holds. The cost is implied rather than deeply dramatized, keeping it shy of the absolute top tier.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The weather station and storm are tactically relevant (alarms, instruments, satellite overlays), and the copper nail functions as a charged micro‑setting object that shapes options and the final image. Details are purpose‑filtered through Elara’s professional bias. World rules are consistent and learned through action (magnetic anomalies, jet stream corridors).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the forgotten vs. evacuate) tightens as the storm accelerates and alarms blare, culminating in Elara choosing to broadcast instead of flee. The reversal/deepening moment when impossible ships emerge pushes her from doubt to conviction. Cost is present (risk, abandonment of safety) but not viscerally cashed out beyond the charged poise. Still, pressure coheres and rises appropriately for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, erasure, and inherited responsibility emerge via concrete images (maps “made to forget,” nails as wayfinders, official records’ silence). The final line reweights the premise without moralizing, and the “reversible exile” concept resonates socially. A slight declarative tilt (“The maps would remember everything now”) skirts on‑the‑nose but remains earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature—measured, tactile, and professionally skewed. Dialogue snippets feel natural and serve pressure rather than exposition. Rhythm modulates well under stress without head‑hopping or register drift. No withholding beyond purposeful pattern reveals.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; figurative language is vivid yet controlled (“wet wool,” the nail warming). No paraphrase loops or template cadences dull momentum, and technical terms are used precisely. A few intensifiers skirt purple but remain clear and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—copper nails as magnetic keys, storms as smuggling corridors, maps that “forget”—feels fresh and cohesive. The reveal of ships in the storm wall is a striking, earned image that reconfigures the premise. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity, and the concept avoids genre cliché. Slightly conservative on the cost keeps it just below 9.0.</comment>
