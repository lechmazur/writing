<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina’s motive—freeing creatures trapped in interrupted time—is clear and consistent, and her choices (diving into the gap; finishing the drawings) align. Interiority is present but largely duty-forward, with minimal contradictory impulses under pressure. The cost touches her (cracked pendant) and others (city loses minutes), but her internal struggle is relatively smooth. Strong competence with limited moral/psychic friction keeps this just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: pendant hum → pursuit via canals → gap at Morteus’s throat → discovery of true source → decisive act of completing illustrations → time snaps back with cost. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure lands with an on‑page price (minutes evaporate, giant wakes, pendant cracks). The revaluation of the city’s practice functions as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing. No loose scaffolding or plot amnesia.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The rooftop canals, the spiral around Morteus’s throat, and the suspended‑moments chamber are vivid and purposeful, guiding access and choice. The environment constrains tactics (boat‑leaping, following the snore‑ripples, diving at the breathing gap). Recurring objects (pendant) and body/architecture integration charge the final image (clear canals, giant awake). World rules are taught through action rather than dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free the trapped time-creatures vs. city’s borrowed minutes) tightens as she nears the giant’s throat and discovers the theft. The decisive escalation is her choice to complete the drawings, triggering a visible loss for the city and forcing a new cadence. Agency drives the turn; cost is unmistakable (panic of sculptors, loss of minutes, pendant damage). One coherent deepening rather than multiple reversals fits the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance emerges from particulars: honoring endings vs. preserving life in borrowed time, ecological elegy reframed through temporal ethics. The final image (clear canals, living subjects) reweights the premise effectively. However, the last paragraph leans into overt thematic statement (“some things weren’t meant to be preserved... but honored in their ending”), dulling subtext. Strong but slightly sermonized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person limited voice is controlled, lyrical without drift, and maintains consistent focalization through Marina’s perceptual priorities. Diction and rhythm modulate well between urgency (chase, dive) and quiet aftermath. No head‑hopping or register slips; exposition integrates with action. The voice is distinct if not radically singular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑rich, and purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs without padding, and momentum is steady. Figurative language is controlled and coherent with no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minimal scaffolding or repetition; the closure image is clear and earned. A few abstract nouns appear, but they don’t blunt clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Time canals, a city built around a sleeping giant’s nap economy, and the ethical twist—borrowing minutes from the final instants of extinction—feel fresh and integrated. The illustrator completing last gestures to release trapped endings is a striking, specific mechanism. The turn is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. Bold worldbuilding marries clean emotional logic without gimmickry.</comment>
