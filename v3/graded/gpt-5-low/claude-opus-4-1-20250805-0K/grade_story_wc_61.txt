<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Keeper’s motive—“to share light without using fire”—is clear and governs every micro‑choice (measuring the red giant, transiting, harvesting, resolving to continue). Her contradiction (burdened witness versus devoted tender) is embodied in small actions and returns in the final stance. The solitude cost is legible and accepted, an Earned Stasis. Slight softness: pressure rarely forces a hard trade‑off beyond reaffirmation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern layering (measurement → mapping → nursery → reprise of gear) crescendos into a charged poise resolution. Orientation is clean from the outset; the closure stakes—enduring as last witness—land with felt cost. The gear’s reprise and the commitment to continue make a before/after legible. Escalation is modest but coherent for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and purpose‑driven, filtered through a caretaker’s priorities (red giant’s “heartbeats,” nursery’s ignition). The calculating gear and “quantum bottles” function as micro‑setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory selection (gravitational pings, photosphere touch) feels specific and integral to her method. World rules remain consistent and learned through her work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (endure the burden of solitary tending) is signaled early and deepened by the “troubling serenity.” The meaningful turn is her acceptance/renewal of duty at the end. However, pressure does not significantly narrow options in scene; it accrues more than it tightens. The cost is present but understated, keeping tension effective yet gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of cyclical creation, stewardship, and non‑destructive giving emerge organically from concrete images (gear approximating infinity; sharing photons without diminishing the source). The final stance reweights prior motifs with resonant inevitability. Minimal moralizing avoids flattening; the paradox line risks telling but is redeemed by enactment. The ending’s promise to remember each “sigh of falling petals” lands as a non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lucid lyric voice with distinct perceptual habits (physics‑tinted metaphors, mechanical reliquary). Psychic distance and register remain steady; no head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Rhythm modulates well between image and movement; elisions are legible. No dialogue needed for this mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs, with clean syntax and minimal scaffolding; imagery is precise and mostly fresh. A few repetitions (“pattern,” “petals”) verge on echo but support the accumulative design rather than stall it. No mixed metaphors or cadence templates blunt clarity. The final line reprises imagery with a crisp, earned cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Cosmic‑gardener is a known frame, but the antique calculating gear, gravitational sonar, and “share light without fire” ethos feel distinctive. The synthesis of elegy and tool‑use grants specificity beyond trope. Risks are tasteful and coherent, not gimmicky. Lack of a harsher turn keeps it shy of the most daring tier.</comment>
