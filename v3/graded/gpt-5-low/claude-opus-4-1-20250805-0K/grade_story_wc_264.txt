<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kess’s motive (guard and cultivate future dreaming) is clear and consistent, and her dreamless state gives her a credible internal cost. Interiority is vivid and character‑specific, not generic. Contradiction (the dreamless tending dreams) hums under the scene, though it could pinch harder in the confrontation. The key choice—singing to force reality to select her version—aligns with her values and history.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with an Accumulative/Textural dominance holds: the pirate’s intrusion tightens pressure, and the lullaby tactic creates a clean because/therefore beat. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she recommits to tending the “quantum gardens,” keyed to the frozen clock. Cost is conceptual (her perpetual dreamlessness and vigilance) rather than a fresh on‑page loss but is legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The phosphorescent dune and wave‑function blooms are specific, multi‑sensory, and integrated into action (they collapse when addressed, align with her song). The chess clock as micro‑setting charges the ending image and shapes perception of time. The rules feel consistent and are learned through use rather than exposition dumps. Environment and object both constrain/enable choices, clearing the 9‑band gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (protecting consciousness cargo), and the pirate’s grab is a tangible test. The escalation is a single, effective tightening turned by her agency via the lullaby. The price paid is mostly enduring (ongoing burden and dreamlessness) rather than an on‑page sacrifice; the conflict resolves a bit cleanly. Still, pressure coheres and rises to a meaningful stance crystallization.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, time’s rupture, and cultivating wonder amid collapse emerge organically through motifs (clock, lullaby, dunes, “unlit corners”). The final image reweights prior material without a stated moral. One line (“They’re seeds…”) skews close to thesis‑saying but remains character‑true. Subtext (dreamless guarding dreams) carries emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third‑person closely held to Kess sustains a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head‑hopping; dialogue is minimal but pointed and carries subtext. The patterned language (fractured lullaby) is taught early and paid off at the turn. No register drifts or mechanical slips distract.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with purposeful figurative texture; most lines do multiple jobs. Minimal redundancy and no noticeable scaffold loops; rhythm varies to support momentum. A few lush images press toward purple, but coherence and clarity hold, including in the climax. The final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Freight guard of consciousness” on phosphorescent quantum dunes is a striking synthesis, not a template. The lullaby‑as‑physics key is a fresh, character‑driven tactic that feels inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects and concepts (clock, Archive divergence, blooms) cohere into a singular vision. Risky lyricism heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
