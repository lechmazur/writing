<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot’s interiority is specific and embodied (watchful calm giving way to trembling), and her resignation grows credibly from the sensory-memory experience. The lantern reframes her vocation as complicity, producing a believable break. A few thesis-like lines (“She’d been controlled too—by protocols…”) flatten nuance. Still, the final choice feels earned with a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene Hybrid drive holds: accumulative memory pressure leads to a causal Decisive Change (resignation and new mission). Orientation is clear early (rain, tunnel, body, role), and setups (lantern, supervisor control) pay off. The cost is implied more than dramatized, but legible. The closure image (storm baptism + lantern) coheres with the earlier beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tunnel, rain, and lantern are vividly integrated and filtered through Margot’s professional eye; the space carries historical residue that charges actions. The lantern functions as object-as-setting, constraining attention and reweighting the final image. Weather deepens atmosphere and subtly parallels the internal shift. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it meaningfully shapes tone and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to stay an observer or become a liberator) is clear and tightens as memories intensify. The decisive tightening occurs when Margot reframes Jerome’s death and resigns, foreclosing career stability. The price remains largely conceptual, not dramatized across beats. Still, internal and external pressures interweave coherently to an earned act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Freedom vs. modern bondage resonates through specific images (lantern lineage, tunnels, supervisor control) rather than abstract summary alone. The final image “baptized by the storm” reweights the premise without needing a spelled-out moral. Some lines tilt toward thematic declaration, slightly softening subtext. Overall, the recurrence of the lantern meaningfully shifts by the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Close third voice is steady, lucid, and modulates with pressure; the prose carries a controlled lyricism fitting the hybrid mode. The investigatory stance underpins vocabulary and perception without head-hopping. Occasional declarative thesis sentences intrude on the otherwise textured voice. Rhythm and certainty remain appropriate to what Margot can know.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentences are clean and purposeful with strong image work; the rain/lantern motifs thread momentum rather than stall it. Minor purple notes (“heart too full”) and thematic restatements recur but do not impede clarity. Information density is high and transitions are smooth. The final line lands with image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a modern preventable-death investigator with an Underground Railroad lantern that transmits entangled memories feels fresh and coherent. The risk of overt allegory is mitigated by concrete scene work. The transformation arc reads inevitable in hindsight. It’s not radical in form, but the conceptual integration is deft.</comment>
