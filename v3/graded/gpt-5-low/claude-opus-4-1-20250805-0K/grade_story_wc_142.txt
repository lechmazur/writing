<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maya’s dual loyalties and tactician’s mindset are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices—reading codes, convening the meeting, choosing incorporation over direct confrontation. The stone chip touch and the thumb‑cut give her motives bodily texture. The internal conflict is credible and active on the page, though the choice lands with slightly tidy confidence rather than visible wobble or cost. Still, actions align cleanly with motive and reveal a specific, embodied character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under a Situational/Hybrid lens, pressure coheres: coded warning → developers arrive → community gathering → legal reorganization; the final image (papers coming, cornerstone laid) locks the Decisive Change. Causality is clean and on‑page; orientation is swift and stable. The cost is implied (foregoing open resistance, bureaucratic entanglement) more than felt, softening the punch slightly. Nevertheless, closure is earned and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The raft‑carnival ecology and graffiti system are lived‑in and shape tactics (wave‑powered lights, platform maze, coded murals driving decisions). The foundation chip as micro‑setting object charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered without tourist cataloging. It narrowly misses a 9+ only because constraints rarely force a hard physical limit at a peak beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive gentrification) is clear early; escalation tightens with the developers’ arrival and the community’s rapid reorganizing pivot. The plan forecloses the fight‑them‑directly path, and the graffiti‑legal synthesis feels like a genuine narrowing of options. The visible price is muted—less a loss than a strategic reframing—so the tension doesn’t quite peak. Still, agency drives the turn and the outcome.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of cultural resilience, translation between worlds, and making oneself “unbuyable” emerge from specific acts and images (murals encoding law, the stone’s relocation). Subtext runs through the two‑story murals read differently by insiders and outsiders. A few lines edge toward thesis (“become something they can’t buy”), nudging didacticism. The final whisper of “STILL FLOATING, STILL FREE” resonates, if slightly on‑the‑nose.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person close is steady and character‑particular; diction blends the tactile raft world with Maya’s pragmatic lexicon. Rhythm modulates well between observation and decision; no head‑hopping. Brief quoted speech reads naturally and advances action. Minor moments of declarative summary don’t disturb the control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear, economical, and image‑dense without purple excess; lines often do double duty (world + tactic). Minimal scaffold and no disruptive loops; syntax varies and propels. A few elevated phrases approach slogan, but cadence and clarity hold. Final images land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of a drifting carnival city, a community‑wide graffiti code, and legal self‑defense via cultural heritage feels fresh and organic. The stone chip as heirloom‑to‑cornerstone is a smart, specific pivot. Risks are coherent and pay off without gimmickry. The only limiter is a slightly familiar “protect heritage via designation” solution, though it’s enlivened by the code‑art execution.</comment>
