<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives and competence are clear and drive every turn (opening the door, solving the loop‑trap, negotiating). Interiority is light—she rarely hesitates or reveals contradiction—so emotional cost reads more conceptual than felt. The “carefully resourceful” trait is shown (silver silk, dead languages), not merely told. The rescue of the time traveler offers a relational beat, but their dynamic is underdeveloped.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: password → descent → trap solved via pattern gaps → negotiation → release. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the mountain accepts, the diary fills, passages open). The cost is conceptual and lightly sketched (trading hoarding for dissemination), which softens impact. The single‑scene flow and anchors are stable and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore is vivid and functions as pressure: shifting corridors, singing books, a logic‑loop trap, and a sentient “contract.” Details are POV‑filtered (linguistic patterns between roots; humming volumes) and culminate in the garden transformation. The environment constrains choices and charges the final image. Texture is lush without becoming touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—accessing the library and avoiding entrapment—tightens through the trap and the contract. The negotiation turn is protagonist‑driven and resolves the pressure, but the acceptance feels relatively frictionless. Costs are implied rather than dramatized (commitment to seed knowledge outward). Tension is steady yet never bites hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The seed/pressing motif coheres with “unlearned lessons” and reweights at the end: artifacts become seeds. A slight on‑the‑nose line (“not as artifacts to be hoarded, but as seeds”) trims subtlety, but the botany‑language synthesis earns resonance. The release of trapped seekers gives ethical texture beyond personal gain. The thematic afterimage is strong and consistent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Mira’s perceptual biases (language, pattern, acoustics). Rhythm is controlled; sensory diction is consistent with her discipline. Minimal dialogue carries weight and stays in register. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, motion) with few scaffolds or loops. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“books began to sing…with pure meaning”). Cadence varies with scene pressure; clarity remains high at the peak. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward purple but never muddies sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—linguistic botany mapping a sentient mountain‑library of lost wisdom—is distinctive and integrated. The loop‑trap solved by “phantom books” and the contract renegotiation feel earned by prior particulars. Resolution tilts familiar “forbidden archive” tropes toward dissemination rather than hoard. Risk is thematic rather than structural, but the synthesis reads fresh.</comment>
