<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interior contradictions are vivid: “lucid turbulence” lets multiple borrowed selves argue in-scene while she still executes craft choices. Motivation is clear and particular (to understand and render others via broadsheets), and actions align (presswork, type selection, use of the halo). The cost—eroding personal identity—lands credibly by dawn. Minor softness: her core want edges toward the conceptual, occasionally buffered by metaphor rather than concrete stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: star vanishings and layered selves increase density toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is on-page and costly—she “couldn’t remember which personality was originally hers,” reweighting the premise from math to typography. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the pattern taught is paid off. The final charged image (last star, “seventeen different mouths”) seals the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, open roof, and letterpress are sensorially specific and integrated into action. The environment and tools charge the ending and pattern (shifting ink, refracted starlight), though they rarely constrain a discrete choice. The halo fragment functions as a micro-setting object with evolving charge. Vivid atmosphere supports theme without feeling like a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres as internal escalation: the overlay of selves, the angelic grief, and the dwindling constellation tighten toward identity loss. The live clock of disappearing stars and the warming halo deepen stakes. Agency appears as chosen endurance and production (printing a hundred adaptive sheets), culminating in a costly stance. Slightly abstracted stakes keep the tightening just shy of visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: presswork becomes a metaphor system culminating in “emotion as typography,” and the constellation of Empatheia reframes preservation as printing. Subtext runs in how ambiguity is weaponized to create empathy and disorientation, not explained. The final repricing resonates and lingers. A single thesis-like sentence risks mild didacticity but is earned by scene work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled, distinctive, and anchored in Mira’s perceptual biases (craft lexicon, math/typography cross-talk). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during stress; no head-hopping or register drift. Patterned elision is taught and legible. Rhythm lifts pressure without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (ink color shifts, stacked transparencies). Figurative language is abundant but coherent and mostly disciplined; minimal scaffolding or loops. Cadence varies to maintain propulsion. A few lines flirt with purple, but don’t blur cause/effect or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Letterpress + vanishing constellation + empathy-transposition is an original synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The halo fragment and adaptive broadsheets refresh familiar metaphysics with concrete craft. The risk of a conceptual ending pays off via charged images and cost. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>
