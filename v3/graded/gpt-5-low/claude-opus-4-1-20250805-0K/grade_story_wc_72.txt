<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Both Thessaly and Marina have clear, pressure‑tested motives that sharpen under revelation; Thessaly’s past atrocity and ongoing witness create credible contradiction. Marina’s internal shift—from certainty to nuance—reads earned with embodied detail (trembling hands, the ampoule). A slight on‑the‑nose streak (“History isn’t black and white—it's purple…”) trims subtlety but doesn’t undercut credibility. The final renunciation of absolute judgment feels paid for by prior causality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: arrival → telepathic contact → staged revelations → Marina’s decision → Thessaly’s reconfigured stasis. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with legible costs (mass drowning; Marina’s reputation risk). Orientation is clean from the opening lines, and the single scene holds. The ending image (“stone animate with possibility”) reweights the premise without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The underwater garden, kelp, marble, and diving bell are vivid and purposeful; the ampoule and seawalls tie setting to plot and history. The environment shapes the mode of contact (telepathy) and charges the final image of the garden as monument. Detail selection feels filtered through the situation rather than touristic. It stops short of directly constraining a present‑tense tactic, but it deeply informs consequence and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether the truth will be told and how Thessaly will be seen; the revelations narrow Marina’s options credibly. The decisive deepening arrives with the dolphins/seawall memory, forcing moral calculus. The cost is made explicit and carried into the close, though the present‑scene risk is largely reputational rather than immediate. Tension sustains without gimmick or coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story engages moral ambiguity with specificity (weaponized water, genocide prevented via atrocity) and lands a resonant answer: embrace nuance over absolutes. Recurring images (foxglove purple, garden) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end. A few thematic lines verge on declaration, slightly reducing subtextive potency. Overall, the aftereffect lingers and resists tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with telepathic exchange; psychic distance is steady and legible. Dialogue‑as‑thought has subtext and advances stakes without exposition dumps. Diction and rhythm are purposeful, with only occasional overt thesis‑phrases. No head‑hopping; stance remains coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean, propulsive lines with efficient imagery; little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is mostly precise and anchored to concrete objects (kelp, marble, foxglove), avoiding mixed metaphors. The “dominoes falling upward” image is a slight flourish but remains intelligible and apt to the reversal of time’s flow. Syntax varies to match pressure, and the final sentence lands with compressed clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—telepathic living statue, archaeological encounter, foxglove‑weaponized water, dolphins breaching seawalls—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The moral pivot avoids template hero/villain binaries. Risks (lyric telepathy, quiet closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. Specific details and cost ground the originality beyond surface novelty.</comment>
