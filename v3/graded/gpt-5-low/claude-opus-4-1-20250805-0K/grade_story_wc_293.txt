<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marla’s interior is specific and embodied—reading winds like sheet music, clutching the collodion shard—and her decisive act (playing the melody backward) is motivated by the newfound decoding. Contradictory impulses—guilt and guardedness versus granting amnesty—surface through images rather than labels. The final acceptance of responsibility (ferryman of forgiveness) feels earned, though the emotional cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Status dynamics with the hitchhiker are light but present in his mentoring/fading stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: shard revelation → reverse‑playing → rematerialization → reconfiguration of role. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/when), and the single scene maintains continuity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with the choice to keep playing charged by responsibility. Cost is present but subtle (accepting ongoing duty; letting him fade again), keeping this just shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The mountain pullout, winds, bridge, and scaffold wrap flutters are vividly selective and filtered through the fiddler’s sensibility. The environment and objects (wind patterns, glass plate, bow/strings) meaningfully charge choices, especially decoding via flutters and light. While the setting doesn’t physically constrain movement, it materially informs tactic and meaning. Strong integration without excess cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding/bridging between certainties and possibilities—tightens through the decoding and backward performance. The return/fade of the hitchhiker tests her commitment, foreclosing a simpler “rescue and keep” outcome. Pressure is mostly internal and lyric, yet the one decisive intensification reads clearly. The price, however, remains more thematic than bodily or relational.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motifs (bridges, pixels, scaffolds, music) braid into a coherent meditation on forgiveness and possibility. The final image (“ferryman of forgiveness”) reweights prior beats effectively. Slight ding for on‑the‑nose articulation via the hitchhiker’s direct thesis (“You’ve been granting amnesty…”), which edges toward telling over subtext. Still, the resonance lingers without a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical POV with controlled diction and musical syntax; perceptions are character‑specific and confident. Dialogue is sparing but functional, carrying subtext and advancing plot. Psychic distance and tense remain stable; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well at the reversal beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images are mostly clean, momentum steady, and sentences multitask. A few density surges risk purple, but metaphors are internally coherent and pattern‑driven (photography/music/bridge lexicons). No significant loops or scaffold; the final cadence lands crisply. Minor verbosity in thematic phrasing keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—fiddle music as bridge‑building, wet‑plate shards as pixelated amnesty, scaffold flutters as notation—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The conceptual leap is grounded through tactile details and action. Risk‑taking is evident and coherent, with no late rule cheats. A touch more cost or ambiguity would push this into the rare tier.</comment>
