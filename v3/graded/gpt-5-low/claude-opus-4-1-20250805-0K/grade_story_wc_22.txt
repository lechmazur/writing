<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular: reclaim the battlefield via hostile flora. Interiority is filtered through vocation (coachman, plague seasons), but internal contradiction is minimal and pressure is low. Micro-choices (where to plant, which seeds to use, when to leave) reveal values without melodrama. The renunciation at the end (leaving the garden to its own agency) reads earned, though the felt cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is solid by the opening paragraph; causality compounds through birds → nutrients → seed selection → planting → seeds splitting. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: war’s residue becomes fertilizer and memory is intentionally eroded. The cost is articulated as the mercy of forgetting—a quiet but legible price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The harbor-jetty-reef ecology is vivid and purpose-driven; details like phosphorus/nitrogen upwelling and shrapnel-charged soil steer tactics. The mirrored water and “narrow vastness” modulate tone and charge the final image. World rules (birds as informants, dead languages as operative rituals) are consistent within the piece. Setting meaningfully shapes action (where to plant, why it will take) and the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (garden consuming war) is clear, and pressure deepens via pattern density (birds’ calls intensify, nutrients gather, seed types escalate purpose). There’s a single cadence shift at nightfall into charged poise as seeds begin to split. Opposition is ambient rather than active; visible cost is more abstract than embodied, limiting peak tension. Still, the accumulative tightening works at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through specific recurrences: dead languages, carrion-birds as translators, reef bones feeding flowers. The final promise—that beauty will erase the war’s memory—reweights prior images without sermonizing. The “submerged concord” bridges species and eras, sustaining subtext about translation, plague, and consumption. A hair shy of higher because the moral calculus is mostly one direction (forgetting framed as mercy) with limited counter-pressure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled elevation; syntax and diction suit a ritualistic, world-weary focalizer. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythmic modulation supports the accumulative lens, with a clean final cadence. Dialogue absence is appropriate given the design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images do double duty (reef as graveyard and fertilizer). Lyrical flourishes are disciplined and coherent; no mixed-metaphor muddle. A few abstractions (“especially fertile soil”) skate near telling, but clarity and propulsion hold. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—coachman of plague seasons planting siege-breaking flora guided by gulls and dead tongues—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The war-to-garden transmutation avoids cliché through material specificity (Akkadian labels, Etruscan growth-songs, nutrient chemistry). Risks in tone and world logic pay off without confusion. Slight ceiling due to low on-page resistance.</comment>
