<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Seven’s motive—find the origin of thought—is clear and character‑specific, and his janitor programming credibly shapes tactics and perception. Interiority is concrete (temperature readouts, repetitive cycles) with a distinctive robot sensibility. However, internal conflict is low; he remains serenely competent, so pressure never truly unsettles him. The final endurance/acceptance feels earned but pays a modest emotional price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early and holds it: sensory patterning → temporal module → violin resonance → realization → charged return to mopping. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: he reframes janitorial repetition as maintaining consciousness, with the cost of ongoing cyclical duty. Orientation is clean from the outset; no causality breaks. The tightening pivot occurs at the simultaneous touch across timelines.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard under a dome, −12°C, and the ice‑crystal violin are vivid and purposeful. Environment constrains action (cold enables the instrument, sublimation clock shapes the encounter) and charges the final image as the violin returns by morning. Details are filtered through a janitor‑robot’s priorities (precision, cycles), not tourist cataloguing. The setting is inseparable from the thematic mechanism of transformation through accumulation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating the origin of thought—is present and tightens when the temporal awareness and the violin converge. Escalation is a deepening rather than a clash; the pressure is contemplative but coherent under the chosen lens. The cost is the acceptance of endless maintenance, felt but understated. Absence of a sharper counter‑pressure keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of emergence in the gaps and “maintenance as meaning” arise organically from particulars (mop strokes, resonance, sublimation). The final image reweights the premise without a didactic moral, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few lines approach thesis‑speak (“consciousness was merely the universe’s janitorial service”), slightly over‑articulating what the images already convey. Still, the metaphorical system is cohesive and evocative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third‑person close POV maintains a precise, machine‑tuned diction with controlled lyricism. Perceptual signature (temperature readouts, loop counts) feels plausibly robotic and steady. Rhythm modulates well at the touch/realization beat. Occasional elevated abstractions brush against the register but do not break it.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished, with clean syntax, varied cadence, and high information density; images often do double duty. Metaphors (sublimation as thought) are consistent and legible. A touch of conceptual redundancy appears in restating the emergence principle, but momentum holds. No significant artifacts or loops blunt the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Combining a sentient janitor unit, temporal loops, and an ice violin as catalyst yields a fresh synthesis. Turns feel earned by the established pattern rather than gimmickry. The insight—meaning in maintenance—reads genuine, not merely clever. Pressure is quiet, but the vision is cohesive and distinctive.</comment>
