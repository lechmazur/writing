<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (to restore masks and ground the dead) is clear and enacted through concrete craft choices under pressure. Interiority is specific (“lucid unrest,” scarred fingers), but internal contradiction is minimal and struggle feels almost frictionless. Her endurance across the night counts as cost, yet there’s little ambivalence or error to complicate the work. The closing acceptance of inheritance reads earned but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions steadily reweight stakes toward the dawn settling. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration as spirits rise, reunite, and “settle” at sunlight; the cost is her night’s labor and the net’s total unraveling. Orientation is clean from the start, and set-ups (prisms, net, needle) pay off materially. The causality is ritual-logic rather than plotty turns, but consistent and sufficient.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Prism Sanctuary and starlight/prisms are not mere decor; they hum, focus beams, and charge the final image at the apex with timing and consequence. Tools-as-setting (needle, net) are tactically integrated, and sensory detail is selective and purposeful. World rules are learned through action, not exposition. The environment’s properties constrain the ritual and shape closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: restore masks to ground spirits. Escalation is a steady densifying—from first knot to chorus of masks to spectral emergence—culminating at dawn; the tightening arrives via pattern intensification rather than reversal. The price (time, unraveling the net, bodily/psychic strain) is felt but subtle. A touch more jeopardy or friction would heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of repair, witness, inheritance, and transforming binding into mending emerge organically from acts and images (net knots, prisms, “interlaced hush”). The final settling reweights prior material without moralizing, and the needle as compass point deepens the afterimage. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection. Slight tidiness in the resolution keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely tracks Mira’s tactile perceptions; diction and rhythm are coherent and modulate with pressure. Brief dialogue is minimal and apt; no head-hopping or stance drift. The voice maintains authority without over-explaining, and elision is purposeful. Elevated register feels earned by the ritualized frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, high information density, and images doing multiple jobs (“shadows…like jellyfish made of starlight”). Occasional lushness skirts purple but stays clear and purposeful; little to no scaffold or loop. Rhythm carries momentum across long sentences without slippage. Final images are crisp and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—funerary masks reassembled with a centuries-old net that “accumulates silence,” prisms channeling starlight—feels singular and necessary. The ritual method is inventive and follows its implications to a clean, resonant end. Risks in concept and tone pay off without obscuring clarity. It’s fresh without gimmickry.</comment>
