<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera’s motives are clear and consistent—find truth, retrieve her grandmother’s letter, and deliver suppressed messages. Interiority is anchored in tactile specifics (brush, ink, tremors), but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers. Her final resolve feels earned yet largely unopposed by on‑page counterpressure. Still, micro‑choices (staying up to piece the map, entering the tunnel, deciding to deliver all) reveal a coherent hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Causal chain is tight: plate fragment → assembled map → discovery of crystallized messages → grandmother’s confession → decision to transcribe and deliver. Closure lands as a decisive change/charged poise with a legible cost (risking the city’s “carefully maintained peace”). Orientation is firm early and the two‑shard structure is clean. The cost is largely prospective rather than enacted on the page, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, breathing leaves, and pneumatic tubes are vivid and integrated into action; the mask and dead zones constrain tactics. The golden ink and living leaves return in the final image to charge the theme. World rules (crystallized sound) are taught through discovery rather than dumped. Economy stays focused on what matters to Vera’s craft and mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exposing suppressed truths versus preserving peace—is signaled and coherently tightened as Vera moves from discovery to action. The grandmother’s confession reweights risk and catalyzes the commitment to deliver all messages. On‑page resistance is light; conflict is more investigative and ethical than adversarial. Nevertheless, the turn at the tubes functions as a meaningful deepening that narrows her ethical options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The water/truth motif is threaded concretely (“truth, like water, always finds its way”) and reweighted by the city’s engineered scarcity. The final image—gold ink flowing as she transcribes—offers an earned, resonant answer about the cost of candor. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“some truths were worth wilting for”), trimming subtlety slightly. Overall, theme arises from actions and objects rather than meta commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable, selective, and character‑specific; diction carries tactile precision without strain. Lyric turns (“condensation that smelled of copper and regret”) fit the voice and world. No head‑hopping or unjustified knowledge leaps. Rhythm modulates well between investigative calm and charged decision.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are tight, image‑rich, and purposeful with minimal scaffolding; sentences do more than one job. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Momentum is steady with clean paragraphing and no obvious loops. A couple of aphoristic phrases flirt with telling, but they don’t blunt clarity or cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—living‑leaf calligraphy as lie‑detector, crystallized sound in pneumatic dead zones, and a political water diversion—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The cartographic zinc fragments used to exhume confessions is inventive and thematically apt. Risk‑taking aligns with character and world, avoiding gimmickry. Only the lightly didactic closing notes temper the ceiling.</comment>
