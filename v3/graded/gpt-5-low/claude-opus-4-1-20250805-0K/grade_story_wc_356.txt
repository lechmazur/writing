<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira’s ambition versus the demanded stillness is embodied through tactile choices (dew collection, soil tending, sketch‑journaling) and her sensitive nose. The internal turn—accepting the stench as communication—feels earned. Slight softness: conflict remains gentle, with mockery offstage and few costly mistakes dramatized. Still, the final endurance under the bloom lands as a real renunciation of haste.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned care and sketching accrete to a cadence shift at the “turning of the tide’s thought,” then the bloom reweights meaning. Orientation is clear early; the ending provides a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (she breathes the stench). Some summary spans weeks, but they serve the pattern and do not blur closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The treetop village’s sway, suspended garden, and dew from spiders’ webs infuse every choice and culminate in the wind carrying the flower’s message. Environment isn’t postcard—it shapes process (finding stillness while swaying) and charges the final image. Sensory specificity, especially olfactory, is purposeful and POV‑true. The setting’s logic remains consistent and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving readiness by cultivating the bloom—tightens through a pattern deepening from rote care to embodied understanding; the shoot’s emergence is the meaningful turn. The climax asks her to endure overwhelming sensation, foreclosing her prior impatience. Pressure is lyrical rather than adversarial; costs are modest but legible. A sharper on‑page test from an opposing force could heighten escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—wisdom as an undercurrent and odor as communication, not corruption—emerges through concrete acts and the final revaluation of the bloom. The last image reframes time and patience without sermonizing. Minor ding: Master Thorne articulates the thesis somewhat directly, slightly reducing subtext. Overall resonance persists beyond the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct sensory bias keeps perspective tight and credible. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (quiet accumulation to the overwhelming bloom). Dialogue is sparse but natural, serving pressure rather than exposition. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean, image‑rich, and purposeful; metaphors align with the botanical/arboreal field and rarely overreach. Momentum holds despite reflective spans; sentences carry multiple jobs. Minimal redundancy and no template cadence drag. A touch of density in figurative phrasing is present but controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The corpse‑flower/olfactory‑seer angle in a swaying treetop guild feels fresh, and the “smell its dreams” move is a memorable twist. The apprentice‑learns‑patience arc is familiar, but specifics make it singular. Risks are tasteful rather than radical; the synthesis is strong and coherent. It stops short of transformational novelty, but it’s well above template.</comment>
