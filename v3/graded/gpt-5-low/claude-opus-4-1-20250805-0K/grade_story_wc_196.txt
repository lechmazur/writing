<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive is precise and embodied: access the archives to find his mother’s truth while curating a counter‑narrative of small graces. His micro‑choices (photographing the note, cross‑referencing addresses, returning the button, adding a name to his private index) reveal character under gentle pressure. The cost to intimacy (Sarah leaving) grounds his endurance as an earned stance. Interiority is specific and avoids therapy‑speak, with contradictions (solitude vs. need for witness) held in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer (button → note → tracking → disturbed dust) until the closing charged poise of adding Timothy to the private index. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise that reconfigures his quest: healing via witnessing imperfect kindnesses, not a single revelation. Orientation is clean early; causality is soft but coherent under the chosen lens. The cost—choosing the archives over life outside—remains legible at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The file room and dust operate as active setting and micro‑tool: dust “language” directs tactics and the disturbed pattern signals recent searching. The infantryman’s button functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image when returned to place. Details are vivid and POV‑filtered (Army stationery, red ink, faint pencil). The environment feels lived‑in and thematically fused to the act of careful witnessing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but clear: whether he can reframe his healing through the archives’ human residue. Pressure coheres through the deepening finds and the revelation that someone else recently searched, tightening the emotional field. The final tactic—adding Timothy to his index while returning the button—forecloses the path of pure self‑quest in favor of communal witnessing. Costs remain internal but present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thematic resonance is strong—kindness persisting in bureaucratic spaces—but the final paragraph edges into explicit thesis (“Some wounds required archaeology…”) that slightly dilutes subtext. The best moments embed theme in particulars (the faint pencil “tries so hard to be good,” the button’s return). The ending still offers a non‑literal answer (witnessing over revelation), but a lighter touch would heighten after‑echo. Complexity is present without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is controlled, with a distinctive perceptual signature (reading dust as language, artifacts as speech). Diction is elevated but character‑plausible for a reflective archivist; stance and distance remain stable. Rhythm modulates with discovery without head‑hopping or over‑explaining. Occasional aphoristic lines flirt with sermonizing but do not disrupt POV integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful imagery, and minimal scaffolding. A few metaphors verge on purple or repeat (“dust” as language, spirits) and thematic aphorisms compress into summary near the end, modestly slowing momentum. Syntax varies and carries scene propulsion. Proofing and clarity are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archivist reading dust patterns in a foster file room to curate an index of small graces is a fresh, specific angle. The infantryman’s button and faint marginalia feel original and humanly true. The quiet reweighting at the end avoids cliché, though the closing aphorisms slightly blunt uniqueness. Overall, the synthesis of object, setting, and motive shows confident ingenuity.</comment>
