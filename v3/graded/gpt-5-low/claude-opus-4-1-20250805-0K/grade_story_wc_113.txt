<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive—to complete Elisabetta’s interrupted piece—drives concrete choices (returning to the flooded hall, transcribing, stepping deeper to play). Interiority is particular to a musician’s perception, with embodied costs (holding the violin high, chest‑deep water). Internal contradiction is light; he’s steady rather than conflicted, so complexity is modest. Still, actions align tightly with motive and culminate in a credible endurance choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the flood, reflections, and emerging notation build toward a charged final image. Closure lands with cost when he wades to chest depth to sustain the unfinished note, resulting in the lanterns dying and the restored program—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. The because/therefore chain is subtle but coherent and resolved on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flooded pit and lantern‑lit hall are vivid and integral; water and acoustics constrain choices and enable the “instrument” effect. The violin case, soggy program, and shivering reflections are used as tools rather than postcards. The environment directly charges the climax (standing chest‑deep, harmonics via water). Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake: completing the ghost composition. Escalation is earned through the required deepening—final movement forces him into deeper water, narrowing options and raising physical and existential cost. No antagonist, but the constraint architecture (flood, dissolving program, single playable chance) tightens convincingly. The resolution stems from his agency and endurance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “in‑between” theme—stage/audience, living/dead, silence/sound—organically infuses action rather than lecturing. The final image (restored program signed across centuries) reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext (art as conduit completing the interrupted) accrues through concrete beats and the refusal to literalize the ghost. Resonance lingers without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a musician’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate under pressure (the playing sequence tightens cleanly). No head‑hopping or unearned certainty; elision is purposeful. The “music giving silence shape” line exemplifies tonal precision without overstatement.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, action, and theme—without scaffold or synonym loops. Figurative language is fresh and disciplined; no mixed metaphors in peak beats. Momentum holds through descriptive passages because details advance pressure. Copy is clean and varied in syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Flooded orchestra pit as instrument plus water‑revealed notation is a distinctive synthesis. The dual‑signed, time‑split composition is an elegant, earned turn. Risks (quiet, lyric closure; non‑expository ghost) pay off with clarity and force. Familiar ghost‑music tropes are transformed through specific, irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
