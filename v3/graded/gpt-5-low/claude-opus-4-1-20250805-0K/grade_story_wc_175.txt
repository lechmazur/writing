<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—honoring erased histories through ephemeral signals—is clear and embodied in concrete action, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers or faces competing impulses. Her competence and tenderness are credible, yet the lack of friction limits depth. Micro-choices (knot patterns, where to place the wing) reveal values but don’t force a painful trade-off. The endurance/renunciation at the end is earned but quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens through pattern-building toward the monarch’s arrival, with closure in a charged poise image where two histories touch and a conceptual cost is named (the monarch will die, the structures dissolve). Orientation is clean early; one scene coheres. The closure lands on-page via the butterfly’s reading and departure reweighting what came before. Stakes are conceptual but legible, paid in ephemerality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto’s moisture and altitude directly constrain tactics (temporary fibers, signals that must dissolve) and charge the final image. Specifics—dew-weeping crevices, moss curtains, prisms of droplets—are filtered through Mira’s purpose. The setting is not postcard static; it dictates the form and cost of her art. The aerial isolation and humidity are integral to method and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure is quiet but coherent: the last monarch’s imminent passage creates a one-chance window. Escalation hinges on the monarch’s approach and landing—a single decisive intensification that validates or voids Mira’s effort. The visible price (certain dissolution, the monarch’s death) gives the ending weight. Still, the lack of resistance or complication keeps it from higher tension bands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—impermanence as preservation—emerges organically through the knots, dissolving structures, and the moth wing read as braille. The final image reweights history and memory without moralizing: “It would die… but the spores and seeds would remember.” A couple of declaratives (“They honored the temporary…”) flirt with telling, but the images carry the load. Resonance lingers with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates well, especially around the monarch’s arrival. Elision is purposeful and legible for this lyric mode. No dialogue, but the narrative stance remains confident and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dense, vivid lines do multiple jobs; figurative language is largely coherent and scene-serving. A hint of purple (“prisms that hung like unfinished sentences”) suits the mode without obscuring clarity. Minimal scaffold and no noticeable loops. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: cloud dwellers erased from records, histories encoded in moth scales, and a last monarch “reading” ephemeral structures feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in premise and method heightens meaning without gimmickry. The emotional truth—making beauty that won’t last to honor what was erased—lands as singular. The world logic stays coherent.</comment>
