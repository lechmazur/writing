<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motive and method are clear and character‑specific, and her choices (to read the feather, to lead Chen to witness) align with a patient, pattern‑attuned temperament. However, internal contradiction is light; she begins already believing and ends with a refined version of that belief. The shift from “understanding” to “inhabiting” lands, but cost is conceptual rather than dramatized under pressure. Chen’s presence adds a mild relational angle but does not force a hard choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through images (feather → spreading light → fish constellations → jellies) to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives in the acceptance that some mysteries are to be inhabited, charged by the city’s pulse going dark—an earned stasis with a conceptual price. Orientation is clean early, and the luminous event provides the single tightening/deepening expected at this length. The cost is subtle but legible in the renunciation of instrumental “solving.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The underwater dome against Thymal is vividly rendered through bioluminescence, mineral shimmer, and living limestone rhythms, filtered through Mira’s professional gaze. The setting integrates with action (descent to the observation dome; starlight filtering to trigger phenomena). It charges the final image but does not overtly constrain a choice on the page, keeping it just below the 9‑band. Specificity and tone are consistently anchored in the environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressure accrues via the rare alignment and the city’s “luminous respite,” culminating in a cadence shift as fish and jellies reweight meaning. Stakes remain internal and observational; there’s no firm narrowing of options beyond watch vs. measure, and no visible price exacted in scene. The escalation is beautiful but gentle, consistent with the accumulative lens yet light on cost clarity. The key turn is Chen abandoning instruments to witness, which is thematically apt but low‑risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Belonging versus control, sky/abyss dialogue, and time’s bridge are coherently woven through recurring images (feather, constellations, living stone). The final acceptance resonates, but the line “some mysteries weren’t meant to be solved but inhabited” edges into explicit thesis. Subtext largely operates through image and shared witnessing. The piece elicits wonder with a soft ache, avoiding false binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third‑person close centers Mira’s perceptual signature—patient, pattern‑attentive, gently lyrical—without head‑hopping or register slips. Diction and rhythm suit the awe‑struck mode, with controlled modulation as the event intensifies. Dialogue is minimal but natural and purposeful. Narrative certainty matches what Mira can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information‑dense, with images doing multiple jobs (worldbuilding, theme, momentum). Figurative language is fresh and coherent to the milieu; no loops or scaffolding bog the flow. A few elevated lines verge on aphorism but do not muddy closure. Opening and ending images frame the piece with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>“Landscape astrologer,” stellar alignments animating coral architecture, and the feather as ritual residue feel distinctive and integrated. The piece risks a quiet, accumulative structure and commits to wonder over spectacle. The turn from measurement to inhabited mystery is not novel in concept but rendered with fresh particulars and strong vision. Emotional truth is earned through specific observation rather than schematic plotting.</comment>
