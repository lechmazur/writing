<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maya’s interiority is specific and embodied (morphine haze, phantom shoulder pain) and her micro-choices—translating the cast, drawing the bridge, relinquishing the coral—track a credible value hierarchy under pressure. Contradictory impulses (guilt vs. caretaking; retreat vs. connection) act simultaneously in scene. The relationship with the child functions as crucible without sentimentally flattening either. A faint slip toward tidy wisdom threatens complexity but doesn’t undercut the earned final act.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clear anchors builds under an accumulative/textural lens to a resonant reconfiguration: Maya recasts her survival and purpose, paying a cost by giving up the coral. Causality is coherent—child’s request → translation → collaborative art → charged gifting—without outliney “and then” beats. Closure lands on the page with felt price and a clear before/after. No orientation debt; reflective shards stay tethered to present action.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The misted atrium, misters, glass twilight, and the coral as tactile micro-setting are vivid and purpose-driven, charging the final image. The environment reads through Maya’s professional and personal filters (reef, neural pathways) and supports tone without museum-touring. The cast becomes a lived canvas, integrating setting with action. Though the atrium doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, it meaningfully frames and amplifies the ritual of making/translation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning/purpose from trauma—tightens as the translation act becomes communal and culminates in the irreversible gift of the coral. Pressure coheres through the child’s need and Maya’s pain/guilt, with the bridge-and-phrase serving as the turn that reweights options. The price is visible (relinquishing a talisman, enduring pain), though the conflict remains quiet by design. No false resolution; the ending accepts ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of translation, endurance, and communal art emerge organically via concrete acts and recurring images (coral, butterflies, mist), and the final image reweights the premise. Subtext is active in the drawings-as-language and the collaborative cast. A few lines verge on thesis (“communication transcends language…”; the explicit redefinition of her survival) softening ambiguity. Despite that, the piece largely resists moralizing with a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stable close third with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm match an educated translator under morphine, and dialogue feels natural with clean subtext. The voice modulates gracefully from observational lyric to intimate confession without head-hopping. Sensory selection reads character-specific rather than generic. No helpful-narrator over-explaining despite the reflective elements.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery (neural pathways, branching routes); rhythm varies and scaffolding is minimal. A handful of phrases flirt with purple or platitude, but clarity and propulsion remain intact. Figurative logic is consistent, and there are no loops or cadence templates. Final image lands cleanly without syntactic muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Translating smudged prayers on a cast in a misted hospital atrium, with a brain coral talisman reframed and surrendered, offers a fresh synthesis. Emotional truth arises from specific choices rather than template beats, and the collaborative art escalation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are quiet and textural rather than structural, but they pay off. Minor familiar notes don’t dominate the originality of the central mechanism.</comment>
