<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—years of frugal dedication to decode the palace—reads clear and consistent, and her choices (overlaying charts, placing and speaking the square) align with that drive. Interiority is vivid but largely single‑valence; she rarely shows contradictory impulses or fear under pressure. The sacrifice is framed as long‑term devotion rather than an on‑page dilemma, which limits felt cost in the climactic beat. Still, her competence and embodied reverence give specificity and credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens cleanly from descent to activation to awakening; the closure lands on the page as the palace lights and the covenant is sealed. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and beats link coherently (alignment → warming → second tile → resonance → final activation). The cost is mostly conceptual (lifelong austerity and attention) rather than a peak‑scene trade‑off, which slightly softens the cadence. Nevertheless, the before/after is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The palace’s architecture—gapped ceiling, phosphorescent mortar, schematic walls—shapes tactics and enables the climax; objects-as-setting (tiles, charts) charge the final image. Details are selective and expert‑filtered through an astronomer’s eye, widening into an atmospheric, credible world. World rules stay consistent and are learned via action (Mars alignment triggers warming). Sensory texture extends beyond the visual with bone‑felt resonance, deepening mood without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (complete the beacon/contact), and pressure deepens once the tile warms and the second tile unlocks, culminating in the spoken numbers. However, escalation faces little resistance; each step succeeds without cost or counterforce, so options don’t feel narrowed. The covenant’s “sacrifice” is declared rather than forced against a competing demand in scene. The result is compelling but gentle rather than testing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece weaves devotion, empiricism, and communication through number into a resonant answer: knowledge as covenant across time. Images recur with reweighted meaning (magic square, gaps, twilight/dusky harmony), and the final awakening reframes the palace as a beacon rather than a throne. Some thematic lines tip into declaration (“The covenant wasn’t with gods…”) which reduces subtextual charge. Even so, the conceptual repricing lands with a satisfying after‑thrum.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third‑person limited remains steady, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits Mara’s mind and material. Diction and rhythm modulate as pressure builds, and the observational lexicon feels plausibly hers. No head‑hopping or stance wobbles; elision is purposeful. A few abstract formulations skim toward essayistic, but not enough to dilute voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean syntax and varied rhythm; imagery does double duty for mood and mechanism. Occasional abstractions (“empirically ironic,” “uncloak itself”) skate near purple but remain legible and purposeful. Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops or figurative muddle in the climax. The final cadence is crisp and image‑led.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ancient Babylon as an architectural encryption for extraterrestrial contact via math—especially a magic square keyed to celestial ratios—feels fresh and well‑integrated. The “time as encryption” and devotion‑as‑method turns add elegance without gimmickry. While the cosmic‑contact trope is familiar, this synthesis and the tactile procedures make it memorable. Slight risk aversion in conflict keeps it shy of the boldest tier.</comment>
