<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marina’s motive—selfless guardianship—reads cleanly and drives her dawn choices, with the bell and chalk as revealing actions. Interiority is mostly inferred through gesture and image rather than deeply dramatized contradiction. Secondary figures (Okafors, Nakamuras, Chen) function as clear pressures but stay surface-level. The final renunciation (fading) feels earned and paid for, though the inner cost is implied rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The causal chain is tight: messages → shared evidence → Dr. Chen’s inference → fences down → networked immunity; the “because/therefore” links hold throughout. Orientation is immediate and sustained. Closure lands on the page with cost: Marina’s fading and the bell’s materialization reconfigure the world and her presence. The months-long montage is brisk but coherent and does not undercut the causal payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Pomona-7’s orchards and floating arches are vivid, and property lines/root systems directly shape tactics and solution. The bell, arches’ light, and red sky charge the final image with specific texture. While the arches are more atmospheric than constraining, the orchard ecology and fences materially affect choices. Detail selection is purposeful and filtered through the ghost’s custodial attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (saving orchards/community) is clear and escalates from isolation to collaboration. The key tightening is the discovery that immunity requires cross-boundary diversity, forcing fence removal and shared risk. Resistance is largely off-page, making the path feel smoother than ideal, but the turn still narrows options credibly. The cost—ceded separateness and Marina’s departure—lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interdependence and community-as-mycorrhiza emerge organically from events and images (roots, hedges, fountain). The bell’s transformation offers a resonant emblem of shared aid. However, the final chalk line explicitly states the moral, blunting subtext with overt theme-telling. Despite that, the story leaves a lingering emotional aftereffect through image rather than lecture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The third-person focus is steady and confident, with lyrical but controlled diction that suits a centuries-old caretaker. Dialogue is spare, natural, and functional. Rhythm modulates well between image and movement, with no head-hopping. The voice maintains a distinct, gentle authority that fits the ghost’s role.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean, with strong verbs, specific nouns, and images that carry multiple jobs. Figurative language is present but not overstacked, and sentences propel rather than loop. The final image is crisp and un-muddled. No noticeable syntactic monotony or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A ghost engineering communal salvation via fungal networks on an orchard planet with floating arches feels fresh and integrated. The bell’s charged reprise and the ecological-social metaphor elevate beyond template “ghost helps town” arcs. Risks are measured and coherent, though the path of cooperation lacks a thornier complication that might push it into rarer territory. Still, the synthesis feels specific and memorable.</comment>
