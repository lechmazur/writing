<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marta’s motive and competence are crystal clear and embodied in purposeful, tactile choices (rigging the pendulum, modulating languages). Interiority is present but largely single‑valence—she faces little self‑contradiction or visible cost. The “empathetically decisive” trait manifests in action, yet the arc lacks a complicating flaw or hesitation under pressure. The ending shows change around her more than within her.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound layers, elevators join, community gathers, and the final image reconfigures the town’s social fabric (RR). Orientation is immediate (tower, librarian, prairie night) and causality is clean within the lyric frame. The closure lands on the page—porch lights, shared plans, weight still swinging—though the price of change is more conceptual than felt. No unkept setups; the cuckoo weight and clock chime pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The astronomical tower, its acoustics, and the cuckoo weight are not mere backdrop; they constrain and enable tactics and charge the final image. Environmental specificity (gears aligning planets, prairie wind, corrugated “vocal cords”) is filtered through Marta’s musical sensibility. The setting’s rules stay consistent and learned by doing. The last swing of the weight meaningfully binds place to outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (revive a dying district through sound) and the pressure coheres as the choir grows and the community is drawn in. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The piece lacks a marked tightening that exacts a visible price or forecloses a live option. Still, the communal gathering by dawn reads as an earned deepening of consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of language as bridge and revoicing old structures arise organically from action and image (elevators as choirs, polyglot harmonies). However, explicit thesis statements (“Every voice matters in the choir,” “sometimes the most profound rehabilitation…”) tip into mild sermonizing, diluting subtext. The strongest resonance is imagistic—the pendulum keeping time “between earth and sky.” The final repricing is felt but somewhat over‑articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person close voice with musical diction suits Marta’s vocation and the accumulative structure. Rhythm and sentence craft support momentum without opacity; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. Occasional elevated phrases (“cosmic dance,” “borrowed starlight”) are consistent with the established texture. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the voice carries the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines are clear, purposeful, and often do double duty (worldbuilding via action). Some purple glints and motif reiterations flirt with excess but do not obscure cause or image. No scaffold loops or template cadences drag the final third; the closing image is crisp. The prose sustains propulsion through varied syntax and strong verbs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: astronomical clock acoustics + multilingual frequencies + singing grain elevators as social technology feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The cuckoo weight as communal metronome is a memorable touch that binds concept to resolution. Risk‑taking is coherent and paid off on the page. Emotional truth emerges through specific, unforced details rather than novelty alone.</comment>
