<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are clear and particular—she engineers a technical solution that encodes care—supported by tactile actions (unwinding the chain, carving plans). Her interiority carries contradiction (“elegant cruelty and kindness”), giving moral texture. The visible cost is modest but present (anonymity, manipulation, and forced collaboration). A sharper on‑page consequence or moment of doubt under pressure could elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (causal planning within an accumulative, breathing-volcano frame) holds to closure. The decisive act—carving plans, leaving the mixed‑resin note, and designing two‑operator gates—reconfigures options with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean and the single-scene arc is coherent. Stakes resolve via Charged Poise rather than a hard turn, but the cadence lands.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The amphitheater’s breathing, volcanic basin, and stone benches are vivid and POV‑filtered through a machinist-mediator. The place constrains tactics (carved plans to be discovered there; historical venue for debate) and charges the final image. The surveyor’s chain works as micro‑setting/tool entwined with lineage. Atmosphere augments theme without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused (reconciling water rights) and the pressure coheres as Mara commits to a plan that will compel collaboration. Escalation is quiet but real: resin clue → trembling recognition → irreversible inscription and anonymous note. The cost is more conceptual than visceral; no live counterforce on the page presses back. Still, the plan forecloses paths and forces a trade‑off, satisfying this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (“encrypted compassion,” power held without destroying, love masked as pragmatism) emerges from specific images and tactics. Recurring objects (chain, resin, breathing stone) deepen the moral calculus at the close. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“love must wear the mask of pragmatism”), slightly reducing subtlety. The ending’s water-as-memory image lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyric, and technically minded in a way that feels character‑specific, with controlled cadence shifts at key beats. POV is stable and modest; inference stays within plausibility. Figurative texture (“stone lungs,” “star‑drunk night”) is integrated rather than tacked on. No dialogue needed; the interior line carries subtext cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm, strong verbs, and high information density. Metaphor density is rich but coherent to the motif; minimal scaffolding or loops. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple but remain legible and purposeful. The final image recharges earlier motifs without blur.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—machinist as mediator, amphitheater-as-breathing organ, adhesive-forensics as social insight, “encrypted compassion” encoded in hydrology—is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric engineering, quiet manipulative reconciliation) cohere and heighten stakes. Key turns arise from character choice rather than gimmick. The piece avoids template beats while staying lucid.</comment>
