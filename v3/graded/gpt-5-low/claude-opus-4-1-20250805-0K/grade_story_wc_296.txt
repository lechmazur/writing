<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael’s motive (clear the bloodline and save the order) is coherent and he acts decisively under pressure. Interiority is specific (“warlike serenity,” guarded expression) but internal contradiction is light, with little felt friction beyond competence. The final stance—choosing to carry a hated legacy to save the realm—reads earned, though the emotional cost is mostly conceptual. A sharper on‑page price or a moment of doubt would deepen character complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages are clean: failed illusion → dive → garden discovery → amber cracks ice → charged return. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the meaning of dishonor inverts and reweights the war’s premise with the seed in hand. Cost is present but mostly deferred (social peril and looming execution); a concrete on‑page sacrifice would have elevated the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cursed lake, orchard vortex, and glass‑absence garden are vivid, tactile, and integrated into action. Environment constrains movement (vortex pull), reveals knowledge (mirrors of absence), and charges the final image (trees unspiral; seed pulses). World rules feel consistent and learned through discovery. The imagery is lush without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (execution in seven sunsets; survival of the groves) and the pressure tightens through the discovery and cracking of the confession. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑driven; physical or social resistance is minimal, so costs are implied rather than felt. The decisive deepening (dishonor as protection; seed’s true purpose) is strong and reconfigures options. A concrete forfeit or immediate complication at exit would heighten consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of reputation vs. salvation, truth beyond appearances, and corruption as prey cohere through motifs (mirrors that show absences, water finding a way). The final image conceptually reprices the premise without a tidy moral, though lines like “truth, like water, always found its way” verge on explicit statement. Subtext operates in the ancestor’s chosen disgrace and Kael’s guarded endurance. A touch less declarative framing would let images carry more of the weight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely held to Kael maintains control and confidence. Diction suits the mythic register without slipping into academic abstraction. Purposeful elision is paid off by concrete discoveries. Minor moments of thematic telling slightly flatten the otherwise distinct voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is elegant and image‑dense with generally clean rhythm; information density is high. A few sentences summarize realizations rather than letting images do the work, and there’s mild purple pressure at times. Still, clarity holds and the closure image is sharp. Slight pruning of declaratives would improve propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Glass trees reflecting absences, a seed that eats corruption, and the inversion of dishonor feel fresh and integrated. The reveal is earned by the established logic of misdirection and mind‑reading enemies. It’s a high‑level synthesis of mythic fantasy and ethical cost. A more idiosyncratic flaw or price for Kael would push it further into the exceptional band.</comment>
