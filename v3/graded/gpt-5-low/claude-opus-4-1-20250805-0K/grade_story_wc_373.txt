<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mae’s motive (finish her father’s work by recording the breaking of trust) is clear, embodied, and drives micro‑choices like letting the woman take the fob. The lineage pressure produces credible status shifts and a lived moral tension between belonging and betrayal. Interiority is concrete (“wool blanket soaked in seawater”), not diagnostic. The cost—exile from the market—lands as an earned endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: lineage → access → fob reveal → suspicion and ultimatum → recording until dawn → feds arrive. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the task at the price of future access, with the tide/sunrise clock framing cost. The arrests happen offstage, softening impact slightly but not breaking coherence. Lens: Hybrid leaning Situational at the end, held consistently.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The under‑pier market is tactile and specific (barnacles, dripping beams, nets), and the tide/sunrise physically and socially constrains options. Details are filtered through Mae’s priorities, and the environment charges the final image (dawn on the rotting pier; market dissolved). The watch fob functions as a micro‑setting object that shapes choice and the ending’s weight. No white‑room moments or static cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are established early and meaningfully tighten at the badge reveal; the “you have until the tide changes” ultimatum is a decisive narrowing. The cost is legible: complete the recording but lose the place and invite danger. Resolution leans smooth—the woman’s allowance and the quiet arrests reduce bruising on the page—but pressure remains coherent. Tension operates across dialogue, image, and the live clock.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “sound of trust breaking” motif integrates theme and plot, reweighted at the badge reveal and echoed by the market’s dissolution. Family versus criminal code (“truce of hush ends with family”) offers resonant ambiguity without sermonizing. The final image conceptually reprices trust and legacy through the altered weight of the fob. A single line edges toward statement, but subtext predominantly carries meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, seaworn voice with controlled rhythm; perception is selective and character‑bound. Dialogue carries subtext and power dynamics (“Tommy’s girl,” “truce of hush”), advancing plot without exposition dumps. POV distance is stable and modulates under pressure. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lean, vivid sentences do multiple jobs—setting, mood, and pressure—without padding. Figurative language is consistent and apt (sea/tide/metal), avoiding mixed metaphors. No loops or scaffold; momentum is steady into the charged final cadence. Mechanics are clean and rhythmic without monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pirate market under a rotting pier, an audio‑motive of “trust breaking,” and the watch fob as badge create a fresh synthesis. Turns feel earned by prior particulars (failed covers, bloodline play) rather than gimmickry. The quiet, procedural ending resists genre bombast while preserving stakes. Slightly familiar undercover frame is elevated by sensory and conceptual specificity.</comment>
