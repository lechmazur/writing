<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—to recover living sound from trees—drives every action and aligns with her tenderness-over-force ethic. Interiority is specific (reading stress cracks, sensing harmonies), and micro-choices (pressure, angle, which crack) reveal values under quiet pressure. However, contradictory impulses are minimal; she faces little internal resistance or risk beyond patience and fatigue. The endurance at the end (returning tomorrow, accepting the insulator’s wear) reads as earned but not costly enough for a higher band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds from hedgehog cue to the emergence of layered birdsong, culminating in a charged poise ending. Closure lands on page with a conceptual cost: the insulator accrues cracks, and the restored music remains a ghost—hard-won, partial, and fragile. Orientation and stakes are clear early; the cadence shift from silence to symphony to held hush is clean. The price isn’t catastrophic but is legible and binds future options (continued, delicate labor; finite tools).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove and the porcelain insulator are not backdrop; they constrain tactics and charge the final image. The grove’s specific history (migration strata) and the alder’s stress cracks provide both resource and rule-set, filtered through Mira’s professional perception. World rules (The Silence; trees as memory vessels) are learned by action rather than info-dumps. The environment’s quiet tone infuses each beat and materially shapes how sound is recovered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure escalates texturally as sound layers accrue and Mira must maintain tenderness to avoid “creating new silence.” The dominant stake—coaxing song without harm—tightens through her tool heating and the choice to stop at noon with the insulator newly cracked. Cost is present but modest; there’s no antagonist or reversal beyond technique discipline. Still, the deepening is coherent and culminates in a reweighted stasis.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (compassion over force, art as restitution, memory as counter-silence) arises from particulars: tool choice, touch, the grove’s scars. The ending’s ghost birdsong offers a resonant non-literal answer—restoration is partial and requires tenderness across time. No sermonizing; images do the work (etched insulator, hedgehog witness). Slightly limited by the low moral friction on the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person close is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“symphonically minded” noticing, stress patterns as score). Diction and rhythm modulate as sound accumulates; no head-hopping or register drift. Explanations remain voice-motivated (insulator’s hum history) and integrated with action. A few lofty phrases flirt with purple but remain in character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world rule, action, mood) with minimal scaffolding; cadence varies with the scene’s swell. Figurative language stays coherent to the sonic/memory motif; no significant loops or synonym churn. One or two lines edge toward ornamental but do not slow momentum. The final image is crisp and recharged by prior objects.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Releasing pre-Silence birdsong by “strumming” stress-cracked bark with a repurposed telegraph insulator is striking and integrated. The empathy-as-technique angle feels inevitable once taught, not gimmicky. The hedgehog timekeeper and object-memory reciprocity (insulator now cracked) sharpen the originality. Risks are taken in a quiet mode and pay off with clarity.</comment>
