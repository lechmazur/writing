<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kessa’s motive—to liberate the trapped orchard by turning constraint into instrument—is clear and embodied through tactile, sonic labor. Her interiority feels specific (mallet warmth, bone‑deep vibration), though contradiction is minimal; she rarely doubts or missteps. The cost is present but light (fatigue, aching muscles), limiting depth of internal conflict. Still, micro‑choices (reading clouds, adjusting rhythm) reveal a competent, focused psyche under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density of sound and pattern builds to a decisive rupture (“the world’s largest string snapping”). Orientation is clean from the outset; rules are learned through action and hold through closure. The cost is modest but legible, and the final charged poise (new coordinates/purpose) reweights the world. Causal threads (resonance → cloud shifts → whale bass → current release) feel earned within the established logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and operative: driftwood as instrument, salt‑kissed trees that shiver, blue‑hour sky as score. Environment and object constrain choices (node strikes, cloud‑reading), and the mallet charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful across sound, touch, and sight. A hairline deduction because time/weather pressure (blue hour) shapes tone more than tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and clear: break the recursive current. Escalation arrives as increased tempo/precision, environmental response (clouds, whales), and a culminating rupture. Agency drives the turn; coincidence aids but does not resolve. The on‑page price skews physical/energetic rather than a sharper loss, keeping it just shy of higher intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres: art as engineering; constraint transmuted into freedom. Recurring images (fractal spiral, resonance, clouds as notation) shift meaning at the end with a mission‑forward reconfiguration. The line “every obstacle... unplayed instrument” edges toward overt statement, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the final charged poise sustains reflection beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a distinct perceptual signature tuned to sound and pattern. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without slipping registers. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference stays within Kessa’s ken. The voice remains confident without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence music aligns with subject; images are vivid and controlled, with good propulsion through the action. Occasional lushness nears purple but largely serves clarity and momentum. Minimal scaffolding or loops; key beats are dramatized rather than summarized. The closure image is crisp and unblurred by metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating orchard as instrument, sketched resonance, cloud‑script, whale bass—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are taken in concept and language, integrated with plot pressure. Specificities (heartwood mallet, fractal tightening) avoid gimmickry. A rare, memorable angle executed with discipline.</comment>
