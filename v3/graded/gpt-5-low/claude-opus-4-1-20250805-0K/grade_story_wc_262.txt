<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vera’s motive (professional duty vs. reverence for “unused love”) is clear and coherently escalates toward her decision to take the film. Interiority is specific and embodied (cool brass, “tasting silver and salt”), with a credible overwhelm. The final choice forecloses a path—she keeps a sacred artifact, violating the job’s implicit boundaries. A touch more on the practical risk or reluctance would sharpen the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; the psychometric immersion deepens steadily to a charged final act. Orientation is clean (who/where/when within the opening), and set-ups (demolition, the film, Eleanor) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes “demolition” into a private delivery of the letters with a felt ethical cost. The quietness is intentional and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The projection booth and its objects are vivid and POV-filtered, with tactile, era-specific detail. The environment and tools (projector, film, window to the velvet seats) charge the final image and shape the choice. Sensory range and tonal cohesion are strong without museum-catalog excess. Only minor—constraints are more spiritual than physical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (honor/steward unexpressed love before demolition) is signaled early and tightens as density and specificity increase (Eleanor). The escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, fitting the lens, culminating in the theft/rescue of the film. Cost is implicit (professional breach, letting the Palace fall) but legible. A hint more friction at the decision moment could heighten pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory, unseen labor, and love’s audience emerge organically from particulars (leader tape, splice marks, reel darkness). The final image reweights the premise: private projection as delayed delivery, resisting tidy closure or sermon. Subtext operates in image and silence; no moralizing. The “incubator” conceit feels fresh and carries through.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person close POV is consistent and precise; quoted letters diversify texture without head-hopping. Diction and rhythm suit the character’s vocation and the piece’s hush. No exposition crutches; the voice modulates naturally into the ending. Minor risk of purple is managed by specificity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: high information density, varied syntax, and images that pull double duty. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and scene-anchored; no damaging loops or scaffolds. The closing cadence is clean and earned. A few metaphoric clusters brush the edge of lushness without blurring sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The psychometry of a projection booth as a repository for unsent goodbye letters feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The spatial-emotional map and “two movies at once” image elevate the premise. Risks (quiet, lyric, concept-led) pay off with clarity. The Eleanor thread grounds originality in human specificity.</comment>
