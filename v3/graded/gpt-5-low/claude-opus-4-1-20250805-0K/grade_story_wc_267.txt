<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive—staying to understand the cost of silence—drives concrete micro‑choices (keeping the bolt, noticing the worn step, handing the bolt to Elena). Embodied details (nerve tingling, frostbite) ground his interiority. Elena’s brief appearance carries credible history and visible cost (scars), though her thesis‑like line edges toward on‑the‑nose. The final stance—choosing when to offer sound—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the patterned build of silence/sound, object returns, and spatial cues culminates in a reweighted final note. Orientation is clear early, and the two‑shard frame (present with charged backstory) remains legible. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: sound offered deliberately, with the felt costs (lost voices, scars, frostbite) alive on the page. Causal threads (bolt → bench → Elena → note) cohere without strain.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, ice glaze, spiral stair’s discoloration, and carved acoustic channels aren’t postcard details; they shape perception and choice and charge the ending (the fortress “warms”). Objects operate as micro‑setting (bolt, staircase) and constrain knowledge. Weather and acoustics inform both past catastrophe and present renewal. The setting’s mood and rules hold consistently and deepen the theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—when and how to break silence—tightens through Elena’s return, the bolt transfer, and the eight o’clock performance. Escalation is quiet but decisive: recognition at the staircase, reveal of scars, invitation to the piano, then the new composition. The price is legible though primarily conceptual/relational rather than immediate jeopardy. The resolution is earned by Marcus’s endurance and Elena’s renewed risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sound versus silence is dramatized through objects, space, and choice rather than lecture, culminating in a new ethic: offering sound deliberately. Subtext hums in the staircase discoloration and the fortress’s “apology,” with the last image recasting prior events. One line from Elena edges toward thematic declaration, but the ending’s image does the true work. The aftereffect is contemplative rather than pat.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third‑person limited through Marcus is steady and credible; diction and noticing are character‑filtered (tools, cold, acoustics). Lyrical cadences are controlled and modulate with pressure, and the sparse dialogue carries subtext and action (the bolt handoff). No head‑hopping or stance drift. The voice holds confidence without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are tight, image‑rich, and carry multiple jobs (bolt as talisman/history, staircase mark as forensic and thematic). Occasional abstractions (“agreement between sound and silence”) are lucid and supported by concrete scaffolding. Rhythm varies well with no scaffold loops or template runs. The final sentences resolve by image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Silent Choir Hotel, cobalt fortress acoustics, and the bolt as a carried wound feel fresh and integrated. The discoloration clue and the fortress “apology” offer non‑obvious, specific turns. The final reconfiguration of silence into chosen music lands as an elegant synthesis. Risks are lyrical and thematic rather than structural, and they pay off.</comment>
