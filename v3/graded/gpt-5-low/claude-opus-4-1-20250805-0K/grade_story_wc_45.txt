<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Thomas’s motives—yearning for his sister and a healer’s ethos that favors transformation—are clear and embodied in micro‑choices (pocketing then returning the tooth; weaving the nest). Interiority is specific and character‑particular, with credible contradictions (skepticism evolving into forgiving awareness). The sibling dynamic carries subtle status shifts without melodrama. Slight neatness in aphoristic lines softens felt risk but not meaningfully.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the garden encounter to a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Closure lands when Thomas returns the tooth and accepts “Can’t” with warmth—an earned stasis that forecloses keeping her or the token of certainty. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks. The price is legible on the page (relinquishing the keepsake and the hope she’ll stay).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The secret garden/hedge maze is lush, selective, and purposeful as a liminal ground that enables this meeting and charges the final image. Details like jasmine out of season, the fountain handprints, and spider‑silk nest are filtered through Thomas’s healer gaze. The environment shapes options (a place “where both worlds could touch”), not just mood. Strong object‑as‑setting synergy with the tooth and tools at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—acceptance vs. clinging—tightens modestly but clearly: the Council’s disapproval, the “Mother knew?” reveal, and the refusal to stay culminate in Thomas’s relinquishment. The escalation is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens, and the cost is felt. No major reversal, but a meaningful narrowing of options occurs. Stakes remain intimate and never diffuse.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—healing as transformation rather than restoration—emerges from action and image (bones “remember,” the re‑woven nest, the garden’s impossible blooms). Subtext runs through dialogue indirection and the tooth’s reprise, resisting tidy moralizing despite a few aphoristic phrases. The ending reweights earlier material without stating a thesis. Mercy/cruelty sharing a path adds ethical texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV and stance are steady, with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature rooted in Thomas’s healer sensibility. Dialogue carries subtext (the Council, Mother) and advances the scene without exposition dumps. Register is elevated but coherent for this voice. Rhythm modulates well, especially at the final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is controlled, image‑rich, and efficient; sentences do more than one job and avoid loops. Figurative density is high but coherent and pattern‑consistent, with no mixed metaphors dulling clarity. Minor aphoristic lines edge toward prettiness but don’t stall momentum. The final line crisply reloads motifs without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Changelings and secret gardens are familiar, but the synthesis—with bone‑setting craft, a tooth as coin/talisman, and a healer’s innovation—is fresh and specific. The final trade (token for acceptance) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are tasteful and integrated rather than ornamental. The piece maintains conceptual integrity without gimmickry.</comment>
