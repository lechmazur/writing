<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—preserving vanishing knowledge—drives concrete micro-choices (decoding under cold, transcribing, deciding to teach and give away the fulgurite). Interiority is embodied through tactile rope work and weather. The cost is gentle but present (responsibility taken, relinquishing a cherished object). Limited internal contradiction keeps the arc quiet rather than pressurized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean single-scene accumulative build: decoding → transcription → decision to pass the craft forward. Closure lands as a charged poise: she commits to teaching and gifting the fulgurite, reweighting the stakes around stewardship after loss. Orientation is immediate and stable; causality is modest but coherent. The felt cost is subtle yet legible in the acceptance of duty and parting with a talisman.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harbor, fog, snow, rope, and knots are vividly filtered through Mara’s sensibility; cold fingers and hush shape tempo and attention. Recurring objects (rope, fulgurite) charge the final image. The environment doesn’t corner her into a specific binary choice, but it palpably frames patience and care. Specific maritime details (bowlines, clove hitches) ground plausibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preservation) is clear, and the second decoding sequence provides a mild deepening. Escalation is primarily textural; pressure comes from time (before dawn), cold, and inheritance responsibility rather than a hard turn. The final decision to teach narrows her options, but the price remains gentle. No true reversal, but the tightening suits the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge woven into materials and nature—emerges through rope-reading, fulgurite, and barnacle lore, culminating in the vow to transmit it. Subtext operates via fractal/rope parallels, avoiding heavy moralizing despite a few declarative lines. The ending reweights earlier images without stating a thesis. Quiet resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lucid, lyrical register that feels lived-in and patient. Rhythm modulates with the fog’s hush and the meticulous work. No head-hopping or stance wobble. A few abstract lines brush against essay, but voice control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines are clean, varied, and purposeful; imagery often does double duty (knots as language, fulgurite as nature’s script). Minor redundancy around the “secret weavers” concept edges toward exposition but doesn’t stall momentum. Technical knot terms add texture without clogging. Final sentence harmonizes motif and scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ethnographic rope-encoding, maritime lore, and fulgurite as nature’s writing is fresh and coherent. The quiet stewardship ending avoids cliché. Risks are thematic and tonal rather than structural, but they pay off. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
