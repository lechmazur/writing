<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s interiority is vivid and particular—measuring grief by grams and angles is character-specific and embodied. The paradox of being boundary-lessly trapped vs. free is dramatized through her refusal to leave and the reliance on the grotto’s constraints. Micro-choices (reaching for the burner, orienting to vertices, adding the grotto’s weight) reveal values and cost. The ending’s endurance is earned, though true contradiction-in-action could be sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and pattern alignments escalate toward the final repricing (“weight of weightlessness”). Orientation is clear early (Mara, grotto, starlight, burner) and the scene remains single-window. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with conceptual cost (choosing containment with awareness). Causality is lyric but coherent; no late rule breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and burner are not backdrop: they constrain choices (she cannot cross the threshold) and charge the final image. Starlight, vertices, oxidation, and acoustics are filtered through Mara’s fractal mindset. The environment actively shapes her method (orientation) and the stakes (containment vs. unraveling). Sensory specificity is purposeful and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres as an internal stake: maintain patterns and capture heavier “weights” vs. the cost of remaining confined. Escalation is a clear density increase: whale-bone arches calcify, the burner heats, she adds the grotto’s weight. The meaningful tightening is an inward deepening rather than a hard reversal; it still narrows options by reaffirming the prison she chooses. Stakes remain felt even if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of grief having mass, light revealing weight, and self-forged prisons emerge organically through image. The final recognition reweights prior material, but “some prisons we weave ourselves” states the thesis overtly and blunts subtext. Without that on-the-nose line, resonance would be higher. Still, the emotional aftereffect is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (angles, vertices, acoustics, mass). Rhythm modulates with pressure—the burner warming and hush parting land cleanly. Diction stays consistent with the character’s sensibility. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet largely precise; images do multiple jobs. A high figurative density risks purple but remains coherent with taught motifs (“shingled hush,” calcifying patterns). Minimal redundancy and strong propulsion for a lyric mode. The final image is clean and unblurred.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fractal weaving as mass-measure of emotion in a bronze grotto is striking and integrated. The burner as grief-weight and the method of celestial orientation feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The piece takes risks in concept and diction without losing clarity. The reconfiguration at the end is specific rather than generic mysticism.</comment>
