<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained: reclaiming a buried self from the crushing weight of prophecy. Interiority is embodied and specific (soil ache, rain scent) with credible ambivalence between oracle and gardener. Micro‑choices—following the stone’s pull, refusing to seek visions, kneeling to plant—align with that tension. The cost of renouncing default prophecy‑seeking reads on the page without melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and sensations tighten toward the decisive planting. Orientation is clean early (seer, mountain bookstore, mercury pools), and the stone’s guidance provides a coherent progression. Closure lands as a decisive act reframing the premise—she plants the future rather than reading it—carrying the cost of abandoning a practiced mode of control. The after‑image (word‑blooming plants) repays setups without mechanical over‑explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mountain‑bookstore ecology is vivid and used functionally: bark pages, shell scripts, mercury pools, and the soil chamber all shape action. The environment constrains and enables choices (blind navigation by spines, the downward path, the bookless heart of soil). Recurring objects (mercury bowl, stone, soil) charge the final image. Sensory filtering through touch over sight deepens place and character simultaneously.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering a viable self—tightens through the stone’s escalating cues and culminates in a renunciation of vision‑seeking. The meaningful turn is the shift from divination to cultivation, with an implied loss of certainty. Pressure is mostly internal but coherent, with cost legible in the pain of remembering and the surrender of her practiced power. A touch more resistance or jeopardy could heighten the squeeze, but the current arc holds.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres organically: buried talents as seeds reinterprets knowledge, memory, and home without didacticism. The stone’s nonliteral “seeds” reweight the rules of this world; the final garden of word‑leaves offers a resonant answer to how we grow futures. Subtext hums in the trade of omniscience for tending, of reading for making. The ending lingers as a conceptual repricing rather than a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close remains steady, tactile, and specific to a touch‑forward, silver‑blind seer. Rhythm modulates well from slow, sensory immersion to a charged but quiet close. Elision is purposeful, with confident inference rather than over‑explaining. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is economical and musical, with images doing multiple jobs (mercury as vision and burden; soil as home and future). Minimal scaffolding, no paraphrase loops, and clean syntax keep momentum. Metaphors are controlled and coherent, avoiding purple excess. The final sentence lands with precision and earned weight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—oracle in a mountain bookstore, mercury futures, a lost language stone that plants potential—is fresh and integral. Turns arise from prior particulars rather than late rule drops. Emotional truth (choosing to make rather than foresee) grounds the novelty. The risk of a quiet, concept‑driven ending pays off with a distinctive, memorable image.</comment>
