<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority drives credible micro‑choices (reading, etching, texting, leaving the pearl). Contradictory impulses—professional detachment versus the urge to confess—act simultaneously at the knife beat. The change (choosing connection and accepting cost) is earned by prior pressure from the etched confessions. A few lines verge on thesis‑speak, but they’re grounded by concrete acts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: reading → etching → radiance → outreach creates a tightening cadence with on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a concrete decision (calls, altered report). The pearl’s effect on the bunker adds a persistent constraint that shapes choice. No causality breaks or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crystal caves and cultivation chamber are vivid and functionally integrated; the shell and pearl charge the final image and influence her report. Environmental logic (luminosity causing fractures) plausibly affects tactics. Detail selection follows her inspector’s eye while carrying atmosphere. Minor symbolic shine risks overstatement but remains earned by action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal (armor vs. vulnerability) with a clean tightening at the knife beat and a meaningful follow‑through (texting, report, leaving the pearl). The radiance eruption functions as a pressure deepening, not a deus ex machina. Costs are legible: professional boundary crossed, emotional exposure, and foreclosing solitude as a tactic. Tension strains convincingly without needing multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Strong thematic weave—confession as alchemy from isolation to connection—emerges through concrete particulars (shell etchings, light weakening walls). The final image reweights the premise, but explicit moralizing (“the real apocalypse is the distance…”) narrows ambiguity and slightly blunts resonance. Still, the pearl’s redefinition of “structural integrity” elegantly embodies the theme. The shift feels earned and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Close third remains stable with a precise, slightly elevated lexicon suited to an inspector encountering the uncanny. Rhythm modulates effectively at pressure points (“During the heartbeat of a hesitation…”). No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Occasional aphoristic phrasing trends declarative but doesn’t undermine focalization.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and purposeful; sentences carry multiple jobs with good momentum. Minor purple glints and thesis‑leaning lines appear, but figuration stays coherent (shell spiral, radiance, dissolving walls) and supports action. No noticeable loops or scaffolding; cadence shifts align with beat intensity. Mechanics are polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—luxury doomsday bunker, confessional shell, cultivated pearl of radiance—is fresh and coherent. The “light weakens walls” inversion is a striking, non‑obvious turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks land without gimmickry, and emotional truth anchors the conceit. Small nods (Thomas Crown/crown) add texture without over‑cleverness.</comment>
