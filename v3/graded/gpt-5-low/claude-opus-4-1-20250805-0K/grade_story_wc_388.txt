<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Marcus’s investigative rigor, skepticism, and ethical quandary are clear and consistent, culminating in a choice that forecloses the splashy expose in favor of preserving the sanctuary. His internal conflict—debunking vs. protecting—plays on the page through concrete actions (digging up the diamond, seeding letters). Interiority is specific (methodical reconstruction, tactile handling of the stone) though occasionally told in thesis-like lines. The cost is credible and lived in the final beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under a Situational/Causal lens, the chain of letters → discovery → dilemma → seeded truth and reburial coheres and culminates in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending with cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the dust storm and orchard bubble enforce a tight frame. The decisive act (reburying the diamond and scattering letters) reconfigures options and pays off set-ups. Minor exposition density in the letter summaries doesn’t break causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard-in-wasteland, Geiger clicks, and dust storm form a vivid, rule-consistent environment that constrains choice and charges the final image. The stillpoint’s radius and the diamond function as micro-setting tools shaping tactics (digging, staying within protection). Sensory economy is strong and filtered through Marcus’s investigative priorities. The last image—trees untouched in their bubble—lands because the setting is meaningfully embedded.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes—expose the truth vs. preserve a sanctuary—are legible early and tighten through the accumulating letters and the physical discovery. The dust storm adds a live clock; the ethical trade-off carries a felt price (foregoing the career-defining expose and potential wider salvation). Escalation is primarily knowledge-deepening that narrows options. The resolution arises from Marcus’s agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres around flawed protection, culpable secrecy, and the ethics of truth-telling; the seeded letters as “truth scattered like seeds” is a resonant embodiment. The diamond’s flaw reweights meaning at the end without needing overt allegory. A few on-the-nose lines (“The real curse was human choice”) slightly flatten subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection beyond plot without losing specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady, close third with a controlled, observant register that suits Marcus’s profession. The voice modulates with pressure (methodical in the tent, terse at the storm) and avoids head-hopping. Occasional aphoristic phrasing leans toward summary but remains consistent with the reflective stance. No dialogue, but the narrative cadence carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean, propulsive, and image-rich without purple excess; the Geiger clicks and “crack in reality” are vivid if slightly familiar. Information density is high—letters compress large backstory efficiently—and sentences vary rhythmically. Minimal scaffolding and no notable loops; transitions are clear. The final image is crisp and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The radioactive stillpoint/diamond premise is familiar SF territory but gains freshness through the orchard testbed, ethical calculus, and the tactile method of reconstructing truth. The “seeding letters” twist is an elegant, character-specific solution. Risk-taking is measured rather than radical, but coherence and specificity elevate it. The piece feels memorable within its compact scope.</comment>
