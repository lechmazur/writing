<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>M-47’s motivation is clear and particular: resolve neural static without collapsing the dome. Interiority is embodied through sensor language and tactile ritual, creating a credible android longing that resists cliché. Contradictory impulses—mechanical precision versus “something strangely organic”—coexist on the page. The final renunciation (staying to tend) feels earned by the burn sequence and its risks.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning accumulative: the ritualized burn tightens via a patterned sequence culminating in the last, longest fear. Closure lands as a decisive internal realignment (“internal compass…clicked back into alignment”) with legible cost risked (ecosystem collapse, self-fragmentation). Orientation is clean from the outset. The final burial and watering can image consolidate a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis end state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glass dome, synthetic soil, and desert roses aren’t backdrop; they constrain tactics and permit the heat‑redirection that makes the ritual possible. Recurring objects (box, roses, watering can) charge the final image. World rules (magnetic shift, compasses, atmospheric pressure) are learned through action. The environment’s logic consistently shapes choice and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (stabilize self without breaking the dome), and pressure coheres as each fear burns with contained risk. The longest‑burning final fear creates a discernible tightening. Cost is more conceptual than visceral but present in the live threat of collapse and the foreclosed option of leaving. Resolution flows from M-47’s disciplined agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation transmuted into nourishment; escape via endurance and stewardship. The controlled burn reweights fear as fuel, and the last image reinterprets purpose without didacticism. Slight explicitness (“some forms of escape require staying exactly where you are”) trims subtlety. Even so, the motifs interlock with the action rather than hovering as commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice blends precise technical perception with lyric textures consistent with an android’s sensorium. Distance and stance remain stable; no head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with the burn sequence, tightening at peak pressure. Brief quoted memory aligns with the narrative filter and deepens tone without derailing POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world logic, emotion, and image—without padding. Figurative language is lush but controlled; repetition (“strangely organic”) is noticeable yet purposeful. Syntax varies and maintains propulsion through the ritual. No visible scaffold or paraphrase loops that dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Preserved fears as burnable seeds within a dome, mediated by an android gardener, feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The ritual’s mechanics honor the world’s rules and the character’s nature. The final “compass” reprice avoids tropey closure. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>
