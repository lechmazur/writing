<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira’s vocation and lineage give clear motive and a steady, embodied method; photographing before touching and tracing stones read as specific micro‑choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is light—she bears “legacy’s burden,” but we see little active doubt or competing impulse in the moment. The choice to leave her own notebook is earned and reveals values, though the cost remains mostly implied (solitude, duty). Strong presence, modest complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of Voss’s diary reweights the corridor, the film strip becomes a map, and extraction deepens rather than pivots. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—she adds her own record and leaves it, committing to stewardship. Cost is conceptual/emotional more than dramatized risk. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the structure is clean within a single scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: ivy‑veiled corridors, limestone absorbing voices, a choked doorway, the fireplace with half‑burned diaries. Environment gently constrains tactics (narrowed passage, delicate handling, photographing before touching) and charges the final mantle image. Sensory selection fits Mira’s acoustic bias, avoiding tourist cataloging. Not quite environment‑as‑trap, but it shapes access and tone throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Primary stake—preserve and decode the university’s memories—remains coherent, with a meaningful deepening at Voss’s diary and the hidden devices reveal. Escalation is quiet; tension accrues through density and discovery rather than risk or opposition. The final act (leaving her own notebook) forecloses a path (keeping it private) but the price is soft. Effective for this mode, if not searing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of memory, stewardship, and intergenerational obligation emerge organically from particulars (walls “dreaming,” devices hidden in stone). The final notebook entry resonates, but the explicit thesis phrasing (“The walls dream of us…”) drifts toward stated moral. Subtext exists in her solitude and in ivy as relentless archive, though some lines lean sentimental. Strong, if a touch declarative at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice carries a distinct perceptual signature—sound and vibration shape attention and diction. POV is steady and plausible in knowledge; reflective moments are anchored in action and tools. Rhythm modulates well between tactile work and lyric observation without head‑hopping. Lyrical but controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is clean, with varied sentences and high information density; images do double duty (ivy as conqueror and curtain, fire as failed erasure). Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable loops; verbs are strong and specific. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts sentimentality but doesn’t blur sense. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Corridor echo cartography” in a climate‑overgrown campus is a fresh synthesis; the acoustic‑memory conceit feels original and consistently exploited. The hidden recording devices mapped by film negatives add an inventive turn that reweights earlier details. Risk‑taking is quiet but confident; the piece commits to its premise without hedging. Only the gentle stakes prevent a higher score.</comment>
