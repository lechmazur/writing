<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive (ferrying as transformation) is clear and embodied through skilled micro-choices (speed, angle, terrace selection). His competence is vivid without lapsing into omniscience. Internal contradiction is light—he hints at a past wound but faces little pushback beyond calibrating the passenger’s distress. The passenger is legible but thin, serving as catalyst rather than a fully pressured foil.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the terraces’ shifting acoustics and Marcus’s calibrated adjustments build toward a resonant reconfiguration: the woman no longer flinches at the whistle. Orientation is strong, and each pass (Opal Arch, Mirror Gallery, Prism Crown) compounds pattern and meaning. Closure cost is modest but felt—an acceptance of sound and relinquishment of defensive rigidity. The final image reweights the premise rather than delivering a neat fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terraces are specific, sensorial, and rule-bound, shaping tactics (angle, speed, platform properties). Sound behavior is integrated into action rather than cataloged, and objects (cables, arch, galleries) inform choices. The storm glass charges the final image. Vivid economy with purposeful sensory mix, especially acoustic architecture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—guiding a distressed newcomer through weaponized silence—is clear and tightened by the terraces’ harmonic response to distress. Escalation is a controlled deepening rather than a reversal, culminating in the Prism Crown cadence shift. Prices are subtle: vulnerability and attention-labor over bravura risk. The outcome leans smooth; a sharper foreclosed option or misstep would raise the pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The thematic claim—silence as presence, not absence—emerges through concrete acoustic transformations (delayed gasp, softened whistle). One line states the thesis overtly, but the scene largely earns it via experience. The final acceptance of the whistle reprices the world’s rules with an emotional aftereffect. Complexity is moderate, avoiding sermonizing while staying accessible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close is steady and plausibly bounded by Marcus’s professional sensibility; diction and rhythm suit a lyric-textural mode. Dialogue is minimal, natural, and subtextual, advancing the core turn. The voice’s measured confidence matches a practiced operator, with controlled lyricism under pressure. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image-dense, and largely free of loops or scaffolding; sentences do multiple jobs and momentum holds. A few explanatory lines flirt with didactic clarity but don’t stall the scene. Figurative choices stay coherent within the acoustic/optic system. Cadence shifts appropriately at the Prism Crown without purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The suspended acoustic city and terrace-specific sound physics feel fresh and meaning-bearing rather than decorative. The gondola operator as empathic soundsmith reframes a familiar “healer guide” trope through concrete technique. The storm glass as micro-barometer of psychic pressure is an elegant, integrated touch. Risk-taking is controlled and coherent, landing a distinct signature.</comment>
