<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive (seventeen years of anomalies leading him here) is clear and his micro‑choices—producing the box, consenting to the woman, walking fountain to fountain—align with that drive. His internal shift from “luminous skeptic” to “realistically imaginative” lands, though the cost is mostly conceptual. The woman functions as a quiet crucible but remains enigmatic, offering limited relational pressure. Contradictory impulses are hinted, not dramatized under heat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres through ritual repetition and image density toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is on‑page—the city sings again, geese resume, Marcus revalues skepticism with cost in time and stance. Orientation is crisp from the opening (geese frozen; city; Marcus; box). The price is felt but soft, more spiritual than practical, which keeps this shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The city, its dry basins, the stained glass box, and the feather are vividly particular and integrated with action. The environment constrains tactics (moving fountain to fountain; basins “holding time”) and charges the final image (fountains singing again). Sensory choices feel voiced (temporal residue, ghost‑constellations) without tourist cataloging. Occasional lyric lushness stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unsticking the city’s memory to release the geese—is legible early and tightens once the feather is removed and the geese begin to drift. Escalation follows the accumulative lens: each fountain touch deepens pressure rather than flipping it, culminating in the first fountain’s flow and the geese’s release. Agency is present (they choose to perform the ritual), but overt cost and foreclosed alternatives remain muted. The conflict stays serene—effective for tone, less so for knife‑edge stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: skepticism and wonder as dance partners; memory as compost nourishing renewal; patience at sidereal scale. The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing, though one line (“They were composting...”) edges toward tell. Subtext breathes through the geese’s pause and the city’s hush. Resonance lingers, if gently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident; the lyrical register matches Marcus’s perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare and carries subtext (“You’re early,” without moving lips) while advancing plot. Rhythmic control is strong with varied sentence lengths and clean mechanics. Elevated diction feels motivated by the piece’s cosmological mood rather than imposed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with images doing multi‑work (“rain that remembered where it had been”; “temporal residue”). A few stacked metaphors risk purple but remain coherent and mostly non‑redundant. Momentum carries through description without scaffolding loops. Syntax varies and clarity holds at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—fountains holding time, geese snagged on history, a feather as memory key—is fresh and synthesized into a convincing myth‑logic. Turns arise from seeded elements (box as key; patience aligned to dead stars) rather than late rule drops. The risk is tonal—a quiet ritual in lieu of fireworks—which pays off in distinctiveness. Emotional truth is understated yet particular.</comment>
