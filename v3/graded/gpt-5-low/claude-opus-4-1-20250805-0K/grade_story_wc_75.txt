<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marta’s motive—rescuing fragile records under a live clock—is concrete and consistent, and her micro-choices (lens use, prioritizing initials, pressing the lens to stone) reveal values under pressure. Dread and tenderness coexist credibly, giving her interiority bite. The cost (she cannot save everything; parts visibly blur) is felt. Slightly limited internal contradiction beyond urgency keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the thaw and rosewater scent create a tightening cadence; the ice crash and the wall beginning to weep provide on‑page cost and narrowing options. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene holds coherence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: documentation-as-resistance revised into a charged, costly poise. No causality breaks or resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto city behind a waterfall actively constrains action (weeping walls, changing roar, dripping ceiling), and the emerald lens functions as micro‑setting that shapes perception and tactics. Sensory specificity (rosewater, carbon and flour dust, pigment visibility) feels POV-true and purposeful. The environment charges the final image as both resource and eroding adversary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save what can before the thaw erases it—is established early, with a meaningful escalation as scent intensifies, ice crashes, and the walls begin to blur. Agency is present in triage choices and frantic transcription. The price is unmistakable: loss on the page and acceptance of partial rescue. Slightly more tactical trade‑offs could have sharpened the turn further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of memory versus erasure, exile, and art-as-resistance arise organically through the bread initials, the opera glass, and the weeping walls. The ending’s notion that “an ending properly documented could become a beginning” edges toward explicitness, trimming the mystique. Nonetheless, the final charged poise (working through the night as the lens transforms loss into legacy) resonates. Subtext in objects carries much of the weight effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third’s perceptual signature—museum-trained eye, tactile urgency—stays consistent and modulates with pressure. Diction is controlled and specific, with rhythmic variation that supports tension without over-explaining. No head‑hopping or stance slips; inference aligns with what Marta can plausibly know. A few abstract phrasings skim the surface but don’t mar control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lean and evocative, with images doing multiple jobs (opera glass as tool and heirloom; rosewater as ominous clock). Sentences vary in rhythm; momentum sustains without looped scaffolding or figurative muddle. High-pressure beats remain clear and concrete (droplets form, blurring begins). Occasional elevated abstractions are brief and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—emerald opera lens revealing vanishing inscriptions, rosewater as a geologic omen, bread-initial alphabets as communal identity—feels fresh and inevitable once seen. The beekeeper’s prophecy and the museum guide’s lineage tie art, memory, and ecology with originality. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off cleanly. The premise would not travel unchanged to another setting without breaking its core.</comment>
