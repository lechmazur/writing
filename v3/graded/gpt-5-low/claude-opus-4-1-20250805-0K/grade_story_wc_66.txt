<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mariel’s motive—smuggling stories through music—is clear and consistently enacted, with tactile micro‑choices (dial adjustments, ink mixing) under pressure. Interiority is specific (“thistled calm”) and embodied, though internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers. Competence dominates, giving the piece poise but limiting visible struggle. The closing endurance choice reads earned, with implied risk rather than dramatized cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a pirate signal → deciphered instructions → clandestine transcription → charged departure. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing in the final carried‑scores image, with social cost implied (Ministry risk, public activation) rather than enacted. Orientation is crisp early (alcove, famine aftermath, radio task). The main shortfall is the off‑stage payoff, which slightly softens the cost on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting and tool-work are vivid and integral: the ember alcove’s warmth, mist, and radio glow shape tactics and tone, and scarcity (no electricity, candles as currency) constrains choices. The radio dial recurs to charge the final image with an “older” glow, linking environment to theme. Sensory selection fits a copyist’s eye and ear. World rules (luminous notes, dust memory) are internally consistent and taught through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeding imagination under authoritarian control—is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the pirate lyrics address Mariel directly and the signal wavers. However, escalation remains gentle; no option is starkly foreclosed, and the price (detection, harm) is implied rather than tested on the page. The piece maintains tension but doesn’t force a hard trade‑off within the scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—stories as a luminous contagion reawakened through art—emerges organically from particulars (dust as witness, notes that glow, breath as vector). The ending reweights the premise without sermonizing, offering a resonant answer: imagination survives by being smuggled and shared. Subtext rides the materials (ink, dust, radio) rather than explicit thesis. Slight earnestness is present but controlled.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a meticulous artisan under scarcity. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (signal waver vs. serene craft), with no head‑hopping and clean focalization. Lyric lines from the broadcast add texture without breaking POV modesty. No dialogue burdens; the song snippets function as purposeful indirection.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense yet purposeful; lines often do double duty (worldbuilding and theme). Minor purple tendencies surface but rarely blur sense; momentum holds. No evident loops or scaffold, and the final image crisply reprises earlier motifs. Syntax varies and supports the quiet escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: luminous notation, dust as memory repository, and insurgent pedagogy via symphonic parts. The pirate‑instruction mechanic and “secretly luminous” dust‑ink feel singular rather than template. Risk‑taking is evident yet legible; only the soft on‑page cost restrains the upper band. The concept coheres into a memorable, specific stance.</comment>
