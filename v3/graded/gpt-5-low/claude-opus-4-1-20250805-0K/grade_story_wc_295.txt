<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (to decode, to carry the burden without breaking) are coherent and enacted through specific choices—sharing the telegram, aligning the star pulse, reframing their role from prophet to witness. Internal contradiction is light; she bears strain but rarely wavers, and Hayashi applies minimal counter‑pressure. Still, her micro‑choices (pressing the flower to the brass, adding the memory card) reveal values through action. The emotional register is steady and embodied enough without therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations accrue (telegram → star pulse → temple correlation → warnings) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the decision to “carry this together” and the ritualized passing‑forward (memory card), with a conceptual cost (accepting the burden rather than a messianic release). Orientation is clean and the scene remains continuous with one cadence shift at dawn. The price is more conceptual than visceral but is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory, telescope brass, speakers, and star atlas are specific, tactile, and filtered through a working gaze; the whale‑song audio and V442 pulse are vivid. The daylily as object‑setting charges the final image and constraints (access to V442, the atlas as relay) shape choices. Tone and setting interlock without postcard cataloging. Minor reliance on familiar images (“whale song”) is outweighed by purposeful detail.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing/decoding the message—tightens as the star pattern matches dreams and “warnings” reframes the meaning. The escalation is a knowledge deepening rather than a reversal; the cost is a chosen endurance shared across generations. The turn is earned but remains gentle, with little on‑page jeopardy or loss beyond conceptual burden. Still, the communal arrival and dawn cadence provide a meaningful pressure uptick.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of witness vs prophecy, intergenerational relay, and ephemeral comprehension (daylily) recur and reweight the ending effectively. However, the explicit thesis lines (“The stars chose us as witnesses, not prophets.”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext in the final beat. The daylily’s reprise is elegant and supports a resonant afterimage. Overall, insight feels earned by particulars despite some telling.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and confident; diction fits a literate, scientifically adjacent observer with lyrical lean. Dialogue is spare and purposeful, modulating tone without exposition dumps. Rhythmic control is clean across the dawn turn. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; imagery is largely precise (telegram, brass, translucent petals) and cadence varies well. Occasional familiar metaphors (“whale song,” “weight of shared exhaustion”) slightly flatten freshness but do not impede clarity or propulsion. No looped scaffolding or filter‑verb stacks. Final line resolves with a strong image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—variable stars as intergenerational Morse through dreams, with pressed flowers as breadcrumbs—feels fresh and coherent. The risk is quiet and thematic rather than twisty, yet it lands with specificity. Emotional truth (burden shared, not solved) undergirds the conceptual novelty. A few familiar phrasings aside, the vision reads singular.</comment>
