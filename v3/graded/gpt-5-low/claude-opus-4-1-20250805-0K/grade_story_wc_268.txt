<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Syln’s motive—guarding truth over power—is clear and consistent, and her agency culminates in the decisive act of dropping the pellet. Interiority is economical but specific (ink‑making, attention to scripts), giving her a lived texture. Contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely wavers, which limits complexity. The status dynamic with the pretender is crisp but brief.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: discovery of messages → correspondence → breach attempt → confrontation → revelation. Closure lands on page with the pellet’s activation exposing deception and forcing the pretender’s flight, while Syln settles into earned stasis. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the before/after is legible. Orientation and lens (Causal) are taught early and held.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The drifting library, crystalline dome, and rune‑bound time distinctly shape options and tactics, charging both the messaging method and the climax. Details are filtered through Syln’s professional gaze (ink, shelves, records) and integrated into action. World rules remain consistent and purposeful. The environment directly constrains the breach and enables the truth reveal.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender via the library’s mechanisms—is signaled early. Escalation coheres: the messages intensify, reality shudders, the pretender arrives, and Syln forecloses his claim with a single, risky act. The price is borne mostly by the antagonist; Syln’s personal cost is understated. Still, pressure tightens in a single, effective turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of truth’s endurance versus performative power emerges through concrete particulars (ink, records, dome, “the library remembers”). The ending’s quiet return to labor reframes victory as stewardship rather than triumph. Subtext in “regalia with calculated modesty” and “nothing dies here” deepens the critique of legitimacy. No moralizing undercuts the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, elevated, and consistent with Syln’s age and vocation; the diction suits the mythic register without slipping into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext and revealing power plays. Psychic distance stays steady and apt. The narrative certainty matches Syln’s plausible knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry good rhythm and density, with purposeful imagery tied to action (“ink that spread like living shadow”). Minimal scaffold and no major loops; exposition compresses efficiently. A few high‑lyric lines skate near ornament but do not blur causality or stall momentum. Grammar and mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—diminutive titan librarian, time‑drifting archive, ink pellets as evidentiary devices—is fresh and integrated. Turns feel earned from established rules (the library as cross‑temporal repository). The risk is a quiet, concept‑driven confrontation rather than spectacle, which pays off in originality. Only the antagonist’s quick collapse trends familiar.</comment>
