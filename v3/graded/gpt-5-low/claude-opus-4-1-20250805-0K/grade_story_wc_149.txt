<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlow’s contradictory pull—“mournful elation,” loving what poisons him—reads specific and embodied, and his talisman-touching micro-choices feel character-true. The relationship crucible with the ghost bride is vivid and morally charged. However, the decisive act at climax is largely hers, limiting his agency in the release. The cost lands, but his final stance is more acceptance than choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: bead pulses → apparition escalates stakes → bead cracks → debt resolves → dawn returns; cost is the loss of magic and of her presence. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words and the single-scene structure holds. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. The 100‑year “resonant awakenings” clock tightens the beat effectively.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse and starless night are sensorially rich and filtered through Marlow’s keeper’s gaze (mercury pools, philosopher’s stone soil). The setting charges the final image—dawn lifting, fruits reverting, gold painting glass—reweighting the world’s rules. The environment is not postcard; it’s the mechanism that binds and then frees. Specific objects (the bead, resin, vines) are integral rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freedom versus binding love—is legible early, and pressure deepens with the “tonight” clock and the bead’s heartbeat. The tightening culminates in the crack that forecloses the garden’s unnatural persistence. Agency skews to the ghost bride at the peak, slightly softening the test of Marlow’s commitment. Nonetheless, the escalation reads as coherent because/therefore causality with a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Love as preservative toxin versus the grace of release is dramatized through actions, not sermonized; “lovingly venomous” pays off in both protection and consumption. The bead’s reweighting and the ordinary apples/pears embody the theme of renouncing immortality for life. The closing image invites reflection without tidy moral. Complexity persists in the ache of what’s lost and gained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely tracks Marlow’s perceptions, with controlled cadence and vivid lexicon that fits the world. Dialogue carries subtext and status—her crystalline frost against his guarded tenderness—while advancing stakes. Rhythm modulates cleanly as pressure rises. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level density is high but precise; images do multiple jobs (e.g., fruits as hearts, withering to mortal sweetness). Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing keep momentum. A touch of purple flourish appears but remains voice-consistent and legible. The final line resolves by image without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard, mercury irrigation, and debt-bound ghost bride synthesize into a fresh, specific myth. The turn—freedom as the true repayment—is inevitable in hindsight given the set patterns. Risks in diction and concept cohere without gimmickry. Only slight conventionality in the star‑crossed motif keeps it short of the rarest tier.</comment>
