<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are precise and layered—mercy for Eleanor versus accountability for Thomas—and her micro-choice to add a hidden codicil embodies that contradiction. Embodied details (walnut-stained fingers, breath steeping like tea) ground emotion. The final renunciation/acceptance (preserving the covenant while recording the erased names) reads earned with visible cost. Minor safety in phrasing avoids deeper messiness, but the internal conflict is credible and specific.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens: the scene accrues pressure through setting, research revelation, and ritual action, culminating in a closure beat that reconfigures meaning. Closure is on-page via the codicil and the handoff of the covenant/locket (a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing). Cost is legible: she chooses a truth that may stain legacy while granting mercy. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The blooming jetty and wisteria are vivid and sensorially integrated, shaping tone and charging the final image; the portable ink set as tool links environment to action. The locket’s photo of the same jetty enriches temporal layering. Setting doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, but it frames and deepens the choice beautifully. Detail selection is economical and filtered through Mara’s archivist sensibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early (Eleanor’s peace versus historical erasure), and escalation coheres as Mara reframes her role and commits to the codicil. The single tightening—mercy plus truth rather than either/or—forecloses the path of silent compliance. The price (burden of recorded names, potential reputational fallout, personal haunting) is felt. Pressure is primarily internal but sufficiently sharp for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—mercy versus truth, preservation as remembering everything—emerges through objects and acts (microscopic codicil) rather than abstract sermonizing. A couple of lines lean declarative (“She was not merely an archivist…”; final sentence crystallizes the thesis), but they’re earned by the specifics. The final image (perfume, darkness, covenant, locket) resonates beyond the scene. Subtext holds: love despite knowledge, grace despite truth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is steady, lyric yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (ink, paper, scent) that fits an archivist. Brief dialogue is natural and weighted. Diction and rhythm modulate smoothly into the charged final beat without head-hopping. No gratuitous elision; withheld facts are revealed in-step with Mara’s process.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush but largely precise; images do multiple jobs (steeping, perfume, stains) without over-saturation. Minor risk of purple in stacked modifiers is kept in check by action density (writing the codicil, the handoff). No significant loops or scaffold; cadence varies well. Closing lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist restoring a marriage covenant while inscribing a hidden ledger of the fire’s erased names is a fresh, specific angle on truth/mercy. The micro-script codicil as ethical tactic feels inventive and inevitable in hindsight. The locket/photo echo at the same jetty adds elegant temporal resonance. Risks are tasteful and integrated, not gimmicky.</comment>
