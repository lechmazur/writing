<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive—to vindicate his father and inscribe the truth before discovery—reads clear and character‑specific, with tactile micro‑choices (pressing the door, choosing testimony over confession). The interiority is vivid (“chasing hush”) and embodied through the lattice and hover. However, internal contradiction is limited; he rarely wavers, so pressure doesn’t expose competing impulses. The renaming (“True‑Tongue”) lands, but the felt personal cost at the peak remains mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece holds a Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence culminating in a Charged Poise: the testimony carved into the lattice before the boat arrives. Orientation is precise from the opening (nameless lighthouse prison, Devil’s Tooth Reef, highest cell). Causality is coherent: door → corridor → lattice → vision → testimony → awaiting discovery. The cost is implied rather than dramatized (risk, lifelong imprisonment), keeping this shy of 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is integral: the reef‑locked lighthouse, the ajar door, and the salvaged confessional all constrain options and charge the ending image. The lattice functions as a living archive and tool, not mere décor. “Copper light” and salt‑gnawed details serve mood and stakes without museum‑tour excess. The environment decisively frames the final tableau and discovery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible (clear a legacy of murder by deception before authorities arrive), and the ticking clock tightens the window. The meaningful turn is Marcus choosing testimony through the lattice, transforming a confessional into a recorder of truth. Opposition is largely ambient; no on‑page counterforce tests him beyond time and access. The cost and narrowing of options are present but soft, limiting escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of truth vs. performance and the ethics of confession accrue through action: lattice as archive, hush as pre‑truth poise, testimony carving wood. The final image reweights the premise: a prison built to hold liars becomes a reliquary of truth. A few on‑the‑nose moments (“True‑Tongue”) skim close to statement but are earned by the particulars. Resonance lingers without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Marcus with a distinct perceptual signature (salt, copper light, lattice maze). Diction remains consistent, confident, and precise; patterned imagery is taught and maintained. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates cleanly toward the closing tableau.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient, with images doing multiple jobs (lattice as map, copper light as preservative “amber”). Figurative density is high but controlled; metaphors align with the world. Minimal scaffolding and no notable loops or muddle. A touch of heightened diction skirts purple but stays legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—boy‑who‑cried‑wolf legacy fused with a lighthouse prison and a confessional lattice that stores truth—is fresh and cohesive. Hovering as “sustained impossibility” tied to being born in captivity is inventive. The revelation mechanism (lattice‑held confessions) is an elegant genre tilt. Risk‑taking is evident without obscuring clarity.</comment>
