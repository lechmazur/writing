<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear—contain a self-fulfilling prophecy—and actions consistently express skilled, ritualized competence. Interiority is textured but largely assured; the brief moment seeing “wars prevented, loves that would never bloom” gestures at conflict yet resolves without much embodied hesitation. Micro-choices (mapping pockets of quiet, catching fragments) reveal values but rarely tax them. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads credible though the cost remains mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (summoner, night brook, ritual), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern-building and a cadence shift at dawn. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she disperses the prophecy, accepting the cost of erased possibilities and chosen ignorance. Causality is clean—set pattern (mapping silence) leads to channeling the prophecy into the brook and dissolution. The cost is legible if quiet, anchored by the “trillion smaller possibilities” and the final smoothing-away image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The brook and nocturnal haven are deeply functional: mist kisses edges, murmur serves as white noise, and the water carries the prophecy to sea. Environmental specificity constrains tactics and charges the final image (paper and footprints smoothed away). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is tight and on-page: silence the prophecy before it propagates. Pressure escalates texturally—bursts of script, gathering fragments, the wing unfolding layers—culminating in the night-long channeling to the sea. The piece favors competence under strain over jeopardy, so the price feels more ethical than visceral. Still, the resistance and time passage deliver one meaningful tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around the ethics of foreknowledge, communal contagion of prophecy, and the mercy of quiet. Recurring images (silence mapped, water’s carry, smoothing-away) reweight the ending without moralizing; “some truths were kindest when allowed to remain whispers” reads as earned rather than declarative. The final image reframes prevention as both peace and loss. Ambiguity lingers productively in the futures she chooses to disperse.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person close aligns with the summoner’s austere craft; diction and rhythm are controlled without drift. Patterned elisions (“moth-thoughts and owl-dreams”) are taught and legible. No head-hopping or unjustified certainty. Modulation tightens during peak beats (luminous script bursts) without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and economical, with multi-duty sentences that advance action and atmosphere. Figurative language is rich but coherent; it rarely crowds sense and maintains physical logic (silence as mapped flows, water as carrier). Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops. A slight tendency toward lushness is tempered by precise verbs and clean sequencing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Silencing a prophecy via “mapping silence” and conscripting brook-murmur is an inventive synthesis; the crane’s moonlight wing feels distinctive, not ornamental. The moral calculus—saving the present by dissolving futures—is fresh and lived-in. Risks are taken in tone and method without obscuring clarity. The closure image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
