<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Marina’s competing impulses—to reclaim her child and to protect herself from unbearable grief—are dramatized in the dig and the final renunciation-with-allowance. Her occupation colors perception (flames bending) and motivates attention. The kept single vial is a credible, costly compromise that forecloses a path. Interiority stays embodied and specific (coffee grounds, warm wildflowers) rather than abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid lens: causal discovery guided by accumulative patterning leads to an Earned Stasis closure. Observation → cemetery → exhumation → revelation → partial reclamation is clean and motivated, with the cost explicit on the page. The final image (lanterns bending toward the whale/cemetery) reweights prior material with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; single POV and scope are tight.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: gravity pockets, salt crystal chamber, and the cemetery’s altered physics all shape reading and Marina’s options. The environment charges the choice (easy digging, floating stones, nausea), and the recurring objects (coffee grounds, lanterns, wildflowers) charge the final image. World rules are consistent and learned in action. The tone-suffused atmosphere amplifies theme without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to reclaim buried memories—tightens credibly when the coffin of vials reframes the choice with immediate, personal cost. The escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for the length. The final trade-off (keep one, rebury the rest) is a real price. Minor softness: external pressures (city destabilization) stay largely ambient rather than forcing a sharper time-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of grief, memory’s weight, and societal erasure arise organically from concrete actions, not told morals. The whale as a mass of aggregated sorrow and the salt/vial burial achieve a resonant conceptual repricing. The ending refuses neat catharsis, holding charged ambiguity with emotional honesty. Recurrences (wildflowers, bending flames, coffee patterns) reappear with transformed meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and character-filtered; diction and image system remain coherent to Marina’s sensibility. No dialogue is needed; the internal cadence modulates with discovery and decision. Purposeful elision (founders’ practice) is paid off by present action. No POV leakage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines are concise yet dense, with images doing multiple jobs (coffee grounds as divination and physics echo). Figurative language is vivid but not purple; rhythm varies and carries momentum. A brief explanatory pass about the founders verges expository but remains anchored in the present and fuels the choice. Mechanics are clean and the final sentence lands with image, not summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: gravity pockets, salt crystal memory coffins, a lantern lighter reading coffee grounds, and a whale drawn by grief’s mass cohere into a fresh, inevitable-feeling whole. Risks (quiet, conceptual closure) pay off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth undergirds the novelty. The particulars feel singular rather than templated.</comment>
