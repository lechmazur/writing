<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kira’s motives (curiosity → decoding the site’s message) are clear and her choices drive discovery; embodied reactions (the gasp, the tactile pull) land. Internal contradiction is light—she shifts from skepticism to acceptance smoothly, with little friction. The pilgrim adds gentle pressure but never truly tests Kira. The closing reorientation feels earned but not costly in character terms.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid lens leaning accumulative: observational density (light, thermal trails) links to actions (pulling stones, placing matrices) that culminate in a CR—the repricing of “belonging.” Orientation is clean early; cause/effect holds. The closure’s cost is conceptual (foreclosing the quest for a single place), felt but soft. The sequence tightens once (pattern → hunt → chord), satisfying scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The observatory at dusk materially shapes options—the pattern appears only in that light; walls encode trails legible via thermal sensors; the dome projects at the end. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kira’s professional gaze. Tools and environment integrate with action rather than stall it. The final image is charged by place and light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode/understand the message) is coherent, but pressure is gentle; puzzles yield without setbacks or trade-offs. The tightening is present (discovering the anomaly → sourcing matrices → completing the chord) yet lacks a felt price beyond effort. Agency is active but unopposed. Stakes remain largely conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of belonging and cosmic resonance emerge through images (tiles as type, star trails, tonal chord), but are undercut by explicit thesis statements (“proving we belong…,” “belonging wasn’t about…”). The pilgrim’s didactic lines reduce subtext in the final beats. Still, the frequency image carries legitimate resonance and reweights earlier particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and confident; diction suits a precise, lyrical observer. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and advances plot, if a bit declarative. Rhythm varies with discovery and lands a clean final cadence. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and economical; images like “brilliant dimness” and “grinding whisper” carry weight without clutter. Minor purple tendencies and occasional abstraction in the finale don’t impede clarity. Information density is high; sentences do multiple jobs. Line rhythm supports momentum through the hunt and softens for the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The fusion of movable type matrices with star maps and thermal “star trails” feels fresh and specific. The belonging-as-frequency turn is conceptually intriguing, if slightly familiar in articulation. The observatory-as-press conceit ties craft, science, and cosmology in an elegant synthesis. Risk is taken in the lyrical-accumulative approach and largely pays off.</comment>
