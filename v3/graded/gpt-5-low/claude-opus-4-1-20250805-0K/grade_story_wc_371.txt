<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila’s motive—attention as vocation—reads coherent and culminates in a believable reorientation from “cursed awareness” to “ministry.” Interiority is specific (moths writing messages; bread as compass) and choices follow her bias to notice and tend. Internal conflict is gentle rather than contested; the cost of the new calling is implied more than dramatized. The elderly woman exerts light relational pressure that clarifies, rather than tests, Lila’s stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of anomalies tightens into entry (door), encounter (tea house), and reweighting (absolution via attention) with a clear CR/Earned Stasis close. Orientation is brisk and clean; the bread trail causally links discovery to recognition. The cost—ongoing tending as condition for the tea house’s persistence—is present but soft, keeping the closure strong but short of exceptional. The throughline remains single‑POV and single‑scene with one intentional transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The courtyard/tea house ecology is vividly selective and POV‑filtered (jasmine, thornrose hedge, paper screens with southbound birds, “future rain” tea). Setting shapes options: the hedge hides the entrance; the tea house exists only because of Lila’s gardens; its survival depends on tending. Recurring object (bread) charges the final image and anchors place. Sensory balance and rule‑teaching of the magical realism are deft.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accrues via a pattern break (bread → door → spirit reveal) that reweights the stake from curiosity to responsibility. The deepening is clear but low‑friction—no counterforce challenges her choice beyond implied commitment. The decisive turn is the bread “uncloaking” and the condition that the tea house remains only if tended. Stakes are meaningful yet contemplative, not adversarial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme—absolution through attention, the sacred in the ordinary—emerges from concrete acts (illegal gardens, bread‑memories) and culminates in a resonant final image. One line flirts with didacticism (“The sacred hides in ordinary things”), but context as character dialogue tempers it. The conceptual repricing (“absence is just presence wearing disguise”) reweights prior images without over‑explaining. Emotional aftertaste feels earned, not saccharine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyrical without drift, and plausibly housed in Lila’s perception style; diction like “heuristic kindness” feels character‑specific rather than imported. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and carries subtextual pressure. Psychic distance stays steady with clean free‑indirect moves. Rhythm modulates well at the reveal and close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level is tight and economical; images carry multiple jobs (bread as scent, compass, memory). Figurative language is fresh and coherent; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentences vary in length and propulsion, and the final line lands with precision. Minor aphoristic moments are restrained and anchored by scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Magical realism via guerrilla gardening plus bread‑as‑memory/time feels distinctive and integrated. The “tea of future rain” and “uncloaking” loaves are fresh inflections that serve stakes. Risk is controlled and purposeful rather than ornamental. The synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight without leaning on familiar twist mechanics.</comment>
