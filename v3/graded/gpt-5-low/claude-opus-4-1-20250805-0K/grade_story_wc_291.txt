<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sarah’s methodical tactility, prosopagnosia, and portrait process create a distinct interiority and drive credible choices (easel placement, charcoal sequencing, phone call). The tension between her sensory mapping and the world of masks reads specific and embodied. Internal contradiction is lighter—she rarely struggles against her own motives—so the emotional price remains subdued. Still, her tremor before the final portrait and the cost of working without evidence ground an earned, if quiet, endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the portraits accrue into a pattern that reconfigures meaning and culminates in the targeted call to check psychiatric hospitals. Closure is a conceptual repricing with a charged poise final image (ribbon pressed in sketchbook), and the cost is the relinquishment of conventional evidence in favor of her reconstructed composite. Orientation is clean early; causality is coherent through “therefore” beats (ribbon → insight → call). The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it short of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist, stone, and carved steps are tactile, and the charcoals operate as a micro‑setting filtered through a portraitist’s priorities. Environment contributes to discovery (the ribbon) and charges the closing image as the mist lifts. Sensory detail is judicious and character‑specific, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting pressures mood and method more than options, but it’s integral to tone and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding what the masks hid—tightens via the accumulating portraits and the discovery of the ribbon, culminating in a narrowed suspect profile and specific next step. Pressure builds through density rather than reversals; the key deepening is the shift from “random killings” to “reunions” to “composite killer.” The cost is largely a choice of method and empathy rather than an acute sacrifice, but the path is earned and coherent. One decisive tightening (the call) anchors resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of duality, fragmentation, and the peril of forced wholeness emerge through the portrait process and the composite killer insight. The ribbon and mist reprise at the end land a resonant image. Some phrasing edges toward overt thesis (“fractures that make us human, the contradictions that complete us”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance is strong and organic, if occasionally too declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The perceptual signature—texture over face, angle over feature—shapes diction and selection with consistency. Rhythm modulates well between brief tactile moves and longer reflective sentences. No head‑hopping; the brief phone line fits voice and stakes. A few abstract lines at the end brush generality, but the voice remains controlled and particular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and mostly economical; many lines do double duty with setting and theme. Minor repetition of “duality/contradiction/unity” creates a light echo of abstraction in the final third. Syntax varies, and the final images are crisp and earned. No significant artifacts or clarity issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of prosopagnosia, portrait craft as investigative method, and mask‑themed murders is fresh and coherent. The composite killer as a unity of others’ contradictions feels non‑obvious yet grounded. Quiet risk—accumulative structure and a conceptual closure—pays off without gimmickry. Slight thematic on‑the‑nose moments keep it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
