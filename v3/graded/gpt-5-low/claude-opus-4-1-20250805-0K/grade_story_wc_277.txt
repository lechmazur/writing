<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Margot’s conflicting drives—to uncover truth and to shield her empire—are dramatized through concrete micro‑choices (writing a proof, then crafting misdirection). The embodied details (nib’s shadow tracing ellipses, the “goodbye kiss to honesty”) reveal a specific psyche under pressure. Her pivot to the Tokyo lie reads as a credible, morally costly renunciation. Only slight neatness in the telegram‑proxy deduction keeps this shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: journalist’s call triggers investigation, proof by contradiction yields a new understanding, leading to a decisive misdirection. Orientation is firm from the opening, and the drive lens (Causal) holds cleanly to closure. The ending delivers Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a visible cost (“goodbye kiss to honesty,” locking the nib). No dangling threads undermine the final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory above the clouds and the brass instruments are not postcard décor; they charge the decision and the final image by yoking astronomy’s orbits to moral orbiting. The rosewood nib functions as a micro‑setting tool that frames and constrains her tactic (writing proofs, then misinformation). Sensory specificity stays POV‑true and purposeful. The final vaulting of the nib inside the observatory seals the thematic environment into closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (truth vs. legacy), and pressure coheres as her reasoning closes options from denial to exposure to strategic misdirection. The decisive act forecloses a path with cost, and dawn’s imminence tightens the clock. Internal and external stakes interlock without overreach. Minor convenience in the “proxy died in an accident” mention doesn’t blunt the escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from action and image—truth as orbital, the ethics of media power, generational secrecy—without sermonizing. The orbits motif accrues meaning, reweighted by the final refusal to “land.” The grandfather’s suppressed asteroid elegantly parallels Margot’s choice. The last image leaves a resonant, morally complex aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Margot’s perceptual biases (astronomical metaphors, print imagery). Psychic distance modulates smoothly under pressure. No head‑hopping or unjustified certainty intrudes. Occasional elevated diction fits her education and milieu.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—image, action, theme—without padding, and rhythm varies well. Figurative language is dense but coherent and tethered to the scene’s grammar (astronomy/print), avoiding muddle. Minimal scaffold; no looped restatements dull momentum. Clean mechanics and purposeful paragraphing support propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of observatory, media dynasty, and a proof‑by‑contradiction tactic feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The misdirection strategy via a third impossible story is a smart, character‑true twist. Risks (lyric density, conceptual motif) pay off without obscuring clarity. Minor familiarity in the “proxy accident” beat prevents a 9+.</comment>
