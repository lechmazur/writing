<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Magnus’s interiority is specific and embodied, filtered through tactile engagement with objects and the sea. His investigative micro‑choices (timing the beam, reading scratches) reveal motive and flaw (compulsion to witness). The reveal about the son lands as an earned emotional contradiction—grief and relief braided. A small quibble: the leap to “son” is swift but supported by object history and genetic echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single‑scene progression holds cleanly: dock inquiry → pattern recognition → temporal coordinates → identity/return. Closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: he resumes the watch reconfigured by regained memory, with felt cost. Hybrid drive leans accumulative at the end but causal links carry the investigation. No orientation debt; all anchors are clear early.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the lighthouse’s rotation literally structures the gaps and enables the decode. The opal dock/mist are not postcard—scratches become legible only under that beam. Objects as micro‑setting (boutonniere, compass, watch) charge the final image. Tone and environment fuse to constrain perception and choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering stolen memories/decoding the gesture) escalates via discovery beats (beam cadence, scratched timestamps, cache of objects). The price is internal—accepting the years lost and the son’s burden—and the piece earns that cost. Pressure is quiet but coherent; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Slight softness: external risk is low, so tension relies almost entirely on revelation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, erasure, and isolation emerge through image systems (“softly persistent” genetics; mountain bloom at sea; baptism). The boutonniere’s reweighted return reframes solitude as witnessed endurance rather than mere abandonment. Ambiguity in the last line invites reflection without moralizing. The conceptual repricing of “borrowed” as “stolen/returned” is elegant and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Magnus’s perception—syntax and diction match the sea‑worn, meticulous mind. Patterned elision (memory gaps) is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping; stance confidence stays within what Magnus can infer. Elevated language occasionally risks lushness but remains character‑coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; images do double duty (beam as both setting and logic engine). Figurative language is rich but disciplined; few redundancies and clean sequencing. Minor purple edges (“opal dock,” “moonstone colors”) are offset by specificity and momentum. The final image resolves with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: memory‑wearing as investigative method, edited recollections synced to lighthouse rotation, temporal coordinates etched in panic, and the baptismal return. The twist that the memories were Magnus’s and the stranger his son feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, quiet stakes) heighten rather than blur coherence. The piece reads singular, not templated.</comment>
