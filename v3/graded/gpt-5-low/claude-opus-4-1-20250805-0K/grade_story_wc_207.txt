<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vera’s motive (pursuit of petrichor/memory) is clear and consistently drives choices, culminating in a credible refusal to cross. Interiority is embodied (vials, mineral air, trembling fingers) and character‑specific (sensibly eccentric). The internal conflict between awe and caution surfaces at the hinge without melodrama. The cost of restraint is felt, though not deeply excavated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clean early (factory shut, cave descent, purpose), and causality holds through discovery → vision → charged choice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she foregoes the door now, leaving with a vial and a new limit. The cost is implicit (lost immediate crossing) but discernible in the charged final image. Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens remains consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The limestone cave and phosphorescent lagoon are vivid, sensory, and POV‑filtered, with professional noticing shaping detail. The environment constrains choice (silent, shimmering wall; subterranean access) and charges the final image. The compass as object‑in‑setting tightens pressure credibly. Scale and specificity are proportionate and woven into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: collect/understand versus step through. Escalation builds via the compass spinning, water rippling, and scent intensifying, culminating in a refusal choice that forecloses a path for now. The price of caution is present but relatively soft on the page. Still, the tightening is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres around thresholds where “explanations fail,” with doors/hinges/petrichor as evolving motifs. Subtext of being collected by wonder reframes agency in the final paragraph. Occasional explicit phrasing edges toward telling, slightly dulling the afterglow. Nonetheless, the closing image reweights the premise with resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person limited voice is consistent and character‑plausible, with controlled rhythm and sensory lexicon matching Vera’s vocation. No head‑hopping or stance slips; elisions are purposeful. Elevated diction feels earned by tone and situation. Modulation under pressure is deft without grandiosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry strong image density with minimal scaffolding and good rhythmic variety. A few abstract formulations (“where explanations fail”) flirt with purple but are balanced by concrete cave craft. Information moves forward without loops or clutter. Final lines land with clean cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—collecting petrichor as memory via psychometry—feels fresh and integrated, not gimmicky. The Hartley compass and “hinged awakenings” synthesize genre and lyric modes with specificity. The refusal ending aligns with the concept and avoids the obvious portal-cross. Risk is measured and pays off in coherence.</comment>
