<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear motive (open the diary through tuned silence) and embodied, character‑specific perception drive her micro‑choices. The pacifist who “fights through frequency” is distinctive, though internal contradiction is soft (little friction beyond competence and urgency). The felt shift is credible: she reprices the lock’s purpose and chooses patience/tuning over force. A touch more visible cost or doubt under pressure would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences and the communal pause builds toward the clasp’s song. Closure lands on the page with a reconfiguration (the lock as preservation, not protection) and a conceptual cost (patience and attunement over force). Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate and stable. The cost is more conceptual than dramatic, but it reads cleanly at the fireworks beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The workshop, tin roof, salvaged gear, and fireworks shape texture and outcome—the chorus of devices materially charges the climax. Detail is selective and POV‑filtered (catalog of silence) with multisensory specificity (lavender and gunpowder, static as applause). The environment actively harmonizes at the turn, not just decorating. Minor restraint on 9‑band because the setting rarely constrains options beyond tone and method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking the diary before midnight) is signaled early and tightens via time pressure and intensifying clicks. The decisive adjustment (one final decimal) is earned by prior tuning; the communal stillness deepens rather than merely coinciding. Prices are implied (months of work, choosing listening over breaking) rather than sharply dramatized in‑scene. Escalation is clean but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Resonance between silence and empathy is strong and organically tied to action; the final image (firework pause) reweights earlier motifs. However, the explicit line “The path to empathy…” and the closing explanation about “tuning into the right emotional wavelength” edge toward on‑the‑nose. Still, the thematic synthesis largely emerges from particulars (cataloged silences, ceasefire scenes) rather than sermon. The quiet ending lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric, confident voice with a distinct perceptual signature (naming silences) and steady POV distance. Rhythm modulates well at the peak (clicks → chorus → opening) without head‑hopping or over‑explaining. Diction suits the character’s sensibility and tools. No dialogue needed; the interior register remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with strong image economy; sonic motifs (“static like applause,” the clasp “sang”) are precise and earned. Figurative density is high but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Minimal scaffold or loops, and cadence supports momentum to the opening beat. A few abstract phrases (“emotional frequencies,” “theatrical sincerity”) slightly soften the edge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—resonance‑locked clasp opened by the frequency of communal anticipation, recast as empathy—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The catalog of silences as both vocation and tactic is an inventive, coherent frame. The Victorian/military/Tibetan chorus at climax is a memorable, non‑obvious turn. Bold without gimmickry.</comment>
