<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amira’s motive (grief-driven reclamation) is clear and consistently enacted through concrete tactics under pressure. Her agency steers every turn—planning the breach, adjusting frequencies, enlisting Chen, prioritizing “return” over “harness.” Internal contradiction is light; she rarely wavers, which trims psychological complexity. Still, embodied stakes (the geode’s weight/warmth; the security risk) keep her from reading schematic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Causal: the ticking cooldown, the illicit access, and the alarm’s early end tighten options; actions drive effects (scanner tuning → discovery → transmission). Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing: severed futures redefined as a reservoir redistributed to the world, with on‑page cost (security, probable suppression). A slight ease in how swiftly the scanner maps global reservoirs keeps it shy of exceptional. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory and altitude‑thinned boundary materially shape tactics and plausibility; the cooling cycle and scanner architecture constrain choices. The geode functions as charged micro‑setting/tool, evolving from relic to conduit and final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though nonvisual senses could deepen atmosphere further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—steal time from the system to access and release trapped potential—is signaled early and coherently escalates via the early alarm and impending security. The decisive turn (transmit and reframe “harness” as “return”) narrows options and risks punishment. The conflict resolves a touch smoothly, with minimal felt loss beyond exposure, but the ethical tradeoff is clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of grief transmuted into communal restitution and ethical use of power emerge through events and images (the geode’s “remembered hope”). A few lines tilt toward declarative thesis (“Energy cannot be destroyed,” “We return it”), softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material and invites reflection on what society owes the stolen futures.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is steady and credible, with a controlled blend of technical and lyrical registers that fits Amira’s self‑taught rigor and need. Dialogue advances pressure and reveals values, with clear voice separation (Chen’s caution vs. Amira’s imperative). No head‑hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lean, propulsive sentences carry information density without scaffold or loops; rhythm flexes with tension. Figurative touches (“not with light but with possibility”) are mostly apt and not overstacked. Occasional didactic phrasing lightly blunts edge but doesn’t slow momentum or obscure causality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—war‑wrought “unused potential” measurable via perturbation on a high‑altitude lab, stored in a wedding geode—feels fresh and thematically integral. The pivot from extraction to restitution reframes familiar SF stakes elegantly. Minor familiarity in “energy cannot be destroyed” rhetoric is the only ding on an otherwise distinctive vision.</comment>
