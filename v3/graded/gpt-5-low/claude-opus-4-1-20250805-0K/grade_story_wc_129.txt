<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kira’s motivation—to weave herself into the community through art—is consistent and drives action, with concrete choices (organizing the search, offering the clasped-hands sculpture) revealing character. Interiority is mostly inferred from gestures and work rather than deeply rendered contradiction. The “boldly sympathetic” trait has on‑page consequence (earning trust; the cave approach) but carries limited cost. Secondary figures add pressure lightly; conflict remains gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear causal spine: mapping the tag → spiral pattern → descent → discovery → reconfiguration of belonging. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the accumulative ritual of searching tightens coherently toward the crater’s heart. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (community reintegrates the first artist) with modest but legible cost (years of exile; Kira’s all‑consuming dedication). The chain is tidy but avoids convenience-based resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, crater lake, and waterfall cave are vivid and filtered through action; the geography (spiral path inward) constrains the search and charges the final image. Recurring objects (arbor, tag, reeds) evolve and frame choice. Sensory detail is purposeful and varied, with light interacting with materials to mirror belonging. World rules feel consistent and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging through art/community memory—is signaled early; escalation comes via the communal mapping ritual culminating in the descent. Agency is steady, but opposition is minimal and the price of “dedicating too completely” remains mostly thematic rather than dramatically tested. The turn at “the tags form a path” is effective, yet the search proceeds smoothly, softening pressure. Resolution is earned but low-friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—art as communal conversation, kinship as web, recovery of erased languages—emerges through particulars (weaving reeds through obsidian; the tag as prayer). The ending reweights the arbor from monument to mirror without moralizing, though “Every artwork is a conversation” edges toward thesis-stating. Subtext of exile and recognition hums beneath the cave scene. Resonance lingers in the collective singing and the rejoined artists at work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person with clean focalization and controlled distance; dialogue is sparse but purposeful and distinct (Tomás’s warning, Kira’s gentle assurance). Rhythm modulates well between description and action, and the diction suits the mythic-real setting. No head‑hopping or stance drift. The voice sustains luminosity without slipping into abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image-rich, and largely economical; lines often do multiple jobs (world, mood, and motion). Occasional high-register phrases flirt with purple but remain coherent and purposeful. No noticeable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Cadence supports momentum through the search and soft landing at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of communal sleuthing with a street-artist tag transposed into obsidian, a crystalline orchard, and marsh-reed sculpture feels fresh and specific. The rediscovery of the first artist reframes the monument with earned tenderness rather than twistiness. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and largely pay off. Emotional truth is steady, if the stakes feel safe.</comment>
