<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (pacifist cultivation as antidote to her father’s violence) are clear and embodied; the father’s deliberate sheathing and willingness to learn reads as a credible, if modest, change. Interiority is filtered through tactile plant work rather than abstract labels. The relationship functions as a crucible without melodrama. The cost is largely symbolic, but it lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the father’s arrival intensifies the established pattern, culminating in a charged poise ending as they plant together. Orientation is early and clean; the single-scene window is tight. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with the weapon sheathed and a joint act that reweights their opposition. The cost is subtle but legible in the relinquishment of stance in the moment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dome, desert roses, and airship residue are specific, tactile, and POV-filtered, with the environment shaping pace and conduct (no haste within “engraved quiet”). Setting details recur to charge the final image (seeds from the sandbag; recycled air; afternoon light to evening). World rules are consistent and learned through action. The dome’s enforced calm functions as a soft constraint on choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (can their opposed practices coexist) are clear, with one meaningful tightening when the father arrives early, forcing engagement in the greenhouse’s terms. The sheathing and joint planting serve as the pressure’s release valve and stance crystallization. The price is primarily internal and symbolic rather than materially narrowing options. Tension remains quiet but present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Continuity-through-chaos, pacifism as generative strength, and “engraved quiet” cohere through images and acts rather than lecture. The sandbag and roses shift meaning from relics of violence to vessels of continuity at the end. A couple of thematic lines verge on overt statement, but the closing image earns the resonance. The piece avoids false equivalence while honoring complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third centered on Mira with a distinct perceptual signature (plants leaning toward kindness, “engraved quiet”). Diction is elevated yet organic to the voice; dialogue is spare and subtextual. Rhythm modulates effectively from meditative to gently charged at the arrival and sheathing. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work—image, action, theme—with minimal scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; repetition is purposeful and not cloying. A few lines slightly near aphorism, but momentum and clarity hold. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—bounty hunter father, pacifist daughter “teaching” plants under a glass dome with “engraved quiet”—feels fresh and specific. The sandbag-as-seed-pouch is an elegant, character-rooted transformation. The quiet reconciliation avoids cliché through tactile choices. Risk is measured and coherent, if not radical.</comment>
