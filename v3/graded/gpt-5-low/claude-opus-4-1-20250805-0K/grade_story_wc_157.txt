<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivations are clear—Marcus protects the language ecosystem; Serena advances it—and choices under pressure align (he stays to jam the raid, she goes to plant). Interiority is concise but character‑specific, filtered through entomological perception. The relationship dynamic is sharp and functional, though internal contradiction is light (Marcus is mostly competent calm rather than conflicted). The closing endurance feels earned with a visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with a situational dominant lens: auditors arrive, pressure coheres, tactics escalate via insect interference, and closure lands in a charged poise as the door bursts open and Marcus accepts the cost. Because/therefore linkages are intact (auditors triangulate → he escalates interference → sends Serena to plant → faces the breach). The final image reweights options with a clear price (he draws the danger so the message can propagate). Clean orientation, single scene, and one tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is superbly integrated: insect noise masks scanners, specific species produce distinct effects, and the maintenance tunnel shapes Serena’s exit. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Marcus’s expertise, charging the final image with wing‑beat “grammar.” World rules (Cognition Tax, scanners) are learned through action. The environment directly constrains tactics and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the clandestine language operation) is signaled early and tightens when the auditors triangulate and pound on the door. Marcus’s choices escalate in coherent steps (mantises → moths → locusts), foreclosing his own safety to enable the plan. The price is legible as he faces the breach alone; the trade‑off is clean and consequential. One beat of tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of language as ecosystem and resistance as distributed, embodied practice emerges through insects/gardens rather than lecture. The final image (“Even chaos…grammar”) reweights prior particulars with resonance. A slight didactic edge (“Consciousness is not commodity”) reads on‑the‑nose but is integrated as action via planting. Subtext lives in how biology scrambles power, not just in statements.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled voice with entomological lexicon and crisp sentence rhythm under pressure. Dialogue is economical, character‑specific (Serena’s playful indirection vs. Marcus’s focused pragmatism) and advances stakes. Psychic distance is stable; no head‑hopping or register drift. Compression under stress remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are tight and purposeful; images do multiple jobs (“wing‑beats scrambled their frequencies” both world‑builds and foreshadows tactics). Minimal redundancy, varied syntax, and clean mechanics. A few high‑concept metaphors edge toward declarative theme, but they don’t blur action or causality. Momentum holds from arrival to breach.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: entomology as counter‑surveillance, gardens as language, and a Cognition Tax world render a non‑obvious resistance tactic. Turns arise from established logic (species‑specific interference; pneumatic tunnel). The final repricing of “chaos” through grammar feels earned. High originality without gimmickry.</comment>
