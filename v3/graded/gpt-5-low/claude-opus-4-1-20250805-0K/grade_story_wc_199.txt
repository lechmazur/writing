<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motive line is clear and character‑particular: a meticulous sorter who chooses curiosity over protocol, then embraces an inherited interpretive gift. The “report it vs. build monuments” tension appears but resolves quickly with limited on‑page struggle. Embodied emotion is vivid (tingling fingertips, moss fractals), and her altered priorities register credibly by the end. The cost of change (foreclosing her old role) is implied rather than deeply felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details stack (seeds’ songs, moonstone ring, leaves’ letters) until a reconfiguration—Mira accepts the keeper role and the speck dissolves into her. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene coherence is maintained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (identity shift and duty), though the cost remains gentle. The beat where she prods the speck cleanly tightens the meaning cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Ashen Skyborne Arbor is richly specific and filtered through vocation: humming seeds, upward‑falling leaves, bark whisper. Environment charges the ending—moss overtakes ash, transforming palette and signaling new stewardship. Setting informs action (sorting, monuments, leaf‑reading) rather than sitting as postcard. Minor restraint: the place rarely constrains options tactically, but it saturates stakes and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to accept the awakening and interpret the coming choice—coheres and deepens through the moonstone prod and leaf convergence. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but does tighten: from odd speck to readable warnings to acceptance/teaching. The visible price is soft; no path is dramatically foreclosed on the page beyond her former status quo. Still, the key turn is clearly driven by her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of inheritance, memory, and dialogue between earth and sky emerge organically through repeated particulars (seeds as syllables, monuments, letters in veins). The final image reweights prior material: mossy delight as both joy and burden of stewardship. A few explicit statements (“This was her inheritance, her burden, her mossy delight”) edge toward telling, but do not eclipse the earned resonance. Ambiguity (warning or promise) lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (occupational noticing, mythic inflections). Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure and stay character‑plausible without head‑hopping. No dialogue, but the narrative line carries subtext cleanly. Occasional heightened phrasing skirts purple but maintains control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density and varied rhythm; images earn their keep (bell made of starlight; gravity’s rebellious children). Limited redundancy and minimal scaffold; momentum persists despite lyricism. Minor overrichness in stacked modifiers near the end slightly blurs edge pressure. Mechanics are clean and sequencing clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: skyborne arbor, seeds that sing, moonstone dust as catalyst, and “mossy delight” as tonal thesis. Turns arise from established particulars (the prod, monuments) rather than late rule drops. The conceptual world feels singular and lived‑in, with myth folded into craft. Slight safety in the low‑conflict resolution prevents a higher band.</comment>
