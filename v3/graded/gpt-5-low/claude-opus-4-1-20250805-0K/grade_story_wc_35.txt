<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Miran’s motives are clear and particular—she arrives to blunt her own rough memories and discovers a heavier communal burden—culminating in a costly, character‑driven choice. Interiority is embodied via gustatory memory and tactile contagion, not label‑speak. The on‑page fork (walk away vs. subsume) reveals values and risk tolerance. A slight safety in competence remains—the struggle is intense but never in doubt—but it’s still compelling at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (chef, desert fortress, first rain), and pressure coheres toward a decisive act. Closure lands with cost: “scouring her from inside,” time dilation while “swallowing centuries,” and the final acceptance‑meal plan reweights the world. The price persists in the final image (she carries “the digested grief of ages”), satisfying RR with tangible consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The rain‑woken fortress and tidal pools are integral tools, not wallpaper—the pools enable memory transfer, the geometry cues the recipe spiral, and the final image (stars reflected “without sorrow”) is setting‑charged. Environmental logic is consistent and tactile. The coral pavilion underpins history and stakes while shaping the method of action. Vivid sensory specificity stays purpose‑driven.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: whether to bear the fortress’s stored remorse. Pressure tightens from discovery → choice → full contact with escalating cost (“like a sandstorm”). The resolution is a self‑sacrificial endurance that forecloses the walk‑away path and alters tomorrow’s options. Slightly linear but clean and felt at this scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through deeds and images: culinary memory becomes communal atonement; regret metabolized into acceptance. The final promise to cook a feast of transformed memories offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Recurring images (tidal pools, coral, recipe spiral) shift meaning at the end. Complexity remains (poisoned wells, fallen garrison) without tidy absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (taste‑as‑memory) holds steady. Diction and cadence modulate under pressure without head‑hopping. Elevated metaphors are consistent with the POV’s sensibility and vocation. No dialogue needed; voice sustains scene and escalation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet mostly precise, with few redundancies and strong verb‑driven lines. Figurative language clusters at peaks but stays coherent to the ocean/desert/cooking nexus. Occasional familiar phrasing (“brittle on the surface, flexible at the core”) is outweighed by fresh images. Rhythm supports momentum through the choice and aftermath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—culinary synesthesia, desert rain revealing a coral archive of remorse, subsumption as alchemy—is striking and inevitable in hindsight once the recipe spiral appears. Risks (lyric density, mythic register) heighten stakes without blurring clarity. Key turns arise from established rules and character agency. The final reconfiguration feels singular and memorable.</comment>
