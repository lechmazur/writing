<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elsa’s motives are clear and rooted in character: a reticent, competent skipper drawn by coded trust and concern. Interiority is embodied (cold tower breath, sea glass warmth) and consistent with her quiet disposition. The acceptance of guardianship lands, though the internal conflict resolves a touch neatly, with minimal friction. The relationship with Jonas functions as a crucible but avoids melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strong causal chain: letters → arrival → stone message → haunted reveal → choice → lamp rekindled. Closure is on-page with a Decisive Change (the light reignites and role passes) and a felt conceptual cost (choosing a life of charged solitude). Orientation is crisp early; the single-scene arc maintains coherence. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible at the end’s charged poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse, rocks, stairs, and lantern room are vividly specific and filtered through a seafarer’s eye. The sea glass functions as object-as-setting, charging tactile beats and the final transformation. The haunted room’s rules (“responds to intention, not oil”) integrate world and choice. Environment subtly constrains options (dead lamp, treacherous approach) without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring light/protecting both sailors and trapped keepers—is clear early and tightens as Elsa moves from shore to gallery to lamp. The meaningful turn is her decision to take the role and activate the lamp via intention. Pressure is steady, if gentle; obstacles are internal and atmospheric rather than antagonistic. The price is acceptance of enduring solitude refigured as purpose.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of loneliness transmuted into guardianship and “bottled safety” emerge organically from stones, sea glass, and the communal haunt. The final image (stone message: “I am here…”) reweights prior motifs with earned tenderness. Some phrasing states the thesis a bit directly (“These weren’t weaknesses but gifts”), slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled close-third voice with maritime sensibility and lyric restraint; diction and rhythm fit the character. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and advances turns without exposition bloat. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates gently higher at the climax without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean and propulsive with purposeful imagery (“dead eye,” “breathing stairs,” “captured moonlight”). Minimal redundancy; sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere + action). A few near-ornamental abstractions approach purple but stay anchored by tactile detail. Final lines achieve image-driven resolution without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Familiar lighthouse/ghost terrain is renewed through the stone-language system, intention-powered lamp, and sea glass as “bottled safety.” The anonymous letters’ communal authorship is a fresh, character-grounded turn. Emotional truth feels specific rather than templated. Not radical, but confidently synthesized and memorable.</comment>
