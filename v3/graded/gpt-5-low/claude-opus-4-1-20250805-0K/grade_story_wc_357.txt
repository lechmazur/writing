<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kessa’s goal is clear and her competence reads credibly; choosing the tighter spiral and anchoring through the Inversion align with her vocation. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the epiphany arrives with little on‑page struggle. Emotional texture leans explanatory rather than embodied at the peak beats. The final stance shift feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: search → choice of route → echo‑charged grove → Inversion test → monument activation → knowledge shift. Closure lands via a decisive act (inserting the tip) and a conceptual repricing of “resilience.” The hour clock and Inversion pay off in‑scene without confusion. Cost is mostly conceptual, with a slight deus‑ex feel to the monument download limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Verdance’s upward rivers, “whirling silence,” and floating arches are vivid and integrated into choice and pressure. The Inversion and magnetic anchors materially constrain tactics, and the arrow‑monument functions as charged micro‑setting. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the environment directly charges the final image. World rules are shown, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and time pressure is established, but escalation is gentle: obstacles are navigated smoothly and resistance is low. The single tightening beat is the Inversion, which the protagonist has prepped for, so cost never bites. Resolution hinges on discovery plus activation rather than a pressured trade‑off. Tension is present but never acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of resilience as “ignoring” or dancing with change coheres with upward water and time‑scattered echoes. Yet the ending articulates its thesis directly (“adaptation meant not fighting change”), reducing subtext. The arrow‑seeds as technology‑teaching‑organics is a fresh thematic bridge. Resonance lingers, but the moral is a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature (“whirling silence,” upward flows) and controlled lyric cadence. Diction suits an experienced pilot’s sensibility without head‑hopping. Expository patches are concise and voice‑filtered. Rhythm flexes appropriately around the Inversion beat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is clean, varied, and purposeful; images carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, and pressure). Figurative density is high but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Some telling phrases (“The phenomenon was known but never explained,” “The knowledge flooded through her”) slightly flatten momentum at peak moments. Overall propulsion holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of upward hydrology, time‑echo acoustics, and gravity‑agnostic botany feels fresh and internally coherent. The arrow‑seed tech as resilience pedagogy is an inventive turn that reads inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken through sensory logic (sound that spirals, water that climbs) without gimmickry. Slight convenience in the revelation keeps it shy of exceptional.</comment>
