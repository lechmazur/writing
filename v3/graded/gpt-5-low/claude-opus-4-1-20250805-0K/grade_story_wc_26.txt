<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is clear and sustained: to understand the shadow and decide what to preserve. Her agency is concrete (activating the interface, placing the stone, choosing to tend shadows), and the embodied “luminous regret” lands. Internal contradiction is mild—there’s little friction beyond grief and duty—but it suits the length. Secondary pressure (colleagues’ dismissal) remains off‑page, limiting crucible intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern recognition → activation → metamorphosis → repricing of purpose. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost—she assumes a generational duty, accepting the waiting darkness. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the river stone and interface keep causality tidy. The on‑page shift into the grandmother’s dream provides the decisive tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The blooming library, bio‑glass petals, and eternal dusk are vivid and purposeful; the environment enables the interface and charges the final image. The river stone functions as micro‑setting and returns with reweighted meaning in the last line. World rules are learned through action (dream‑sharing) with no dumpy exposition. Setting actively shapes tactics and theme, justifying a high score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around proving the shadow’s reality and what to do with it; escalation arrives via the shadow’s metamorphosis and the forced immersion into the dream. Agency is present (she initiates the sync and later the archival decision), and the choice forecloses a narrower, purely “dream-only” archive. Costs are primarily emotional and vocational rather than risky, keeping the intensity below peak. Still, the single decisive deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of intergenerational stewardship, the materiality of hope, and the ethics of preservation arise from concrete images (stone, shadow, glass petals). The final resolve—tending the spaces between hope and reality—reweights the premise without a literal moral. A few lines veer close to thesis‑statement (“hope itself could metamorphose”), trimming subtlety. Overall resonance lingers through image rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (prismatic light, humming walls, dusk). POV remains clean and consistent; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm varies well through intensification and release. Diction matches the character and world, avoiding register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density with images doing multiple jobs. Figurative language supports sense rather than swamping it; minimal redundancy. A few repeated adjectives (“softly deliberate,” “blooming”) flirt with patterning but stay purposeful. Sentences propel toward the metamorphosis and the charged final image without slack.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of an unbound shadow collecting hope, a river stone as anchor, and a blooming library above clouds feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule changes. The conceptual risk—treating shadow as archive and hope as a preservable shape—pays off cleanly. Emotional specificity keeps it from becoming a mere conceit.</comment>
