<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motive and competence under pressure (“finding the stress points where it wanted to yield”) ground her actions. However, internal contradiction is minimal and the path to success feels emotionally unruffled, limiting depth. The joints “protesting” hint at cost but do not meaningfully complicate choice. Character reads specific and lived-in, if a touch serene for the stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: her mapping → ritual → extraction → bloom softens the beings and reweights the system. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the cave’s music integrates silence, with a modest felt cost (effort, vigilance, and a changed map). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. The solve arrives without a concrete setback, keeping cost from landing harder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting and objects actively constrain tactics: harmonic caves, frozen pool, and echo chamber stone shape how she listens, locates stress, and extracts. The environment’s rules are learned through action, and the final image is charged by the bloom transforming the cave’s acoustics. Vivid multi-sensory specificity supports theme without museum-touring. Slight idealization of space undercuts grit, but integration is excellent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving harmonic balance against overwhelming frequencies—is clear and coherently pressured. The escalation is chiefly a deepening of density and pattern, with one decisive intensification at the extraction. Minimal resistance from the beings and low on-page price keep tension from cresting higher. Resolution is earned but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silence as active, shaping force emerges through particulars (crack-reading, stillness pocket, bloom) and the final reweighting of “harmony.” A few lines verge on thesis-statement (“true harmony required both crescendo and diminuendo”) blunting subtext. Nonetheless, the closing image recontextualizes the premise with lingering resonance. Insight feels earned by concrete labor and observation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice aligned to a pattern-reading mind; diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful. Focalization stays tight and plausible, with sensory bias toward sound and texture. Modulation at the end is measured and fitting. No dialogue needed; the voice does the carrying.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clean, image-driven lines with good syntactic variety and momentum; key metaphors are coherent and apt. Minor tendencies toward explanatory summary in the final paragraphs soften edge and pace. Repetition is purposeful rather than looped, and technical phrasing (“stress points,” “architecture”) is voice-true. The last assertions could trust image more, but line craft is strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of geologic reading, acoustics, and energy beings feels fresh; “bloom of hush” is an original, lived concept. The extraction tactic through stress lines, not force, smartly enacts theme. The solve is calm rather than risky, slightly tamping audacity. Still, the synthesis is memorable and coherent.</comment>
