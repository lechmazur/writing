<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Maya’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a truthful embalmer executing a dishonest father’s last con-adjacent restitution, making micro-choices under pressure (continuing prep, opening the pot, threading the needle). Her honesty actively shifts Wei from vengeance to negotiation, and her final renunciation (give pot and money; bury what’s left) lands with real cost. Emotions are embodied via tactile prep details rather than labels. Wei’s arc is legible and earned without collapsing into stereotype.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Situational with causal linkage (breach → confrontation → negotiated handoff). Orientation is quick and clean; the scene coheres and culminates in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she relinquishes objects and accepts the cost of burial and moral accounting. The envelope/records pay off set-ups without over-explaining, and the ashes-in-ink twist reweights the premise. Minor reliance on stated philosophy (“mathematics of a fair trade”) keeps it just shy of exemplary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prep room is tactile and integral: tools, fluids, and procedures constrain pace and choices, and the body-as-setting charges the moral calculus. The ink pot functions as a micro-setting object that transforms the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (chemical-sweet air, foundation on hollow cheeks) and filtered through an embalmer’s eye. The environment consistently pressures and frames the negotiation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reparation and rightful ownership—is signaled early and tightened when Maya reveals the ashes and the envelope, forcing a trade weighted by cost. Escalation is a deepening rather than big reversal, consistent with the lens, and Wei’s stance crystallizes under the pressure of unexpected honesty. The price (relinquishing legacy objects and accepting burial) is on the page. Slight softness in external jeopardy keeps it from higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong thematic weave of debt, truth vs. deception, and bodily accounting (“cancer… keeping honest books”) culminates in a resonant final calculus. The ink/ashes reprice legacy and apology without didacticism in the image. A few thesis-forward lines (“Death couldn't be conned,” “mathematics of a fair trade”) edge toward statement rather than emergence, tempering subtlety. Overall, subtext carries in gesture and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>POV is steady, with a confident, precise perceptual signature fitting an embalmer’s mind. Dialogue feels natural, advancing stakes with subtext (Wei’s fury dissolving; negotiation through honesty). Diction modulates with pressure without register slips, and no head-hopping occurs. Occasional aphoristic phrasing is voice-justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense with purposeful detail; images earn their keep (“chemical-sweet air,” “heavier now with truth”). Minimal redundancy; sentences do multiple jobs and propel. A few aphorisms flirt with overstatement but don’t dull momentum. Mechanics are polished; the closing line lands with clarity and charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fusion of embalming praxis, restitution math, and ashes-as-ink offers a fresh, integrated angle on legacy and repair. The waiting-in-the-prep-room confrontation reframes revenge through an unusual ethical ritual. Risks (philosophic motif, object-centered closure) pay off cleanly. The piece avoids template beats and feels particular to these characters and this setting.</comment>
