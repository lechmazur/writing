<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation and embodied reactions (“trembling hands,” time‑pressure to photograph) ground Vera. Internal contradiction is light—she’s largely assured rather than torn—so the change reads more as confirmation than a costly pivot. Still, micro‑choices (angling the prism, deciding to document) align with her drive and reveal character under pressure. The final endurance—staking reputation on proof—lands credibly but with limited felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single scene, clean orientation, and a coherent accumulative build from observation → communion → frost‑lexicon → documentation. Closure is a conceptual repricing: mind/matter boundary reframed with on‑page evidence captured before warmth erases it. The cost is modest (time pressure and reputational stakes rather than an acute sacrifice) but legible within this lens. Causality holds without contrivance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and lifting mist shape mood and impose a real clock—the frost will melt—charging the final image and tactics. Sensory details (humming pillars, “crystallized breath”) feel purposeful and filtered through Vera’s mystic‑empirical gaze. The micro‑setting (prism on the altar) functions as an object‑as‑setting constraint. Atmosphere supports theme without tipping into mere symbolism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early (gain proof), with a clear tightening when frost appears and the sun threatens to erase the evidence. Escalation is primarily textural/knowledge deepening rather than a hard trade‑off; the main choice is to document quickly, not to sacrifice. Pressure remains coherent; cost is present but muted. A slightly sharper dilemma would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonant images (“emotional wavelengths,” frost as lexicon) carry the theme of porous mind/matter well. The final reprise (“truthful lies…simply truth”) coheres, but explicit claims about rewriting textbooks edge toward telling. The piece invites reflection, though it leans a bit declarative in the last third. Subtext operates strongest in the frost‑language metaphor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, lyrical register suited to a mystic scientist; rhythm modulates as pressure rises. Diction stays coherent and character‑plausible, with clean focalization and no head‑hopping. Occasional high‑register assertions feel slightly expository but do not break voice. Overall, distinct perceptual signature with good cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, with vivid imagery and mostly efficient sentences; momentum is maintained. A few purple patches and paraphrase tendencies (reiterating the theory and its implications) lightly burden the final paragraph. Figurative language remains coherent (frost‑as‑language) without mixed metaphors. Minor trims could heighten sharpness at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emotion‑imprint premise is familiar, but the frost‑lexicon manifestation within a quartz arbor feels fresh and well synthesized. The shift from private mysticism to visible, documentable phenomenon is an elegant turn. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off. A bolder cost or counter‑pressure would push ingenuity higher.</comment>
