<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marcus’s interiority is specific and embodied (heartbeat counting, chilled breath, porcelain shard as anchor), and his motive evolves credibly from correcting an “error” to accepting and using the ghost. The technique he learned “through weeks of failure” grounds competence with earned struggle. The internal contradiction (wanting restoration vs embracing evolution) becomes legible and resolves in a costly acceptance. A few lines verge on neat epiphany but are supported by on‑page process.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the density builds via heartbeat counts, radio clearing, ink patterns, and code cascade, culminating in a conceptual repricing of life/death with a charged final image. Orientation is clear early (observatory, snow, monitors) and held. Closure lands as a stance shift to coexistence and a forward plan (“Tomorrow, he would begin teaching others”), with conceptual cost (foregoing singular identity). The price is more thematic than concrete but legible in the before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The observatory, snow, and galaxy wheel infuse atmosphere and mirror internal states without feeling pasted on; the porcelain shard and ink function as micro‑setting tools that shape action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (whisper of snow, green glow, cold breath). Spatial and rule consistency hold, and the setting charges the ending image. While constraint is more poetic than tactical, the environment’s specifics are integral.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (identity reclamation vs evolution) is signaled early and tightens as Marcus initiates the risky ink‑bridge and engages the ghost. The major deepening arrives with the defragmentation and the realization that the ghost is not a bug but a path. The choice to accept dual existence (and plan to teach others) reads earned under the accumulative pressure. The cost is implied rather than viscerally dramatized, slightly softening the edge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: identity beyond bureaucratic documentation, wisdom fetched from failure, and coexistence across flesh/data. Recurring images (heartbeat, snow, porcelain, spiral/galaxy) reweight in the final cadence and avoid tidy moralizing. Two explicit thesis lines (“The ghost wasn’t an error… It was an evolution.”) edge toward stating the theme, trimming some subtlety. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third voice is steady, lyrical without drift, and modulates with pressure (heartbeat tempo, breath in cold, code as snowfall). Diction and rhythm feel controlled and character‑bound; no head‑hopping or stance slippage. The single line of dialogue is minimal and apt. Elision around “technique” is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with clean syntax and vivid but restrained imagery; the snow/code/ink motif avoids mixed metaphors. Repetition of heartbeat counts is a purposeful pattern, not dead weight. Minor on‑the‑nose declaratives slightly flatten peak lyricism but do not harm momentum or clarity. Mechanics are clean and sequencing is coherent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—bureaucratic death birthing a digital ghost contacted via ink‑geometry in a snow‑silenced observatory—is fresh and memorable. The ink‑bridge method and heartbeat metric personalize familiar cyber‑ghost ideas. The final repricing feels inevitable from seeded particulars. It takes a bold, cohesive risk without gimmickry.</comment>
