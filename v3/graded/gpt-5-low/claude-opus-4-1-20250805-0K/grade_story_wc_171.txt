<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—transmuted vengeance into “operatively gentle” strategy—drives precise on‑page choices (breaking ritual, centering the clipboard, reframing justice). Interiority is concrete and embodied through object handling and history. The cost is credible (risking protocol and pride), though the internal contradiction could tighten once more under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Situational lens holds: the ritual alignment and mustering press a stance crystallization, culminating in a Charged Poise/RR—“first crack” and the clipboard’s new light. Orientation is clean and the before/after is legible with a conceptual cost (relinquishing hero narratives). Closure is strong but not fully decisive, keeping it just short of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The terrace, twin suns, and memory‑glass clipboard integrate setting with action and meaning; the environment and ritual window shape tactics and the final image. Specificity is vivid, tactile, and filtered through Mara’s priorities. The clipboard functions as micro‑setting that charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (puncturing inherited hatred) is clear; escalation arrives via protocol subversion and the delegates’ tactile recognition—an effective deepening. The price is felt (pride, justice frames destabilized) though consequences remain conceptual. Tension runs through image and ritual rather than hard reversal, but it tightens coherently.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—price of redemption vs. vengeance—emerges through concrete choices and the evolving clipboard image (red to in‑between). A few lines verge on thesis, but they’re earned by scene pressure. The final image reweights prior material without neat moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm fit the ceremonial context. Dialogue carries subtext and pressure (Theren bones “sing,” justice vs. vengeance exchange). No head‑hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors; cadence varies to match beats. Minimal redundancy and no figurative muddle at the peak. A touch of elevated diction edges toward overt statement in two lines, but momentum and clarity hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Alien negotiation framed through a ritual object that archives failures feels fresh; the suns’ “kiss” and the clipboard’s reweighted light synthesize concept and image. Risks (lyric mode, quiet closure) pay off without obscuring coherence. The premise transforms familiar tropes through specific, consequential particulars.</comment>
