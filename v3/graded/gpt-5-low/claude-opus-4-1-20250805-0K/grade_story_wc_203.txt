<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s motives are clear and continuous—fixer’s intuition fused with a compulsion to attend to the dead—and his careful, tool‑true micro‑choices (dust reading, prying, climbing) reveal a precise hierarchy of values. Interiority stays embodied and specific (cables “singing,” the mainspring warming) without therapy‑speak. The guilt‑sunk ghost refracts his own burden, giving a subtle relational crucible without dialogue heaviness. The only softness: cost is mostly conceptual, not biting him on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: failure → apparition → dust analysis → floorboard → journal → ceiling cache → revaluation of grandmother → decision to go public. Orientation is tight from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: ghosts release their vigil and Marcus commits to exposure, reweighted by the mainspring’s promise. The cost is implied (taking on a dangerous corruption machine) rather than dramatized, keeping this just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The abandoned circus office is tactically active: dust and architecture dictate search logic, the ceiling cavity yields the evidence, and the fluorescent’s failure gates the ghost’s appearance. Detail selection is POV‑true (tool names, inspection records) and carries tone. The mainspring barrel functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image. Environment constrains choices without becoming a postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and deepens through discovery rather than confrontation: the rectangle of undisturbed dust narrows options into an active pry and then a ceiling search. Stakes—truth versus complicity—rise with the ledger and the cache, and the ghosts’ release sharpens consequence. Cost remains primarily moral and future‑facing; no immediate loss or danger tests him on the page. Still, the tightening is clear and earned under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme crystalizes through images rather than thesis: cracks between working/broken, honest darkness, “weight like air,” and the mainspring’s winding recast repair as ethical duty. The grandmother’s sabotage reframes heroism and complicity without sermon. One near‑moralizing line (“Some things were better seen in the honest darkness”) edges on explicitness but aligns with enacted imagery. The final charged poise invites reflection without tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Controlled, confident third‑person close with a distinct mechanist’s perceptual signature; diction (“mainspring barrel,” “inspection certificates”) earns authority without drift. Rhythm modulates well from quiet noticing to decisive action. Minimal dialogue is apt and subtextual. No leakage or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, world, and move—with little scaffold or repetition. Figurative language stays coherent to the mechanical/carnival palette (“cables singing,” “weight like air”). A couple familiar phrasings (“web of neglect”) are minor. The closing cadence is crisp, image-led, and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—blue‑collar psychopomp, mechanical failure as haunt‑magnet, a horological heirloom as ethical metronome—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Dust analysis as investigative method is a smart, specific turn. The conspiracy thread is familiar but reframed through tactile, non‑noir choices. Risks are measured and land cleanly.</comment>
