<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Morrow’s motive—to understand and possibly recover a form of presence in loss—is clear and consistent, and her careful, methodical temperament comes through in the mapping and placement acts. Interiority is specific (phosphorescent pigments, chip-sequence decoding) rather than generic. The internal conflict is gentle rather than pressured; doubt versus acceptance never bites hard. The final renunciation (leaving the eyes, accepting non-return) reads earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the outset (cavern orchard, satchel, mosaic), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: placing first eye → environmental charge → second eye → mathematical apparition → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: absence redefined as transformed presence, with an Earned Stasis refusal of a physical return. Cost is legible in the choice to leave the eyes and accept the altered state. The chain is coherent without and-then drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cavern orchard and chipped mosaic are vivid, sensorial, and rule-bound; the place is necessary for Elias’s state and Morrow’s method. Environmental details (dripping stalactites, bioluminescent fungi, limestone water) integrate causally with the magic and charge the final image. The setting constrains time and tactic (she works when the orchard falls silent). Specificity feels lived-in rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are singular: resolve ambiguous loss by testing Elias’s theorem. Escalation is a textural intensification (humming trees, fungi ripples) keyed to Morrow’s agency in precise placement, culminating in the voiced pattern and her reoriented question. The cost is subtle but present in accepting a non-binary return and leaving the eyes behind. Pressure remains coherent, if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of ambiguous loss and love’s persistence through transformed states are embodied in objects and setting rather than pure assertion. Subtext surfaces in the orchard's mechanics and the eyes-as-interface, and the final acceptance reweights earlier images. However, lines like “The mathematics of emotion… always balanced” veer into thesis statement, softening the afterglow. Complexity remains, but a touch of stated moral trims resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Morrow’s meticulous sensibility. Diction and rhythm modulate well with the revelation beats; no head-hopping or register slips. Minimal dialogue is purposeful and integrated into the conceit (voice arising from patterns). The prose maintains POV modesty and legibility under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet clear, with strong image economy (chips as states, humming trees, fungal calculations). Occasional abstraction loops (“mathematics of emotion,” “presence/absence”) risk overstatement but do not stall momentum. Syntax varies and supports cadence; no major figurative muddle or template runs. The closing thesisy phrasing slightly dulls the final image’s sting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—glass prosthetics as apertures for emotional calculus in a subterranean orchard—feels fresh and coherent. The reveal reframes loss without a cheap twist, growing inevitably from the setup. Risks (lyric explication of an abstract concept) largely pay off with distinct imagery and world logic. It reads as a singular vision rather than a template variation.</comment>
