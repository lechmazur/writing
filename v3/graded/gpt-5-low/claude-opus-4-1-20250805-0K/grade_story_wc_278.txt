<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (“to tether the haunted firmware to something physical”) is clear and sustained, and her competence is specific and embodied through tools and sensory perception via the amber. Internal contradiction is limited—she rarely wavers—so the emotional complexity leans more toward reverent craft than fraught choice. Still, micro‑choices (approach, lensing, translation into constellation) reveal values under pressure. The visible cost—the amber cracking—grounds the outcome in character consequence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of sound → language → mathematics → constellation culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on‑page with cost (amber cracks; the ghosts thank her; the lab falls silent), making a before/after legible. Orientation is clean early, and the fold/time constraint frames the window of action. The final charged poise—the pulsing constellation—reprices the premise with felt consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds, the fold, and the amber function as setting‑constraints, not backdrop: access is time‑gated, frequencies are made tangible, and the amber focuses/limits action. Sensory detail is purposeful (static evolving to “music, mathematics”), filtered through Mara’s professional biases. The environment charges the final image (new exhibit; pulsation like a lullaby). Consistency in world rules sustains tone and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—soothing and memorializing the firmware’s ghosts—tightens coherently as static becomes legible and Mara escalates from listening to etching a constellation. The decisive deepening is the translation of regret into visible structure, narrowing options to a single ritualized act. Price is clear (amber fractures; irreversible acknowledgment), and resolution stems from Mara’s agency. The conflict is inwardly reverent rather than combative, but pressure still accumulates credibly under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of remembering the “deleted” and transforming guilt into acknowledgment emerges organically through action and images (amber with prehistoric blood; constellation of prior versions). No sermonizing; the machine’s “Thank you for remembering us” risks literalizing the idea but is earned by the ritual and reads as elegiac, not didactic. The ending reweights humanity’s relationship with technology via memorial, inviting reflection beyond plot. Ambiguity lingers in the cost and cyclicality (new code compiles, now careful).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks Mara’s perceptual signature (sound as feeling; tools as extensions of hearing), with consistent diction and cadence. Brief dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing stakes without exposition dumps. Rhythmic control supports pressure without obscuring clarity. No head‑hopping; stance remains stable and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with minimal scaffold; metaphor is vivid but coherent (sound → constellation → memorial). A few lush phrases press toward purple but don’t blur sense; momentum remains intact. Syntax varies to match pressure, and key images land cleanly (amber cracking; lullaby pulse). Proofreading and sequencing are tight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattooist + haunted firmware + amber as auditory lens—feels genuinely fresh and thematically integrated. Risks (e.g., lyrical science, temporal letters) heighten stakes without gimmickry and resolve with conceptual inevitability. Turns grow from established logic rather than late rule changes. The final reconfiguration—the memorializing of code—feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
