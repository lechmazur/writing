<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Marcus’s motive—to see deeper layers and hold contradictory truths—is clear and consistent, and his embodied handling of the rope grounds his interiority. His decisive act of returning the rope reads as an earned renunciation consistent with his poet’s ethos. The internal conflict is present (hunger for truth vs. the cost of revelation) but remains more conceptual than felt in the body at peak moments. A touch more friction at the choice point would deepen the cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story escalates through layered revelations toward a conceptual repricing at the end; the final act—replacing the rope—lands an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with moral cost (choosing witness over intervention). Orientation is clean early (Marcus, grotto, beings, rope) and the internal logic of the beings’ revelations holds. Cost is slightly soft (more implied than dramatized), keeping this shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto, clay walls, and rope are sensorially vivid and POV-filtered (“time had texture,” “walls began to sing”), and the recurring object charges the final image. The environment shapes discovery (carvings, buried evidence) and imbues options with meaning even if it doesn’t physically constrain tactics. Rules of the world (energy beings alter shadow/time perception) are consistent and learned through action. Strong micro-setting work centered on the rope elevates the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres via accumulating moral revelations that reweight Marcus’s choices; the key tightening comes as the final layer reframes guilt and reparation, prompting his renunciation. Stakes stay primarily internal, but the beings’ appetite for complexity adds a live pressure to keep going. The price—choosing to leave the rope and carry the burden of understanding—registers, though it could be edged with a sharper on‑page trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of justice vs. mercy and the inheritance of choices emerge organically through the rope’s history and the beings’ “ethical” games. However, the ending leans into explicit thesis statements (“They were the only ones…,” “The texture of time was nothing more…”) that reduce subtext. The strongest moments are image-driven (setting the rope down; starlight witnessing all layers). A lighter touch in the final paragraph would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyrical, image-forward voice matches a poet’s POV and remains consistent; diction and rhythm are controlled, with purposeful cadences under revelation. Limited dialogue is apt and functional. Occasional abstraction creeps in but is supported by concrete anchors (rope fibers, clay vibrations), keeping psychic distance steady. Overall, a distinct perceptual signature without slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly economical; images often do double duty for scene and theme. Minor tendencies toward overt aphorism and abstract intensifiers appear in the final grafs but do not cloud clarity or momentum. Sentence rhythms vary, and paragraphing breathes at turn points. No notable loops or scaffold; information density stays high.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—energy beings who feed on moral complexity recruiting a roadside poet via a charged object—is fresh and coherent. The layered time-vision with tactile “texture” feels newly particular, and the judge-brother turn reframes without gimmickry. A hint of familiar lyric moralizing tempers the peak novelty, but the core vision reads singular and confident. Strong, near‑publishable originality.</comment>
