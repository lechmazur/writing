<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lila’s motive and competence are clear, and her lie to the supervisor plus the breadcrumb choice show agency. The father–Apollo thread personalizes the quest without overexplaining. However, inner conflict is underplayed; she moves from discovery to self‑erasure with minimal on‑page hesitation or embodied cost. A touch more ambivalence or friction at the choice point would deepen credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture: patterns build to a conceptual repricing (“We’re archived”) and a decisive act (self‑archiving). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; causality is coherent. Closure lands with a felt conceptual price—she forecloses ordinary life—though the cost is more implied than dramatized. The breadcrumb return and renaming to Pattern User 8625 deliver a clean cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The archive space is tangible and character‑filtered (maintenance elevator, obsolete servers, cached strata), and it constrains action—only she can navigate these substrata. The mission patch functions as a charged object that recurs and weights the ending. World rules (ghost sessions, likes as code) are presented through action rather than dump. Sensory spread leans visual/conceptual but suits the task‑driven mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering/choosing the fate of the “missing”—tightens from anomaly to shadow network to joining. The meaningful turn is the father/frequency linkage reweighting the discovery into a personal decision. The price (self‑compression) is legible but not viscerally contested on the page. Still, pressure coheres and rises under the chosen lens without reliance on coincidence to resolve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Absence‑as‑presence and the ethics of digital persistence emerge organically from particulars (likes as code, deletion gaps, cached ghosts). The final image (“they go home”) reconfigures the premise without sermonizing. The Apollo patch mirrors legacy and inheritance, deepening the question of where memory ends and personhood begins. One on‑the‑nose line (“We’re not missing. We’re archived.”) skirts declaration but is justified as an in‑world message.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, tech‑lyric third‑person close with consistent focalization; no head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm carry momentum and pattern‑minded perception without register drift. Purposeful compression works with the investigative mode. Dialogue is minimal by design, and the narrative voice shoulders subtext effectively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lean, purposeful lines with high information density; images (ingredient coordinates, modulated static) do double duty. Few to no scaffold loops or purple stacks; metaphors align with world logic. Cadence varies to support escalation into the protocol initiation. Minor repetition around patterns is intentional and supports texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cached ghosts, likes as steganography, ingredient‑coordinates, and Apollo emergency frequency is fresh and coherent. The shadow‑archive afterlife trope is reinvigorated through specific, plausible mechanics and a personal stake. The final reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight given the seeded motifs. Risk‑taking is present without obscuring clarity.</comment>
