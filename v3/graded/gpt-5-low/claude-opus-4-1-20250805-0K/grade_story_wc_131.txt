<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Edgar’s kindly, meticulous nature is dramatized through concrete, pressure-shaped choices (the twined reading light, the hidden caches). His contradiction—self-erasure versus the hunger to connect—surfaces without tidy therapy-speak. The archivist’s single line engages a relationship dynamic that reframes his isolation. The final renunciation of total invisibility reads earned and carries emotional cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean orientation and a held Accumulative/Textural lens: outage → aid → revelation → invitation → decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: trust replaces pure anonymity, with the cost of exposure implied. Beats link causally without contrivance; there’s no soft reset. The last image (amber rectangles, tape decision) marks a before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library’s crawl spaces, pipes, grate, and dawn light constrain tactics and enable the gift-drop, charging the ending’s poise. Sensory detail (oxide sheen, dust motes, cool copper) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The environment evolves with the power’s return, altering choices and sightlines. Micro-setting (pipe chases, ventilation gap) functions as lived terrain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (visibility through trust) tightens via the outage and the archivist’s direct address. The reveal of her tape player is a meaningful deepening that reweights options. The decision to share the cache tomorrow is a stance crystallization with a felt risk. Tension is quiet but persistent, cohering under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation as shared devotion, visibility through reciprocal care, the ethics of guardianship. Recurring objects (tape, light, grate) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final choice answers the story’s question with charged ambiguity rather than verdict. Sentiment is earned through particulars, not assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The third-person close adheres to Edgar’s perceptual signature—mechanical textures, tape-era sense memory—without leakage. Diction is lyrical but disciplined; dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and catalytic. Rhythm modulates with pressure; no unearned omniscience. The “sapphire hush” line integrates tone with POV rather than authorial gloss.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is tight and economical, with images doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is fresh and controlled; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Syntax varies to maintain propulsion through a quiet scene. Final lines land by image, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—an invisible caretaker in the library’s interstices collaborating with an archivist via tape—feels distinct and inevitable in hindsight. The outage as catalyst avoids gimmickry. Objects and methods (ferromagnetic tape, pipe chases) ground the novelty. The risk-taking is quiet but specific, elevating rather than distracting.</comment>
