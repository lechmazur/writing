<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Martha’s motive—crafting a memorial that can hold braided grief—is clear and specific, and her agency (design choice, careful carving, public dedication) aligns with it. Interiority is embodied in tactile craft and the monarch cycle; “grief has grain” gives her a particular worldview. Internal contradiction is quieter—urgency vs. reverence—so the pressure doesn’t splinter her, but the cost of letting the grandfather’s voice fade lands. The final endurance/renunciation feels earned by the work done on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: months of carving, poem‑trading, and monarch build culminate in the unveiling and the grandfather’s departure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: completion triggers the loss of spectral guidance and transfers that presence into the community. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (who/where/when). The final image (poem released like butterflies) reweights prior motifs without mechanical wrap‑up.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse, granite, milkweed, and light are vivid and filtered through a carver’s eye; atmosphere deepens as dusk/migration near. The place constrains cadence (seasonal clock) and supplies concrete resources (workbench, glass, ribbon, plants). The environment charges the final image (glass “cupped hands,” wind carrying words) without postcard excess. Specificity stays purposeful and lived‑in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent: complete a memorial that truthfully holds collective grief before the migration/voice passes. Escalation is a tightening of cadence and urgency (“The migration won’t wait”) and the communal test at the unveiling; the price is relinquishing the mentor and accepting communal holding. The pressure is more deepening than reversal, but the turn at completion is clear and paid. A slightly sharper on‑page trade‑off beat could elevate further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief as communal migration emerges organically from ribbon/monarch/poem motifs and craft practice. The line “My grandfather believed grief was like butterfly migration” edges toward declarative thesis, but it’s grounded in the ritual moment and doesn’t undercut the earned imagery. The final release of words into wind reframes the premise with felt cost. Ambiguity remains humane rather than programmatic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is steady and intimate; diction is controlled, lyrical without drift. The “thundering calm” cadence matches Martha’s temperament and the craft labor. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext and instruction without overexplaining. Rhythm modulates well from meditative carving to communal ceremony to quiet coda.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑dense, and purposeful with minimal scaffold or loops; figurative language is consistent (weaving, grain, migration) and not muddled. Sentences vary, and paragraphs carry momentum across months without drag. No mechanical or cadence artifacts disrupt clarity, and the final lines land with precision. A few abstractions (“collective strength”) are supported by concrete touches and do not blunt the image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Gravestone craft inside a greenhouse braided with monarch migration and spectral mentorship feels fresh and integrated. The pandemic memorial premise risks familiarity, but the specific synthesis (loom ribbon embedded, poem tradition, seasonal clock) distinguishes it. The ending’s conceptual repricing (voice into community and wind) is earned, not clever for its own sake. Boldness is quiet but confident.</comment>
