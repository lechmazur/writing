<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivations (root-bound anchor, purposeful curiosity) are clear and embodied through tactile choices—pressing the clipping, tracing scars, touching the brightest wound. Contradictory impulses (fear vs curiosity) surface at the climax but the struggle is relatively smooth. The “anchor” acceptance reads earned, though lightly priced. More friction or a costed renunciation would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: pattern recognition → planting → maze growth → scar-reading → intersection → poised signature. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “ready to sign her name in starlight,” with a conceptual cost of becoming the anchor. Orientation is clean early; causality is coherent within the lyric logic. The cost is felt but abstract, keeping it below the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glade and its blue hour are vivid and functional—the environment responds, parts, and reveals scars, and the labyrinth physically shapes movement to the heart. Objects and setting integrate (clipping to maze to cat’s cradle of light), charging the final image. World rules are taught through action, not explained. Strong economy with sensory specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (sealing the eclipsed covenant by heeding the pattern) is signaled early and tightens as the maze proliferates. Escalation occurs through density and revelation rather than opposition; pressure grows, but resistance is minimal. The final act is a poised decision rather than a contested choice. Cost is mostly conceptual, not forcefully dramatized.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (roots, scars, eclipse) crystallize into a theme of anchoring/fidelity to place as ethical duty under temporal fracture. The final image reweights “root-bound” from flaw to necessary role without moralizing, though a line like “Someone had to be the anchor” states the insight a touch directly. The covenant as living light ties duty to communal imagination. Resonance lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lucid, lyrical register that fits Mira’s sensibility; the mirror-whisper line adds texture without breaking stance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, staying controlled. No head-hopping; inference is plausible. Slight loftiness in places, but voice coherence holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density with largely clean, musical lines; images like “cat’s cradle made of light” are precise and evocative. Occasional stacked abstractions (“intersection of dreams,” “quantum possibility”) flirt with purple but do not muddy action. Minimal redundancy and strong propulsion for a lyric piece. Final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Time-slip garden, “eclipsed covenant,” and scar-linking as epistemology feel fresh and organically fused to character. The labyrinth grown from a clipping is a striking, specific turn. The risk of high-concept lyricism pays off with clarity and a charged final image. Slightly soft cost keeps it below the very top.</comment>
