<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s warmly observant stance and small, precise actions (turning, setting, then returning the cicada) read as tactical persuasion that aligns with her vocation. Chen’s fear of foresight is specific and felt, and his shift is believable. The relationship dynamic is delicately rendered through subtext rather than declarations. Minor limitation: Mira exhibits little overt contradiction under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear single‑scene structure with strong orientation; the accumulative lens holds as images and confessions intensify toward a charged poise. Closure lands via Chen’s tacit decision signaled by the cicada exchange and the “tomorrow” line, with conceptual cost (accepting the burden of foresight). The wave/bioluminescence beat provides the key turn/deepening. Stakes stay coherent and focused without sprawl.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto, stars, tides, and bioluminescence are vivid, POV‑filtered, and evolve with the scene; the environment actively charges the final image. The wave’s arrival reconfigures the moment and catalyzes wonder precisely when needed. The jade cicada functions as object‑as‑setting, concretizing theme and shaping action. Sensory balance and specificity are exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure builds through revelation (Chen’s foresight) and the environmental surge, culminating in a meaningful stance crystallization. The dominant stake—will Chen re‑engage—is legible and resolved through Mira’s chosen mode of witness and endurance. Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than physical but is clear. Slight softness in overt foreclosing of options keeps it just short of top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Transitions/time are embodied through tidal pools, cicada, and bioluminescent “fallen stars,” with the ending reframing endings as charged pauses. Subtext operates in gesture (placing/returning the cicada) and in the environment mirroring the conversation’s stakes. One line (“Every ending is just the pause...”) edges toward thesis but is earned by prior particulars. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent close third filtered through Mira with clean modulation and no head‑hopping; inference about Chen stays within plausible access. Dialogue carries subtext and advances pressure without didacticism, and rhythmic control supports the lyric accumulation. Diction is character‑apt and avoids register drift. The voice remains distinctive under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant, image‑dense, and purposeful; most sentences do more than one job. Figurative language is varied and coherent with marine motifs; no muddled metaphors or loops. Minor risk of saturation is mitigated by clear scene advancement and rhythm changes (e.g., the wave beat). Final line lands cleanly without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tidal‑pool chronicle framed as a meditation on foresight and transition feels fresh, with the jade cicada anchoring a distinctive synthesis. The bioluminescent surge as an inflection point is memorable and non‑formulaic. Risks in quiet, accumulative design pay off with clarity. The piece commits to its premise without hedging.</comment>
