<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Margot’s motives—professional obligation versus clandestine obsession—are clean and drive concrete micro‑choices (hiding/revealing the phrasebook, overlaying the condensation). Her dry wit and observational bias read as character‑particular rather than generic. The inspector adds credible pressure and shifts her stance. The internal contradiction could show one sharper moment of cost‑tinged hesitation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with a situational spine: discovery → arrival → choice. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the condensation map pays off the earlier obsession and aligns with the inspector’s approach. Closure lands as Charged Poise with a visible price (“risk everything”) and a clear before/after to secrecy. A hair more on the concrete consequence would push it higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The outpost and frozen lake are tactile and purposive; the window condensation literally becomes a mapping tool that constrains choice. Pressure ridges, rusted desk, and the falcon’s perch integrate setting with action and theme. The final image (charts splayed, frozen lake holding secrets) is charged by place. Detail selection is disciplined and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting or revealing the discovery) tightens with the inspector’s arrival and recognition of the window pattern. The decision to share forecloses concealment and creates future risk. Stakes remain intimate but coherent; the emotional and professional costs are legible if mostly implied. A small on‑page complication or loss would intensify the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Convergence/trust/resurgence accrue through concrete images: phrasebook dog‑ears, dendritic rivulets, “herald” falcon, and the final thaw‑poise. The theme of language decoding the natural world is dramatized, not stated. The reprise of “worrying tranquility” as held breath before thaw adds resonance. No sermonizing, with room for ambiguity about institutional power versus personal allegiance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, restrained third‑person close with a distinct observational lexicon (“cataract eye,” “subtly confident precision”). Dialogue is economical and subtextual, advancing pressure. POV boundaries hold and modulation under stress is controlled. A touch more idiomatic differentiation in the inspector’s voice could heighten contrast.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is precise, image‑rich, and mostly free of scaffolding or loops; several sentences do multi‑tasking (atmosphere, character, world‑rule). Figurative language is apt and consistent with the icy milieu. Rhythm varies and carries momentum into the closing cadence. A few adjectives could be shaved, but density rarely clots.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The condensation‑as‑watershed mechanism, polyglot phrasebook as map, and “herald” falcon fuse into a fresh synthesis. The inspector‑as‑brother risks cliché but is humanized by the quiet, knowing exchange. The final charged poise feels inevitable in hindsight. Strong originality without gimmickry.</comment>
