<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Marina’s arc from skeptic to participant is clear and motivated, with concrete micro‑choices (pressing the shell to her ear, plucking/bowing the cello, agreeing to help). Interiority is specific (the humming tic, professional lens) without therapy‑speak. Claudia applies immediate relational pressure and carries distinct voice. The cost is mostly emotional and subtle, but legible in Marina relinquishing her “myth‑buster” stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discoveries compound (shell hum → cello harmonics → voices → conceptual reframing) to a Conceptual Repricing where Marina consents to preserve rather than debunk. Orientation is clean within the first lines. Closure lands on page with a felt price (joining the chorus of her own unfinished conversations). The scene stays within length/scope and maintains a single coherent window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory, telescope, and cliff are vivid and integrated, with purposeful sensory cues (salt‑green dome, papers like dying moths). The cello and shell operate as micro‑setting/tools that charge the final image and constrain action (placement of the shell at the cello’s heart). Tone and environment harmonize to support the theme. While the cliff doesn’t force a tactical choice, the space reads lived‑in and essential to mood and function.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Marina’s professional identity versus the lure of belief—tightens as the phenomena escalate and Claudia reframes the myth. The decisive deepening is Marina moving from testing to bowing to agreeing to help, a value trade‑off. Cost is present but soft (no external jeopardy), leaning on internal renunciation. Pressure remains coherent and builds toward a clear stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of regret, unrealized conversations, and the ethics of myth resonate through concrete objects and actions rather than abstraction. The final image reweights the premise: truth in the space between fact and fiction. A few on‑the‑nose articulations (“decode the universal riddle of regret”) slightly reduce subtlety. Overall subtext (Marina’s humming joining the chorus) is earned and affecting.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled yet clean, with a distinct perceptual signature (myth‑buster bias filtering details). Dialogue feels natural, presses goals, and differentiates speakers—Claudia’s “cheerfully gloomy” cadence lands. POV distance is stable and never leaks. Rhythm modulates well through discovery and climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is tight and image‑rich without purple drift; metaphors are coherent and scene‑specific (“papers rustled in the wind like dying moths”). Sentences do multi‑tasking work and avoid scaffold or loops. Pacing breathes where needed and tightens at the bowing beat. No artifacts or muddle in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “ephemeral compass” via a half‑finished cello and a painted shell is a striking, fresh synthesis. The twist from astronomy to navigations of regret feels inevitable in hindsight and grows from particulars. Emotional truth grounds the novelty. Risk‑taking is confident without obscuring clarity.</comment>
