<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena’s drive—to reconcile the atlas and her grandmother’s margins with what she sees—is clear and expressed through embodied habits (the tapping, instrument checks). The generational thread gives her interiority specificity. However, the leap from patterned shadows to “metamorphosis” reads swift and nearly unopposed, with little contradictory impulse or costed doubt on the page. The final decision to dive is motivated but not wrestled with.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, one continuous window, and an accumulative/textural build are cleanly executed. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she lowers the station to dive after re-seeing the “dead” reef as a transcribed town. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and set‑ups (atlas page, tapping) pay off. The cost is implied (risk, duty breach) rather than concretely tallied, which softens impact slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The station, glass, instruments, and reef are tactile and filtered through a scientist’s sensibility; the surfaces as instruments for rhythm are a sharp micro‑setting move. Environment constrains action: she uses the emergency console and anchoring system to change options. The reflection in the glass over the coral city elegantly charges the final image. Minor plausibility gaps about station mechanics do not impede effect at this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes—seeing death vs. transformation—are legible early, and pressure coheres as density of pattern increases to a decisive act. The meaningful tightening is her choice to descend, foreclosing pure observation for embodied risk. Still, on‑page friction is gentle; there’s little resistance or competing obligation to sharpen the price. The escalation reads more deepening than squeeze, appropriate for the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Transformation, time, and intergenerational pattern‑keeping emerge through particulars (bleached reef, torn atlas, rhythms) rather than sermon. The re‑seeing of “paths transcribed” reweights the opening and lingers. A slight tilt toward statement in “Some messages take generations to deliver” trims the afterglow. Overall, the thematic weave is coherent and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is steady, close, and textural without slipping into omniscience; the diction suits a reflective field scientist with a lyric bend. The perceptual signature (sound‑first attention, material specificity) is distinct and consistent. Rhythm modulates well toward the ending image. No dialogue, but the internal cadence carries subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines are clean, with purposeful repetition of “tapping” and “white” functioning as motif rather than loop. Sentences do more than one job, and the prose balances clarity and lyricism. There are a few near‑paraphrase moments (“wasn’t here for official data” vs. later pattern motive), but they don’t stall momentum. Figurative control largely holds, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coral‑as‑city transcription revealed through rhythmic tapping is a fresh synthesis of climate grief, memory, and perception. It feels earned by the set‑up and the grandmother’s “periodically eternal” line. The risk is aesthetic rather than structural and pays off in an image that feels new. Only the minimal on‑page cost keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
