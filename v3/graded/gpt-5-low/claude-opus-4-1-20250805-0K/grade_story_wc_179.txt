<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus’s “scheming pacifist” motive is clear and consistent, and the Magistrate undergoes a credible internal shift. However, the change occurs with little resistance, softening felt cost and minimizing contradictory impulses in scene. Vera functions as a pressure relay rather than a full character. Embodied emotion is present (the weeping, the tactile exchanges) but often abstracted by thematic diction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (causal with accumulative texture): the Magistrate’s arrival → touch with the broken box → loosening grip → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (relinquishing an identity of rage), though the price reads gentler than the setup implies. Orientation is quick and clean, and set-ups (silence, touch, box) pay off. The son’s fever is offstage, lowering pressure at the decisive beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The Soundless Sanctuary meaningfully constrains tactics (touch/intent in lieu of speech) and charges the final image via the music box. Specifics like “between heartbeats” and object memory create a unified atmosphere that serves action. World rules stay consistent and are learned through use. A touch more tactile spatial detail could have deepened immersion, but the micro‑setting carries real weight.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (father’s rage vs. son’s life), and the arrival at dawn tightens the window. The conflict resolves swiftly once touch is initiated, with minimal pushback or trade‑off on the page. The meaningful tightening exists, but the test of commitment is light. Emotional consequence lands, but a visible price in the scene is muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonance arises from the box’s broken pin and the sanctuary’s ethos, culminating in a reweighted final image. Thematic statements are occasionally didactic (“resentment is a melody... poisoning our blood”), crowding subtext. Still, the image of a different song born from acceptance gives a felt answer without tying every thread. Greater reliance on implication over thesis would lift this.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third‑person close maintains a coherent, lyrical register that matches the premise; telepathic “speech” is cleanly handled. Rhythm and diction are controlled with purposeful modulation at the climax. Minor register drift into aphorism appears under pressure but doesn’t fracture POV. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are largely clear and propulsive, with purposeful imagery and a steady cadence. Some overwriting and motif repetition (“cellular memory” iterated) edge toward thematic redundancy, and occasional platitudes dilute line‑level freshness. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Soundless Sanctuary, tactile communication, and “cellular memory” as a vehicle for pacifist strategy feel distinct. The broken music box as praxis for nonviolence is an elegant, specific synthesis. Resolution is non‑obvious yet inevitable given the rules taught. Slight sermonizing keeps it short of revelatory.</comment>
