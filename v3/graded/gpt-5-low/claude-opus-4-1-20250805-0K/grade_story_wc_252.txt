<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and embodied: survival-learned grace versus the prison of disguise, culminating in the concrete act of unbinding. Her contradictory impulses (evasion and longing) play on the page, and Torven’s “combative tenderness” adds pressure and recognition without romance. The final renunciation (leaving clothes, diving) forecloses a life with felt cost. Slight neatness to the epiphany keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning causal: scrimshaw discovery → confrontation → whale call → unbinding → island’s becoming. Orientation is clean, and closure lands with cost (abandoning a protective identity and life on the docks). The scrimshaw and whale call function as causal triggers rather than deus ex machina. One tight deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe, bioluminescent surf, and scrimshaw as charged object are vivid and purpose‑driven, not postcard. Environment constrains action (the edge, the wading, the luminous water as threshold). The final image is inseparable from place and object. A hair more tactile dock labor detail could have pushed it even higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (authenticity as access to Cetacea) tightens when the whale’s call forces a trade‑off: safety of a performed identity vs. entry to the island. The unbinding and dive are decisive choices with visible price. Pressure rises coherently, though it remains primarily internal; no external blockade tests resolve beyond the call itself.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of authenticity, pacified violence, and communal recognition are woven through images (bindings, barnacles, luminous surf) and the scrimshaw’s reweighted meaning. Subtext in Torven’s plea and the non‑romantic hand‑taking lands. A couple of explicit thesis‑like lines (“authentic souls had no need for it”) slightly overstate what the images already earn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with clean focalization; dialogue has distinct idiom and subtext (“You’re magnificent” reads as recognition, not desire). Rhythm modulates well from docks to moonlit fringe. No head‑hopping or register drift; voice carries pressure without overexplanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences are lean and purposeful, with strong verbs and charged images; repetition is minimal and functional. A couple of abstracting sentences edge toward telling, but momentum holds and the final cadence is earned. Figurative language stays coherent (barnacles, tide, fringe) without purple spill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a post‑Pacification world where a whale‑called island appears through self‑detachment, anchored by a trans revelation that is concrete and communal. The scrimshaw’s refunctioning from map to heart‑key is elegant. It’s not radically avant‑garde, but the integration is distinctive and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
