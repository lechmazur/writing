<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira’s motive and skillset are crisply established and her choices (venturing out, planting under time pressure, returning nightly) align with her identity. Interiority is textured via tactile details (trembling hands, the heat of the seed), but true internal contradiction is faint and she meets limited resistance. The “teach others” mandate at the end signals change, yet the cost of that commitment remains mostly conceptual. A stronger on‑page test of fear or compromise would deepen character pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the envelope triggers a clear because/therefore chain (message → night planting) while atmosphere densifies toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands as a reconfiguration: the haven self‑protects and Mira assumes a broader role as guardian/teacher; cost is implied responsibility and opposition to development, not explicitly paid. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres. A more concrete on‑page price at the close would push this higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the liminal brook pocket, storm‑charged air, and bioluminescent roots shape both mood and mechanics (misdirecting surveyors). Sensory selection is apt and filtered through Mira’s escape‑room mind, tying environment to her method. The space charges the final image, though the world’s altered rules arrive smoothly via observation rather than exposition. Excellent economy with no white‑room moments.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving wild negative space against development—is signaled early, and the time‑boxed planting is a meaningful tightening. Escalation is primarily accumulative (roots glow, the haven cloaks itself, community gathers) rather than confrontational; agency drives the turn but meets little pushback. The resolution derives from her stance crystallizing, not a contested trade‑off. A tangible loss or risk paid on the page would clarify cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme coheres: mystery as a preservation tactic, innovation needing negative space, and community as quiet counter‑force to monetization. Recurring images (flow, scent, geometries) deepen the idea without sterile allegory. A couple of explicit theses (“True innovation required negative space”) edge toward telling. The final charge invites reflection and lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A confident, consistent third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (puzzles, orthogonality, flow). Diction is controlled and rhythmic without lapsing into register mismatch; no head‑hopping or unwarranted certainty. Lyric modulation suits pressure beats and remains legible. If dialogue appeared, subtext could further texture voice, but its absence suits the mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, and minimal scaffolding keep momentum. The figurative load is rich but coherent and mostly earned by POV; no notable loops or template cadence. A few elevated phrasings risk purple, yet they stay within voice logic and do not blur action. Final image resolves cleanly with no syntactic clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—escape‑room logic applied to urban ecological defense via a transformed corpse flower—is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The misdirection‑as‑habitat defense is an inventive, organic extension of her craft. Risks are taken in tone and premise without gimmickry. A sharper on‑page price would add bite to the ingenuity.</comment>
