<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s curiosity and care are concrete and embodied (frost, shuddering cables, the warmth revealing ink), and her motives drive each micro‑choice. The internal contradiction is mild—there’s little friction beyond cold and caution—so the arc leans discovery over struggle. Still, the final renunciation/embrace (“she would climb again,” encrypt her own joy) is earned by prior attentiveness. No therapy‑speak or stock reactions dilute the voice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: goggles → coordinates → astrolabe → diary → repricing of Thorne’s “death” as departure. The elevator’s count creates a tight single‑scene frame with an on‑page RR/CR closure. Cost is subtle (choosing a life of continued ascent/solitude reweighted by care), but legible. Orientation is immediate and consistent; the hybrid drive leans accumulative/textural with causal payoffs and holds through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire, narrowing shaft, amber bulbs, and frost‑glass are vivid and purposeful; the environment shapes tactics (projecting coordinates on frost, warmth revealing ink). Sensory selection is biased to brass, cold, and light consistent with a cleaner’s eye and a sky‑tower. Objects as setting (goggles, astrolabe) charge the final image. A strong atmospheric spine without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure builds via the elevator’s ascent and informational reveals; the tightening is felt in the shuddering machinery and narrowing walls. Stakes are primarily internal and epistemic; external jeopardy remains low, so the cost reads as chosen solitude and responsibility rather than acute risk. The meaningful turn is clear when coordinates point behind the astrolabe and the diary reframes Thorne. Coherence never wobbles, but escalation is gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of grief transmuted into tenderness and earned attention as a key are woven through objects and action, not lecture. The line “Sorrow shared becomes joy discovered” risks explicitness, yet it’s diegetic (in Thorne’s hand) and reframed by Mira’s decoding. The ending reweights the premise with a quiet, resonant image rather than a tidy moral. Complexity is modest but honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third‑person limited is steady and texturally distinct; diction fits Mira’s station and sensibility without register slips. Lyric cadence modulates with the floor‑count rhythm and never muddies clarity. No dialogue, but the narrative voice carries subtext through selection and rhythm. Psychic distance tightens effectively at beats of discovery.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, economical, and image‑dense without purple sprawl; the floor‑count device provides propulsion. Phrases like “ice cracking from its cables like breaking bones” and “hidden ink” pay off thematically and sensorially. Minimal redundancy; metaphors cohere to cold/light/brass. The final line reprises the charged object without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: servant‑as‑decoder, goggles projecting coordinates via scattered light, grief encrypted in star charts. The elevator countdown frame is elegant rather than gimmicky, and the discovery reconfigures a familiar “vanished captain” trope. Not radical, but specific and memorable. Risks are controlled and cohesive with the concept.</comment>
