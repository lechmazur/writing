<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kira’s motives are clear and consistent—protect the sanctuary, transform harm into growth—and her key micro-choice (silencing reporters, then inviting Marcus in) feels earned. The embodied detail (handling the cutting; noticing drip‑rings) grounds emotion without label-speak. Internal contradiction is present but gentle: guarding privacy vs. offering the garden to another. A hair more friction or cost on inviting Marcus would deepen the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: viral exposure pressures the sanctuary; Marcus’s arrival tightens; the proffered cutting crystallizes a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Closure carries cost—she risks the privacy of her refuge to teach—and the before/after is legible. Orientation is clean early, single scene, single POV. Slightly soft on explicit narrowing of options keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The moss‑claimed server room is vivid and specific; tech repurposed for water and seedlings enriches plausibility and tone. The environment charges the final image and inflects choices (her cultivation tactics, the sanctity she protects). Details filter through Kira’s professional eye without museum‑tour excess. Exceptional, though not quite constraining a tactical choice in-scene to earn the absolute peak.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve a hard‑won sanctuary vs. respond to public exposure—tightens when Marcus arrives and asks “Teach me?”. The decisive proffer narrows her path by inviting another into the private space, with a felt price. Escalation is cohesive under the chosen lens, if quiet. A touch more resistance or consequence on the page would raise pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Transformation of wound into growth is dramatized through concrete acts (cuttings, rainwater channels) and intergenerational craft (pendant, quilts, gardens). Subtext in the proffered cutting and ice‑pattern reframes scars as soil; the final cadence resonates. One or two direct formulations (“quiet revolution”) skirt telling. Thematic complexity still lands without false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature—technical and botanical vocab braided with lyric compression. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and subtextual; Marcus’s request advances plot cleanly. Rhythm modulates well, with luminous but controlled diction. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: high information density, balanced imagery, no paraphrase loops or template cadence. Metaphors cohere (rings, thaw, grafting) and stay grounded in scene logic. The prose breathes where needed and pushes when the beat turns. Minor elevated phrasing is voice‑motivated rather than ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Server room repurposed as moss garden against contemporary virality feels fresh and organically fused to character. The proffer as pivot and the icicle pattern as method avoid template beats. The intergenerational pendant thread adds a memorable inflection. The risks are quiet but confident, with no gimmickry.</comment>
