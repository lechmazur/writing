<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Kaspar’s guilt-driven purpose is concrete and consistent, and his micro-choices (decoding the tapestry, pulling threads, leaving the coin) align with a credible drive toward self-forgiveness. Contradictory impulses—shame vs. duty—surface without therapy-speak. The recognition that he “did his best with incomplete knowledge” feels earned by the on-page work. Stakes are modest but legible, with a foreclosed path (endless self-condemnation) replaced by a costed acceptance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build coherently from boundary to tapestry to reconfigured board toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clean from the opening image; the woven hush functions as a purposeful pattern break that reweights options. Cost is on the page—he cannot unfreeze the village or undo the past—only his stance changes. The copper coin as final act seals the reconfiguration without mechanical over-closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The time-frozen village and platinum board/tapestry are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered, with tactile constraints (frozen rain, boundary vibration) shaping tactic and tone. The environment directly enables the method (thread-decoding affecting piece positions). Recurring storm imagery charges the ending and frames the emotional stasis. Specificity serves meaning rather than cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—earning the right to forgive oneself—tightens as the tapestry yields to deliberate adjustments that reverberate on the board and inside him. The woven hush intensifies pressure and narrows options to an internal stance rather than external fix. The price is a settled acceptance of irreversibility, and the offering of the copper coin is a quiet but decisive renunciation. Escalation is measured yet unmistakable under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres—teaching as humility and defense, not just attack—and the chess/tapestry motifs evolve meaningfully. A few lines verge on explicit moralizing (the final sentence’s maxim) that slightly dulls subtext. Still, the closure image (coin on board, thunder distant) carries resonance beyond the stated lesson. The insight feels earned by the specific work of decoding and revision.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyrical third-person closely tracks Kaspar’s perceptions with consistent diction and rhythm. The voice marries craft and character—tactile noticing, chess-inflected metaphors—without head-hopping or register spills. Modulation under pressure is controlled, and certainty stays within plausible POV knowledge. No dialogue is needed; the silence is thematically functional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and image-rich with strong cadence; most lines do double duty. A minor tendency toward lushness skirts purple but remains coherent and purposeful. Little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping slows momentum. The final images are clean and land without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess, woven intention, and a time-frozen village feels fresh and organically tied to character and theme. The “woven hush” as actionable phenomenon is a distinctive stroke. While the moral axis (self-forgiveness) is familiar, the method and imagery avoid template solutions. The risk in dense lyric texture pays off with clarity at closure.</comment>
