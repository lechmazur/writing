<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are distinct and embodied: a rational, desperate scientist-thief compelled to confess even to rain. The involuntary truth trait constrains action on the page and yields a credible, earned shift when the compulsion lifts. Internal contradiction (skeptical doubt versus hope; relief versus ethical burden) registers in micro‑choices. Slight neatness in the final moral stance keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: descent → find truffles → prepare mixture → drink → compulsion lifts → new plan. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change plus a resonant reconfiguration of how truth might function socially. Cost is primarily conceptual (ethical burden, finite resource, clouded eye) rather than visceral, which tempers impact. Orientation is excellent and the lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The hanging orchard and storm create an atmospheric, tactile arena that supplies the resource and shapes tactics (rake, descent, roots). Recurring objects (glass eye, truffles) are integrated into setting action and charge the final image. World rules feel consistent and are learned through use. Minor reliance on familiar storm imagery prevents a perfect score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (regain agency over speech) and tightens through the found tin and the choice to ingest a risky concoction. Escalation is clean but low‑friction; the cure works immediately without a counterpunch or material loss. The final decision to distribute the cure reweights consequences credibly. Costs are more ethical than embodied, keeping escalation strong but not punishing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of honesty, discretion, and mercy arise from actions and images (symbolic sight substituting for speech; sideways‑grown trees). The final reframe toward “speaking sideways” resonates and reweights prior material. Some lines verge on explicit thesis statements (“Not to restore lies, but to return dignity to truth”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, resonance lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Mara with a distinctive perceptual signature (science braided with folklore). The confessional lines double as action given her condition, and diction remains consistent under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well at key beats (lightning, the swallow, the silence).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines are tight, image‑rich, and purposeful; verbs carry weight and information density stays high. Figurative choices mostly cohere (“hanging orchard,” “trees swaying like hanged men” skirts cliché but is contextually earned). No scaffold loops or template cadence; momentum remains strong. The final sentence clicks objects and fate together cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of empathy‑virus aftermath with Victorian alienism, truffle mycology, and a smuggled glass eye feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The sideways‑grown orchard as thematic engine is inspired. The cure’s symbolic mechanism (satisfying the urge to reveal via sight) is elegant. Minor familiarity in a couple of images is the only drag on an otherwise original synthesis.</comment>
