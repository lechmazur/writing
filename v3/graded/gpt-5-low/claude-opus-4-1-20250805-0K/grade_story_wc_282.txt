<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kira’s vocation and sensory modifications yield a distinctive interiority, and her micro‑choices (following the amber joy, adjusting the harness, approaching the alien signature) track cleanly. The turn from “documenting” to “becoming a translator/teacher” is motivated by her encounter and the fossil’s crumbling. However, conflict remains largely frictionless—little contradiction or risk pushes against her competence. Emotional embodiment is strong but rarely messy, limiting felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensation → deeper chamber → encounter → reweighted role. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing as the fossil fulfills its purpose and Kira reframes her purpose to teaching others. Cost is on‑page (loss of the fossil; relinquishing singular authority) and the world logic stays consistent. The beat progression is smooth if low‑tension, with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vividly and functionally rendered: limestone as emotional recorder, tidal “breathing,” bioluminescence as sky. The environment shapes method (thermal absorption/release) and charges the final image. The fossil operates as a micro‑setting object that constrains perception and then breaks. While it influences tactics more than forcing a hard choice, specificity and integration are excellent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contact/translation) is clear early, and escalation arrives with the non‑human signature that reweights the mission. Kira’s agency drives the deepening, and the fossil’s dissolution marks a tangible price. Pressure remains gentle—there’s no real jeopardy or trade‑off beyond relinquishment—so the tightening is meaningful but modest. The cadence shift at the end reads, but without sharp squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transitional objects and liminality—between human/other, sleep/wake—are woven through concrete particulars (harness, limestone memory, fossil). The closing reprices “voice of the unknown” into pedagogy, a resonant thematic answer. Some lines verge on thesis‑speak (“science was factually mystical,” “documenting humanity’s next evolution”), slightly dulling subtext. Still, the imagery‑led resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady and apt, with a lyrical but controlled diction that matches Kira’s sensory acuity. The perceptual signature (temperature‑tasting fingers, heat‑mapping vision) distinguishes the voice. Occasional expository assertions flatten the music in peak beats. Overall rhythm and stance remain coherent and confident.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences often carry dual duty (world logic + mood). Minor telliness and a few generalized formulations slightly sap momentum in the final third. No significant loops or metaphor muddle; the closing image lands cleanly. Information density remains high without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Heat‑mapped emotions in tidal limestone, post‑hibernation dream‑earth consciousness, and the fossil as key create a fresh, coherent synthesis. The reveal that the entity arises from leaked dreams and the Earth’s “slow thoughts” feels non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risk is lyrical rather than structural, but it pays off in a reweighted ending. Only the low conflict ceiling keeps it from the very top band.</comment>
