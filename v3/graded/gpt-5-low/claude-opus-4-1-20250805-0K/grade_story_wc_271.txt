<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Amira’s motives and contradictions are precise: panic rising versus the disciplined choice to “freeze,” grief against the stubborn act of cultivation. Embodied emotion is vivid via somatic markers and tactile contact with the cedar. Her micro‑choices (replanting, carrying the photograph, returning tomorrow) align with an Earned Stasis resolution. Minor therapy‑lexicon (“somatic markers,” named clinician) risks clinical tint but is grounded in action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens from bodily tremor to a charged stillness and resolves in a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she will keep planting while violence persists. Orientation is clean early (arboretum, cliff, abandoned lighthouse), and the photograph/trees recur to carry through. Cost is legible in the choice to live with ongoing grief and danger. The final beacon sweep reweights prior images without mechanical tying off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The arboretum, cliff, sea, and automated lighthouse are not mere backdrop; they shape perception, tactics (grounding via the cedar), and the closure image (the beacon sweeping living and dead). Sensory texture is precise—salt air, gulls, rough bark, burned photo edges—filtered through a horticultural gaze. Setting coheres historically (Ottoman ships to drones) to deepen stakes. The final drive through rotating light is an image charged by all that came before.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but concrete: regulate trauma enough to persist in custodial care of life. The tremor → freeze → grounding → return to work provides a credible tightening and a tested commitment. The cost is persistence amidst acknowledged, unended violence; a path of withdrawal is refused. Escalation is quiet but consistent with the lens and length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cultivation as refusal against erasure; guidance structures outlasting their keepers; joy rendered “suspicious.” Recurring objects (photograph, trees, beacon) accrue meaning and the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. A single abstract line (“anchor optimism in realism”) borders on thesis but is earned by particulars before and after. The final coexistence of violence and planting resists tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third’s diction is controlled and character‑true, with rhythmic modulation from tight, sensory lines to broader historical sweep. No dialogue is needed; the voice’s perceptual signature (plant intelligence, somatic weather signs) holds. Elevated phrases read earned by the lyric mode and locale. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, vivid, and economic—images often do double duty (white orchids/white phosphorus/white sheets). Rhythm varies; no paraphrase loops or figurative muddle in peak beats. A few abstract nouns appear, but they’re anchored immediately by concrete action. The last image lands with clarity and propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—somatic ecology, post‑keeper lighthouse, and cultivation as resistance—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The automated beacon and “garden will remember her hands” are distinctive, not template. Risks are lyrical and political without sermonizing. The piece commits to its quiet structure and follows implications without retreat.</comment>
