<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—protecting vulnerable voices—drives clear micro‑choices (listening, interpreting, pursuing), and her reluctant‑hero contradiction gives her interiority texture. Embodied perception (copper taste, tremble of orchids) grounds emotion without label‑speak. The “hadn’t meant to be a hero” admission adds a credible, modest cost in identity. A deeper on‑page price or misstep under pressure would raise this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (causal with accumulative signals) holds: hearing‑aid pulses → photo erasure → birthday dirge → theft realization → basement location → sprint. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. Closure lands as a charged poise/early reversal: she commits and the city begins to “remember,” with conceptual cost in the role she accepts. The resolution leans on implication rather than a concrete confrontation, slightly softening cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The atrium’s mist, glass, and orchids, filtered through an audiologist’s bias, create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The hearing aid functions as a micro‑setting/tool that constraints and guides choice, charging the final movement. Sensory range (taste of copper, visual gold, tactile warmth of photo) is tight and selective. A single spatial constraint affecting tactics physically would push it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—halt the Silence—emerges early and tightens through the photograph’s erasure and the dirge clue. The meaningful deepening is the shift from anomaly to crime (harvested memories) that narrows options to a specific locus. Cost is mostly conceptual; there’s urgency but little visible sacrifice or risk on the page. The off‑stage antagonist keeps pressure coherent but not fully sharpened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of voice theft, communal grief as contagion, and incidental heroism arise from concrete particulars (photo fading, SOS heart‑code) rather than moralizing. The final image (“mist began to lift... hearts remembered how to speak”) reweights prior motifs. The single line that names heroism flirts with stating the thesis but is earned. Ambiguity around the thief preserves resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s profession and sensibility; focalization stays tight. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and images feel character‑sourced. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with subtext in the “I can help you” plea. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is controlled: strong verbs, layered images, and minimal scaffold. Figurative density is high but coherent and not muddled (“breath through broken teeth,” “telegraph of terror”). No noticeable loops or template cadence. A touch more syntactic variation at peak beats could further sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Contact tracer for hearts” via an inherited hearing aid is a fresh synthesis; the photo’s active erasure elevates the trope of memory theft. The investigative method and tonal world cohere into an original stance. The off‑page culprit keeps novelty focused on concept over whodunit mechanics. It feels distinctive and publication‑ready with only minor risks left on the table.</comment>
