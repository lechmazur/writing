<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation and interiority are specific and credible: she seeks “psychological safety” while burdened by involuntary truth. Micro‑choices—offering truffles, modulating speech “slant,” and relinquishing the eye—align with her values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (truth vs occlusion, self‑protection vs service) operate simultaneously. The only limiting factor is that external pressure is modest, so her struggle faces few hard tests.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: pressure accrues through the orchard traverse, the encounter with the traumatized trio, and culminates in renunciation. Closure lands on the page when she places the eye in the tree—an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost (relinquishing her regulator). Anchors (who/where/when) are established early and never lost. Persistent constraints (involuntary truth, unstable orchard) shape tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is vividly particular—cables, swaying bridges, rot and petrichor—and consistently filtered through the forager’s priorities. Environment pressures choices (careful movement, no fire, the cracked branch) and supplies the final locus for release (the lightning‑split tree hollow). Sensory economy is strong; details evolve with action. The setting charges the ending image (“a lung finally emptied of grief”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—maintaining safety amid contagious hyper‑empathy—is signaled early and deepens when the trio demands indirection, forcing a tactical shift. The decisive tightening is her choice to give away tools of regulation (truffles, then the eye), culminating in relinquishment. Cost is felt but not harrowingly tested; conflict remains largely internal/relational rather than confrontational. Tension is steady and coherent without multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: truth vs occlusion, safety via regulation not denial, surrender as care. Subtext in dialogue (“Say it slant”) and recurring objects (eye, truffle, mycelium) resonates in the final release. The explicit textbook aphorism risks didactic tilt, though it’s earned by context and not the closing line. Overall, the ending offers a non‑literal answer: safety blooms when control is let go.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with clean single‑POV focalization; diction and rhythm suit the protagonist’s attention and field craft. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and advances stakes. The voice modulates with pressure (from sensory‑rich foraging to quieter renunciation) without leakage or head‑hopping. No gratuitous authorial intrusion undermines the stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and musical; images are fresh (“fruit hung like forgotten chimes”) and seldom overmixed. Information density is high with minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies to sustain momentum. A few elevated turns (“regulation,” “amygdala’s scream”) skirt clinical register but remain voice‑motivated by the textbooks motif. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—empathy virus, truffle pharmacology, a glass eye as occlusion totem, a storm‑hung orchard—is striking and coherent. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight: the tool that softened truth is relinquished to seed safety beyond the self. Risks in worldbuilding and tone land without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors the novelty.</comment>
