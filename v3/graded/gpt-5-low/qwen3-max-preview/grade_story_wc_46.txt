<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority (“each rotation a memory weighed not in grams, but in grief and grace”) grounds a credible vow and practice. Contradictory impulses (grief versus service; withdrawal versus witness) are present but remain largely harmonized rather than dramatized in friction on the page. Micro-choices—the restraint from flame, the choice to polish and to keep silence with villagers—align with motive. The endurance at the end reads as earned stasis with a quiet cost carried forward.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: polishing → testing the glass against dim light → placement in the basin → communal witnessing. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (quiet, public sharing of reflected light) with conceptual cost tethered to her vow and exile. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and set-ups (tools, mist, basin) pay off. The arc is subtle but coherent without causal stumbles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: mist and condensation become the mechanism that creates prismatic light when the glass is placed in the basin. Tools (agate burnishers, cerium) and micro-geography (crevices, basin) anchor action and charge the final image. The grotto’s constraints (dimness, moisture, refusal of flame) shape tactics and meaning. Sensory detail is luxuriant but purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Pressure is quiet but tightens: the vow is tested through method and culminates in placing the glass where water activates it, publicly committing to reflection over ignition. The “no flames” constraint creates a genuine trade-off that defines the tactic. Stakes (solace versus relived trauma) are legible and deepen at the villagers’ arrival and the child’s touch. Escalation remains internal/accumulative rather than confrontational, but it lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of nonviolence, witness, and transforming harm into a “window” emerge organically from process and image. Recurrences (stillness/pearl; reflect vs ignite) reweight at the end without sermonizing; the line “This was her rebellion: not to ignite, but to reflect” edges toward the explicit but stays earned by action. The final charged poise offers a non-literal answer that lingers. Ambiguity remains purposeful and humane.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyrical texture—measured cadence, precise lexicon tied to craft and environment. Rhythm modulates well from tactile polishing to communal hush without head-hopping. Diction suits the character’s contemplative, craft-informed sensibility. No stance or tense slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level is polished with high information density and varied syntax; figurative language is rich but controlled. A few repeated constructions (“not to X, but to Y”) verge on pattern, yet they function rhetorically rather than as loops. No muddled metaphors or scaffolding; images track physically (mist → condensation → prismatic veins). Momentum aligns with the lyric mode’s breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sea glass as communal, non-consuming light in a mist engine feels fresh, and the vow against flame reorients the familiar “light in darkness” trope. The craft specificity and environmental mechanism elevate the concept beyond lyric ornament. The ending’s reconfiguration (weapon → window) reads inevitable in hindsight. Risk is high but coherent.</comment>
