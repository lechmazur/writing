<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elira’s motive is crystalline and embodied—she tastes the lagoon, licks the journal, and offers the compass—revealing a specific hierarchy of values. The psychometry sequence grounds her interiority in concrete sensation rather than label-speak. However, internal contradiction is light; she seldom struggles against a counter-impulse, so the change reads as deepening rather than contested. The final renunciation carries cost but not a hard wrestle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the compass ritual → inversions in the lagoon → journal → offering → sealing passage. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses inwardness; the stone sealing behind her makes the cost legible. Orientation is clean from the first line, and set-ups (compass, Seventh Descent) pay off. Slight deduction because the cost remains more conceptual than dramatized through resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is richly tactile and governs choice—the fissure, the black lagoon, calcite curtains, and the sealing passage all shape her options. The environment charges the final image (the “closing eyelid” of stone) and integrates tools (compass, brass dish) in scene. Sensory detail is precise and POV-filtered through a “petrichor collector.” High-band vividness without static museum-tour description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the place where explanations fail—is clear and tightens via the compass reading and journal discovery, culminating in a renunciatory step into the passage. Pressure deepens rather than reverses; no antagonist, but the piece earns escalation through a charged cadence shift. The visible price is leaving the surface world as the stone seals behind. Slight softness stems from minimal friction en route.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: surrender versus mastery, belonging versus disappearance, knowledge via scent/silence over logic. Recurring images (petrichor, compass, breathing stone) reweight at the end without didacticism. The journal’s line risks overt statement but functions as an earned artifact rather than authorial moral. Resonance lingers as a conceptual repricing of “found vs. lost.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature (olfactory-centered, mineral lexicon) and steady close third distance. Rhythm modulates with pressure; sentences lengthen for awe, tighten for decisive acts. No head-hopping or stance drift; uncertainty is purposeful and pattern-taught. Diction stays within the character’s plausible idiom for this heightened mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and do multiple jobs (world-building, emotion, and plot) with minimal scaffolding. Metaphors are generally controlled and coherent to the stone/water/air palette. A few flourishes flirt with purple (“first sigh after creation”), but momentum holds. No loop artifacts or cadence templates that dull propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Petrichor collector” with psychometry at a subterranean lagoon and a compass pointing to surrender feels freshly synthesized. The hinged awakenings structurally echo the theme, and the sealing stone final image is memorable. Risks in lyric mode pay off with clarity and emotional logic. The premise commits fully without hedge or gimmickry.</comment>
