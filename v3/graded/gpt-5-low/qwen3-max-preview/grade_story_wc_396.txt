<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—she’s “not here to enforce, but to reconstitute”—and her micro‑choices (which mirrors, when to press the shard, asking the final question) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile handling of the crystal and breath on glass. The internal contradiction (peacekeeper vs. wounded witness) is present but stays understated, limiting dramatic friction. The final acceptance of “enough” reads as earned endurance with a modest, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the mirror‑sequence builds to the self‑confrontation and a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is immediate (lighthouse orchard, ice floes), and the recurrent moves (beam, breath, shard) link beats coherently. Cost is soft but legible in the renunciation of fix/wholeness and the choice to continue carrying a “not whole” shard. The on‑page final question reconfigures the premise without breaking logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and particular—the “lighthouse orchard” and groaning floes create a memorable atmosphere that colors every action. The beam sweeping over mirrors charges the method and the final image; the cold, rust, and frost shape her pacing and breath. World details are filtered through her mission, avoiding tourist catalog. It strongly charges the closing image even if physical constraint is gentle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconstituting courage/empathy) is clear, with a meaningful tightening at the oldest mirror when the reflections turn inward. Escalation is primarily tonal/density‑based rather than conflictual; no antagonist, but pressure coheres toward the final stance. The price—accepting incompletion and choosing to carry forward—is present but understated. A slightly sharper on‑page test would heighten cost clarity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of mercy as choice and empathy operationalized through witness arise organically from the mirrors and shard. The final question reframes the world’s rule‑set without prescribing a moral. A couple of thesis‑like lines (“She had once believed peace… Now she knew…”) edge toward explicitness, softening subtext. Overall resonance lingers through concrete images rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“weighted breath before reply,” “anomalies”) remains stable. Rhythm modulates well via anaphora and short lines that breathe at key beats. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; certainty stays within her experiential frame. Slightly elevated diction is justified by the reflective mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: images are clean, repetitions are purposeful, and sentences carry multiple jobs. Occasional anaphora (“Not to… Not to…”) and parallelisms create cadence without bloat. Minor abstraction threads through a few lines but does not blur sense or momentum. The closing image lands with clarity and economy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—peacekeeping as empathy cartography using scavenged mirrors in a lighthouse orchard over ice—is fresh and coherent. The shard-as-tool/purpose reweighting is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. Minor familiarity in the statement of theme prevents a higher score.</comment>
