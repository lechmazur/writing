<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira’s motive—comprehension over reunion—feels specific and drives concrete micro‑choices (aligning the eyes, whispering integrals, leaving one eye, going deeper). Interiority is rich and embodied through tactile interaction with the orchard and mosaic. The contradictory pull between grief and cautious hope is present but could sharpen under pressure for a higher band. The final renunciation (leaving the hazel eye) reads as a modest but earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each action (tracing cracks, aligning eyes, integrals) deepens the pattern until the moon‑dependent projection and fruit‑compass reconfigure options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: silence becomes resonance; loss becomes curvature around absence. Cost is on the page (she leaves an eye, chooses a new path) though it’s quiet. Orientation is clear early; no causal cheats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly realized and functionally central: stalactite drips, bioluminescent fruit, and the moonbeam angle constrain discovery. The setting actively responds (hum through root and rock, tree recognition, fruit falling) and charges the final image (orchard exhale, glow strengthening, eye winking). Details are purposeful and POV‑filtered, avoiding travelogue. The environment directly shapes tactics and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around deciphering absence; escalation reads as pattern‑density increase: hum, projection, hidden equation, then coordinates and frequency via tears. Agency drives turns—she chooses calibration, speaks integrals, and accepts a deeper quest. The price is modest but legible, trading static mourning for uncertain pursuit. A slightly sharper pinch point could elevate stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: ambiguous loss reframed as resonance; emotion as curvature around absence is dramatized via light, sound, and pattern rather than moralizing. Recurring objects (mosaic, eyes, fruit) reweight at the end to answer the central question with buried optimism. The Aris message risks overt statement but is contextualized as his idiom, not authorial gloss. The final images linger without neatness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature holds steady, with mathematical and natural imagery braided through her POV. Compression and elision are purposeful and legible; no head‑hopping in the main scene, with a clean final cut to Aris. Diction suits the character’s conjurer‑mathematic sensibility without register drift. Rhythm varies well, tightening at turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line work is polished: strong verbs, high information density, and images doing double duty (tears refracting projections to reveal secondary symbols). Figurative language is plentiful but coherent to the governing motif of resonance and curvature. Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum is maintained. A few abstractions could be trimmed, but clarity never wavers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—conjuring + calculus + bioluminescent orchard + glass‑eye calibration—is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The “emotion curves around absence” insight gains power through concrete mechanics (moonbeam, mosaic fractures). Risk‑taking is evident without gimmickry. A slightly bolder on‑page cost or complication would push into the rare high band.</comment>
