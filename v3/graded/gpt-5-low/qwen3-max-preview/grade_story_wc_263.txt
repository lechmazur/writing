<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—she bears the ache of others’ stifled art and chooses costly action when the voices crescendo. Interiority is embodied (frozen tears, vibrating ribs) and particular to her cosmology. The internal conflict (yearning for rest vs. compulsion to midwife creativity) is present but could surface as sharper simultaneous contradiction in-scene. The final earned rest reads as credible endurance with cost rather than a tidy cure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and coheres to an on‑page release: the winter fury escalates to mass tracing and liberation, then a spent aftermath. Orientation is clear (archway, aurora, instrument) and the causal pattern within the lyric mode holds. Closure lands with cost—voices released, she collapses to rest—qualifying as a decisive change. The single‑scene surge avoids outline-y “and then” sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and the brass instrument function as charged micro‑settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Weather and stone physically and tonally affect action (frozen stone, frost, aurora’s pulse). Details are POV-filtered and purposeful without tourist cataloging. The final image is inseparable from place and tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity vs. her bodily/psychic limits—tightens clearly when the voices turn furious, forcing a maximal expenditure of effort. Agency drives escalation (she chooses to trace hundreds), and the price is felt in exhaustion and frozen tears. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential; a further explicit trade‑off mid‑climb could have sharpened cost even more. The resolution is earned and not coincidence-led.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of suppressed art, communal release, and ritual caretaking emerge through concrete images (chains snapping as meteors are traced) rather than sermonizing. A few direct statements (“She came to free trapped creativity”) slightly over-articulate what the scene already shows. The ending reweights the premise with a quiet, resonant certainty rather than a moral. Subtext (midwife of dreams at personal cost) lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a stable close third focalization. Rhythms modulate under pressure (from reverie to urgent conducting). The diction coheres to her celestial idiom without register slips. Minor repetition of sentence stems doesn’t disrupt distance or clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and economical for lyric mode; images carry multiple jobs (instrument as memory/device; aurora as pressure). There’s density of metaphor but it remains coherent to the sky/cathedral thread; only light purpleness peeks through. Momentum is steady into the climax with minimal paraphrase or scaffold. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “cosmic midwife” of creativity under an auroral arch is a fresh synthesis, executed with conviction. Familiar magical-realist textures are transformed by specific, charged objects and a communal-release climax. Risks in lyric density and conceit pay off without obscuring clarity. The final harmony of stardust/sky/silence feels earned rather than ornamental.</comment>
