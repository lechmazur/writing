<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (“to hush the dissonance of old guilt”) drives concrete choices: singing, blood‑ink, tethering the glyph. Interiority is particular and embodied (“voice cracking like thawing ice”). Contradictory impulses—shame, responsibility, competence—coexist and resolve through costly action. Slight safety in how neatly her skill matches the solution keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑POV causal chain holds: letters → knowledge of Model L‑7’s curse → amber activation → song + blood‑ink tether → machine’s weeping and release. Closure lands on the page with cost (blood, self‑addressed letter, acceptance of culpability) and a reconfigured world image (time “stitching,” Cradle Major). Orientation is clean from the opening. A few magical leaps (firefly→glyph) are accepted by the taught rules but keep it just below 9.0+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The laboratory, Model L‑7, and the cradle function as charged tools constraining options and enabling the fix; they aren’t mere backdrop. Sound‑texture is vivid and purposeful (static into symphonies; meteor hush) and culminates in the final, reweighted quiet. Recurring objects (amber, letters, machine) shape tactics and the closing image. World rules feel consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (quiet the haunted firmware and her guilt) and tightens as the machine accuses her and escalates to crimson tubes and articulated cries. The decisive act—tethering the glyph with blood and letter‑dust—carries visible cost and resolves pressure without coincidence. Internal and external conflicts interweave cleanly. Tension is steady rather than jagged, but the deepening is meaningful.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of translation, forgiveness, and transforming grief accrue through concrete images (lullaby→glyph→machine weeping; letters under the willow). Final reweighting (“maps…to forgiveness”) is earned by the actions and the meteor hush’s redefinition. One explicit statement skirts on‑the‑nose but is supported by scene work. Ambiguity remains humane (redemption without erasure).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled imagery and consistent psychic distance; the perceptual signature favors sound as meaning. Cadence modulates under pressure (accusatory machine vs. softened sighs). No head‑hopping or stance slips. Occasional density of metaphor brushes purple but stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong line‑level craft with high information density; images often do double duty (soundscape as emotional barometer). Minor lushness and stacked metaphors risk saturation but do not obscure causality or the closure image. Variations in sentence rhythm suit beats. No evident scaffolding or loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, amber glyph—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (sound‑lab cosmology, time folding) heighten stakes without muddling clarity. Key turns arise from established capacities, not late rule injections. The final constellation and meteor hush reprise deliver a memorable, fresh finish.</comment>
