<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motives are clear and particular—translating fear into witness—and her micro‑choices (kneeling to read, speaking the phrases, pressing coral to cast) align with her profession and flaws. Interiority is embodied (“anesthetic... weighting her limbs”) and specific to her translator’s ethic. The final renunciation (not fixing, but letting it breathe) feels earned with felt cost. Slight safety in articulation (“she hadn’t healed the past”) trims the edge of ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure coheres: discovery of the cast → decryption → spoken ritual → visual reconfiguration → stance shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes pain as kinship with an on‑page image (the cast’s knots releasing, coral cooling). Orientation is clean from the first lines; the anesthetic constraint holds through to the end. Cost is legible as acceptance over repair, though the pressure is quiet rather than forceful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mist‑clad atrium, condensation, and salt air create a lived, sensorial container that reflects and pressures the scene’s liminality. The brain coral as object‑setting recurs and decisively charges the ending image. Environmental beats evolve (“atrium exhaled,” mist thins) in causal response to her actions, deepening tone. Minor risk of ornamental lushness is offset by specificity tied to choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she transform uncarried fear into witnessed meaning—tightens through the move from observation to speaking and pressing coral. Escalation is accumulative: density of image and emotion increases, culminating in the cast’s rearrangement and a stance choice. The price is a chosen endurance, not a fix; clear but quietly scaled. A touch more friction or a threatened failure beat could have sharpened the tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of witness over repair, memory as living tide, and symbiosis bloom organically through action and motif (coral/cast/sea). The final reweighting to “kinship” resonates but flirts with explicitness via stated takeaways (“start listening to what it’s trying to say”), softening subtext. Still, the transformation of scribbles into joined figures gives a non‑literal answer that lingers. Emotional honesty generally avoids sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A controlled lyric third with a distinct perceptual signature—maritime metaphors, translator‑logic—holds steady. Psychic distance modulates credibly as the anesthetic deepens. A couple of repeated constructions (“not with magic, but with...”) edge toward pattern, but voice remains intentional and character‑bound. No head‑hopping or stance leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered jobs and move with the scene’s breath; images are largely clean and purposeful. Occasional purple stacking and near‑repetitions (“not with magic, but with memory/resonance”) add a trace of ornament. Rhythm varies and punctuation is clean, preserving momentum. The closing cadence lands with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The decrypting of a child’s cast via empathy, coupled with a brain‑coral talisman and anesthetic haze, feels fresh and integrated. The mosaic of war‑translation and tidal imagery yields a non‑obvious synthesis at the end. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and they pay off without obscuring clarity. Only the slight didactic edge at the finish constrains the ceiling.</comment>
