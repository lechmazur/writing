<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation (rekindle a realm) and a consistent inner texture (scattered memory curated through sensory shards). Key micro-choices—choosing to hum, to invite silence, to not force—reveal values under pressure. The identity shift from “keeper of fragments” to “the loom” feels earned if a touch swift. Internal contradiction (fractured memory vs. steady stewardship) is present but could face sharper on‑page friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural build is coherent: hum → communal joining → mica releasing light → communal dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the final mirror image repricing the world’s logic. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (relinquishing hoarded light/silence), not materially dramatized, which softens impact slightly. Orientation is clear and the pattern taught early pays off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly specific (mica panes hoarding dawn, iron stair, alchemical citrus), integrated with action and final image. The environment constrains tactics (no external sun; must use song to coax trapped light). Sensory texture supports tone without devolving into catalog. A hair’s breadth from over-ornament at times, but discipline mostly holds.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: either the realm remains dark or a communal dawn is rewoven. Escalation is a decisive intensification (solo hum to collective chorus to shattering release). The price is mostly implied (abandonment of silence/hoarding), with minimal on‑page sacrifice or loss, keeping it shy of fiercer tension. Still, agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic throughline (community memory made audible; light as shared resonance) is strong and image-led. However, lines like “ancient, necessary truth” drift toward stated moral, dulling subtext. The final reweighting (windows as mirrors) is elegant but slightly overexplained. Emotional aftereffect lingers despite a touch of sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, coherent lyric voice with controlled rhythm and apt diction; the POV filter stays steady. Patterned elision (near-remembered songs, sensory fragments) is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping; distance modulation suits the crescendos. Occasional aphoristic edges nibble at the line between voice and proclamation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid, mostly coherent metaphor systems (mica/firefly light; woven dawns). Minor redundancies and slogan‑leaning phrases appear but do not stall momentum. Rhythm varies well, with clean sequencing and minimal filter scaffolding. The prose flirts with purple but remains disciplined enough under pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mica hoarding dawn and “woven dawns” via communal song feel fresh and integrated, elevating a familiar communal‑ritual trope. The shift from hoarded to mirrored light is an inventive reprise. Risk resides in unabashed lyricism and concept-forward design; it largely pays off. A slightly gentler cost profile keeps it from the very top tier.</comment>
