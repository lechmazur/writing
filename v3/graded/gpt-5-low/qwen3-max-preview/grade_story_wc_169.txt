<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is distinct and consistent—she aims to “revitalize…the equations that governed possibility”—and her actions align (patterns, launches, recalibration). Interiority is conveyed through precise, character‑specific perception (“probability of grace under temporal duress”). However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely strains against herself. The endurance at the end reads earned but low-cost, more serene commitment than sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: create → launch → observe → recalibrate culminates in the resonance cascade and small multiversal shifts. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the obsidian disc and needle swing reweight the system and options. Cost is implicit (ongoing, relentless labor without finale) rather than explicit on-page loss, slightly softening impact. Orientation is clean from the opening (grotto, gauge, trial balloons), and set-ups pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The grotto and tide act as a living apparatus—convergence point, resource source (obsidian disc), and constraint for tactics. Sensory detail is rich and POV-shaped (salt hexagonal lattices, bioluminescent anemones) with consistent world rules. The gauge functions as micro‑setting, charging the final image. Depth is high without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping hope’s equations “breathing”—is clear and tightens via the emerald balloon’s “What if grief could be transmuted into lift?” and the disc-triggered cascade. Agency drives the turns: she selects patterns, calibrates, and chooses when to integrate the disc. The price is mostly conceptual (choosing ongoing, iterative labor over closure); no option is visibly foreclosed on-page. Pressure coheres but remains contemplative rather than acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The theme—hope as engineered structure—emerges through concrete acts (mandalas, calibration, trial balloons) rather than sermonizing, and the ending’s small, realigned mercies resonate. A few overt lines (“hope wasn’t a feeling—it was a structure”; “No grand pronouncements”) edge toward statement, but the images carry most weight. The final charged poise (she resumes work) offers a non‑literal answer that lingers. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—lyric but disciplined, with a scientist‑mystic lexicon that stays consistent and plausible for the focalizer. Focalization remains stable and confident; no head‑hopping or register slip. Rhythm modulates well from careful observation to the cascade. Purposeful elision (across timelines) is taught and honored at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line work is elegant with high information density; images often do double duty (the gauge measures resonance and character stance). Minor repetition and lushness flirt with over‑ornament (“spirals within spirals,” reiterated cadences) but do not blur sense. Syntax varies and propulsion holds through the quiet mode. No figurative muddle mars the ending beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—altitude gauge as resonance meter, trial balloons as hypotheses, hope as solvable scaffold in a tide grotto—is fresh and coherent. Turns grow from the established method rather than late rule swaps; the obsidian disc is an earned complication. Emotional truth (patient, iterative care) grounds the high concept. Risk is meaningful and controlled.</comment>
