<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motivation and vocation drive every choice, with tactile ritual detail (oils, powders, “patterns in static”). Internal contradiction is minimal—she feels reverence more than struggle—so the arc reads as steady competence rather than pressured change. Micro‑choices (oil strokes, chip placement, surrendering to patterns) reveal values but not much cost beyond solemn acceptance. The closing renunciation (letting the chip drift; planning her own) feels earned, if emotionally even.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: preparation → infusion → pulse → release, culminating in a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is strong early (who/where/what), and the emerald chip’s activation provides an on‑page cost/repricing: not saving life but preserving the liminal instant. The final image (chip set adrift) reweights the premise with conceptual cost and a foreclosed alternative (burial/mourning). No causal gaps or false turns; the sequence coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is vivid, integrated, and functionally charges the ending (the chip, the currents, the aurora’s gaze). Details feel filtered through the mortician’s expertise and aim, not a tourist catalog (moonpetal oil, cloud‑moth silk, condensed skylight). The environment supplies both tool and altar, defining tactics (infuse under auroral resonance; release into high currents). World rules remain consistent and legible through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure tightens via a density increase: surrender to the memorized patterns, the air hesitating, the chip’s single pulse. Stakes remain singular and legible: capture the threshold spark before oblivion erases all. The earned stasis at the end (release instead of traditional rites) carries a felt price and resolves the dominant stake. Slightly inward conflict limits volatility, but the escalation is decisive for this mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around dignity at the edge of death, time’s pause, and choosing witness over denial. The closing image reinterprets rites: a lantern that holds a charged instant rather than a body, a conceptual repricing of “preservation.” Subtext runs through tools and textures without moralizing; no thesis is spoken. It invites reflection on consent, ritual, and awareness without flattening into platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to the mortician sustains a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm remain controlled; image choices feel of this world’s logic. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; psychic distance tightens as the infusion intensifies. The voice modulates subtly from descriptive awe to charged stillness at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and musical, with high information density per sentence. A few lush metaphors risk purple, but they cohere to the sensory logic (light, stillness, static) and do not obscure action. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax sustain momentum through a quiet scene. The final lines land cleanly without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The beautician‑mortician at an auroral grotto capturing a liminal spark via an emerald shard is striking and specific. Method (patterns in static) and ritual detail transform familiar deathwork tropes into something fresh. The final conceptual turn—preserving lucid brink‑awareness—feels inevitable from the setup. Boldness is high without gimmick; only the limited internal conflict keeps it from the topmost band.</comment>
