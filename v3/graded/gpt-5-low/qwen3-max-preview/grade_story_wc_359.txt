<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—she comes to “certify wonder” and acts through striking, surrendering, and finally renouncing the sheet. Interiority is embodied via synesthesia and concrete sensory crossovers (G‑minor as burnt caramel). The piece lacks strong contradictory impulses or a felt moral bind, so struggle reads gentle. Cost is modest but present (exertion, surrender, braving the blizzard).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: each chime intensifies pattern toward a reconfiguration where the sheet’s role transfers into her body and the cavern. Closure lands on-page with conceptual repricing (“wonder…not as luxury, but as oxygen”) backed by enacted ritual and revealed changes. Causality is lyrical but consistent (strike → color/sound → thawed laughter → cavern revealed). Cost is lighter than maximal but legible in the surrender of the tool and chosen exposure to the outer world.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ice cavern and aurora are not décor; they drive method and outcome (acoustics, light guiding strikes, revelations in the ice). Recurring objects (prism bell, amber sheet) integrate with environment to charge the final image. Sensory specificity across modalities is rich and POV-filtered. The setting constrains tactics and culminates in the cavern’s “sculpted” transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accrues through intensifying strikes and cascading revelations; the dominant stake (tending wonder) tightens via the final unfettering. The meaningful turn is the surrender of control to the aurora and the sheet’s internalization. However, conflict is largely uncontested—no opposing force beyond silence—so escalation reads more ceremonial than fraught. The felt price is present but not sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: wonder as an essential practice enacted through ritual, not asserted alone. Subtext operates through images (thawed laughter, quartz veins, “sculpted hush” redefined). A few on-the-nose statements (“not as luxury, but as oxygen”) slightly blunt subtlety. Overall, resonance is earned by action and image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single-POV lyric voice is consistent, confident, and imagistically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (color/taste/texture of sound). Rhythm modulates well from hush to crescendo to repose. No head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional lushness pushes the edge but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful metaphors threaded through action. Figurative saturation is heavy but coherent; minimal redundancy and good propulsion. Minor purple-prose risk and repeated motifs slightly tax momentum. Syntax and sequencing are clean, supporting clarity at peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis—synesthetic bell-ringing that paints with aurora in an ice cathedral—feels singular and inevitable once established. The “sculpted hush” concept is freshly reframed at the end. Risks in diction and conceit pay off without obscuring clarity. The final reweighting (sheet into bones; wonder as tended oxygen) sticks.</comment>
