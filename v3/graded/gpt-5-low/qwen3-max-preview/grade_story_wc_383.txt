<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (archive before dawn) and embodied interiority (dread vs steady breath; skeptic vs charmed) drive credible micro‑choices. The sequence—kneeling, shell to temple, vow, leaving the shell—tracks a consistent value hierarchy. A touch of abstract self‑diagnosis (“translating isolation into independence”) edges toward thesis, but it’s grounded by action. The earned refusal to be “healed” reads as an Earned Stasis with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single continuous scene under an accumulative/textural lens tightens toward a clean on‑page closure. The live clock (stars fading) and the shell’s warming/clarifying whispers escalate to the vow and relinquishment. Cost is legible: she forgoes healing for sovereignty and leaves the charged object behind. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no causality or lens slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden, willow, and twilight are vivid and POV‑filtered, with sensory specificity across scent, touch, and sound. The setting and tool (shell) charge the final image and subtly constrain behavior and timing. World rules are consistent, and details evolve with pressure (“time was thinning,” vines, last star). The environment meaningfully frames the act and its cost.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve and structure memory before dawn—tightens via the fading stars and the shell’s increasing resonance. Agency drives the turn (she vows and archives, then relinquishes the shell), and consequence persists (not healed, but sovereign). Pressure is quiet rather than combative, yet the cadence shift and trade‑off are unmistakable. A sharper external counterforce could have heightened risk, but the internal stakes suffice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—solitude to sovereignty; fragility as first draft of resilience—emerges from objects and acts. However, several thesis‑like statements (“This was her alchemy…,” “Her independence was not freedom from the past, but fluency in its language.”) over‑articulate what the images already carry, especially near the end. The resonance still lands via the vow and the shell’s placement. A lighter touch on explicit moralizing would deepen subtext.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent, distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful repetition. Diction fits the focalizer’s perceptual signature; no head‑hopping or stance drift. The vow line is spare and effective against the lushness around it. Elevated register remains coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful imagery. Occasional metaphor stacking (“supernovas,” “resonance structures,” “lattices of longing”) edges toward excess but stays legible. Minimal redundancy and strong propulsion through varied sentence rhythm. Final lines are clean and decisive without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of archival praxis with a mystical garden and a half‑shell as mnemonic engine. The science‑inflected “resonance structures” blended with lyric naturalism feels distinctive. Risks in diction and concept largely pay off, reweighing the final image. A few familiar formulations temper the ceiling, but the vision reads singular.</comment>
