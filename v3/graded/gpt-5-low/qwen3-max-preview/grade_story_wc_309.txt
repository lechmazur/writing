<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lior’s motive (refusing sterile automation in favor of hand-made wonder) is clear, embodied, and drives each choice. The hesitation before mist-walking and the relinquishing of the keystone show credible internal conflict with visible cost. Interiority is particular (“tastes like laughter or grief”), not stock. A slight tilt toward telling in the sky-cult exposition keeps this just short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: contact with the keystone opens the path; the walk leads to the figure and tree; the offering produces a reweighted ending. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he foregoes stature and keeps sharing small charms despite continued rejection. Cost is on-page (he leaves the keystone; institutions still exclude him). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, lingering luminance, and moonstone keystone are tactile, selective, and integrated into action (the luminance literally becomes the path). Setting constraints and tools shape choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail across sight, touch, and sound (crystal chimes, rime glow) supports tone. World rules feel consistent and learned through observation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering living magic vs. standardization/self-failure) is clear and tightens at the mist’s invitation and the keystone’s placement. Agency drives escalation: stepping onto mist despite past failures, then surrendering the keystone. The price is modest but legible, and the renunciation is credible. The piece remains quiet, but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance is strong in images (doors opening onto small sacred memories) and the final practice of leaving imperfect charms. However, the text occasionally states its thesis (“remembers what magic was before it was managed… meant to be remembered—and shared”) rather than letting subtext carry it, especially in the final lines. Emotional honesty lands; a touch of moralizing mutes ambiguity. The best moments show rather than say (the lullaby-saved village vignette).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The close third voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent; diction and rhythm modulate well at key beats (the mist’s lift, the bloom of doors). Dialogue is brief but textured, avoiding exposition dumps. The perceptual signature (machine oil vs. laughter/grief) feels distinct and character-bound. Minor register slips are absent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines are dense but purposeful; images do double duty without muddle, and momentum is maintained. A small copy slip (“He unstrap”) and occasionally declarative sentences slightly blunt the polish. No template cadence or synonym loops; figurative language remains coherent. Final images land cleanly with strong verb choices.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—automation-age magic vs. wonder, “lingering luminance,” a keystone that accommodates impossibilities—feels fresh and integral. Turns arise from established particulars rather than gimmicks; mist-walking and the apple tree of radiant doors surprise yet feel inevitable. Risks are taken in lyrical mode with clarity intact. Minor thematic on-the-nose lines prevent a higher band.</comment>
