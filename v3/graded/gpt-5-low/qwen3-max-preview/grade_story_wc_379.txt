<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Elara’s choices are clear, consistent, and quietly forceful (refusing to open the mailbox, choosing to “hear” and hum until Leo answers). Interiority is restrained but specific through action rather than abstract labels. Leo’s turn feels credible and earned. Limited internal contradiction keeps this shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual visits and hearing culminate in the mailbox opening and Leo’s softened grief (a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost in patience and vulnerability). Orientation is clean from the outset and the locket-mailbox loop pays off on-page. The final image reweights the rules of the courtyard. Minor neatness in the ritual’s success keeps it just below 9.0.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courtyard and mailbox act as micro-setting constraints—Elara’s method relies on that place’s rules, and the locked box charges the ending. Sensory specificity (jasmine, dawn birds) is purposeful and threaded through action. The mailbox’s physicality dictates tactics (waiting vs. opening). A touch more pressure from Cedar Hollow’s environment could have pushed this to 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes escalate quietly via repeated visits and the choice to hum rather than confront; the cost is time, exposure, and restraint. The meaningful tightening arrives when Leo finally opens the door and the ritual is tested. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens but never bites hard. The conflict resolves without a hard trade-off beyond vulnerability.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Listening-as-healing emerges organically through the locket, the humming, and neighbors sharing grief; the final image earns a tender afterglow. However, lines like “Trauma doesn’t shout—it echoes” verge on thesis-stating. Subtext is otherwise strong in gesture and silence. The theme’s complexity is felt but a hair too explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is poised and consistent, with clean focalization and natural dialogue (“I hear things.”). Diction suits the gentle magical realism and modulates with pressure without strain. Subtext in exchange and silence does work. Minor aphoristic moments prevent it from feeling wholly singular.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is tight, with purposeful images doing multiple jobs and no momentum-draining loops. Rhythm varies well and the final cadence lands. A couple of declarative aphorisms edge toward telling. Figurative control remains clean in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “listening curator” with a story-mailbox and grief-hearing locket feels fresh and integrated rather than gimmicky. The ritualized, non-intrusive method to reach Leo is an elegant, non-obvious turn. Emotional specificity lifts it above template magical realism. Slight safety in the conflict keeps it below exceptional.</comment>
