<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and tactile motives (needle, thread, stitching) drive credible micro‑choices under pressure. The resolve “to descend into necessary darkness” aligns with her actions and the cost (“Pain was the price of coherence”). Slight limitation: she rarely shows contradictory impulses; she “doesn’t flinch,” which trims dynamic tension. Still, her final self‑repricing (crestRISEN) feels earned by prior labor.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural build is clean: stitching → pattern resonance → library’s responsive turn → cocooning compression → reassembled box. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (compression, bone‑break metaphor) and a charged final object. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/why), and the motif chain pays off on the page. Minor ding: stakes remain largely interior, but the piece honors its chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is not mere backdrop; it breathes, inverts, and finally cocoons, directly charging the climax. Salt windows, spiraling guts, and rusted gears meet her tactics (stitching, laying the tapestry) with material consequence. Environmental rules remain consistent within the surreal frame. The final image is inseparable from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether she can confront fracture and remake meaning—tightens as her actions provoke the library’s escalating responses. The decisive deepening occurs when she steps onto the stitched tapestry, triggering inversion and cocooning. Cost is felt in compression and the acceptance of pain as coherence’s price. External antagonism is minimal, but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding a self/world from fracture develops through concrete acts (stitching the Tower to maps, painting on eyelids) rather than discourse. Rhetorical questions evolve from static to instrumental, embodying inquiry as craft. The end reweights grief as architecture and cocooning as transformation without moralizing. Slight cap due to primarily interior stakes, but resonance is strong.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with purposeful rhythm and image systems (threads, maps, almanac, moonlight). POV distance and certainty remain consistent, with sensory choices true to an artist’s eye. A few lush flourishes flirt with excess but do not blur focalization or action. The cadence modulates effectively at the turn.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density; most lines carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, and action in one). Figurative language is rich but largely coherent and patterned to subject; minimal redundancy. A slight purple tilt (“drowned cities,” “unborn colors”) risks saturation but maintains clarity and momentum. Mechanics are clean and sequences legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tarot, a lighthouse library, and reality‑stitching synthesize into a fresh, integrated vision rather than a collage of cool parts. The library’s physical response to her craft is an elegant, earned turn. The mentor’s mid‑sentence vanishing/Tower seed grounds the later repricing. Boldness serves coherence without gimmickry.</comment>
