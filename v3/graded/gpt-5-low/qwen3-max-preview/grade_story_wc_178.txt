<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and embodied through concrete sacrifices (sold cloak, scant food) and meticulous choices (alignment, logging). The interior paradox—empirical rigor pursuing “magic”—gives him specificity without posturing. Internal conflict is subtle rather than dramatized under pressure; he endures more than he wrestles. The Earned Stasis at the end (preserving, not exploiting) reads motivated and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative structure tightens toward Sirius’s descent and the tile’s hum, then resolves in a charged refusal to sensationalize (wrap, leave, return later). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: confirmation without spectacle reweights the covenant. Causality is steady (preparation → alignment → activation → preservation), with the cost seeded and carried. A hair shy of 9+ due to the low external counterforce, though the accumulative lens holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Sky Chamber and reimagined Babylonian palace are tactile and functionally constraining (alignment to Sirius, chalk on obsidian, crumbling stairs). Environment charges the final image—future rulers sitting atop a humming covenant—and dictates tactics. Detail selection is professional-bias filtered (ephemerides, atmospheric subtraction). World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (activate/confirm the covenant’s frequency) is clear and narrows through a timed celestial window. The meaningful tightening is the horizon-kiss and hum; agency is endurance and precision under scarcity, culminating in the choice to preserve rather than exploit. Cost is legible (privation, forsaken status) and reasserted at closure. The pressure is primarily internal-textural, with minimal antagonistic resistance on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of devotion versus spectacle, science as reverent praxis, and empire’s ephemera versus enduring math are earned through particulars, not sermon. Recurring objects (tile, chalk, logbook) and the “between regimes” frame deepen the social cost of his private covenant. One line edges toward thesis (“magic... merely physics undiscovered”), but the final cadence resists moralizing. The last images reprice meaning without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and tightly focalized; diction suits a monkish empiricist with austere grandeur. Rhythm modulates around the activation beat and settles into a charged quiet at the end. No head-hopping or stance drift; the single spoken word lands as earned restraint. Minor repetition (e.g., “empirically ironic”) feels intentional motif, not tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered information and momentum; imagery is vivid without incoherence. Occasional lushness skirts purple but stays controlled by action anchors (aligning, sketching, logging). No scaffold loops or filter stacks dulling immediacy. The final line is clean, image-resolved, and free of muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—Babylonian ruin-as-observatory, magic square as resonant key, and ascetic science as encrypted devotion—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk lies in privileging quiet verification over spectacle, which the piece earns. Familiar “science-as-magic” ideas are transformed by specific praxis and costs. The closure image hums with distinctive integrity.</comment>
