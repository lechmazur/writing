<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A singular, coherent interiority with tactile choices (unfolding the swan, entering, returning, writing) grounds the keeper. Embodied emotion (“trembling palms,” tears) reads specific rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is mild—devotion to nonjudgment encounters only a soft ache—so pressure on motive is limited. Still, the final Earned Stasis (“softened… only witnessing”) feels earned by prior choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: approach → entry via the swan → witnessing → return, culminating in a charged reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the keeper accepts a costed stance (no grief/hope, only witnessing) and resumes with altered poise. Orientation is clean; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the altered self and renunciation of consolatory frames.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely particular and instrumental: catacombs, the obsidian refuge, and the swan constrain access and shape action. The environment charges the final image (river as clock; refuge’s unchanged surface; moss and bone quill). World rules remain consistent (reality loosened but taught through effects). Sensory selection feels precise and character-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via density and cadence rather than conflict: entering the refuge intensifies stakes into the vision of seasons/civilizations, then resolves into a costed stance. The primary stake—can one witness without judgment—tightens at the inversion and the return. The cost is emotional renunciation/softening, not plot jeopardy, but it is clear. One substantive deepening occurs and holds to the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Themes of impermanence, nonjudgment, and regenerative silence develop through concrete particulars (beetle wings, star maps, tea steam-civilizations) and culminate in a resonant quiet. However, the final sentence explicitly states the thesis (“to witness without judgment was the rarest form of love”), tipping into told moral and reducing subtext. Prior images already sufficed to deliver the insight. The emotional afterimage is strong but slightly overdeclared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm remain stable and purposeful. Patterned elision is taught (“reality grips loosely”) and paid off. No head-hopping or register slips. Modulation at the entry/return beats is deft without sacrificing legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax; most images carry multiple loads (world-rule, emotion, theme). The lyricism is lush but largely coherent; metaphor vehicles rarely clash. Minor risk of saturation in places (“maps of stars no longer visible,” “constellations became myths… dust motes”) but momentum holds. Open/close lines are strong and non-redundant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The origami-swan portal, obsidian refuge reflecting “quietude between heartbeats,” and regenerative silence as praxis feel striking and integrated. Risks are purposeful and not gimmicky. The synthesis reads singular even within familiar archive-catacomb imagery. Freshness arises from the specific mechanics and the costed stance rather than concept alone.</comment>
