<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elira’s motive—to redefine mercy through action—reads clear and consistent, with embodied markers like the shard biting her palm. Her agency drives the crucial turns (prying the tessera, refusing to rise, handing it to the magistrate, initiating communal renaming). Internal contradiction is modest; she is resolute more than torn, so the arc leans endurance over ambivalence. The magistrate beat briefly tests her stance and reveals status dynamics without derailing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: detail and ritual build toward a communal redefinition, paid off by the magistrate exchange and the survivors’ participation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—mercy redefined as practice with cost—on the page. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/after the fire) and the pattern is taught and sustained. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than plot‑threat physical, but it’s legible at the ending beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The plaza, ash, and minaret debris are vivid and persistently filtered through Elira’s task. The tessera and stepping stone function as micro‑setting constraints and charge the final image. Sensory texture is selective and purposeful, avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment’s fractures mirror and shape choices without feeling forced.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around Elira asserting a new praxis under public scrutiny, tightening when the magistrate demands silence. The shift from solitary act to communal ritual broadens stakes and demonstrates consequence. Costs are primarily moral/social; the scene doesn’t press a tangible peril, but it credibly forces stance crystallization. The escalation is modest yet earned within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme is potent and coherent—redefining mercy through renaming and action—but it edges into overt statement (“Mercy is not a plea”) that partially supplants subtext. The best resonance arises from particulars (child’s renaming of fear, the scholar burning her books) which could have carried more weight with less declaration. Still, the final image reframes earlier details effectively. Slight sermonizing in the climax dampens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and stable in distance, with elevated diction that matches the ritual tone. Dialogue, when used, is purposeful and distinct (magistrate’s whisper vs. Elira’s struck‑bronze cadence). Perceptual signature remains consistent, anchored in touch and fragmental echoes. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line work is polished with varied rhythm and strong verb choice; images do double duty for mood and action. A few stretches flirt with purple or repetition, but remain coherent and purposeful. Information density supports momentum without scaffolding residue. The prose sustains clarity through the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of “aberrant mercy,” renaming as praxis, and the concrete tessera ritual feels fresh and memorable. The magistrate moment grounds the concept in a sharp, human exchange. Risks are taken in the lyric-ritual mode without obscuring clarity. Only the slight didactic tilt tempers the impression of total originality.</comment>
