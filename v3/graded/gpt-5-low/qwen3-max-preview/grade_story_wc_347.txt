<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (prevent the chorus from growing) paired with a resigned temperament yields a credible, specific interiority. His “arithmetic” altruism and offhand precision create a lived tension between reluctance and care. Micro‑choices under pressure—heel‑drags, pebble clusters, coded whistles—embody character. The cost is an earned stasis: he relinquishes recognition or relief and returns to the orchard’s heart.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate and clean; the causal thread (lost girl + frost clock → guidance tactics → handoff → return) holds. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he saves one and recommits to the burden as frost feathers the branches. The cost is present but quiet; the rescue resolves largely without frictive setback, which trims peak intensity. Still, the final image reweights the premise with restraint and price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The labyrinth, shale, frost, and mechanical birds are tactile and purpose‑driven, shaping stealth tactics and the no‑touch method. Environmental rules are taught through action (alarms, twilight visibility, frost tightening). The recurring nut functions as object‑as‑setting by encoding the map and charging the handoff. Setting charges the ending image (frost, central grove) without ornamental excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and tightens under the frost clock; his tactics adapt (non‑triggering signs, acoustics) to avoid the birds/wards. The find‑and‑handoff sequence provides the single meaningful deepening. The price is endurance rather than injury or rupture; opposition (birds/curse) stays atmospheric, keeping escalation textured rather than combative. Still, agency drives outcome and forecloses relief.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Duty without heroism, invisible care, and memory as refuge cohere through images (nut/blueprint, twilight arrows, frost). “Graceless beauty” is earned by particulars, not stated moralizing; the girl’s line reframes him, then the nut handoff reprices meaning. The ending’s charged stasis invites reflection on cost and refusal. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant without blur.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with precise diction (“offhandedly exact”) suits the POV and never overreaches. Dialogue is minimal yet character‑specific and subtextual. Narrative distance stays steady; no head‑hopping or explanatory crutching. Rhythm modulates well between image density and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; images are fresh and coherent. Figurative density is high but disciplined; no muddled vehicles or loops dull momentum. Variation in syntax and paragraphing supports cadence. Minor lushness remains subordinate to clarity, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mechanical birds + cursed orchard + mnemonic nut + “offhandedly exact” caretaker yields a non‑obvious synthesis. The guidance method (impressions without touching) feels inventive and integral. The quiet, arithmetic motive undercuts tropey heroism. Risks are measured and coherent, though opposition could sharpen for even greater distinctiveness.</comment>
