<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear motive and interiority drive concrete choices: she proposes neutral ground, refuses the list, demands memorized names, and trades relics. Contradictory impulses—old rage vs earned listening—register credibly. The relationship dynamic shifts from adversarial history to tentative co-creation and reads earned. A few aphoristic lines skate toward telling, but her actions anchor them.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single-scene situational design coheres, with an RR/Charged Poise closure when they exchange relics and walk off together. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph, and the persistent constraint (history, guilt) shapes tactics. Cost is felt in the demand to name the erased and in giving up talismans. The closure is quiet but legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The parapet, mist, and wind are vivid and purposeful, mirroring exposure and neutrality (“where the wind doesn’t take sides”). The environment subtly constrains—no cover, no flags, only vulnerability—charging the final image of the mist swallowing division. Micro-objects (drawer pull, key) function as setting-charged tools in the last beats. Detail is selective and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure tightens via the shift from transactional list to moral accounting (“Did you bring the names you buried?”) and culminates in the exchange of relics. Stakes are internal/ethical rather than tactical; still, the on-page ask-and-answer forces a stance. The price—recognition of complicity and relinquishing personal talismans—is clear. External stakes (the prisoner list) recede, but the pivot reads intentional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motifs (neutral ground, silence as currency, moon phases) accrue toward a resonant answer about reconciliation as shared vulnerability. The drawer pull/hinge metaphor reweights at the end through the swap. A few lines verge on thesis statements, but the final image lets subtext carry meaning. The complexity of guilt and memory avoids neat moralizing in the last paragraph.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with disciplined distance; dialogue is spare, subtextual, and character-distinct. Aphoristic sentences are mostly earned by the voice’s control and patterning. Rhythm modulates well between wind-stripped description and tight exchanges. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong cadence and economy; images do double duty (weather as neutrality, objects as history). Minor aphorism density risks preciousness but rarely slows momentum. No evident loops or muddled metaphors; syntax varies with purpose. The final line lands cleanly without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Swapping ghosts” via exchanged relics on a storm-worn parapet is a fresh inflection on reconciliation tropes. The moon-phase timing metaphor integrates with stance rather than gimmick. Familiar elements (neutral ground, talisman) are recombined with specificity and restraint. The result feels singular and thoughtfully risky without obscuring clarity.</comment>
