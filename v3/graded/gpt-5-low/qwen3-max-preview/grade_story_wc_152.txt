<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—she listens for “unheard stories” and acts decisively when the flame trembles. Interiority is particular and embodied through craft gestures and breath with the candle. Limited contradiction: she’s steady under pressure, with little on‑page ambivalence beyond the strategic “foolishness” disguise. Relationship pressure is off‑stage; her solitude trims some complexity but keeps focus taut.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: flame shudders → synchronization → adjacent-layer reconnaissance → counter‑stitching → coup falters. Orientation lands immediately and holds; the lens remains causal through closure. The cost is implied (exhaustion, seizure of her workspace, risk) rather than dramatized as a concrete loss, but the decisive reconfiguration (“adjacent possibilities collapsed into one: hers”) is on‑page. Tight, legible architecture for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purpose‑driven: the cobalt observatory, autumn light, and the eternal candle integrate with action rather than sit as backdrop. The candle functions as a micro‑setting object that constrains choices and charges the final image. World rules (adjacent possibilities via resonance) are consistent and taught through use. Sensory selection tracks her professional bias toward textiles, light, and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (preventing a coup) are signaled early and tighten with the flame’s violent shudder and the reconnaissance step. Escalation is protagonist‑driven—she crafts decoys, maps escapes, weaponizes misdirection. The cost is more conceptual than visceral; we don’t witness a hard loss, though seizure of the observatory and her spent state gesture at price. The resolution is earned by her tactics rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: quiet wisdom disguised as folly, truth found through attention and craft, and the ethics of lying to save a truth. Recurring images (thread, flame, adjacent layers) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final stasis—“they called her a fool still, even as they bowed”—lands as a resonant answer to the piece’s question about how wisdom survives power. Subtext is embedded in her tactics rather than stated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>POV is steady, lyrical third with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in textile and celestial lexicons. Rhythm modulates with pressure (calm cadence → shudder → swift stitching) while staying legible. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and action. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and minimal scaffolding. Occasional stacked imagery (“shadows that claw,” “needle like a comet”) skirts richness but remains coherent. Syntax varies and momentum is preserved through the climax. The final image cleanly reprises earlier motifs without purple spill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an embroiderer as operative cartographer of adjacent realities, with the flame as instrument of resonance, feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The tactical use of craft to wage a counter‑coup is inventive without gimmick. Risks in lyric density and world logic pay off cleanly. The closure image is memorable and thematically precise.</comment>
