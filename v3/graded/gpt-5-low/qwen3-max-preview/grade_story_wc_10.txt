<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, coherent motivation (to translate silence into music) and embodied emotion (skin, bones, heart as instruments) anchor her interiority. The contradiction—grief versus pragmatic resolve—registers but never strains under live pressure, keeping conflict relatively low‑heat. Micro‑choices (fork selection, warming the C512 against her wrist, where to strike) reveal values without therapy‑speak. Change is an earned stance: she commits to continuing the work, with the cost of lost voice and crew still humming beneath the final image.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: successive activations create a pattern that culminates in a Charged Poise ending (hand on frost, earth’s thrum, return tomorrow). Orientation is clean from the outset; the single‑scene progression is legible. Closure lands with a felt reconfiguration of meaning rather than a decisive act; cost is implicit but present. Minor limitation: escalation is gentle, with few narrowing options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is tactile, rule‑bearing, and tactic‑shaping: ice’s crystalline response makes vibration, not sound, the operative pathway. Tools (tuning forks, visor) and environment interlock to constrain choices and charge the final image. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action. The setting’s specifics (fountain, skylight, glass beams) meaningfully guide her moves and the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early; the key deepening is when the ice “sings back” and the thermal map begins to stitch into a score. Pressure coheres through the pattern of awakenings, but options rarely narrow and there’s minimal on‑page cost beyond endurance. Resolution is earned via agency (methodic strikes, mapping), albeit with low resistance. The gentle arc suits the lens but limits intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of silence versus absence and “unshaken marvels” emerge organically from method and setting, culminating in the tactile hearing of earth’s thrum. The motif of translation (sound→heat) reweights earlier images at the end. Slight overt statement (“not the absence of noise, but the presence…”) flirts with editorial moralizing. Overall resonance is authentic and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—precision in sensory substitutions and instrumentality of the body. Diction and rhythm modulate without head‑hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision and patterned phrasing are taught early and pay off. No dialogue, but the voice remains sharply coherent under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences do multiple jobs, balancing clarity and image; figurative language stays within the established physics. A few intensifiers and parallelisms repeat for cadence, not padding; momentum generally holds. No significant loops or scaffold artifacts; proofreading is clean. The lyric density is high but controlled, avoiding purple muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Heat‑mapping emotions translated via tuning forks into silent resonance is a fresh, integrated conceit. The synthesis of tool, environment, and loss feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold yet coherent risk‑taking in concept and line elevates without obscuring closure. Slightly softer stakes prevent the leap to the rarest tier.</comment>
