<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and embodied in micro‑choices: she builds, places the wing, refuses to touch the descending monarch. The paradox “transiently rooted” is dramatized rather than told through the tender, easily unraveled knots. Emotional texture remains concrete (dew, moss, trembling fingers) rather than abstract. The arc is an earned endurance/renunciation with visible cost: beauty without audience and letting the shrine dissolve.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: ritual actions layer toward the monarch’s benediction and her refusal. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she bows and withdraws, foreclosing touch and possession, with the cost legible on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear within the opening lines, and the final image reweights the premise. The rain/wind dissolution forecast ties the structure to cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto above the clouds, lichen, stump, and mist are vivid, integrated, and purpose‑driven, shaping solitude and the shrine’s fragility. The setting charges the final image as the monarch lands and lifts, and the altitude implies no audience will intrude. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her reverent attention. The environment functions as both stage and constraint for her method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on honoring the vanishing without claiming it; pressure deepens as the ritual nears completion and a monarch descends. The tightening choice—refuse to touch, tie the final tender knot—forecloses a path (souvenir, interference) with felt cost. The breeze and hush serve as a cadence shift that intensifies the moment. It’s quiet, but the ethical calculus is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of ephemerality, witness over possession, and memory versus erasure arise from concrete acts (temporary knots, dissolving shrine) rather than sermon. Recurring images (wing, knots, blush, breath) return reweighted in the ending. One declarative line on permanence skirts abstraction but is supported by surrounding scene work. The final benediction and withdrawal provide a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains throughout; diction and rhythm suit a devotional attention. POV distance is steady and plausible; no leakage or head‑hopping. Patterned elisions (refrains like “No one would…”) feel intentional and effective. The modulation at the climax (hush, benediction) lands without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; imagery is precise and not overwrought. Repetition is purposeful and sparing; no significant paraphrase loops dull momentum. Syntax varies and supports cadence shifts at key beats. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—devotional ecology, “signals” to memory, interrupted cadence ritual—is fresh and specific. The final refusal transforms familiar nature‑writing tropes into an ethic with cost. Risks in tone and structure pay off with a coherent closure. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
