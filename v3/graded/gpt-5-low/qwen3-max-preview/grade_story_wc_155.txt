<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elira’s motives and contradictions (acclaim/expectation versus unguarded joy) are clear and drive concrete choices: seeking elders, building the apparatus, choosing resonance over preservation. Her embodied reactions—laughing fully, pocketing the shard as “a key”—mark an earned internal shift. Minor softness remains in how much cost is felt versus stated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery at dawn → oral histories → noon projection → communal response → reconfigured aim. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a legible price—the renunciation of “preservation” for rediscovery—on the page. Orientation is clean early; causal links are coherent and pay off at the projection and its aftermath.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fog, orchard ruins, arches, and noon sun are not mere backdrop; fog functions as emulsion and constrains tactics and timing. Lenses, prisms, and copper reflectors are tool‑specific and charged in the final image (fog curling like a cat). Environmental logic is consistent and deeply integrated with theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through density and timing (noon blade through gauze) to the projection climax; the communal reactions amplify stakes. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual, not material, keeping tension quieter but focused. One meaningful deepening occurs as “display” becomes “resurrection,” narrowing her path forward.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of rediscovery over preservation is earned through particulars (oral histories, warmth under a child’s palm, fog as developer). A single explicit line (“her motivation had never been preservation — it was rediscovery”) edges toward telling, but most resonance is image‑led. The ending reweights prior motifs without a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person closely held to Elira’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful. Sensory bias fits her craft (light, color, optics), with controlled elevation and no head‑hopping. Minor flourishiness never muddies clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient for this mode; images (“blade through gauze,” “breath on glass”) are clean and carry multiple jobs. No noticeable loops or scaffolding; momentum builds smoothly into the noon set‑piece and soft landing. Slight lushness in places, but metaphor logic holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Optical muralism using fog as emulsion is a fresh synthesis; the ancestral knowledge network grounds the magic with human texture. The turn from “display” to “resurrected spirit” feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens meaning without sacrificing legibility.</comment>
