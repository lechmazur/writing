<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority anchored in tactile craft and guilt; the wilt near his chest ties motivation to action. His choice to sing rather than tinker reveals values under pressure and earns the moral turn. Minor softness: the redemption lands smoothly with little residue of ambivalence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: wilt → truth-seeking → song → embedding → reclaimed light. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the acceptance of guilt and a new vow—and the midnight clock pays off on the page. No causality breaks; each step flows from prior pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber—copper pipes, glass bells—actively participates (sympathetic vibration) and charges the final image as it blazes with reclaimed light. Details are POV-filtered through craft and sound, not a catalog. Environment constrains tactics (song over tools) and shapes the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim light by midnight) tightens via the chip’s sorrow-wilt and the imminent shadows. The key choice—eschew repair for truth-song and embed the chip—narrows options credibly. Costs skew internal and aesthetic rather than materially risky, but pressure coheres.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of truth through wear (“covenant of rust”) is earned through events and reweighted at the end. A few declarative lines (“Rust strips away pretense”) flirt with telling, but the dancer’s restored arm as resonance incarnate grounds subtext. The final image answers without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, lyrical third-person close with consistent diction and sensory bias toward sound and craft. Rhythm modulates well at turns (wilt, song, blaze) without head-hopping or register slips. Occasional aphoristic statements slightly temper the otherwise superb control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; images stay coherent to sound, metal, light. Minimal scaffold and no confusing loops; momentum sustains through the climax. A few thematic declarations edge toward purple but do not obscure clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: philosopher’s stone as honesty-sensor, “covenant of rust,” and a sonic repair liturgy feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mysticism, object-metaphysics) are fully integrated with character and setting. The reconfiguration via resonance rather than mechanics is non-obvious and memorable.</comment>
