<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear motive (linking absences; smuggling hope) drives precise micro-choices: rerouting through vents, using Marla’s grid, launching despite risk. The “respectfully rebellious” stance is dramatized (bowing to guards, omitting truth) rather than labeled. Internal conflict is subtle but present—principled law‑bending versus deference. The cost lands as emotional weight more than a stark renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: heavier object → increased surveillance → tactical reroute → camouflage via storm-mimic grid → launch. Orientation is strong early; the lens holds through a quiet, earned closing image (child and thunder). Closure reads as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: options reweighted by a risky act with felt cost. The risk remains untested on-page, softening impact slightly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, integrated environment—ozone/burnt sugar, cobalt glow, skylight—shapes tactics (ventilation shafts, grid storm-mimicry) and charges the final image. World rules (drone lattice, sensors, weather-avoidance) are learned through action, not dump. The arcade functions as tool and sanctuary, not mere backdrop. Sensory selection is POV-specific and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (deliverance across a perilous border) with one meaningful tightening (interceptors → basement reroute and EM masking). Agency drives escalation; the protagonist chooses risk and method. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than an on-page loss, tempering the peak pressure. Still, the narrowing of options reads cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of absence, borders, and promise-keeping emerge organically through objects and acts (“not mail but mercy,” “nature’s still the best smuggler”). The storm reweights meaning at the end without moralizing. Subtext (respectful rebellion; law’s blind spots) works in implication and image. A few declarative lines verge on on‑the‑nose but remain earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV; diction and imagery suit the character’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and subtextual. Rhythm modulates well between hush and urgency. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs (storm as tool, sign, and theme). Figurative language is lush but coherent; minimal redundancy or scaffold. Syntax varies and sustains momentum. A few stacked metaphors brush purple but do not blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a borderland mailman, an arcade‑as‑weather shield, a bottled storm as courier camouflage. The final reconfiguration (“nature’s still the best smuggler”) lands as both tactic and theme. Risks are aesthetic and conceptual without obscuring clarity. Specifics prevent template drift.</comment>
