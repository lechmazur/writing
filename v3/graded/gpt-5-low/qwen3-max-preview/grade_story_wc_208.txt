<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motives (salvage → meaning) are clear, embodied, and deepen under pressure from storm and career demands. Contradictory impulses—monetization vs. communal making—coexist on the page and are resolved by a credible renunciation (leaving the piece unclaimed, walking inland to teach). Her micro-choices (lighting the slide, carving an arch-within-arch, projecting) reveal values through action. Cost is present though conceptual rather than bodily.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the slide vision → carving → projection → teaching choice → communal uptake. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she abandons ownership/market path for communal stewardship. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the brief “days later” shard pays off the pattern without breaking coherence. All set-ups (slide, projector, arch) pay off in the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archway/storm are tactile and constraint-bearing: wind, ribs, and geometry shape tactics (carving, alignment, projection). Tools (lantern, projector, chisels) are integrated and charge the closing image. The environment’s “turbine-hum” mirrors interior state without feeling imposed. Setting is indispensable to the final projection tableau.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on art’s purpose under duress; pressure coheres and tightens once (the slide’s revelation) into a decisive praxis shift. The storm and failing GPS add situational squeeze, but conflict remains primarily internal and meditative. Cost is legible as renunciation rather than loss-in-scene. Escalation is sufficient for length, if quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thematic weave (communal alliance over tech, simplicity as architecture) is strong and image-led through clasped hands and negative space. However, the aphoristic whisper “Simplicity is not absence. It is architecture.” states the thesis too baldly in the final third, softening subtext. Otherwise, the ending reweights earlier motifs effectively via communal ritual. Emotional aftereffect is genuine, not saccharine.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinctive perceptual signature (maker’s eye, tidal lexicon) and controlled rhythm. Lyrical compression stays legible; no head-hopping or register drift. Cadence modulates from gale to held-breath stillness at the projection beat. The voice feels character-specific rather than generic poeticism.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with vivid yet disciplined figurative work (salt dissolving, sedimented trust) and minimal scaffolding. Syntax varies; momentum rarely stalls. A few stacked metaphors edge toward lushness but do not blur sense or closure. Mechanics are clean, with purposeful repetition patterns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: driftwood sculpture + magic lantern + timewoven alliances grounded in specific craft choices. The arch-within-arch and negative-space silhouettes feel inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric mode, communal coda) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The final communal ritual image distinguishes the piece from familiar “storm epiphany” templates.</comment>
