<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elias’s contradiction—“amoral philanthropist” with a private atonement—drives every choice, culminating in the ritualized non-act of leaving the egg. Interiority is specific and embodied (salt crunch, breath, recalled recording), not label-speak. The renunciation (not resurrecting, not retrieving) forecloses paths with cost. Minor hedge: pressure is almost entirely internal, but it remains credible and live.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: setup → ritual → resonance → relinquishment culminating in a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis. Who/where/when are anchored early; the luminous cracks and thinning thunder escalate to a charged final image. The cost is on-page (forgoing possession and accepting future ruthlessness). No causality breaks; each move coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The salt flat is vivid and integral—acoustics, mineral crust, glowing fissures—shaping action and the final image. The environment and recurring objects (egg, map) charge closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (sound as central sense). World rules are consistent within its magical-realist register.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (atonement through echo, not life) is clear and tightens through the ritual to leaving the egg behind. Escalation is tonal and textural (resonance, glowing cracks) rather than adversarial, yet it narrows options credibly. The price—relinquishment and ongoing complicity—lands. Slightly low external pressure keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of harm-for-good, elegy versus resurrection, and the ethics of echo are earned through concrete action and image, not stated morals. The final repricing—“Not life. Not justice. But echo.”—reweights all prior material. Ambiguity is meaningful: restitution without redemption. The resonance lingers without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature—sound-obsessed, precision without overexplanation. Rhythm modulates effectively (short refusals: “He didn’t bury it. / He didn’t smash it.”) to sharpen turns. No head-hopping or stance drift. Elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is elegant and economical; images carry multiple jobs. Parallelism and repetition are purposeful rather than loop-scaffold. A few lush choices (“bruised purple,” “fractured grace”) flirt with purple but never blur sense. Momentum holds through to the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: an amoral donor staging a sonic elegy on a self-made salt flat with a lichen-silt map. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight given his history and obsession with echoes. Risks in tone and magical-realist mechanics heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Memorable, specific, and non-obvious.</comment>
