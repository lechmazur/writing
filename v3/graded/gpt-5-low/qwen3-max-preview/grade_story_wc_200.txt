<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and motive (“not to banish… but to pursue”) drive concrete micro‑choices—the flute to harmonize rather than overpower, the foolish trill to risk levity. Embodied emotion shows in tactile anchors (tooth warmth, “luminous ache”). A modest internal contradiction (fear alongside chosen tenderness) is present, though her flaw set is gentled and rarely pressures a costly choice. The endurance at the end reads earned, if not harrowed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clean: approach → confessions accrete → harmonization → laughter integration → charged departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the gorge’s melody softens and the ghosts integrate, with the price felt in “not lighter, but fuller.” Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when). No causality slips; the tool and environment pay off on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge and its “misaligned harp” are vividly sensorial and functionally constraining—they dictate method (harmonize, don’t dominate) and shape the climax. The crocodile tooth and sunrise further charge the final image. World rules (sorrow warping resonance) are taught through action, not exposition. The environment is inseparable from choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrating grief into healing) tightens as confessions layer and she chooses a risky tonal shift with the “light, foolish” trill, inviting a fragile reversal (laughter). Cost is emotional rather than physical but is legible and reweights the ending. Pressure is consistent if gentle; danger is low, yet agency drives the turn. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: grief and laughter as siblings; integration over redemption is dramatized by harmonizing the broken harp and the ghosts’ laughter. The final image reweights prior images without overexplaining. Some lines verge on thesis (“She knew grief needed no fixing”), edging into didactic clarity that blunts mystery. Still, the resonance is earned through particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is controlled, sensuous, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates effectively around peak beats (the trill, the shudder). Dialogue snippets (confessions) are spare and purposeful. No head‑hopping or stance drift; distance is steady and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with strong image economy; most lines do multiple jobs (world, mood, action). Figurative language is abundant but largely coherent and tethered to the diegesis (sound/harp/resonance). Minimal redundancy; cadence varies. A few elevated phrases flirt with purple, but clarity holds at the peak and ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—geology as warped instrument, a tooth that “remembers,” and laughter as healing’s seam—is fresh and cohesive. Risks in tone and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established rules. The piece reads like a singular vision rather than a template.</comment>
