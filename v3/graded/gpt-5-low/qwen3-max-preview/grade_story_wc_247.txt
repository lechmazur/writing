<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—becoming a vessel to “translate silence into music”—is specific and consistently embodied in gesture and choice. Contradictory impulses (joyful sorrow; the pact to be forgotten) register without tidy resolution. Relationships add pressure: Silas frames the cost and mirrors her motions; the girl’s arrival tests Elara’s credo. Minor limitation: Elara encounters little resistance beyond ethos, so struggle is more devotional than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: gestures → framing click → the girl’s “Show me” → teaching under moonlight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: art as unarchived presence, with the cost of anonymity explicitly accepted (“That was the pact”). Orientation is clean and the one‑scene arc coheres. The causal thread is light, but the cadence shift when the child joins supplies a clear tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harbor is rendered with tactile specificity—mercury sheen, creak of rope, lantern flickers—and is integrated into action (“concert hall,” “wind as conductor”). Details are filtered through Elara’s musicalized perception, avoiding tourist catalog. The setting charges the final image (sea and stars as sole audience), though it rarely constrains options. Strong atmosphere without hard constraint keeps it below the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate around whether Elara can make felt music from silence and accept vanishing memory as the price. Escalation is quiet but real: from solitary mapping to the catalytic click to a live pupil asking “Show me.” The cost—choosing release over capture—is made explicit and dramatized through the camera’s non‑use. Lacks a counterforce that resists her aim beyond ethos, keeping pressure elegant but not intense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: signing as composition, framing without capture, and the pact of impermanence. The final echo reweights the premise—felt over archived—with emotional aftereffect. A few lines verge on thesis statements (“silence is not absence. It is the canvas.”), slightly flattening subtext. Nonetheless, resonance is earned by event and image, not summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that musicalizes environment. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtextual; Silas’s whisper contrasts effectively with Elara’s embodied language. Psychic distance remains steady and apt for the mood. Rhythm modulates well at the girl’s entrance and in the charged final cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: strong verbs and sensuous specificity carry multiple jobs per sentence. Figurative choices are coherent and patterned (sound → gesture → environment), with minimal redundancy. A few formulations flirt with purple but don’t clog momentum. The closing sequence is crisp and memorable without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—sign language as musical composition, a film‑less camera as release mechanism, and a vow of impermanence—is fresh and coherent. The “click” that captures resonance instead of image reimagines a familiar object with flair. Small risks (whispering advisor, lyric register) are integrated rather than gimmicky. Slight familiarity in aphoristic lines prevents a leap to the rarest band.</comment>
