<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she stays to convert confusion into exploration, rooted in family ritual. Interiority is specific (compass rose, grandmother’s advice) and embodied (mist on glass, pulsing applique). Micro‑choices—taking out the sketchbook, deciding to sketch the anomaly—reveal values. The internal contradiction (blessed vs. pariah; anchor vs. current) is present but lightly pressured rather than acutely dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: observation → sketching → anomaly → witnessing/closure. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the final reconfiguration (“echoed silence now companionable”) lands. Cost is conceptual/emotional (choosing isolation and the burden of being the anomaly) rather than decisively dramatized, but it is legible on the page. Quiet closure via witnessing the filament’s absorption reads earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: chilled glass, humming deck, temporally stretched sky all filter through her trained attention. The deck and chronometric shutdown are not postcard backdrops; they enable her tactic (sketching what time has altered). Recurring object-as-setting (compass rose, sketchbook) charges the final image. Constraint is more atmospheric than logistical, which keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to remain and witness) is clear; escalation arrives with the violet filament, which she chooses to engage by sketching. Pressure is primarily internal and aesthetic, not adversarial, so the narrowing of options is subtle. The filament’s brief shimmer/vanish provides a clean tightening and test of purpose. Costs remain mostly implied (social exile) rather than paid on‑page in this scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres around true north as presence and attention under altered time, earned through concrete ritual and image. The final repricing—that witnessing can “grant peace” and that silence becomes companionable—reweights the premise. One explicit line (“true north wasn’t celestial. It was the choice…”) edges toward stating the thesis, but it’s well‑earned by prior particulars. Subtext operates in objects and cadence more than declaration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable, close third with a distinct perceptual signature (tool/sky bias, ritual lexicon). Diction and rhythm align with her contemplative, practiced gaze; quoted family lines add texture without breaking distance. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off. Lyrical control holds under the anomaly without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is frequent but coherent to the motif; few, if any, paraphrase loops. A handful of lush metaphors flirt with purple but remain voice‑justified and clear. Momentum is steady for a lyric piece and the final line precisely recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Time‑dilation plus a hereditary sky‑sketch ritual and a charged compass rose feels fresh and organically fused to character. The “witnessing grants peace” turn is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight given the pattern. Risks are taken in committing to quiet, accumulative pressure without external plot tricks. The synthesis is memorable and specific rather than template‑driven.</comment>
