<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s motive—returning after failures to bind peace through ceremony—is concrete and consistent, with credible endurance as the final stance. Interiority is specific (ink, bone pen, etched failures) and tied to embodied action. Internal contradiction (frayed conviction vs. relentless return) is present without melodrama. The survivors are more tableau than interlocutors, so relational pressure remains limited.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: solitary preparation → ritual writing → communal signing → dawn. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: peace is mustered, not won; cost is her sustained return and the imperfect mosaic of prints. Orientation is clean from the opening and causal throughline never breaks. The on‑page cost is conceptual/emotional rather than tactical, but it’s legible at the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The terrace, triple moons, volcanic stone, and dais are vivid and purposeful; the site’s witnessed oaths constrain method and enable the plan. The clipboard, ink, and bone pen function as micro‑setting tools charging the final image. World rules (cosmic witness via moons/oaths) are conveyed through action, not exposition dumps. The environment materially shapes the choice to pursue ceremony here and now.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: muster a binding peace via ritual; the tightening arrives when the sentries ascend and consent is tested. Agency drives escalation (she prepares, writes, reframes the treaty as a mirror, invites signatures). The price is borne internally and symbolically; external resistance is minimal, keeping pressure refined rather than volatile. The cadence shift at the horns and dawn reads as a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—redemption’s price and fusing sacred with political—emerges from particulars (meteorite ink, oath‑witnessing moons, “mirror” treaty) and culminates in a flawed, collective signature. A few lines verge on statement (“Redemption… was never free”), but they’re earned by the ritual action. The final image reweights earlier motifs without a tidy moral. Ambiguity remains: peace is mustered, not secured.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elira’s sensibility; diction fits the ritual gravity. The single line of dialogue is spare and charged, aligning with her “operatively gentle” register. Psychic distance stays stable and purposeful. Rhythm modulates well from solitary preparation to communal hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence craft is polished with high information density; images do multiple jobs (ink as truth/rarity, clipboard as scripture/shield). Figurative language is lush but coherent and seldom redundant; momentum holds. No loops or scaffold clutter. A touch of overt abstraction appears, but it doesn’t blunt the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—peacebuilding as sacred ritual under cosmic witness, enacted through rare materials—feels fresh and integral. The clipboard-as-liturgical text and “mirror” treaty reframing add non‑obvious turns. Risks are taken in quiet stakes and ceremonial action rather than spectacle, and they pay off. Some tropes (forever war, triple moons) are familiar but transformed by specificity.</comment>
