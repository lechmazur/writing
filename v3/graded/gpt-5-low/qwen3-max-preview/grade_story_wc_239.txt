<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interiority and motive (clarity over dominion) are strong and consistent, and the surrender at the end carries a credible cost (loss of self/language). However, pressure rarely forces contradictory impulses in scene—she barely wavers—so the arc reads serenely assured rather than contested. Micro-choices (selecting shelf, reciting the axiom, consenting to be read) do reveal values but don’t show real struggle. The earned renunciation still lands due to the price paid and prior setup.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and sustained: shelves by resonance, axioms, “hiccups,” and inversion sequences escalate to surrender and reconfiguration. Closure arrives on-page as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she becomes the lens/hush—with the cost of self and language legible. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~120 words), and the pattern of deepening is coherent. One could ask for a sharper mid-beat tightening, but cadence and density shifts suffice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library is exquisitely particular and functional: shelves sort by resonance, time eddies, the library “reads” her—these constraints guide choices and culminate in the domeless sky of eyes. The dictionary as micro-setting tool charges the final image as it dissolves. World rules stay consistent and are learned through her acts; atmosphere and specificity are purposeful. The environment directly shapes the ending, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes stay internal (coherence vs. self) and escalate via ritual phases: axiom spoken, inversion sequence, consent to be read, dissolution, lenshood. The tightening is clear when surrender becomes necessary; cost is visible in the shedding of language/identity. Pressure remains serene—no external opposition or missteps—so tension is more meditative than combative. Still, the single meaningful deepening lands under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of negotiated meaning and the unraveling of language integrates through action (axiom, dissolving dictionary) rather than lecture, culminating in a coherence that refuses blunt “truth.” The final reweighting—becoming the hush after—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A slight on-the-nose risk in lines like “Meaning is not discovered; it is negotiated...” trims the ceiling. Subtext otherwise hums through images (woven regret, books by resonance).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the POV’s certainty and aim; rhythmic modulation accompanies intensifications (negative-space flicker, surrender). No head-hopping; compression and elevated diction feel earned by the mythic frame. The perceptual signature—harmonic shelves, domeless eyes—remains distinct and coherent. Minimal exposition, no dialogue bloat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is taut despite density; figurative language is rich but largely coherent and purposeful, with minimal redundancy. Momentum is maintained via image progression and action-coupled description; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. A few lush constructions flirt with purple but don’t muddy closure. Final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>High-concept synthesis (spiral arbitration, resonance-shelved library, dictionary unmaking language) feels singular and inevitable by the end. Risks in diction and cosmology pay off with a fresh, coherent closure image. The piece avoids template mysticism by committing to specific mechanics (axiom, library reading her). Originality serves character and theme rather than ornament.</comment>
