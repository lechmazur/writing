<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s longing for belonging is concrete and drives each choice (embedding clues in sculptures, following the note, dedicating her name). Interiority is specific to her craft—braiding loneliness into bridges—rather than generic. Internal contradiction (aching solitude vs. deliberate myth‑making) is present but under-pressured. The cost at closure reads more as surrender of isolation than a hard trade‑off, keeping this just shy of outstanding.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link coherently: discovery of the arbor/tag → clue → night journey → dedication/loom reveal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when her sigil is woven into the arbor-web; the before/after is legible. Orientation is clear early and maintained. The felt cost is modest (risk and self‑exposure rather than a foreclosed alternative), trimming peak impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and obsidian arbor are vivid, sensorially rich, and filtered through Lira’s craft‑biased attention. Crucially, the arbor’s function as a memory‑loom constrains and enables the decisive act, charging the final image. World rules reveal themselves through interaction, not exposition. Tone and setting cohere to build atmosphere without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (find/earn kinship) and escalate through the note and nocturnal trek to the weeping grove. Pressure coheres, but resistance is gentle—Vesper is welcoming and obstacles are minimal—so the tightening is more cadence shift than crucible. Agency drives the turn (choosing to follow, then to dedicate). The visible price is primarily vulnerability, which reads but doesn’t bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: art as social weave, chosen kinship over blood, myth as first stitch of community. The final revaluation (“become the grafting point”) reframes prior acts from plea to welcome, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. Subtext works in objects—the arbor as loom, tags as kinship maps—without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful and rich.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in materials (reeds, glass, quartz). Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext and turn (the loom reveal). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without slipping register. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: dense yet purposeful imagery, strong verbs, and clean syntax. A few metaphors cluster (“hummed with trapped starlight,” “luminescent ache”) pushing toward lush, but clarity holds. Momentum rarely stalls despite lyricism; most sentences do more than one job. No notable loops or scaffolding artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a memory‑loom arbor, street art as kinship cartography, and reed sculpture clues in a crystalline orchard. The reveal reweights earlier motifs with inevitability. Risks (lyric-mythic register, quiet conflict) pay off with coherence and specificity. Emotional truth feels earned rather than templated.</comment>
