<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation and vocation are precise and embodied; her constraint (“prison is her purpose”) manifests in specific micro‑choices (orienting the lamp, refusing smiles, choosing endurance). Interiority is lyric but concrete through tactile acts. The father functions as pressure rather than partner, but that’s apt at this length. The final renunciation (weaving her own burden) reads earned with visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative structure teaches its pattern and pays it off with an Earned Stasis: she turns the tool inward, accepting endurance over release. Orientation is clear immediately; causality lands via ritual mechanics leading to calcification. Cost is legible in “not to be free. But to endure.” A hair shy of 9+ only because escalation remains largely tonal rather than turning options sharply.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, magnetic seam, and starlight fissure are not decorative; they constrain the ritual’s tactics and charge the final image. Object‑as‑setting (lamp) and environment integrate seamlessly. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through the weaver’s craft. World rules (calcification via orientation) remain consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmuting unbearable weight) is clear and tightens as the ritual deepens from the father’s burden to her own. Escalation is accumulative: density and cadence shift into the “shingled hush,” then to the inward turn. The price—continued servitude to purpose—is unmistakable. Lack of a harder reversal keeps it shy of the top band but remains fully coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief becoming bearable through form is earned through action and image, not thesis. Recurrences (orientation, halos, hush, calcification) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The closing lines offer a resonant non‑literal answer: endurance as sacred labor. Slight cap due to pressure’s subtlety rather than conceptual weakness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, coherent third‑person lyric voice with controlled distance; diction matches the myth‑craft milieu. Dialogue is minimal but natural and pressure‑bearing. Rhythm modulates with the ritual’s intensification. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, consistent metaphors (“shingled hush,” “eggshell holding moonlight”). A few lines verge on lushness, but coherence and propulsion hold; no paraphrase loops or cadence templates. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean. The closure image is sharp and unblurred by purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise (grief calcified via ritual orientation in a bronze grotto) feels singular and internally inevitable. The tool‑world‑theme synthesis is fresh and lived‑in. The inward flip at the end is non‑obvious yet prepared. Bold lyric risk pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
