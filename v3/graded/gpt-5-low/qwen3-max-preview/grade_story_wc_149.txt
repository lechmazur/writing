<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is lucid (repay a debt across lifetimes), and the ghost bride’s devotion-as-vengeance gives her choices bite; Elara’s moment of acceptance adds a second, if slimmer, arc. Interiority is mostly implied through image rather than thought, limiting contradiction-on-the-page. The visible cost—the bride’s dissolution into the system—is earned. Slight distance from Elara’s internal struggle keeps this shy of top-tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: patterns (cameos, bead resonance, orchard sleep) intensify toward a clear RR closure when burden becomes heritage. Causality is legible within the lyric frame: appearance → transfer → infusion → awakening. Cost is on-page in the bride’s unraveling and permanent reconfiguration of the orchard’s state. Orientation is early and clean; no lens wobble at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the endless-night greenhouse and winter fields shape mood and the final image. The “covenant” of night and glass architecture charge the closure (twilight fruit, humming panes). While not a hard constraint on tactics, the environment’s rules and textures are integral to meaning. Specific sensory motifs recur without feeling touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Primary stake (breaking/transmitting the curse-debt) tightens when the bride targets Elara and relinquishes the bead. Escalation is quiet but real: a cadence shift from haunting to handover to systemic awakening. Agency sits with the bride’s renunciation and Elara’s acceptance; the price is the bride’s self-dissolution. Pressure is coherent, if more devotional than combative.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of love curdled into duty, debt as balance, and inheritance over vengeance emerge organically through object/action, not sermon. The “balance” line risks explicitness, but it’s dramatized by the transmission and sensory replay. The final image (twilight fruit etched with runes; nectar of vows) reweights earlier motifs. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled lyrical omniscience with a distinct sonic texture; no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm fit the gothic-alchemical frame and modulate effectively at the climax. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful, preserving tone. No register slips that break the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images do multiple jobs and momentum holds. Occasional density risks purple, but clarity survives and key beats land cleanly. Parallel constructions (“Glass panes hummed. Stems straightened.”) sharpen cadence rather than loop. No substantive scaffold or synonym churn in the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemical greenhouse, rune-bead resonance, devotion-as-venom—feels fresh and internally coherent. The turn from haunting to heritage is non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off in a memorable final reconfiguration. Familiar tropes are transformed by specific, charged particulars.</comment>
