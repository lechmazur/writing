<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation and embodied patience anchor her choices; the blood-signature is a concrete, values-driven micro‑choice. However, internal contradiction is minimal—competence and serenity face little challenge beyond endurance. The cost (cold, blood) is felt but modest. Still, reactions to objects reveal a distinct temperament without stock cues.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clean: the ritual’s patterned placements tighten into the blood‑seal, glow, hum, and pulse‑map realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves with a living map and the world “resumes breathing,” a before/after shift with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp in the opening lines. Slight limitation: escalation remains gentle, with no sharp constraint beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The subarctic crater orchard and its stillness pervade action, supplying materials (discarded items) and constraints (cold, breath, alignment over the rim). Environmental specifics evolve with events—the blood hissing on frost, the plate warming, wind and wolf at release. The setting charges the final image as she departs with the warm plate against her chest. Highly selective, character‑filtered detail avoids tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revelation through listening) is signaled early and deepens through the blood‑seal that triggers the map’s activation. Pressure coheres via patience/endurance rather than overt opposition; the key tightening is the humming plate syncing to her pulse. Visible price is modest but present. The absence of a counterforce or meaningful trade‑off keeps intensity below top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of revelation over transformation, listening to the land, and turning debris into direction accrue organically through ritual acts. The final charged poise—carrying a living pulse‑map—reweights prior images without moralizing. Recurring motifs (breath, blood‑as‑witness, starlight) return with new weight. Complexity holds without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with controlled rhythm and diction consistent to the focalizer’s sensibility. Psychic distance is steady and intimate; patterned repetition (“She did not flinch. She did not rush.”) is purposeful. No head‑hopping or register drift. Musicality supports pressure without obscuring sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet precise; images perform multiple jobs (world, action, theme). Repetition is intentional and carries momentum; minimal scaffolding. A few ornate metaphors edge toward excess but do not blur causality or the closure image. Syntax varies to match breath and stillness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Alchemy reframed as revelation via pulse‑cartography and safekept starlight feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The discarded‑items method and blood‑as‑signature synthesize concept and character. Risks in diction and design pay off without confusion. Novelty is anchored in felt human stakes (patience, witness, care).</comment>
