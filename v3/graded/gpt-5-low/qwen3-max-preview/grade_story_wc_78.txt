<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation—“turn obstacles into instruments”—drives every choice, and the mentor–apprentice dynamic adds lived pressure. Interiority is mostly enacted through craft rather than thought, which keeps mystery but limits contradiction on the page. The handoff to Kael is motivated and revealing. A deeper flicker of doubt or cost in the Prophet would have pushed this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: cloud‑score → wave‑xylophone → blackening sea → root‑note and fruit percussion → apprentice’s strike. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the system releases into harmonic rain and the tide turns inward. Causality is legible within the world’s rules; the price is modest but present (exhaustion, transfer of instrument/role). Orientation is crisp from line one; no lens slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely specific and functionally integral: the driftwood ring, salt‑drinking trees, kelp membranes, and wave‑xylophone directly constrain tactics. Objects (whalebone mallet, conch, fruit) are used, not toured, and the environment charges the final image. Rules are learned through action without dump. Sensory palette is balanced and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure escalates coherently under the accumulative lens: fractal urgency → sea densifies → Prophet must repurpose orchard biology → apprentice must act. The key tightening is the black sea, which forecloses simple continuation and forces the root‑note gambit and delegation. Cost is felt but light; the piece favors transformation over harm. Still, the agency at the peak (tossing the mallet, Kael’s strike) earns the release.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: survival as resonance, mentorship as transmission, art transforming threat. The orchard’s origin and the black sea’s conversion embody “obstacle into instrument” without sermonizing. The final inward‑turning tide reweights the premise with an elegant, non‑literal answer. A touch more moral friction or price would deepen the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a distinct sonic lexicon sustains control without slipping into haze. Dialogue is spare and purposeful; the “Dub again” line carries subtext and action. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and diction stays anchored to the world’s musical physics. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; metaphors are consistent to the acoustic/nautical palette. A few lush phrases flirt with purple but clarity and propulsion hold, including at the climax. Sentences vary in length and cadence; no obvious loop or scaffold. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—clouds as notation, “sketched resonance,” kelp membranes, fruit as percussion—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks heighten meaning rather than distract, and the mentor handoff refreshes the trope. The conceptual integrity is strong, with rules followed through action. Minor cost softness is the only limiter.</comment>
