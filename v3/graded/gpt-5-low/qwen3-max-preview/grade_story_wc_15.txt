<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied—she defies guild/family precedent to mend the plate, stitching memory into stone. Interiority is vivid and particular to her craft; micro-choices (threading, where to sew, refusing to stop) reveal values. Internal contradiction is limited—she’s steady rather than torn—so cost reads as endurance more than conflict. Still, the choice to persist against erasure lands credibly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: stitching deepens pressure as the environment responds, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the plate pulses and the storm/child animate. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the final vow (“return tomorrow…until the canyon remembered how to sing”) functions as closure with conceptual cost. Cost is more implied than dramatized—no hard obstacle opposes her in-scene—slightly softening impact. Nonetheless, the cadence shift is decisive and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely specific and functional: the red-canyon labyrinth, tide pools, heart-chamber, and loom aren’t postcard—each steers timing, access, and ritual. Environmental feedback (walls hum, bell chimes, breeze) charges turns and the ending image. The plate as micro-setting/object anchors action and meaning. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resisting erasure by mending—tightens via the act of sewing and the plate’s awakening; pressure rises through accumulative responses. However, opposition is largely atmospheric; there’s no on-page counterforce beyond inertia/silence, so the trade-off reads as endurance rather than a forced choice. The meaningful turn is the plate’s living response and the vow to continue. Stakes remain intimate but clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Themes of repair over replacement, honoring cracks, and lineage vs. guild control emerge through action and image. Recurring motifs (plate fractures, labyrinth paths, tide timing) reweight at the end. A few explicit thesis lines (“She wasn’t restoring the plate. She was rewriting its fate.”) edge toward telling, trimming subtlety. Still, resonance lingers and avoids tidy moral binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature sustains coherence; diction, rhythm, and image patterns suit a ritualized, nocturnal craftsperson. Psychic distance stays stable, and the voice modulates gracefully at key beats (stitched awakenings, final vow). No dialogue is needed; the narrative texture carries subtext. Elevated register feels earned by POV and world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise; images do multiple jobs and momentum persists through dense lyricism. Minor overstatement in theme sentences and a high frequency of figurative language flirt with purple but don’t obscure sense. No significant loops or scaffolding; sentences vary well. The closure image reads cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Weaving memory into stone via a cracked story-plate in a tide-timed canyon labyrinth is fresh and coherent. The sleepwalking-paths navigation and guild/ancestor tensions add non-obvious texture. The closing reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight given the threaded motifs. Risk-taking in diction and conceit heightens meaning without losing clarity.</comment>
