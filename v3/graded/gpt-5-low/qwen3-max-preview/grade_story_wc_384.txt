<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and character‑particular—her forger’s craft harnessed to absolution—not merely declared. Interiority is embodied through craft choices (tears‑ink, thorn prick), though contradictory impulses are limited; she reads mostly unwavering. Micro‑choices under pressure (softening imperatives, finishing the final stroke as the last drop falls) reveal values cleanly. A felt cost lands (anonymity, relinquished tools), but the inner conflict could cut deeper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: comet‑key opens vault → rewriting under resistance → final stroke triggers unraveling; closure lands on the page with cost. The drive lens reads primarily causal with lyric coloration and holds through the ending. Stakes are tested on‑scene by the scroll’s resistance and the time pressure of the dripping stalactites. No orientation debt; the Decisive Change (curse unravels) is earned and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely specific and functional: marble vault, aurora, stalactites, quartz pedestal all constrain options and time. The environment shapes action (silent guard, hidden seam keyed to remorse) and charges the final image (bud in marble, softened twilight). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a calligrapher’s eye. A touch lush at times, but never static or museum‑tour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freeing the land from inherited guilt) tightens via the vault opening and the scroll’s active resistance under a live clock. Escalation is primarily a single meaningful deepening rather than multiple reversals; still, the accelerated dripping and fissures provide pressure. Agency is consistent—her choice to soften edicts into pleas is the moral hinge. The cost is present but mostly spiritual; a concrete loss mid‑scene (e.g., a near‑failure beat) could heighten it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of forgiveness versus punitive inheritance emerge organically through craft metaphors (edicts → pleas) and the final bud—no sermonizing. The conceptual repricing of power—from decree to prayer—lands with resonance. A few explicit clarifiers (“not to overthrow, but to absolve”) skate close to telling, but the images do the heavy lifting. The anonymity and dawn‑colored petals leave a lingering, earned aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in script and material textures. Rhythm modulates with pressure (vault sighs, scroll resists, last drop) without head‑hopping. Diction stays coherent to the world and vocation. Slight cadence sameness in intensifiers keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with high information density and purposeful figurative turns (ink writhing, marble sighing). Minor purple lean and motif repetition (“calibrated treason,” “pearl twilight,” “stalactites drip”) flirt with excess but do not blur action or cost. Sentences vary well, momentum holds, and no scaffolding or loops impede clarity. The final third remains clear despite lushness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Calligraphy‑as‑world‑law and “calibrated treason” fuse into a fresh, coherent magic ethic; the comet‑key tuned to remorse is an elegant mechanic. The unlinking via textual mercy is a non‑obvious turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off at closure. Slight familiarity in a few sacred‑heist beats prevents a higher mark.</comment>
