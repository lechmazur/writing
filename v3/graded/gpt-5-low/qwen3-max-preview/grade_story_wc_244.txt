<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—engineering reciprocity to treat loneliness—drives concrete choices (the table, chalkboard rule, final exchange). Her “desperately jocular” shell softens credibly at dusk into genuine vulnerability. Interiority is specific (field stories, satphone blinking) and actions align with her ethos. The internal contradiction is present, though not deeply stress‑tested beyond the final trade.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: rumors and trades build density toward the man’s approach. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when both share loneliest memories and the rock returns merely warm—cost is the on‑page vulnerability. Orientation is crisp from the opening and remains stable. A hair of didactic framing in the last lines trims perfection but doesn’t harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ivy‑draped station is vivid and integrated (birds in booths, foxes on rails) and tonally primes “polite anarchy.” It doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, but it charges the final image: an abandoned terminus repurposed into a marketplace of reciprocity. Sensory economy is strong and filtered through Elara’s aims. Micro‑setting with thermoses, chalkboard, and platform staging feels tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but coherent: can Elara induce connection without magic. Escalation tightens when the man requests the moon rock ritual, forcing her to risk honest reciprocity. The price—exposing her own loneliness—is felt, and his steadied hand marks consequence. Pressure is more deepening than reversal, yet sufficient for the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: reciprocity over miracle, rumor as catalyst, truth in telling. The moon rock’s non‑glow reframes the premise with human cost. A couple of aphoristic lines (“Truth lived in the telling”) skate close to telling but are supported by scene. The ending reweights abandonment and community without moralizing overtly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third‑person close remains consistent with a supple, lyrical register. Dialogue is sparse but functions as action (“Tell me, and I’ll tell you mine after”). Rhythmic control suits the accumulative pattern and modulates at the climax. Diction feels character‑specific and avoids register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and efficient; images like “velvet and static” and “alphabetizing canned goods” land sharply. Figurative texture rarely over-saturates, and momentum holds across mosaicked micro‑beats. Minor aphoristic turns are earned by the dramatization. No scaffold loops or clarity lapses are evident.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: disaster‑logistics ethos meets rumor‑economy in a feral, communal station. The moon rock’s “lunar loneliness” myth cleverly inverts at closure to human warmth. The reciprocity rule as social technology feels original and coherent. Risk is quiet but purposeful, yielding a memorable stance.</comment>
