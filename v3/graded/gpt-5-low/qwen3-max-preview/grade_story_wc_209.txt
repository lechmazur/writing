<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Her motive—to reckon with why flowers bloom at night—is clear and consistently enacted through concrete choices (traveling, decoding glass, repainting). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific rather than generic. The arc lands as an earned endurance/surrender rather than a flip epiphany, with a felt cost (“heart heavier with purpose,” sleepless nights). Limited visible contradiction keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: postcards → cathedral glass → return mural → nocturnal vigil. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she chooses lifelong wakefulness and secrecy, paying with solitude and vigilance. Orientation is clean from the outset; the method and motifs tighten toward the final image. The cost is legible in the line “She left… her satchel lighter, her heart heavier with purpose.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: amber pavilion, etched cathedral glass, moonlit garden, seasonal shifts. Environment and objects function as tools and constraints (magnifying lens, glass layers, light falling last in the pavilion’s center). The final image is charged by place and night—watching real flowers unfurl under stars. Minor holdback: a few lush details feel more atmospheric than choice‑shaping.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reckoning with nocturnal bloom) is signaled early and deepens via discovery of encoded flowers and lunar alignments. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial, culminating in a purposeful renunciation of sleep and explanation. The price—quiet vigilance, secrecy, and a heavier purpose—reads on the page. Lack of overt opposition limits maximum tension but suits the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres without sermonizing: beauty in obscurity and the ethic of seeing through, not at. Recurring images (postcards, glass, night‑blooming flowers) are reweighted by the ending into a lived practice rather than a stated thesis. The line “Some truths are not for speaking, but for living” risks explicitness, but the surrounding scene work earns it. The final vigil image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyric, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (craft/attention to glass, lunar math, pigment and pollen). Rhythmic control supports the accumulative build; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Elevated diction matches the artist’s sensibility and never feels expository. A few lush cadences verge on purple but remain purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, precise verbs, and motifs that pull double duty. Figurative language is rich yet coherent; repetition is patterned rather than looped. Minor redundancy (“brittle” recurrence, some adjective stacking) but no momentum‑killing scaffold. Opening and final lines both work as charged images.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: decoding nocturnal botany hidden in cathedral glass, retranslated into a pavilion mural guided by “lunar math.” Risks a quiet, non‑antagonistic structure and makes it feel inevitable. Specific craft details (etching layers, magnifying lens, pigment and pollen) ground the lyricism. The conceptual turn from solving to surrender is non‑obvious and earned.</comment>
