<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motive—preserve outlawed memory by dancing a verse into her body—drives concrete choices (pressing the moonstone to skin, dancing through pain, accepting the child’s request). Interiority is vivid and character‑specific, if largely assured rather than conflicted. Some contradiction (rebellion vs. solitude; fear vs. compulsion) is implied but not stressed in-scene. The visible cost (blood, exhaustion) credibly earns the closing pivot to teaching.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the find → fusion → grueling dance → communal witness culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—blood, fatigue—and a conceptual repricing (“the nostalgia ban still ruled—but no longer reigned”). Orientation is clean from the outset. The moonstone’s discovery edges toward coincidence but is integrated through the “gaps” method, preserving coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is lush and purposeful: dew, moss, and star‑field aren’t postcards but surfaces for action (barefoot dance, bleeding into moss) and final communion (villagers at the garden’s edge). World rule of the ban stays consistent and charges images throughout. The garden frames and charges the last image as she leads the child back under the stars. Constraint is more atmospheric than tactical, but it meaningfully colors choices and stakes.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—memory versus erasure—tightens via the moonstone’s activation and the endurance dance to inscription. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens; the cost is legible (trembling muscles, blood, collapse). The arrival of villagers shifts pressure from solitary defiance to communal implication, reweighting risk. Slight softness in overt external opposition keeps it from higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of absence as generative and memory as contraband/compass emerge organically through image and action (observing “gaps,” the moonstone as stored resonance). The final teaching gesture offers a non‑literal answer that reweights the world premise without sermonizing. One aphoristic line (“fall into the gaps—and trust they’ll catch you”) edges toward stated thesis but is earned by prior patterning. Resonance lingers beyond plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature sustains throughout; diction and cadence match the character’s sensibility. The brief dialogue at the end is spare, clean, and charged. Psychic distance modulates smoothly under pressure without head‑hopping. Elevated register is consistent and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is polished, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. A few near‑redundancies (“gravitational sighs and stellar sighs”) and stacked figuratives flirt with excess but don’t obscure sense. Momentum holds through the long dance sequence into the charged stillness of dawn. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Nostalgia ban” world meets tide‑anchored choreography and moonstone resonance in a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable by the end. The choice to “write” on flesh via motion is striking and thematically integral. The communal turn (villagers with wildflowers) reframes the premise without cliché. Bold lyric risk pays off with clarity.</comment>
