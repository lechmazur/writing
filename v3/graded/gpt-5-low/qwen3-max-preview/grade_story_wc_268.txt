<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and sustained, and her tactics (ink pellet, cryptic runes) align with a cool, patient temperament. However, interior contradiction is minimal—she never wavers, so cost registers more as renunciation than struggle. The refusal to rule is credible Earned Stasis, but the emotional price is muted. A moment of genuine doubt or risk would deepen the character’s texture under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: seeding the library → witnesses converge → font revelation → public unmasking → refusal. Closure lands on-page with social cost and a clear before/after. The midsection compresses escalation (“Days bled into weeks”) and keeps most friction offstage, but it doesn’t break logic. The drive lens reads Causal with a quiet Accumulative cadence and holds through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ancient temple library and sacred font aren’t mere backdrops—they dictate tactics (messages in books; revelation via ritual water) and charge the final image. Details like iron gall ink, cracked marble, and constellations pausing embed world rules through action. The environment frames both secrecy and spectacle, culminating in the oath scene. The setting’s logic remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (unmask the pretender) and tightens at the oath ceremony. The reversal—ink revealing ancestral sigils—reconfigures power without force, a satisfying pressure turn. Still, few obstacles oppose her in-scene; the plan works without visible jeopardy or adaptive recalibration. The cost is thematic rather than tactical, keeping tension elegant but modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of truth as erosion/mirror are embedded in concrete acts (runic marginalia, ink-as-memory, public witnessing). Recurring images (constellations, vellum, the font) reweight the ending with quiet inevitability. One explicit aphorism (“Truth is not a weapon. It is a mirror.”) edges toward didactic but fits character and scene. The final line reframes sovereignty with resonant restraint rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (“move like ink bleeding through parchment”) is consistent and apt. Voice modulation suits pressure shifts—hushed infiltration to ceremonial exposure to quiet refusal. No head-hopping or register slips; periodic elevated diction feels world-true. Compression is purposeful and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is polished, with varied rhythm and high information density; images carry multiple jobs (world, theme, plot). Lyrical texture skirts purple once or twice but maintains clarity. Minimal redundancy; momentum survives reflective flourishes. The closing cadence is sharp and unencumbered by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The iron-gall-as-memory reveal, library-runic insurgency, and “rune of drift” ethos synthesize into a fresh, inevitable-feeling device. Risk-taking in tone (graceful, erosive overthrow) and structure (accumulative plotting) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Tropes (usurper, rightful heir) are transformed through method and restraint. Only the low-friction execution keeps it shy of rarer air.</comment>
