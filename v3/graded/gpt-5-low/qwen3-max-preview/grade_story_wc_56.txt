<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and micro-choices (not reaching, angling the sundial, waiting) reveal a disciplined seeker with credible motives. The renunciation at the end reads earned and character-specific. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—more patience than turmoil—keeping the arc quiet rather than combustive. Still, the felt cost of giving up the chase could be edged sharper.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: one scene, pressure coheres from watchful waiting to a charged discovery and repricing. Closure lands as an earned stasis/CR—he shifts from chasing legends to honoring ruins—with cost implied in the relinquishment of pursuit. Orientation is clean early; set-ups (radio silence, sundial, salvage ethic) pay off. The cost is conceptual/emotional, not sharply dramatized, which keeps this below the 9-band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The canal, radio silence, and sundial interlock and guide tactics; water stillness and silt materially shape the action and final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through his vocation of listening and salvage. The micro-setting tool (sundial) charges the ending, paired with the locket. Minor risk of symbolic heaviness, but the environment does real work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on internal stance; escalation is a tightening: glint → restraint → tool-assisted alignment → salvage → repricing of lies. Agency is attention and renunciation; the choice not to reach until conditions align is pivotal. Cost is quiet but legible as the end of the hunt ethos. The tension is sustained without reversals; one more felt trade-off could elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The architecture-of-lies motif develops through concrete objects and culminates in the locket’s inscription, reweighting prior images. Subtext operates via salvage/restoration metaphors; the final carry (sundial beside locket) gives a resonant, non-literal answer. A few lines flirt with thesis-stating (“Architecture, after all, is structure with purpose.”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, the thematic weave is strong and cohesive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice with controlled distance; perception is selective and character-true. Rhythm modulates with pressure, especially around the glint and the final repricing. No head-hopping or stance leakage. Occasional abstract generalizations skim close to sermonizing but remain anchored by image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax and purposeful variation; most lines do more than one job. Some metaphor stacks risk purple (buttresses, vaulted ceilings, stained-glass windows) yet remain coherent to the central conceit. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum holds. Slightly heavy thematic exposition in a couple of lines keeps it below elite polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a legend hunter as patient salvager of misremembered truths under a radio-silence clock, using a sundial for angles rather than hours. The locket inscription is a precise, humanizing turn that grounds the larger metaphor. Risks are taken in maintaining a serene, reflective register without external antagonism—and it works. Slight familiarity in the “lies as architecture” conceit prevents a higher score, despite strong execution.</comment>
