<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained—she seeks the center to reawaken the eclipsed covenant—and her micro‑choices (heeding the pull, pressing the clipping) align. Interiority is vivid and embodied via roots in her soles and glowing scars. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she reads almost purely resolute, limiting dramatic torque. The final endurance/merger carries cost conceptually but not acutely on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: omen-rich approach → key action at the dais → cobalt eruption and merger. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and set‑ups (clipping, scars, node glade) pay off in the ritual. Closure lands as a charged poise/RR: the covenant stirs and she merges, reweighting the world’s rules. The cost is felt conceptually (surrender/anchoring, risk of awakening a suppressed pact) more than viscerally.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is tactile and consequential—the roots anchor, the dais focuses action, the environment is the “last uncorrupted node” that enables and constrains choice. Details are selective and filtered through her purpose (iron/incense scent, night‑blooming vines). The setting directly charges the final image (cobalt helix, voices from roots and scars). Richness stays purposeful rather than postcard-like.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on reactivating a suppressed covenant before the glade “forgets itself.” Pressure tightens through the guided approach and the ritual ignition, but opposition is largely atmospheric; no live counterforce tests her resolve. The decisive “heed” and insertion of the clipping earn the culmination, yet the price remains abstract. Escalation is present but not harrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dream-vow legitimacy versus bureaucratic denial emerges through action and recurring images (scars as conduits, eclipse memory). The ending’s merger offers a resonant answer—private dreams are binding, reclaimed through collective witness. A few declaratives (“Lies.”) edge toward tell, trimming subtlety. Still, the final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“cobalt glade,” “purposefully curious,” ritual lexicon). Rhythm and syntax modulate well from survey to ignition, with purposeful compression at peak. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; the Chancellor’s quoted line is clean and charged. Diction stays coherent to the world’s register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with vivid yet controlled metaphors; most images cohere to plant, wound, and eclipse motifs. Minor purple tendencies (“liquid shadow and starlight”) don’t obscure clarity or pacing. Repetition is largely purposeful; no significant loops or scaffolding. The close lands cleanly at the line level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—time‑rift survivor reigniting an eclipsed dream covenant via a living maze clipping and scar‑network—is fresh and committed. Motifs integrate organically with tactics and ending charge. Risk‑taking in diction and world logic reads intentional rather than ornamental. Slightly safer conflict contour keeps it shy of the very top tier.</comment>
