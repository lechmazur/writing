<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ripple-mark’s motive (to conjure silence rather than flee) is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices—calibrating pitch, tracing fissures, offering the stone—align with that drive. Interiority is implied through tactile attention rather than explored in contradiction, so we don’t feel much internal friction under pressure. Competence carries the scene with minimal visible cost beyond relinquishing the gathered hush. Strong presence, limited complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens from cacophony to tuned balance, culminating in releasing the hush to the largest being. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (storm tuned, not banished) with a concrete pivot on the page. Cost is modest but legible—the stone’s stored hush is surrendered—making a before/after meaningful. Orientation is clean and the one-scene structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The caves’ acoustics and the ice’s fracture-memory inform tactics and outcome; environment is not backdrop but instrument. The echo stone and ice wall function as micro‑setting that constrains choices (listening, calibrating, touching seams). Sensory detail is tactile and purposeful across sight, sound, and temperature. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through density and calibration rather than direct opposition: from drowned resonance to matched pitch to the “bloom of hush” and the final offering. Stakes remain singular (restore balance) and advance by one decisive deepening. The visible cost is low and the resistance is more environmental than adversarial, which slightly softens tension. Still, the meaningful tightening lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silence-as-architecture and tuning chaos into balance recur through concrete actions (reading ice, humming, release). The ending reweights earlier images—storm tuned, not erased—avoiding moralizing. The stone’s surrender and the ice’s release provide a resonant, non-literal answer about control versus attunement. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and tightly filtered through Ripple-mark’s sensory priorities; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and diction is consistent with the mythic tone. No dialogue is needed; narrative certainty stays within plausible inference. Elision is purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is vivid and efficient; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, motion). Figurative language is fresh and coherent with the sonic motif; no loops or scaffold clutter. A few lush clusters flirt with excess but don’t blur causality or the closure image. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Energy beings and acoustic caves are familiar-ish materials made new by the “captured silences,” fracture-memory, and hush as a weaponized offering. The method and final image feel non-obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk is taken in privileging accumulative tuning over spectacle, and it pays off. Emotional truth is subdued but credible.</comment>
