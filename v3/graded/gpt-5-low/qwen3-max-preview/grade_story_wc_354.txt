<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Distinct interiority and embodied detail (the dented stone, pupils’ tears) root his motive and flaw. His micro-choices—staying to “correlate,” then rising to carry the covenant forward—track cleanly. Internal conflict is present but gentle; contradictory impulses rarely collide under pressure. The change is credible yet the felt cost is more inferred than dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: eclipse approaches, field intensifies, he correlates silence, then reconfigures purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “not an end, but a reset,” and he chooses to teach correlation. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene coheres. The cost is subtle but legible in the renunciation of looking back and the recast of exile.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus, auroras, and twilight are vividly filtered through his chess‑tutor sensibility. Environment and object (the worry stone) charge the final image and constrain timing via the eclipse. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, not a catalog. World rules feel consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on perceiving/choosing under the eclipse clock; pressure coheres as the field surges and the covenant reframes. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, consistent with the lens. The final choice forecloses a return to mere anxiety, but the visible price is modest. Tension is steady, not sharp.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of wonder versus control, beauty through difficulty, and silence as structure emerge from particulars (pawn structures → vectors; eclipse as reset). Recurrences reweight at the end (stone from worry to compass). A few lines edge toward aphorism, but the final image avoids sermonizing. Resonance lingers without tidy moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, character‑specific lyric voice marries chess lexicon with magnetic imagery. Distance control stays stable; no head‑hopping or register whiplash. Rhythmic modulation supports the contemplative pressure. Slight purple tendencies appear but do not blur sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with varied rhythm and efficient motif reprise (“translate silence,” “correlate”). Minor density/purple patches and near‑repetitions show up but serve pattern rather than padding. Clarity and momentum hold through closure. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: chess tutelage, magnetic nexus, and silence‑as‑strategy feels fresh and coherent. The “eclipsed covenant” reframes exile with conceptual stakes. Risks pay off without obscuring clarity. Only the conflict’s softness keeps it from the very top tier.</comment>
