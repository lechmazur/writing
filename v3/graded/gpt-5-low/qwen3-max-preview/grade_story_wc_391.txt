<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and specific—she pursues a “patient revolution” by aligning the viaduct to lunar paths—yet on‑page micro‑choices under pressure are mostly summarized rather than dramatized. The inner contradiction (impatience transmuted into patience) is articulated and partially embodied, but not tested in a sharp present‑tense crucible. Her endurance functions as Earned Stasis, though the immediate cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Strong coherence, modest scarcity of live, pressured choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of moon‑tracking, coordinates, and the viaduct’s retuned resonance thickens toward a charged poise at the end. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the regime’s silence and her kneeling thanks reconfigure stakes without a loud decisive act. Cost is present (renunciation of spectacle, endurance across the freeze/thaw cycle) but remains mostly conceptual. Structure is clean, with one continuous frame widened by seasonal progress.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and the magnetic viaduct guide tactics (ice as map surface; lattice alignment; seasonal clock). Recurring objects (sextant, chalk) and weather (after rain, hoarfrost, thaw) meaningfully charge the final image. Sensory texture is controlled and POV‑filtered. World rules feel consistent within a lyrical modality.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconfiguring power through silence—remains coherent and deepens via pattern (children, parents, soldiers; envoys → threats → silence). Escalation is more tonal than event‑driven, but the cadence shift to regime hesitation and retreat constitutes a real tightening under the chosen lens. The price is restraint under provocation, though it’s not stress‑tested in a discrete confrontation. Quiet resolution feels earned, if not knife‑edge tense.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (stillness as radical counter to spectacle) emerges organically from concrete acts: moon‑tracking, re‑tuning industrial relics, and teaching children. A few lines verge on declarative thesis (“unyoked the people’s hunger for spectacle”), yet the images carry the weight. The final act (“whispered thanks to the moon”) offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, confident, and consistent—measured, luminous, and textural without head‑hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate to support accumulative pressure and a calm, radical stance. No dialogue is needed; the perceptual signature (industrial/lunar lexicon) is specific. Elision is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: strong verbs, high information density, and recurring images doing double duty. Occasional repetition (unyoke/patience/silence) risks faint redundancy but reads as motif rather than loop. Figurative language remains coherent; syntax varies with control. Final third is clear and charged without purple muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—engineering a revolution by retuning a viaduct to lunar harmonics—feels fresh and inevitable within its logic. Risks the ultra‑quiet resolution and makes it work through specific ritual and tool use. Emotional truth (endurance over spectacle) reads earned, not ornamental. Distinctive images and premises elevate beyond familiar “quiet resistance” tropes.</comment>
