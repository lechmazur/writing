<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and sustained: revive a dead mother tongue via risky means. Interiority is embodied (texture of grief/joy) and filtered through her occupational method. Contradictory impulses (feeding the diamond’s hunger vs. preserving “pure signal”) surface but aren’t deeply contested. Final endurance choice (quiet articulation over spectacle) feels earned with a soft, felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: birds arrive → diamond activated → canyon reconfigures sound → forward‑echo closure. Closure lands on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s rules pivot when the canyon replies and carries her final word outward. Persistent constraints (the diamond’s hunger; canyon’s echo‑memory) shape tactics. Cost is legible in her weeping endurance and in the necessity to feed noise to save meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon’s echo‑preservation and bone towers are vivid and rule‑bound; they actively constrain and enable the act of translation. The diamond functions as a micro‑setting tool, charging the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (rasp, velvet hush, brittle snap) and filtered through her method. The environment directly shapes the ending’s action and image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reclaim a language’s voice. Pressure tightens when the diamond’s vacuum risks consuming everything except “emotional residue,” forcing careful calibration. Escalation is a density increase (flock syntax → activation → canyon responses) consistent with the chosen lens. The risk feels contained rather than perilous, but the emotional price and tool‑constraint keep tension live.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, loss, and translation emerges organically via specific images (texture→sound, echoes preserving time). The ending reweights the world’s logic—echoes become responses—and reframes language as communal, time‑layered agency. No sermonizing; the diamond’s hunger adds moral texture without tidy absolution. The final forward echo offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single, controlled lyric POV with a distinct perceptual signature (“quietly articulate”) that matches method and stakes. Rhythm modulates purposefully; fragments land for emphasis without confusion. No head‑hopping; certainty matches what she can experience. Elevated diction suits the mythic register and stays coherent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; repetition (“She did not… It did not…”) is patterned and purposeful. Figurative language is vivid yet legible, rarely purple, and cadence varies. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum builds through syntax. Final image is clean and charged without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: cursed diamond as resonance filter, canyon as time‑archive, birds as syntax—each element interlocks. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the taught rules. Risks (lyric density, conceptual method) heighten stakes and coherence. Emotional truth undergirds the novelty, avoiding gimmickry.</comment>
