<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and character‑particular: a linguist driven to repair trust after the Silence, embodied in meticulous, oath‑aware method. The “carefully reckless” contradiction is dramatized (fist‑pump, then triple verification). Micro‑choices under pressure (warning the choir, tuning phonemes) align with her values. The curator’s caution adds relational pressure without derailing her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: research → discovery of harmonic promises → choral test → charged silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: awe‑silence and prismatic ink denote a before/after with conceptual cost and a path forward. Because/therefore sequencing is intact, with on‑page consequences (chiming inkwell, chandelier tone, environmental response). The price is largely conceptual rather than punitive, but it reads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive’s acoustics and objects are not backdrop; they shape tactics (singing in the rotunda, calibrating to the space) and answer back (inkwell chime, chandelier tone). Recurring micro‑setting (glass inkwell) charges the final image. Sensory specificity is selective and POV‑filtered (dust motes spiraling to vowels, rain‑on‑stone exhale). World rules (resonance as performative truth) stay consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she restore trust without re‑breaking it—tightens through the warned risk: “Sing only if you mean it,” which forecloses careless options. Escalation accrues via movements, each unlocking deeper environmental response. The visible cost is modest (spent ink, risk borne, communal vulnerability) and opposition is mostly ambient; still, the narrowing reads. Resolution is earned by her choice to conduct, not to publish.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of promise, trust, and communal truth emerge through action (oath‑chains that collapse if betrayed) rather than abstract talk. Subtext hums in the caution that meaning exists only when intent holds, reweighted by the final awe‑silence. A couple of explicit lines (“She wasn’t just translating. She was repairing.”) skate toward thesis. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice with controlled cadence; diction suits a scholar attuned to sound. Brief dialogue carries subtext and status: the curator’s warning frames stakes; her reply asserts agency. Psychic distance remains stable; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates cleanly from meticulous study to choral lift without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multi‑function density (world, theme, action) with few redundancies, and the read‑aloud rhythm varies well. Figurative language is frequent but coherent to the sonic premise; images don’t tangle or contradict. Minimal scaffolding; each line advances atmosphere or stakes. Slight lushness risks purple, but control holds, especially at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Symphonies of truth” as legal/ethical technology, oath‑chains with acoustic failure modes, and a practical reconstruction method feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The archive as instrument and the inkwell’s sonic participation are inventive. Risk‑taking serves meaning, not gimmickry. The final convergence image re‑prices the whole piece with confident originality.</comment>
