<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline from the first line and drives every action: finish the sky before demolition. Interiority is specific to her tactile cognition; the coin and textures reveal character. The revelation that her “deficit” is a lens is earned by the tactile process on the page. Minor ding: little contradictory impulse beyond the mid‑story reframing, so pressure reads more devotional than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single, continuous scene with clear anchors (who/where/when) and a clean accumulative drive to closure. The demolition clock and the coin’s deciphering yield a steady because/therefore linkage: retrieve relic, translate touch into sky, finish before dawn. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she accepts no witnesses and the imminent loss. Slightly low on external turns, but cohesion and cost are undeniable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The hollowed tree library, bark‑worn shelves, and damp wood are tactilely integrated with her sensory bias. Environment and object (coin, secret safe) constrain tactics and charge the final image. Weather/light studies and demolition machinery shape choices and tone. The setting isn’t postcard; it’s a living apparatus that culminates in a sky only she can read.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the transmutation before destruction—is clear and tightens through radios, countdowns, and the final hydraulic whine. The choice to prioritize communion over preservation narrows options and exacts a cost (no witnesses, loss of the work). Escalation is mostly textural but legible under the lens. Lack of a sharp reversal keeps it short of peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme arises from particulars: touch over sight, translation over representation, art as transmutation under erasure. The epiphany about prosopagnosia as lens is paid for by the tactile process and the non‑spectatorial ending. A couple of lines verge on thesis (“they saw faces and called them whole...”), but they remain grounded by image. Resonance lingers in the charged acceptance of loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in touch. Diction is consistent and modulates effectively as the clock tightens. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; compression is purposeful. Cadence carries pressure without overexplanation.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and maintains momentum; images are fresh and precise (“ghost‑light of dead astronomers,” “dawn bled through leaves”). Figurative density is high but controlled, rarely lapsing into purple or redundancy. Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable loops. A touch of rhetorical symmetry near the end skirts abstraction but doesn’t dull the closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face‑blind portraitist translating a coin’s star‑indentations into a fugitive sky inside a living library is an inventive synthesis. Risks (lyric mode, quiet stakes, no witnesses) heighten coherence and land cleanly. The final acceptance reframes absence as atmosphere in a non‑obvious, memorable way. Feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
