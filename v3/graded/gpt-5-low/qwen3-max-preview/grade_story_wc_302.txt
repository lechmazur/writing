<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular: she seeks the archive and pays with her identity. Interiority is embodied via the watch’s heat and the bone stylus etching into skin. Contradictory impulses—cautious exuberance vs. risk—surface through micro‑choices (reaching into negative space, stepping through the arch). Slight distance from concrete, scene‑bound struggle keeps this just shy of exemplary.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early (reversing stacks, propagation delays) and held to closure. The final turn—inscribing the silence and becoming the archive—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with undeniable cost. Setups (watch thresholds, self‑documentation, recursion) pay off cleanly in the mirror scene. Orientation is purposeful and supports the conceptual repricing at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The glowing library’s rules (reversals, mist that forms sentences) constrain navigation and tactics, charging each choice and the final image. Sensory specificity is rich and purposeful (bergamot and rain releasing from “Apologies Swallowed Whole”). Recurring objects (watch, bone stylus, mirror) integrate as setting mechanisms rather than décor. World logic remains consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure deepens through a clear sequence: shelves’ logic → “Regrets Never Voiced” → glyphs that alter the past → inner sanctum → mirror. The cost escalates from documentation scars to identity dissolution. Agency matters at each turn (what she touches, what she records, whether she steps through) and culminates in the chosen acceptance. Stakes stay focused on truth versus self and tighten credibly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of unsaid truths and the price of understanding emerges organically from particulars (bone‑etched vows, scent‑memory “apology,” mirror recursion). The ending’s acceptance reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a lucid conceptual answer. Motifs reprise with changed charge (watch freezing; silence as the final glyph). Ambiguity is meaningful rather than vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent third‑person close focalization; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and diction remains character‑filtered (technical metaphors like “propagation delays” are integrated through her lens). Purposeful elision is taught and paid off; the prose never explains what the images already do. No dialogue, but the narrative stance is assured and precise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do multiple jobs (world, psyche, pressure). Figurative texture is ambitious but coherent to the conceit; minimal redundancy. A few lush flourishes flirt with excess, yet clarity and momentum hold through the peak beats. Final image is crisp and unsmothered by ornament.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—library of unspoken words governed by latency, a threshold watch, bone‑etched documentation that alters the archive—is fresh and internally rigorous. The recursion twist feels inevitable in hindsight given the early rules. Bold risks in concept and diction heighten stakes rather than obscure them. Emotional truth (acceptance as cost) grounds the novelty.</comment>
