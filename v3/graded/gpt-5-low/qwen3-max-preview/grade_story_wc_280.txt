<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation—an artist refusing to fade who shifts to invitation—drives concrete choices (selecting the cerulean laugh, singing seven notes, tossing the coin). Interiority is conveyed through synesthetic perception that feels character-specific. The internal conflict (clinging to encore vs. letting go) is present but lightly contested on the page, with minimal resistance at the decision beat. Cost is felt via thinning form, though the transition reads smooth rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: coin as compass → thread selection → seven-note intervention → coin sacrificed to grow a sapling. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: she foregoes haunting for rooted legacy, with visible cost in dissolution and relinquishing the coin. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and causal links are legible within the lyric frame. The brief postlude of outcomes pays off the echoes without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard/maze is vivid and specific (upward fountain, timeline-blossoms, chiming blossoms) and charges the final image with the sapling. The environment responds to her presence and supplies the decisive arena and tool (fountain as locus for the coin’s transformation). Rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. Sensory detail is rich and POV-filtered without drifting into catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting despair into possibility while confronting release—tightens as the three echoes manifest and demand a choice. The escalation is a density increase culminating in the relinquishment of the coin and self, with a clear price. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres through her agency and the orchard’s response. A touch more friction before the final toss could have heightened tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of art’s afterlife and legacy over spectacle emerges organically through images (applause ripples, reversed Star/Tower/Moon/Sun, rose lighting the dusk). The final sapling reweights the premise toward communal possibility rather than individual performance. A few explicit outcome lines risk neatness, but they extend resonance rather than moralize. Subtext—encore transformed into rooting—lingers effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (sound-color-scent fusions) remains stable and controlled. Rhythm varies, with chimes and ripples echoing content without gimmickry. No head-hopping or stance slippage; certainty matches what the ghost could infer. Elevated diction fits the operatic subject and never strays into academic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with fresh, coherent metaphors (“notes…braiding despair into something softer”). Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing support momentum. Lushness skirts purple once or twice, but images align and do not muddle action. Opening and closing lines are strong, with precise verbs and purposeful syntax shifts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—synesthetic diva-ghost, hedge-maze orchard of timelines, tarot coin as compass/sapling—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and conceit pay off with a concrete, charged final act. The rule-set is honored and extended rather than hand-waved. Emotional truth (letting go as encore’s truest form) lands without cliché.</comment>
