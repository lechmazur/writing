<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular—she redirects grief into offerings without voyeurism. Contradictory impulses (isolation versus outreach) coexist credibly and guide micro‑choices (engraving, folding, leaving). The endurance choice at the end (unsold locket left without signature or witness) reads as earned stasis with cost. Interiority is vivid and embodied through tools and ritual rather than labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent, and closure lands as a charged poise: the locket left, the crane placed, and the distant stir of the “curtains” reprice the pattern. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when). Cost is implied rather than dramatized—solitude and renunciation—so the final turn is quiet but legible. No causality breaks; the motif grid coheres to the last image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The observatory and its “curtains of intention” are specific, sensorial, and filtered by her craft; the micro‑setting of tools (locket, stencil, vellum) grounds action. The environment meaningfully charges the ending (the remote stir/glow as barometer of ache), though it doesn’t force a tactic. Detail selection is economical and purpose‑driven. World rules feel consistent within the lyrical conceit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rerouting grief) is clear and there is one effective deepening when the curtains respond as someone unfolds an offering. Escalation remains tonal and patterned rather than decisively narrowing options; the piece avoids a strong turn and relies on cadence intensification. The ending’s renunciation (no watching, no note) registers as a price. Tension is more devotional than adversarial but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme integrates through concrete acts: stitched/folded/etched artifacts become vessels that carry permission, reweighting “genuinely artificial” into sacred. A line edges toward explicit thesis, but it’s backed by scene work (fox under bench; locket in crane; coordinates as breadcrumb pedagogy). The final image reaffirms rerouted grief without moralizing. Subtext hums in the refusal to witness and the observatory’s responsive silence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and purposeful diction; POV distance stays steady and plausible for a reflective artisan. No dialogue to test, but internal texture feels consistent and character‑shaped (tool lexicon, ritual verbs). Psychic distance tightens at key images without slips. Elision patterns are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied cadence; figurative language is rich but generally coherent and scene‑tethered. Minimal redundancy; no algorithmic loops or filter stacks. A few abstract statements risk over‑telling but are cushioned by tactile specificity. The final lines land cleanly by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—mourning jeweler, coordinates as grief breadcrumbs, an observatory whose curtains answer ache—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric conceit, nonliteral mechanics) heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. The craft premise enables non‑obvious turns (no witnessing; the glow as distant confirmation). Minor softness in escalation keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
