<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira’s professional specificity and calm, methodical agency are vivid and consistent, with concrete embodiment (molars rattling, cold coffee, oscilloscope). Motivation is clear and sustained, and actions align with character. Internal contradiction is light—competence rarely strains, and we don’t see a meaningful slip or cost beyond fatigue. The ending’s stance (vigilant, hopeful defiance) feels earned but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the causal chain is clean: detect → analyze → counter-broadcast → social response → withdrawal → renewed stance. The piece adheres to a single-scene window with one tightening as the tricksters “pulse with irritation.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive defeat, with a credible next-steps image (pinning the new chart). Cost is present but modest, more conceptual than dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The control booth, Cold War‑era transmitter, oscilloscope, and charts are purposeful, filtered through a professional’s eye, and used tactically. The setting constrains options (station as vector and battleground) and resources (counter‑frequency generator). The final image with the pinned chart and whispered challenge is charged by place and tools. World rules remain consistent and integrated into action rather than dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect campus from corrosive influence) is clear and escalates when the signal “tightens” in response to her interference. The tactical choice to destabilize rather than overwrite is a meaningful turn that reframes conflict. However, the price feels light—little pushback beyond a writhing signal, no tangible loss or hard trade‑off on the page. Tension persists but never truly threatens to break her tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of corrosion vs. harmony, ethical intervention, and hope as a non‑weaponized tool emerge from concrete events and images (poisoned violin tuned to lullabies). The closing charged poise reframes hope as vigilance, not triumph. Some lines approach thesis‑statement territory (“Hope… was the only tool left”), softening subtext. Still, the integration largely resists moralizing through action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third voice blends technical precision with lyric inflection, maintaining consistent distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythmic control supports pressure without opacity; metaphors feel apt to the character. Dialogue is minimal and functional (forum quote), avoiding contamination of voice. No head‑hopping or stance slips occur.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum; imagery is vivid yet controlled (“tuning a poisoned violin”). Minimal scaffolding and no meaningful loops; syntax varies with scene needs. A few elevated turns risk purple but remain coherent and character‑motivated. Final line lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs without rhetorical excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of campus radio tech, subsonic emotional warfare, and a scientist’s quiet counter‑broadcast feels fresh and specific. “Tricksters” as corrosion agents rather than conquerors is a strong inflection. The arc is familiar (expert intervenes to stabilize a community), but details and voice avoid template. Risk lies in the ethical quiet victory and charged poise rather than spectacle, which coheres.</comment>
