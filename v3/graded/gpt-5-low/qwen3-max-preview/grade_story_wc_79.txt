<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crisp and character‑particular: she’s powered by a private ache and professional obsession that drive concrete choices (testing the sequence, packing, deciding to climb). Interiority is textured through craft details (mapping on shell, whistle lexicon) rather than labels. Contradiction is present but subtle—quiet restraint versus audacious risk. The final stance (go at midnight regardless of sanction) feels fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern language work → watcher’s head turn → decisive plan constitutes a coherent tightening. Closure lands as Charged Poise with cost signaled (“become part of the legend”); while not enacted, it reconfigures options and stakes. Orientation is clean early and remains stable. Minor limitation: the decisive act is deferred, keeping cost largely implied rather than paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: city atop turtle shells, carapace map, bleached light, and rusted gate all constrain options and tactics. The reed whistle and shell‑ridges operate as micro‑settings that shape communication paths and the final plan. World rules are learned through use (wind, humidity, sun angle) rather than dumped. The environment charges the closing image of the midnight climb.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear—reach/watchers vs city’s denial—and escalates when the pattern elicits a head turn, narrowing her options to confrontation. The choice to go at midnight is agency‑driven and forecloses safety and social belonging. Costs are felt but largely prospective. One more on‑page counterforce or loss would have intensified pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of silence, memory, and code accrue organically through spirals, breath, and institutional erasure. The watcher’s small response reweights the moral landscape (complicity versus indifference) without sermonizing. The ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer: breach silence with risk, or accept complicity—no tidy moral. Strong image patterning (spirals, breath, rust) binds meaning.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyric, and tightly focalized through a distinct perceptual signature (cartographic and acoustic thinking). Diction remains consistent and character‑plausible, with controlled cadence shifts at key beats. No head‑hopping, and elision is purposeful. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but stays disciplined.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, motive) with clean propulsion and minimal scaffold. Recurring metaphors (spirals, breath, rust) are coherent and not overmixed. Rhythm varies and lands emphatic images without redundancy. Minor density in places, but clarity and momentum hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—biocartography on turtle shells, breath‑code linguistics, silent sentinels—feels fresh and necessary to this protagonist’s psyche. The turn (head pivot) emerges from established method rather than a new rule. Risks in concept and diction pay off without gimmickry. Slightly conservative on escalation prevents a higher band.</comment>
