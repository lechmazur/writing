<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and motive (“interpret silence with empathy”) drive concrete choices (overlaying footage, waiting through dusk, leaving yarrow). The quiet renunciation—choosing to witness rather than rebuild—reads earned. Internal tension (proof vs. reverence) is present but subtle rather than contested on the page. Still, her methods and micro‑choices reveal a distinct, embodied psyche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: evidence layers (1953→2019 footage, spiral map tear), culminating in the dusk silhouette and token offering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (refusing reconstruction, embracing witnessing). Orientation is clean from the outset; the pattern taught early is paid off precisely at the last‑light beat. Stakes stay coherent and narrow in scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective environment: rain‑scoured vault, weeping arches, broken oculus, henge/menhir alignment. Setting constrains tactics and charges the ending (waiting for dusk; last light striking the central menhir catalyzes the chapel’s silhouette). Details filter through a map‑maker’s priorities, maintaining plausibility and specificity. The final image is inseparable from the place’s physical grammar.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through density and pattern recognition rather than confrontation: the migrating shadow, spiral path, and timed dusk viewing. The choice to witness—not rebuild—forecloses a path with an implied reputational/academic cost. Stakes remain intimate but legible; the cadence tightens into the last‑light moment. Lack of overt resistance keeps the ceiling below the very top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Silence as vessel, memory’s choreography, and ethical witnessing accrue from concrete particulars (shadow’s arc, torn map, yarrow token). The ending reweights earlier images without moralizing, though a few lines verge on aphorism (“silence…was not void but vessel”). Thematically coherent across ancestry, erasure, and reverent restraint. The final loop invites reflection without instructing it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical, confident single‑POV voice with a cartographer’s lexicon and tactile noticing; rhythm modulates well. No dialogue; narration stays within plausible perception and inference. A few lush turns press purple but remain controlled and pattern‑consistent. The voice feels singular and steady under the emotional crest.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with generally clean syntax and purposeful imagery; minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and task‑tethered (map tear, choreography, vessel). No significant loops or cadence templates dull momentum. Minor richness saturation keeps it a notch below stellar minimalism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a cartographic‑forensic poetics where a “whispered chapel” is proven by shadow choreography across decades. The henge/altar as negative space and the ethical pivot to witness rather than rebuild feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyricism serves the premise without obscuring clarity. The conceptual and emotional strands fuse memorably.</comment>
