<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—terminal curiosity about endings—is specific and consistently dramatized through listening and risk. Her contradictory impulses (self-erasure vs. service; drift toward danger vs. care for others) coexist on the page, especially when she chooses the floe. Actions align with her psychology without therapy‑speak shortcuts. Minor convenience in her preternatural sensing skirts the mystical but is earned by established attentional practice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the pattern of listening culminates in the winch‑chime and glacier collapse, then reconfigures her stance (declining euthanasia). Orientation is clean early; the marina accident turns the pressure coherently. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (exposure, renunciation of a chosen death). One elegant, decisive tightening suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina is vivid and functional; sounds, cold, and unstable surfaces shape perception and choices (stepping onto the floe). The parasol tip doubles as a tool‑in‑setting that charges the final image. Weather and ice behavior evolve with events (storm aftermath, calving shelf) rather than sit decoratively. Strong integration without excess cataloguing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to meet endings—tightens through a concrete hazard (shear) that forces a choice. The turn is her agency: walking onto the floe instead of evacuating, sacrificing safety for insight. Cost is legible (near‑freezing, foreclosing euthanasia path) and carries forward to the later refusal. Tension operates at both sentence and scene scales without requiring an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motifs (sound, lace, thresholds) accrue to a resonant answer: endings as sung transitions rather than terminus. The refrain “fold in patience” and the reweighted parasol tip effectively yoke theme to event. A slight over‑explicitness in “She realized then…” trims the mystique of implication. Still, the final hospice pivot earns its weight from concrete experience.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; cadence modulates with pressure (the marina stilling, the submerged bell). Diction remains coherent to the character’s sensibility and task. Minimal dialogue is purposeful and charged (“There.”). No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line craft is lush yet largely precise; images like “a bell submerged in deep water” and “lace unraveling” carry layered work. Minor risk of purple in the opener (“rinsed in Arctic brine…rigging of forgotten ships”) but it sets pattern and doesn’t blur sense. Momentum is maintained; few redundant stems or scaffolds. Syntax varies and supports pacing through the pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist premise, Arctic acoustics of finitude, and the parasol‑tip tuner synthesize into a fresh lens on deathwork. The catastrophic “sigh” of a glacier reframes hospice listening with specificity rather than platitude. Risks in lyric register and mystic inflection pay off without obscuring clarity. The design feels singular and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
