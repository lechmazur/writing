<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (“thwart the deal…capture the sound of trust breaking”) drives specific micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is textured (fear calcified into purpose) and embodied through tactics rather than summary. Relationship pressure with Marla/The Chain is indirect but legible through status cues. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; a slightly sharper on‑page cost to her choice would elevate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with crisp anchors and a coherent drive lens (accumulative/situational) culminating in on‑page closure: the deal breaks. Causal throughline holds—her controlled approach and the fob brush precipitate the decisive shift. Cost is felt conceptually (risk and lineage exposure) though lightly rendered. The recognition turn is clean and earned by prior set‑ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The pirate market and rotting pier are vivid and functional: singing eels mask approach, anchor chains frame The Chain’s entrance, and salt‑rot shapes movement. The watch fob operates as a micro‑setting object that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered. World rules (truce of hush) integrate with place without exposition dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit and pressure tightens via near‑exposures, a staged false start, and the memory-triggering brush. The reversal hinges on her agency (choosing listening and the fob over confrontation). The price is implicit rather than dramatized (risk of being marked “lighthouse blood”). A slightly sharper consequence or narrowed option after the break would heighten escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Trust, silence, and lineage braid through recurring images (the fob’s tide‑tick; “truce of hush”) and culminate in a quiet, resonant reconfiguration. The final silence after Marla’s exhale reweights the premise without moralizing. Backstory fragments (Harbor Wars) tilt the present with thematic relevance. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical third‑person close holds steady; diction matches milieu and pressure. Indirection in the single spoken line (“Lighthouse blood”) carries subtext without explaining. Rhythm modulates with tension (shorter beats near the approach/brush). No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with fresh, controlled figurative choices (“lanterns swaying like drunken fireflies,” “truce of hush”). Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops; syntax varies with momentum. A few high‑color images cluster but do not blur causality. Line‑level polish reads publication‑ready.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of pirate noir, hush‑truce politics, and “capturing the sound of trust breaking” feels singular. The watch fob as tide‑synced heirloom that detonates recognition is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (quiet sabotage, nonviolent climax) heighten coherence rather than obscure it. Specificity resists template plotting.</comment>
