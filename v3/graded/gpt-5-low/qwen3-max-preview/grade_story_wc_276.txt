<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fisher’s motive (to catch the goddess’s echo) is clear and her actions track cleanly to it, with deft, embodied micro‑choices (zigzagging to avoid snapping chords, voicing silence). The renunciation at the end (releasing the echo; accepting shards as a tool, not a trophy) reads earned. However, interior contradiction is muted; she stays uniformly competent and cool, so struggle feels low‑friction. The emotional cost is present but understated, limiting depth of internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: careful hunting → tonal key found → spike charged → inversion → release. Closure lands on the page with cost: the spike cracks, and she relinquishes capture in favor of carry/transfer (RR/CR). Setups (fragile chords, voicing silence, grieving constellations) pay off cleanly in the final image. Orientation is strong from the outset; no causality slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly rendered and constrains tactics (she calibrates steps to avoid snapping chords; silence must be “voiced” as a working method). The rail spike functions as micro‑setting/tool charging the final image when it cracks and becomes a shrine center. Environmental reactions (shuddering garden, inversion, folding petals) evolve causally with action. Sensory and world rules remain consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused early and escalates through density: locating the bass fossil, matching the “feral” lullaby, spike overheating, world inversion. Agency drives each turn, and the end choice is a renunciation with visible price (forgoing capture; destroying the tool). Internal and external pressures interweave (grief tide, fragile chords) without coincidence resolving the conflict. The only modest limit is the protagonist’s near‑frictionless competence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres around grief, stewardship vs. possession, and making meaning by transliteration not translation. The ending reweighs the premise: the echo is not to be owned but carried, with constellations shifting from blue to gold as a resonant answer. Recurring images (lullaby, silence as lure, patterns breaking) accrue subtext without moralizing. The result invites reflection beyond plot while remaining grounded in particulars.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is distinctive, sonic‑biased, and steady; metaphoric system (sound, silence, resonance) is coherent. Psychic distance and diction remain controlled under pressure, with rhythmic modulation at turns. No head‑hopping or stance drift; purposeful compression reads taught and legible. A few patterned constructions repeat by design (“not to X, but to Y”), adding cadence rather than clutter.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; propulsion is maintained through tight syntax and purposeful parallelism. Figurative language is abundant yet disciplined and coherent to the sonic motif; clarity holds through the climax. Minimal scaffold or synonym loops; no muddled metaphors at peak beats. A hair shy of perfect due to the sheer lushness risking saturation in a few lines, though it never impedes sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The fusion of “voicing silence,” transliteration of emotion, and sleepwalking constellations feels authentically singular. Turns grow from established rules and character method, not late inventions. The final reconfiguration is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Bold risks in worldbuilding and diction heighten meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
