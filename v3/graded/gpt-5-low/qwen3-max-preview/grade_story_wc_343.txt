<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Arlen’s diligently curious drive is specific, embodied, and consistent, and his micro‑choices (kneeling to trace chalk, testing phrases, directing hops) reveal character. Internal contradiction is minimal—he encounters little pushback or fear—so pressure doesn’t expose deeper fault lines. The brief dynamic with Veyra adds status texture but resolves quickly. The closing dog‑ear choice signals growth, though its cost remains soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Structure is clean: discovery → demonstration → communal enactment → reweighted ending image. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, with a Conceptual Repricing at the end (“language” found). Closure lands, but the cost is mostly conceptual; risks or sacrifices aren’t stressed on the page. Causality is steady and orientation impeccable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The airship, balloon, chalked deck, and murmurations are vividly integrated into action and tactic, not just backdrop. The hopscotch grid and stranded luminance directly constrain choices and charge the final image. World rules feel consistent and learned through observation. Minor overlushness in description doesn’t impede clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain predominantly aesthetic/intellectual (discovery, steering light) with low friction; skepticism dissolves quickly and obstacles are light. The meaningful tightening is the public test with crew boots and the signal beam, but few options are foreclosed. Cost is under‑articulated, so tension plateaus into triumph. Strong concept, muted pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres around learning a language of the world—pattern, attention, and shared meaning—earned through concrete particulars (hopscotch, phrasebook, birds). The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext of community within isolation lands. Slight neatness reduces lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Arlen’s noticing; diction suits his meticulous mind. Dialogue is brief but functional, carrying subtext (skepticism to awe) and advancing action. Rhythm modulates well between lyric observation and procedural clarity. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished, image‑rich, and largely efficient; lines often carry multiple jobs. A few lush metaphors stack (“lute strung with sunbeams,” “living inkblots”), flirting with purple but not obscuring sense. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax maintain momentum. Final cadence resolves on a precise, resonant image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Airship + stranded luminance + hopscotch cipher + phrasebook marginalia is a fresh synthesis with satisfying inevitability in hindsight. The decoding method is ingenious and grounded in character. Risk is artistic rather than structural; clarity holds. The only limiter is gentled stakes, not concept.</comment>
