<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—she collects temporal textures—and her actions (ear to the lamp, note-taking, cross‑referencing) align with that drive. The discovery of someone else’s history triggers a credible reorientation from solitary curation to communal invitation. Internal contradiction (studious control vs. relinquishing authorship) is present and earned. The emotional beats are embodied without therapy‑speak, though pressure remains gently scaled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is clear: pattern of listening/noting deepens until the “Unknown Era” breaks it open. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she invites others by leaving the notepad, accepting a cost in control and authorship. Orientation is strong from the start; stakes tighten with the new resonance and returning footsteps. The price is legible in the final image and coheres with the taught pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and the orphaned fluorescent lamp are vivid, specific, and integral to action and closure. The lamp’s hum functions as a tool and constraint, and the trees materially affect the ending by shielding the notepad. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered through her studious craft. The final image is charged by place/object logic rather than postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes—ownership of the archive vs. opening it to a chorus—are signaled early and deepen with the alien resonance. The meaningful tightening occurs when she recognizes histories not her own, then chooses to invite others as footsteps return. Cost is the surrender of sole authorship and potential disruption of her curated order. The escalation is subtle but coherent for this lyric mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: authorship versus community, memory as made and shared, artifact as conduit. The final act reframes the mountain from personal archive to communal chorus without moralizing. Recurring motifs (lamp hum, bonsai, notepad) reweight meaning at the end. The piece invites reflection on truth/fabrication with emotional honesty and no tidy platitudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature holds steady, with diction and rhythm tuned to her meticulous mind. The voice modulates with discovery (the “Variant Theta” moment) and remains consistent in distance and certainty. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference reads as inference. Elision is purposeful and paid off via the closing reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet controlled; images do multiple jobs and propel mood and meaning. Figurative density is high but patterned and legible, with minimal redundancy. Syntax varies, punctuation is clean, and the final line lands cleanly. There’s slight risk of purple, but it never muddies causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—bonsai maze as archive, invented histories refracted via a flickering fluorescent lamp—feels original and inevitable in hindsight. The “chorus” revelation transforms the premise without gimmickry. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes and coherence. Key beats arise from established particulars rather than late rule changes.</comment>
