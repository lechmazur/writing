<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Coherent, specific interiority and motive (honoring endings; “empathy was his compass”) drive every micro‑choice. The past at the Archive and transfer “downward” supply credible history and cost. Internal contradiction is minimal—he’s largely aligned—so pressure never forces him into a wrenching trade‑off. Nonetheless, embodied emotion (kneeling, tears, broom as benediction) keeps him vivid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: ritual sweeping → visitor comet → efflorescence → earned stasis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reaffirms the vocation with a reweighted stillness after witnessing the comet’s surrender. Orientation is clean early (where/who/what), and the single scene with reflective braids stays legible. The cost is quiet but on the page (solitude, invisibility, renunciation of “glory”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Worlding is precise and purposeful: Andromeda Drift rim, analog dials, wind‑chime sensors, archival glass. The yellow lantern glass functions as a charged micro‑setting and tool that constrains how he sees and acts, and it returns to charge the final image. Sensory detail is balanced and POV‑filtered, with object history (poet‑astronomer) deepening stakes. Environment coheres and shapes tactic (wonder over warning; no alarms).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witnessing endings as sacred) tightens when the rogue comet arrives and chooses the pulsars’ “sigh.” Escalation is a deepening of attention rather than a hard narrowing of options; his agency is endurance/renunciation, not intervention. The setting’s non‑alarm ethos supports the quiet test of his method and commitment. Cost is felt, if subtle, in the recommitment to obscurity and the emotional toll.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of impermanence, surrender, and “flourishing stillness” are embodied by concrete events (the comet’s bloom) rather than mere assertion. A few abstract lines flirt with didacticism (“Where others saw entropy, he saw release”), but the images carry the weight. The final stasis reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext (choosing presence over prophecy, reverence over protocol) hums under action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric voice with controlled diction and cadence; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates from hushed ritual to charged witnessing and back to benediction. Figurative language remains voice‑true to this character’s cosmology. Dialogue absence suits the solitary POV and aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and mostly lean, with strong verbs and purposeful images; repetitions feel patterned rather than scaffolding. A few aphoristic turns edge toward purple, but clarity and propulsion persist. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support momentum and the closing image. No artifacts or loops materially dull the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The “cosmic janitor” frame, analog station ethos, and lantern glass as soul‑filter feel fresh and integrated. The comet’s efflorescence between dying pulsars is a striking, non‑obvious turn that aligns with the theme. Risks (lyric quietude, anti‑plot) pay off through coherence and closure. The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
