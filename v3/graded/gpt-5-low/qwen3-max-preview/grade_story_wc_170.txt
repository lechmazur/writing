<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation is legible (return the borrowed heartbeat; coax mirrors into possibility), and actions align. Interiority is mostly projected through image rather than conflicted thought, yielding limited on‑page contradiction. The “perceptively calm” stance fits but softens pressure. Still, embodied micro‑choices (palm to stone, hums the code, refusal to linger) read true.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: song → prism → mirrors reconfigure → relinquishment. Closure lands as a charged poise: she returns the heartbeat and leaves, foreclosing attachment; the tolling bell seals a before/after. Cost is conceptual but clear—self‑erasure and non‑possession are the price of her work. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The terrace, rain‑wet marble, prism parapet, and tarnished mirrors are vivid and functionally integrated. Environment constrains method (mist + prism make the “canvas”) and charges the final image (mirrors alive with doorways). Sensory economy is strong without tourist cataloguing. World rules are learned through use, not explained.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (can she persuade mirrors; can she return the heartbeat intact) and tighten in the hush before the bell. Escalation reads as density: mirrors shiver, then reveal increasingly charged possibilities; the self‑image in mirror three is the turn. The price is primarily renunciatory, not contested, so pressure stays aesthetic rather than dire. Still, the cadence shift to release is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: hope lent and returned amplified; art as permission rather than revelation; possibility over fixed truth. The lullaby “code” and mirrors’ alternatives build subtext without moralizing. The final renunciation resists tidy closure, leaving a resonant afterimage. A faint sentimentality risk is contained by specificity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person with mythic distance and controlled certainty. Rhythm modulates well from hushed buildup to bell‑sealed release. No head‑hopping or stance drift; diction fits the piece’s register. Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (e.g., “each droplet catching the slant of dusk” sets time, tone, and method). Figurative language is lush but mostly coherent; minimal redundancy and no template cadence loops. A few stacked modifiers flirt with purple, yet clarity and propulsion hold. Final line cleanly recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—mirage painter borrowing heartbeats to persuade mirrors via coded lullabies and a rain‑lit prism—is fresh and precisely realized. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (the third mirror’s self‑image, the bell’s hush framing the act). Authentic vision overrides trope echoes.</comment>
