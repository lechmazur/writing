<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rich, idiosyncratic interiority and embodied traits (moon‑tuned physiology, the censer hum settling behind her sternum) ground motive and micro‑choices. The arc from ignoring rhythm to honoring it—and the chosen practice of calling/singing—reads earned. Contradictory pulls (longing for coordinates vs. acceptance of silence) coexist without tidy resolution. Relationship pressure is minimal, but the unknown voice introduces a subtle crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. The closure image (full‑moon ascent, song to absences, seepage replies) lands with conceptual cost and a before/after reframing (“abandonment” → “recalibration”). Causal threads within the mode are coherent (hydraulics failure → silence → calls → final sending). Orientation is clear early and the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The signal station, gantry, and broken dish array are vivid and tactically used (climbing the highest gantry; wind as carrier), with the censer foot functioning as a micro‑setting/anchor object. Sensory detail is selective and purpose‑driven across sound, touch, and scent. World rules (resonance over ringing) are consistent. The environment charges the final image decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via pattern density and timing constraints: the failed attempt during a crescent, then respecting phases, culminating in the full‑moon send. Stakes remain internal but coherent—the cost is endurance without fixing, committing to a practice that yields only seepage. One meaningful tightening lands with the final act and flicker replies. The conflict is quiet, not anemic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes through concrete motifs—resonance vs. resurrection, reverse migration, altars of static—without slipping into sermon. Final reframing of “abandonment” as “recalibration” offers an earned, resonant answer to grief navigation. A few declaratives (“Not resurrection. Resonance.”) verge on thesis but feel integrated by the imagery’s work. The aftertaste is reflective and specific rather than platitudinous.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, coherent lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature sustains across the piece. Diction and rhythm suit the character’s attention and the world’s radio/astral lexicon; the brief dialogue is eerie and functional. Psychic distance remains stable, with purposeful modulation at the climax. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and musical, with purposeful repetition as pattern rather than scaffold. Figurative language clusters around a tight semantic field (signal, tide, metal, moon) avoiding muddle. Minimal redundancy and strong verb choices keep momentum in a contemplative register. No noticeable mechanical errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—astral/radio ritual as a cartography of loss, “reverse migration,” and a censer foot as anchor—is fresh and cohesive. Risks in concept and diction heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the taught pattern. Memorable images and methods elevate beyond trope.</comment>
