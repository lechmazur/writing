<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority and a coherent drive: skeptic, grief-struck, yet compelled to “calibrate” belief against guilt. Micro-choices under pressure—entering, ungloving to touch, digging out the radio, twisting the wheel—reveal values and contradictions. The self-implicating realization (“a prop she’d unconsciously lugged here”) deepens flaw and agency. Slight neatness to that inference keeps this just shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative build that lands a clean Conceptual Repricing: ghosts → echoes/guilt, with a cost the protagonist accepts. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and the causal chain is legible and motivated. The transistor’s improbable persistence reads as a stylized but thematically consistent device, not a cheat. The final turn (twisting the wheel; choosing to carry) closes the arc on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: mildew, gravel, rust, the crooked alcove, and the tarnished brass wheel are filtered through her urgency. The wheel functions as object-as-setting, charging discovery and closure. Dawn at the mouth reframes mood without overstatement. Minor note: the tunnel doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond discovery, but it supports tone and image superbly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can she locate and own the weight of guilt) tightens through the radio reveal and culminates in the tactile act of turning the wheel and accepting burden. Internal and external layers interweave cleanly; the recognition of her own voice narrows options. The price is felt (no absolution, only steadier carrying). Escalation is quiet but genuine and character-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ghosts reframed as echoes of guilt and “mind’s machinery” integrates theme with event, not sermon. Recurring images (wheel, 3:17, dawn, radio) shift meaning at the end to answer the core question. A few explicit lines (“She didn’t believe in ghosts. But she believed in echoes.”) verge on thesis-y but feel earned by the scene. The aftereffect is sober and resonant rather than tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Controlled close-third voice with distinct texture: measured lyricism that modulates from “drowsy alertness” to steadier resolve. The radio’s quoted dialogue adds contrast without disrupting focalization. Diction and rhythm align with the character’s mental state, and inference reads as inference. No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do double duty (dust as “silent applause”). Figurative language is apt and varied, avoiding purple excess or mixed metaphors. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum, and there are no paraphrase loops or cadence ruts. A couple of aphoristic sentences skate close to summary but don’t sap the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: paranormal trope inverted via talk-radio texture and a self-haunting through archived voice. The “calibration” motive and the beaded valve’s reweighting feel inevitable in hindsight. Quiet risk—eschewing big scares for conceptual cost—pays off cleanly. Minor contrivance (radio functioning) is subsumed by the piece’s integrity.</comment>
