<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Silas’s motive—decoding the boutonnière—drives every choice with a distinct, embodied interiority (“the gap to speak”). The endurance to return nightly and the refusal to report at the end read as an Earned Stasis with a subtle cost. Internal contradiction is muted; he rarely wavers, which slightly limits dynamism. Still, his actions consistently reveal a precise, idiosyncratic psyche.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern of watching gaps → sensory shard on night four → conceptual reconfiguration and decision not to report. Orientation is clean from the opening; the closure lands as a charged withholding with conceptual cost. The causality is quiet but coherent—no outliney jumps or retroactive patches. Slight softness comes from limited external pressure, not structural confusion.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: opal dock, mist, and lantern recur and filter through Silas’s perception. The Edelweiss functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. Environment guides mood more than constrains action, keeping this just below the very top band. Sensory detail is selective and character‑specific without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode the gesture—tightens with the fourth‑night break when sensation arrives, altering knowledge and options. Agency appears as endurance and a final renunciation (not reporting), with a felt conceptual price. Lack of an adversarial force or harder trade‑off keeps escalation gentle rather than wrenching. Still, the cadence shift qualifies as a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of borrowed memory, witness, and love’s persistence emerge through concrete images (flower over the heart; lantern for ghosts). The ending reframes truth as belonging “to the sea,” a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext around complicity and privacy lends complexity. No platitudes; the motif’s reprise reweights prior material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is controlled and distinctive—lyric without drifting into abstraction. Diction tracks Silas’s sensibility; patterned phrasing (“gaps,” “nautical twilight”) teaches its cadence early and pays off. No head‑hopping; distance is steady. Minor flourish at peaks is purposeful, not a register stumble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight and musical; images (“blade through gauze,” “tide‑worn stone”) carry layered work. Minimal redundancy, good propulsion for a quiet piece. A touch of lushness risks purple but remains coherent and legible. No loops or artifact patterns dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper decoding a sea‑borne death via an alpine flower and “observing gaps”—feels fresh. The memory‑borrowing premise is integrated tactically rather than as mere theme. Risks are taken in quietness and method; they cohere. Only the gentle stakes ceiling keeps this from the very top band.</comment>
