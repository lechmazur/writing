<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Her motive and method cohere, and her calm under pressure reads earned through embodied choices (measuring echo decay, placing the lantern, leaving it as anchor). The internal tension between her mother’s warning and her refusal of amnesia adds credible push–pull. Costs are present but subtle (professional dismissal, self‑burden via name tattoos). A sharper on‑page trade‑off under immediate threat could lift this further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear: a routine inquiry deepens into a memory‑field investigation culminating in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending (leaving the lantern, accepting dismissal). Causality is inferential but consistent—empirical observation unlocks the 1852 surge reading and reframes the death. The final image carries cost and a before/after is legible. One more concrete obstacle in-scene would tighten pressure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful—the tunnel’s damp, diesel, runoff, and rails act as pressure and medium for the memory “reverberations.” The lantern functions as micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image and constrains choices. World rules (memory‑field) are learned through action rather than dump. Occasional overt symbolism (“city’s refusal to remember”) risks telling what the environment already shows.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs institutional amnesia) is clear, and escalation comes via the realization of a historic panic surge causing death. Her choice to anchor the lantern and accept institutional dismissal is an earned renunciation with cost. The tension is more deepening than reversal; adding a concrete risk (physical or bureaucratic) in-scene would heighten stakes. Still, the cadence shift at “Show me” and the lantern’s silver light functions as the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus progress emerges through the lantern, spectral data, and the city’s material refusal rather than mere thesis. Subtext hums in images (names inked, air growing still) and the ethical stance lands without pat resolution. A few explicit lines (“Ignorance is armor—until it becomes a cage.”) flirt with aphorism but remain supported by scene. The ending reweights prior images convincingly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—measured, sensorial, and quietly lyric—matching a data‑minded investigator in a haunted space. Distance control is steady; elisions and compressions are taught early and paid off with the lantern’s non‑flame light. Diction remains coherent under pressure, with clean focalization. A hair less meta phrasing in two spots would further refine the register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines are tight, image‑rich, and purposeful; most sentences do double duty with scene and theme. Figurative density is high but controlled, avoiding mixed metaphors; rhythm varies cleanly. Minimal redundancy; no template cadences or filter stacks. A couple of declaratives risk telling, but they don’t blunt the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis of forensic empiricism with historical haunting and civic memory gives this a fresh angle. The Underground Railroad lantern as data‑summoning object feels inevitable in hindsight and central to closure. Risks (lyric‑accumulative structure, restrained plot mechanics) pay off. Only the mild thematic explicitness keeps it just shy of the highest band.</comment>
