<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—reach the lost lover—and the self‑sacrifice is credibly earned by her history and present isolation. Interiority is embodied (sap bead’s heat, plum scent, tactile loom work) rather than labeled. The internal conflict (keep self vs. send message) is dramatized in the choice to weave herself. Slight safety: we rarely see a counter‑impulse tempt her away at the brink.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: the rummage box → puzzle → rebuilt loom → solstice → self‑weaving ladder tightens toward a costly closure. Closure lands on the page with felt price (chair empty, last thread falls) and a charged payoff (amber bead reaches him). The coincidence of the rummage box is fable‑legible and paid off by consistent world‑rules. Orientation is clear from the opening and time/place shifts are purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard/bamboo micro‑world is vivid and specific, with tools (loom, shuttles, bead) functioning as setting. Environment and object charge the final image: the bead is both compass and courier; the solstice and the grove’s hush constrain timing. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her craft. World rules (thin places, twilight threads) remain consistent and felt.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through a single decisive tightening: to send the message, she must dissolve herself into the weave. Agency drives the climb (rebuilds loom, chooses solstice, begins the passes), and cost is unmistakable as memories convert to glyphs. No antagonist, but pressure coheres and narrows options under the accumulative design. The rummage‑box coincidence complicates rather than resolves.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of love-as-communication through sacrifice emerges organically from events and recurring objects, not declaration. The final image reweights all prior motifs—the bead, the silence, the loom—into a resonant answer. Sentiment is held in check by concrete costs; no moralizing intrudes. The “raveling silence” evolves from loss to completion, adding conceptual depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close voice with consistent distance and a distinct perceptual signature (craft‑centric noticing). Patterned diction is taught early and modulates at peak beats without head‑hopping. A few repeated phrases risk incantatory excess but remain purposeful. Rhythm supports pressure, particularly in the shuttle‑pass sequence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet largely precise; images often do multiple jobs. Minor purple tendencies (“time’s unraveling tapestry” echoed) skirt redundancy but don’t blur causality. Syntax varies and propels the climax cleanly. No significant scaffold or filter‑verb stacking drags momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Weaving thresholds via a mouse‑nibbled star‑map puzzle and an amber bead as beacon feels freshly synthesized and inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its mythic physics without hedging, and the final transposition (her essence as starlight) is earned. Risks (fable coincidence, high lyric register) heighten stakes rather than obscure them. Specificity keeps the conceit from generic myth.</comment>
