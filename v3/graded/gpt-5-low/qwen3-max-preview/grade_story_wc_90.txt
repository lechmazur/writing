<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elira’s pacifism drives tactics and costs, and her interior contradiction is dramatized in the shadow’s “carry me like a wing” turn. Embodied emotional calibration (light/heavy) grounds motives in action. The final acceptance of her darkness reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a tidy epiphany. Micro‑choices (stitching, song, apology) under pressure reveal a coherent value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: set‑ups (photos, Tear, emotional gravity) pay off causally in the final stitching. Closure lands on the page with cost—the Tear dissolves, the ship is relinquished—and options reconfigure decisively. Orientation is clear early and the gate scene is legible. The persistent constraint (emotional calibration measured in “grams of levity per heartbeat”) shapes tactics through the climax.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The recycled ship, failing gravity plates, and object‑system (Kwan Yin’s Tear) are tactile and purpose‑driven; tool and environment charge the final image. Details are filtered through Elira’s priorities (repair, ritual, photos), avoiding museum‑tour listing. World rules (emotional gravity) remain consistent and integrated into action. The dissolving Tear as micro‑setting meaningfully constrains and completes the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reunion via Echo‑Realm) tightens through calibration risk (too heavy/too light) and the required acceptance of rage. The decisive act—stitching the final photograph’s frequency—arises from her choices, not luck. Visible price (loss of relic, leaving the ship) charges the resolution. Pressure coheres without an external antagonist, and the escalation reads as an intensification of the established pattern.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of nonviolent healing through integration rather than suppression is earned in scene, not declared. Recurring images (tears, stitching, weight) reweight at the end into reunion and dissolution of the Tear. The shadow’s line reframes darkness as lift, avoiding moralizing while offering a resonant answer. Complexity remains—the cost of leaving and losing the relic—tempering the uplift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Elira’s perceptual signature (tools, weight shifts, ritual). Cadence modulates well at the climax; the brief dialogue carries subtext without explaining. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Slightly elevated diction remains voice‑justified and consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors (“lullaby made of rust and solar wind”) that advance character and world. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies to maintain momentum. Ornate language skirts purple but stays legible and scene‑advancing. Final images are clean and unblurred by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: emotional gravity as calibration, stitching spacetime via crystallized tears, and a compassion‑relic that dissolves on fulfillment. Risks in tone and concept cohere under pressure and feel inevitable in hindsight. The shadow‑as‑wing turn reconfigures prior material with freshness. Genre conventions are transformed through precise, character‑driven choices.</comment>
