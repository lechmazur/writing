<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motives (patience, preservation) drive specific choices: the offering, the waiting, the request to “learn to read” knots. Interiority is precise and sensory-led rather than abstract. The relationship dynamic (supplicant vs. gatekeeper) is legible and evolves. Internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wavers, so complexity caps just below higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-scene accumulative design holds: approach → offering → test of patience → instruction → redefinition at closure. Orientation is immediate (dock, fog, fulgurite), and patterning is consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“I’m collecting hands”), with a modest but present cost (commitment, endurance). Slight softness in explicit cost keeps it just shy of the 8.8+ range.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harbor fog, snow, tarred rope, and fulgurite create a tactile, selective atmosphere filtered through the collector’s priorities. The environment shapes mood and pace (hush that enables instruction) and the fulgurite charges the final image. Sensory balance extends beyond visual (salt, cold, weight of rope). Constraints are tonal more than logistical, limiting the ceiling slightly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—earning access to living tradition—tightens when Havel withholds, then grants instruction, and again as she proves competence. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. The cost is primarily endurance and responsibility rather than a sharp trade-off, so escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing. Absence of a harder price or reversal limits peak tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through embodied practice versus extractive capture—emerges organically via fulgurite/“storm’s tooth,” knot lexicon, and “carry” vs. “photograph.” Subtext lives in gesture and silence; the teaching method enacts the thesis. The final shift (“collecting hands”) reweights the premise without moralizing. Complexity lingers beyond the page.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyrical third-person maintains steady distance and a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is spare and character-true (Havel’s idiom contrasts with her measured tone) and moves the scene. Rhythm flexes with hush and instruction, avoiding head-hopping. Elevated diction feels earned by voice and setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Clean, economical prose with images doing double duty (fulgurite as offering and motif). No visible loops or scaffolding; syntax varies to sustain momentum. A few lush turns approach purple but remain legible and purposeful. Final cadence is crisp and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: a seed collector apprenticing to knot-weavers, fulgurite as “sky’s broken tooth,” and ropes that hold story. The quiet-risk structure (instruction as plot) pays off with a fresh, inevitable-feeling reframe. Details feel singular rather than templated. Ingenuity is high without gimmickry.</comment>
