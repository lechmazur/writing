<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and embodied—dust, oxide, warmth—grounding her motive to resist erasure. Micro‑choices (what to return, where to place it) reveal a hierarchy of values under quiet pressure. The internal contradiction (yearning for visibility vs. remaining unseen) is credible and carried to an earned refusal. Slight softness: her flaw set stays safely benevolent, limiting sharper friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: the ritual → tape discovery → placement → staff recognition → posted notice lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Closure cost is felt (she remains hidden, risking slow hunger for recognition) and options reweight around “visibility without spectacle.” Orientation is clean early; no causality hiccups. The cost is subtle rather than biting, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library’s underbelly, stained glass, ducts, and microfilm reader are tactile and POV‑filtered, charging the final image. Environment consistently shapes action (crawl spaces, boiler room paths, placement spots). Sensory specificity is strong across sight, touch, and sound. It stops short of a hard constraint moment, hence not higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate around being felt/known; escalation is the decisive intensification of the tape fragment and its public recognition. Agency drives the turns—she chooses to surface artifacts and risk being noticed. The price (remaining unseen, exposure risk, relinquishing objects) is legible but quiet. Tension is sustained, not jagged, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of resisting erasure through quiet offerings emerges organically from action and object work. The “if you’re listening… you’re not alone” refrain reweights the ending without sentimentality. Slight deduct for explicit thematic statements (“Visibility wasn’t spectacle. It was resonance.”) that edge toward thesis. Still, the afterimage is earned and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (technical yet reverent). Diction modulates with pressure (sapphire hush → gold warmth) without head‑hopping. Dialogue snippets feel natural and advance the stakes. No stance or tense slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery; metaphors are apt and coherent (“broken promise,” “oxide spirals”). Rhythm varies and momentum never stalls. A few elevated phrasings flirt with purple but stay voice‑justified. No loops or scaffold artifacts.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis: a clandestine caretaker archaeologizing abandonment under a public library, using archives’ detritus to make herself felt. Turns are grounded and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and design pay off without gimmickry. Not radically unprecedented, but distinctly singular in execution.</comment>
