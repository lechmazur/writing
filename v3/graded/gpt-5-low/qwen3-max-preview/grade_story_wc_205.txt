<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular—the shard as “a rosary of regrets” nails his state. Motivation evolves credibly from failed insurgency to translator of a lost social grammar. Micro‑choices (covering mirrors, accepting Voss, transcribing poems) reveal values under pressure. The shift reads earned with felt cost: renouncing the old war for a quieter, riskier one.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative drive holds: storms → veiled mirrors → stable glyphs → collaborative transcription. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: rebellion reframed as memory‑keeping, with the final haiku sealing a before/after. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of prior identity and in courting academic/political backlash. Orientation is clear from the outset; pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, low gravity, and chrono‑winds are sensorially rich and rule‑consistent. Environment constrains tactics (covering mirrors during storms) and charges the final image (dawn on gilt balconies, mirrorless chamber). Details filter through his grief‑tuned attention, avoiding tourist cataloging. The shard functions as object‑as‑setting, projecting glyphs that shape action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue/reimagine civilization’s memory—tightens via the method’s refinement and Voss’s arrival. The key deepening is the velvet‑draped mirrors leading to full sentences, which reweights options. The conflict is quiet but coherent; the price is a re‑allegiance from action to attention. External antagonism (guilds, dispute) stays mostly offstage, keeping pressure more internal than peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme fuses form and action: silence, reflection, and refracted time become ethics of remembrance. Motifs (mirrors, storms, unfinished songs) accrue and shift meaning at the end. One explicit thesis line (“The real rebellion was against forgetting”) edges toward telling, but subtext still predominates through images. The final haiku offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without closing complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature tied to his history and grief. Dialogue is sparse yet weighted; Voss’s line lands with subtext and respect. Diction suits a romantic‑intellectual revolutionary in elegiac exile; stance stays stable. Rhythm modulates well from lush description to charged stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is dense but largely purposeful; metaphors cohere to light, glass, and time. Minimal redundancy; sentences do multiple jobs (world, emotion, stakes). A few high‑register flourishes flirt with purple but don’t blur sense or closure. Momentum holds through the lyric cadence to a clean final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Visible time, mirror‑veiling as chrono‑acoustics, and wealth measured in shared silence feel freshly synthesized. The shard‑projected glyphs and comet‑tail velvet are specific and memorable. The revaluation of revolution as translation is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and tone heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
