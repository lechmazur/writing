<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elira’s motives and methods are clear and coherent, with embodied specificity (salt on shawl, handle of the valve) revealing temperament. Her agency culminates in proposing the rite rather than seeking memorials, an earned renunciation with conceptual cost. Internal contradiction is muted—she’s preternaturally composed and competent—so pressure on her psyche remains low. Still, micro-choices (listening, cross-referencing, refusing statues) reveal a distinct hierarchy of values.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: interviews → patterning → proposal → communal rite. Closure lands on the page with cost and a felt before/after—the town’s practice changes and loss is ritualized rather than erased. Orientation is clean from the first line; no lens ambiguity. The trumpet valve centering the chart and the rite provides a crisp on‑page cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor is vivid, specific, and POV‑filtered; details (fog, gulls, brine, customs house attic) are active rather than postcard. The valve functions as a micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image and frames meaning. Weather and environment reflect and feed the work without heavy-handed symbolism. Spatial and sensory coherence never falter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through density and communal stakes: trust accrues, evidence compiles, then the proposal confronts civic habit. Cost is conceptual—no statues, accepting rust and silence—which fits the lens but keeps visceral jeopardy low. The meaningful tightening is the council scene into the first rite, which reweights loss into practice. Stakes remain coherent and focused.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief mapped into geography, memory as navigation, honoring silence’s shape. The final ritual image conceptually reprices the premise—absence becomes a compass—without moralizing. Recurring objects/images (valve, fog, tide, names) deepen resonance. It invites reflection beyond plot with disciplined ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction, rhythm, and syntax are controlled and purposeful. No head‑hopping; psychic distance is steady. Compression is taught and maintained; the voice earns its poetry. Modulation at the end lands with charged poise.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line craft is strong: high information density, clean syntax, and purposeful imagery without muddle. Some figurative lushness risks saturation, but it stays legible and grounded in action. No loops or scaffolding; paragraph rhythm supports momentum. Final lines precisely echo earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Archivist of absences” and the trumpet valve as a mute compass feel singular and inevitable in hindsight. The seasonal rite derived from data and listening refreshes familiar memorial tropes. Risks in concept and tone cohere and heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis of method, setting, and theme reads authentically new.</comment>
