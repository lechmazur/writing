<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and character‑specific: recovery of stolen memories drives rigorous, embodied inquiry. The internal conflict culminates in a credible Earned Stasis—leave and warn vs. stay and pay with the rest of herself. Interiority is sensorial and non‑generic (rosewater, pipe smoke, peaches). The final smile reads as a costly acceptance powered by her flaw—curiosity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear single‑POV structure with a coherent Hybrid (accumulative/causal) drive: mapping distortions → experiment under the warped skylight → triggered pulse → charged choice. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis; cost is legible in the line “let the orchard take the rest,” reweighting all prior beats. Orientation is strong early, with the greenhouse and ring of wrecks anchoring. A hairline limitation: the choice’s consequence remains implied rather than enacted on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely specific and active: the sunken greenhouse’s glass warps starlight, directly enabling the test and shaping options. Environmental rules are learned through action (bent constellations map disappearances), and the shipwreck ring externalizes the orchard’s predation. Sensory detail is purposeful across modalities (brine, glass chime, scent‑triggered memory). The final image is charged by place, not a postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover vs. risk further loss—tightens through the experiment’s pulse and the seeped fragments that change her options. The trawler’s route break as trigger is a crisp pressure point; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The final decision forecloses a path with felt cost. Slight limitation: external antagonism is diffuse, relying on environmental pressure rather than contested exchange.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory as ecology and curiosity as appetite emerge from particulars, not thesis lines. The orchard’s “steal to survive” reprices the moral frame without moralizing, and the ending’s acceptance resists tidy comfort. Recurring images (glass, stars, fruit, scent) deepen resonance at closure. A touch more friction between duty (warn) and obsession could intensify the afterimage.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a field‑worn folklorist; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Purposeful compression and image chains are legible and taught early. No POV slippage or unearned certainty; the speculative leaps are framed as theory. Minor lushness never overwhelms clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: high information density, varied sentence rhythm, and purposeful repetition. Metaphors are coherent to the world (glass, tides, orchards, constellations), with no mixed vehicles at the peak. Occasional stacked modifiers approach purple but remain controlled by concrete anchors. No loops or scaffold that slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—undersea Victorian orchard feeding on rupture, mapped via warped constellations—feels striking and inevitable in hindsight. The method and mythos are integrated through character and place, not gimmick. The final reweighting (predator as ecosystem; curiosity as complicity) is fresh and earned. Boldness is high without sacrificing legibility.</comment>
