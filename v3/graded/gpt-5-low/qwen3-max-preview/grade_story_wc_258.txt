<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motive and praxis: she maps post‑collapse culture via onyx‑ink cards and a measuring tape. Interiority is steady and credible, if cool; we feel method more than contradiction. The small relational beat (“Tell me what you see”) shows humility-as-agency, but there’s little visible cost or rupture. Strong presence, minimal internal conflict limits ceiling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: observation → ledger confession → mapped convergences → visitor’s reframing. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (“They’re remembering forward”) with the tape’s reprise as charged poise. Orientation is clean from the opening; pattern-building escalates coherently. Cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it short of exceptional.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV‑filtered: rain‑beaded skylight, hollowed financial district, QR‑phoenixes and chalk equations. The loft and rain charge tone and process, while the measuring tape functions as a micro‑setting tool that returns in the final image. Details feel chosen by her occupational bias, not touristic. Constraint is more tonal than tactical, but consistently integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether meaning can be mapped in the ruins; pressure rises by density: convergence points, shared hashtags, #FeedTheFuture. The meaningful tightening is the visitor’s reading that reweights the work. Little explicit cost or foreclosed option appears on the page, so tension remains tempered. Still, agency appears in method and curation rather than confrontation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of recomposition, communal memory, and symbols supplanting code accrue through concrete emblems (QR‑phoenix, equations for meals). Subtext breathes in ritual gestures and the invitation to co‑read the cards. A couple of on‑the‑nose lines (“This wasn’t chaos. It was recomposition.”) skim didacticism, but the final exchange earns resonance. The ending reframes past material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, textured voice with precise lexicon, rhythmic control, and clean close third. Dialogue is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext (“Tell me what you see”). The perceptual signature—measurement metaphors, card‑as‑culture—stays consistent. No stance slippage or head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; figurative language is rich but disciplined. Minimal redundancy, strong cadence variety, and no pattern artifacts or loops. Occasional heightened declarations are balanced by tactile specifics. The final line lands cleanly without purple overspill.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Cartomancy as cultural reverse‑engineering in a post‑crypto city is fresh and coherently exploited. Specific inventions (measuring meme virality vs. irony, QR‑phoenixes, foreclosure‑constellations) feel inevitable in hindsight. The risk—lyric method piece with quiet closure—pays off without obscuring clarity. Singular vision rises above template.</comment>
