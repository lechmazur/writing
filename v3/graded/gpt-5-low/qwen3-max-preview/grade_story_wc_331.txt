<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, particularized motivation and perceptual bias (“sanely eccentric,” alphabetizing by resonance) produce coherent choices—she steals into the Restricted Stacks, activates the tessellation, sings. Interiority is present via tactile and auditory cues (chalk dust, humming), but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers. Her relationship to the grandmother via the scarf adds depth without becoming sentimentality. The final stance (reawakener, not cataloger) reads earned, though the on‑page cost remains light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single‑POV, one scene plus a single crossing beat; orientation is swift and clean. The accumulative drive coheres to a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: stories as living orbs, her role shifting from retrieval to reawakening. Causality is clear (scroll → scarf → axiom → amphitheater → song → return), but the closure’s cost is conceptual rather than felt, keeping it below the highest band. No dropped setups or logic leaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific (scientific poetry library; Restricted Stacks; “Non‑Euclidean Lullabies”; amphitheater of story‑cores) and filtered through her trained attention. The scarf and tessellated scroll function as micro‑settings/tools that constrain action and enable the crossing. World rules are learned through use rather than exposition. The final image is charged by place (patrons feeling warmer pages), though the environment doesn’t actively corner her into a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find where stories live) is signaled early and escalates through the crossing and song. Pressure is mostly textural; no antagonist or hard obstacle tests her resolve, and risk/cost are muted. The meaningful tightening is the decision to enter and then to sing to reawaken, which reweights purpose. Earned but gentle stakes keep tension below truly bracing levels.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of analog memory as sanctuary (post–Data Collapse) integrates with action: only the tactile scarf bridges to the story‑realm and her role reframes preservation as care. Subtext accrues through motifs (hyperbolic language holding infinities; humming conjectures), avoiding explicit moralizing. The final return subtly answers the core question: stories “live” when witnessed and sung to. Complexity is present, though the piece doesn’t press an opposing claim or cost hard.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, musical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction aligns with a mathematically‑literate librarian. Patterned phrases (“Not metaphorically.”) are taught and purposeful, adding cadence without confusion. Distance is steady, with rhythm modulating at the crossing. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; verbs are strong and syntax varies. A few lush lines flirt with purple, but the figurative system (math/geometry ↔ story) stays coherent. Repetition is purposeful and not loop‑like; momentum holds through the crossing and return. The cost’s lightness is thematic, not a line‑level drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis—scientific poetry stacks, hyperbolic tessellations as portals, analog heirloom as key—feels fresh and internally consistent. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule changes. The risk is aesthetic (lyric math) and pays off. Only the soft pressure limits transcendence into the very top band.</comment>
