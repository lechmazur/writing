<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elira’s motive is clear and embodied: she chooses to remove her gloves and endure psychic contagion to “sandpaper” rough memories. Her micro-choices under pressure (pillar to arch to basin) align with this drive and reveal competence plus cost. Internal contradiction is subtler—she trembles but rarely wavers—so the conflict leans toward steadfast endurance over ambivalence. The ending registers earned change without feeling unmotivated.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain reveals geometry, descent intensifies exposure, the basin plunge culminates in an on‑page reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when), and the single continuous scene coheres. Closure lands with cost—the pavilion releases remorse as she emerges “hollowed but whole.” The because/therefore chain in this mode is clean and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: rain-slicked fortress reflections guide access; subterranean frost and coral architecture constrain tactics and risk. Sensory specificity is filtered through a chef’s palate (salt, metallic tang), deepening POV. The environment charges the final image (petrichor replacing salt), satisfying the 9‑band constraint link. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—absorbing stored remorse until it becomes “bearable weight”—is signaled early and tightened by the choice to remove gloves and finally submerge both hands. Escalation is clear (touch → overwhelm → still center → plunge), and the price is viscerally rendered. The conflict is primarily endurance-based rather than choice between competing goods, but the cost is unmistakable. Resolution is earned by the protagonist’s fortitude and method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres around transforming grief from laceration to weight; motifs reprise with evolved meaning (salt → petrichor; shell → vessel). Subtext works through tactile ritual and environment rather than moralizing. The final articulation of her future cooking risks slight explicitness but arises credibly from what we’ve witnessed. Resonance lingers in the conceptual repricing of sorrow as soil for “something softer.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly bound to a sensorium of taste and touch appropriate to a chef who reads emotion via objects. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful compression reads legibly, and stance remains consistent. Lines earn their music without tipping into opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is controlled and propulsive; images often do double duty for mood and plot. A few rich image strings press toward density, but metaphors remain coherent and scene-advancing. Minimal scaffolding or loops; cadence varies well. The peak beats are clear and uncluttered by figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Chef-as-mnemosomatic taster, tidal-pool analysis as method, and a coral ice vault of remorse synthesize into a fresh, memorable conceit. The risk of high lyricism is embraced and pays off in a specific, character-driven ritual. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight given the established rules. It reads as singular rather than stitched from familiar templates.</comment>
