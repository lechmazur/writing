<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The recluse’s motive—honoring a covenant by preserving the unsaid—holds steady and compels endurance choices (refusing to open the box, shielding it in storms). Interiority is conveyed through precise attentional habits rather than abstract labels. The arc is an earned stasis with felt cost, though internal contradiction is subdued (temptation vs. duty is implied more than dramatized). Absence of a second, pressuring on‑page character limits relational crucible dynamics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is clear from the outset and held: ritual, ghosts, and the box pattern toward a charged poise. Closure lands when the master beekeeper’s ghost meets her gaze and she bows—an on‑page reconfiguration that ratifies the covenant with cost. The persistent constraint (never opening the box) shapes tactics throughout and charges the final image. Orientation is clean and the cadence shift at the end is unmistakable.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The wasteland and beekeeping ruin are tactile, filtered through her perceptual signature, and the stained glass box functions as micro‑setting. Environment constrains choices (storms necessitate shielding; ash, collapsed hives, and light through glass shape ritual). Specific occupational relics (honey press, rusted smokers) are purposeful, not touristic. The final honey‑gold light image is inseparable from the place and object.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: preserve the unsaid vs. the lure of release, escalating via storms and the intensifying presence of ghosts. The tightening is a deepening rather than reversal, culminating in the gaze exchange that narrows options by reaffirming renunciation. Cost is legible (continued burden, bodily shielding), though there’s limited adversarial pressure or explicit temptation beat. Tension operates more in cadence and image than in conflict turns.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of silence, obligation, and the ethics of keeping versus speaking are embodied in specific images and acts, not lectured. The box, ghosts, and light accrue meaning, and the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: translation without disclosure. No moralizing; ambiguity remains meaningful (preservation as mercy or denial). The conceptual repricing of “unsaid words” into weight lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with stable close third focalization; perception is character‑specific (archivist reverence, tool‑literate noticing). Rhythm modulates with pressure (storms vs. vigil) without head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (contents of the box) is taught early and paid off in the covenant logic. Diction stays coherent and confident across the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry layered work (world, character, theme) with minimal scaffolding; imagery is vivid and largely precise. A few lush turns risk purple drift, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially near the close. Repetition patterns read intentional rather than looped. The final lines are clean and earned, with no figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of post‑apocalyptic beekeeping, visible ghosts, and a covenant to preserve silence feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The stained‑glass reliquary and “weights of the unsaid” concept avoid genre cliché. Risk‑taking is quiet but bold in its refusal to open the box or over‑explain. The originality rests in integrated particulars rather than a twist.</comment>
