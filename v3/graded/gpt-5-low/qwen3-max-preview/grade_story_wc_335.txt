<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority with embodied contradictions: she’s both brusque and protective, choosing sharp pedagogy over comfort. Micro-choices under pressure (backward pacing, one forward step, the 37-degree line) reveal values at cost. The novice and cartographer dynamics sharpen her motive without softening her edges. The Earned Stasis—maintaining combative mentorship despite exile risk—reads credible and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens taught early and held: the shadow, tea geometry, and backward-walk pattern tighten toward a charged poise. Closure lands on the page—the shadow remains contained, exile stays reversible, cartographer’s map reconfigures—at a felt cost. Orientation is clean from the opening. Stakes and rules remain consistent without causal cheats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The library, skylight, and swing aren’t decorative; they constrain attention and tactics (she monitors the shadow at specific “hush” beats). Tea, desks, and Rare Cartographies merge tool and place into method. World rules (trapped shadow, listening library) are learned by action. The final image is charged by setting: dusk through fractured glass, the swing’s hush, the held shadow.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—misreading leads to exile and shadow escape—is clear, with pressure deepening through dusk and the swing’s hush. Her agency drives turns (disciplining the novice, the cartographer intervention, the deliberate forward step, then retreat). The price is endurance and self-fracture rather than a flashy reversal, but it’s legible. A hair more on-page jeopardy would sharpen the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of resilience without false repair, mentorship’s cost, and using boundaries as compass accrue through concrete images (glue vs grit; tea fractures; compass line). Subtext operates in gesture and object use; dialogue carries implication. One explicit thesis line (“This is the cost of combative tenderness…”) edges toward statement but feels earned by prior scene work. The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent voice—lyric yet purposeful—filters every detail through her perceptual logic. Dialogue is sparse, sharp, and subtextual; no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates with pressure (hush beats tighten, dusk lengthens). Elevated diction matches the fable-technical register of the world.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do double duty (tea geometry = method + fate). Figurative language is rich but coherent; cadence varies, avoiding monotony. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks that dull momentum. A few aphoristic lines flirt with overtness but stay anchored in scene.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Tea-leaf topology as historiography, a shadow trapped in glass, and reversible exile as a live mechanism feel freshly synthesized. Risks in structure and diction heighten coherence rather than obscure it. Turns arise from established rules and character stance. The final conceptual reframing (line as compass, not cage) lands with inevitability.</comment>
