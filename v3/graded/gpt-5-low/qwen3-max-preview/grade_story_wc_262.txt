<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent: she seeks where unused love is stored and then chooses to release it. Interiority is vivid and embodied (“stitch itself into her ribs like a second skeleton”) with credible contradiction between collector and releaser. Micro‑choices under pressure—initiating the reading, following the echo, deciding to mail the letters—align with her traits. The cost is felt as she carries others’ grief, not just named.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The structure is a clean accumulative build from psychometry to discovery to release, with a clear closure beat. The decision to mail the letters constitutes on‑page reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is established early (projection booth in a storm), and the pattern holds. The marquee’s unprogrammed message risks neatness but reads as charged poise rather than a mechanical fix.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The projection booth and its tools meaningfully shape action and outcome: the projector’s baseplate hides the cache; the film itself is a conduit. Sensory details (ozone, dust, wet stone, velvet) are purposeful and filtered through her perceptual signature. The setting charges the final images (marquee, wet pavement, exhaling theater). Environment is not postcard décor; it constrains discovery and release.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on transforming incubated love into motion; pressure deepens through visions to the tangible cache. The tightening arrives with the hidden compartment and the choice to become the vessel and then the releaser. The price is emotional burden, carried forward into action. Escalation remains quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—unused love incubates and must be witnessed then released—emerges clearly from concrete acts. However, the marquee (“LOVE NEVER ENDS—ONLY CHANGES FORM”) and the final paragraph edge toward explicit moralizing, blunting subtext. Earlier images (unmailed letters, second skeleton, lanterns on a river) already earned the insight. The piece resonates, but it tells a touch too plainly at the end.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled; POV remains stable and plausibly bound to her perceptions. Rhythmic modulation suits rising pressure without slipping into haze. No dialogue is needed; the narrative cadence carries subtext. Diction coheres with the character’s sensibility and method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: vivid verbs, layered images, and efficient progression. Figurative density is high but largely coherent and purposeful; only occasional aphoristic turns feel on‑the‑nose. Momentum holds with minimal scaffold or redundancy. The final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Psychometry via film in a vintage booth, pursued to locate “unused love,” feels freshly synthesized. Risks in lyric mode and conceptual framing pay off with distinctive images (sprocket‑hole yearning, letters sealed “the color of dried roses”). A few familiar gestures (the marquee message) reduce surprise slightly. Overall, the vision is specific and memorable.</comment>
