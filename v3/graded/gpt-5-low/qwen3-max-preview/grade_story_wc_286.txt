<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and steady—she seeks why this oasis resists change—and her micro‑choices (aligning the glass, watering the bee, not firing, leaving the glass behind) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied and particular to a potter’s sensibility. Internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, so pressure is more contemplative than conflicted. The renunciation (leaving the compass‑glass) reads as a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: the thrum intensifies, visions layer, and the final act reconfigures meaning (soft vessel, unfired, glass nested). Orientation is clean from the outset (potter, kiln, beekeeping oasis, wasteland). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with the cost of relinquishing the guiding object. Causality is lyric but coherent, with because/therefore links through sun‑alignment and kindness‑activation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The oasis, kiln, hives, and desert tools are tactile, selective, and filtered through her craft. The lantern glass and beekeeping ruins constrain choices (timed sun alignment; decision not to fire in a place that teaches surrender). World rules (phototropic kindness; layered summers) are learned by action/observation. The final image is decisively charged by object‑as‑setting integration.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but tangible: understanding resistance to change and deciding how to hold time. Escalation reads as density/deepening—the thrum grows, bees return, she shifts from making a container to cradling time, culminating in not firing and leaving the glass. Costs are gentle but legible (relinquishing the tool, choosing permeability over permanence). Pressure is coherent though quiet.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of surrender vs preservation and kindness as a temporal adhesive emerge through repeated particulars (bee drinking, soft pot, unfired kiln). A few lines verge on thesis (“Kindness… the only force…”) but are supported by image‑work. The end reweights “change” as gentle transformation. Subtext hums in the craft choices rather than moral summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a potter’s perceptual signature (clay, coiling, firing) grounds the piece. Distance remains stable and apt, and patterned diction supports the accumulative design. No dialogue to test, but narrative rhythm modulates with pressure (thrum rising to lullaby). Confidence and plausibility hold throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but purposeful; images earn their keep (bees as cathedrals; honeycomb as palimpsest). Minimal redundancy and strong verb choices sustain momentum. A few metaphor concentrations flirt with purple, but coherence holds and closure is sharpened by precise objects. Syntax varies and cadence supports escalation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Potter + beekeeping ruins + kindness‑responsive lens + layered time is a fresh, organic synthesis. The unfired vessel as sanctuary for time reconfigures a familiar preservation trope in a non‑obvious way. Risks in tone and concept pay off without gimmickry. The final image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
