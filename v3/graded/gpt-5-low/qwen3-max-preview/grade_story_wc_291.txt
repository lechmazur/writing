<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s motives (awakening empathy over courtroom justice) are clear and drive concrete choices: staging the quarry vigil, lighting candles, placing the ribbon, and touching the man’s hand. Her face blindness inflects perception and action in specific ways (texture‑based sketches, tactile anchors). The killer’s guilt is embodied (tremor, coat salt, boots avoiding the ribbon), enabling an honest, non‑carceral resolution. Internal contradiction is subtle (compassion vs. danger/justice) but credible for the chosen mode.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: ribbon → vigil of textured portraits → man drawn in → masks unearthed → town’s reconfigured empathy. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (“The cold cases wouldn’t close in court”). One coincidence (the man appearing) is acceptable under the lens, paid off by pattern density and the ribbon’s charged placement. The dawn unearthing is slightly summarized but still integral to closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist, stone, and silence shape tactics (concealment, vigil, hidden relics) and charge the final images (candles, ribbon, glass cases). Sensory filtering through Elira’s tactile bias feels specific and lived (limestone chill, grit, silk decay). The setting functions as stage and accomplice to erasure and retrieval. World details remain consistent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes—memory vs. erasure—are established early and deepen when the man arrives and Elira chooses connection over accusation. The meaningful tightening is her invitation to “help me remember them properly,” foreclosing a punitive path. Costs are conceptual and social (no prosecutable resolution) rather than kinetic, which keeps tension quiet but coherent. Pressure holds under the accumulative lens without sag.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance versus erasure emerges through particulars: faceless portraits, the ribbon as lure, masks preserved in glass, the final faceless sketch of the killer. Subtext surfaces in gesture and texture more than statement; when lines verge on thesis (“people vanish twice”), they’re earned by the scene. The ending reweights the premise: empathy as counter‑violence to erasure. Resonance lingers without tidy moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and filtered through Elira’s perceptual signature (texture over visage), with consistent distance. Dialogue is sparse, goal‑driven, and subtextual, advancing the turn. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (hushed ritual to trembled confession) while staying coherent. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight and musical with high information density; images do double duty (masks as “faces,” mist as guilt). Occasional purple edges are present but do not muddy clarity or causality. Repetition patterns feel intentional (absence/texture/mask riffs) rather than scaffolding. The final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Face‑blind investigator using texture to counter erasure is a fresh angle; the killer as curator of stolen “faces” reframes culpability and grief. The quarry‑as‑stage mirroring the masquerade is a non‑obvious synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The risk of a justice‑refusing resolution reads bold and coherent. Specifics (silver thread moons with thorns; scent memories) lift it above template territory.</comment>
