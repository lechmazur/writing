<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elira’s goal and method are clear and consistent, with embodied perception (“each synaptic thread glowing”) revealing a mind built for pattern. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she rarely doubts or wavers—so pressure doesn’t expose layered impulses. Micro‑choices (which dialect to whisper, whether to seize Fragment Delta) are present but low‑friction. The closing acceptance of stewardship reads credible but not costly on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative: thresholds and inverted gravity create a patterned deepening toward the chamber. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (acquiring the Seed) plus a Conceptual Repricing (vigilance belongs in margins), and the chamber sealing and gravity snap provide concrete finality. Causality is clean—fragment fuse → sigil → door—within the lyric mode. The visible cost is modest but legible in the sealed chamber and collapsing window.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The grotto, mist, and inverted gravity directly constrain action (walking upside‑down; water rising; dust suspended) and shape tactics through thresholds. Recurring objects (Codex, sigil, lichen‑veined wall) evolve into functional tools, charging the final image. World rules stay consistent and are revealed through interaction rather than dump. The environment palpably choreographs discovery and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (access the hidden chamber during the sky’s sigh) is clear, with one meaningful tightening at each threshold and the fragment fuse beat. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑deepening rather than direct resistance; risk feels aesthetic more than perilous. The time‑box and sealing provide consequence. Agency drives each turn, though the price remains low‑temperature.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motifs (margins, doodles, vigilance) cohere and reweight the ending; the Seed reframes secrecy as protection from neglect. However, the final paragraph states the thesis explicitly (“vigilance cannot be enforced—it must be seeded…”), softening subtext and inviting the Thematic Echo penalty. Earlier images already earned the insight; telling blunts resonance. Still, the conceptual repricing lands.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, textured lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature suits the archivist’s cognition. Diction and rhythm modulate well through thresholds without head‑hopping or stance drift. Elevated vocabulary stays coherent to POV. A few lush lines flirt with purple, but remain legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with mostly multi‑tasking sentences; images advance action and world‑logic. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; metaphors track physical logic (“water… rose like liquid glass”). Minimal scaffolding and no evident loops. Slight overwriting in places marginally slows momentum, but does not harm clarity or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: inverted gravity window, marginalia as key, and “clandestinely luminous” archives feel distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. The fragment‑fusion → sigil vector is clever and earned. Risks in diction and worldbuilding heighten coherence without gimmickry. Emotional stakes could cut deeper, but the conceptual ingenuity is high.</comment>
