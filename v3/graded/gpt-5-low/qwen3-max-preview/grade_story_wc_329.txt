<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Her motive is clear and sustained, with embodied cost (aching bow arm, blisters) and specific tactics. However, internal contradiction is minimal—she acts from steady conviction without a palpable counter‑impulse. The statues’ shift to curiosity reduces interpersonal crucible pressure. Still, micro‑choices (soft timbre, pressing the shell to the body, pacing escalation) reveal values under strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: music accretes, shifts cadence, and reconfigures the system (statues to gardeners) with cost on the page. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the shell’s dust and the apple’s handoff. The arc stays coherent with one deepening turn rather than reversals. Minor softness in jeopardy keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and charged through action: patrol patterns, obsidian eyes, metallic apples, and the sky‑bridge all constrain choices. The tool/object layer (violin + shell) concretely alters tactics and charges the ending image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered by her aim; world rules are learned by observation, not exposition. Environment decisively shapes the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and escalates via density rather than confrontation (statues freezing → weeping → kneeling → gardening). The price is stamina and risk of triggering guards, but danger never truly bites, limiting pressure. The shift to louder yet “never harsh” plays as a meaningful tightening consistent with the lens. Resolution is earned by her endurance and attention more than a hard trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motifs (husks, gears vs. roots, molt) evolve into a resonant answer: beauty persists waiting for the right attention. Subtext works through tactile music and the statues’ dew, avoiding schematic allegory. A slight brush with explicit thesis (“The tarnished wonder... It was molting.”) curbs the mystery but doesn’t collapse into sermon. The final apple and dusted shell reweight prior images effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate with intensity. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the voice carries the accumulative design. Patterned elisions (metaphoric mechanics, heartbeat lexicon) are taught and paid off. Minor risk of rhapsodic saturation is well managed.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line craft is strong: sentences do multiple jobs, images are largely clean, and momentum is sustained. Some density of figurative language edges toward purple but remains coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or template cadences blunt the climax; the closure image is clear. Precision in verbs and concrete detail keeps music tactile rather than abstract.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: heart‑rhythm signaling, a locust shell as texture amplifier, statues reprogrammed by resonance, and an orchard shedding metallic sheen. Risks in concept and diction are integrated and paid off at closure. Turns arise from established logic rather than late gimmicks. The vision reads singular and memorable.</comment>
