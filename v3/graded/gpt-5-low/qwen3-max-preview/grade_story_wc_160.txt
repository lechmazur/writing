<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑particular—harmonizing control and mercy—and embodied through tactile choices (chain alignment, humming, covert copying). The “slyly heartfelt” method creates credible internal contradiction (competence vs. subversive compassion). Emotional texture feels lived (trembles, warmth of stone), not labeled. Cost is hinted (overseers, children downstream), though not stress‑tested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: envelope glue → ash → amphitheater harmonics → decision to embed mercy into systems. Orientation is crisp from the opening and sustained through a single scene with a clean exit image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a plan to recalibrate with risk and a reweighted mission. The cost is conceptual and social more than immediate; still effective but soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The amphitheater within a dormant volcano is vividly rendered through sound, heat, and dust and actively shapes discovery (harmonic resonance reveals inscriptions). The surveyor’s chain and acoustics function as micro‑setting tools constraining her method. Environmental breaths and warmth modulate tactics and theme. A touch lush, but purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are focused: recalibrate a failing system without losing soul; pressure tightens at the seventh marker and with the overseers’ implied scrutiny. The harmonic reveal deepens options and commits her to a covert path—synchronization over sabotage. Price is largely deferred and ethical rather than immediate; escalation remains coherent but quiet. One clear deepening beat suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—chain tension as chord, equations as lullabies, compassion as encoded design. The final promise that “mercy [moves] the gears” reweights the premise without didactic overreach. A couple of thesis‑like lines flirt with telling, but the imagery carries the load. Resonance lingers through the covenant motif.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric voice with a machinist’s perceptual bias (tools, ratios, pressure) sustains control. Diction and rhythm modulate with the building’s “breath,” paying off the pattern. No head‑hopping; distance is well managed. Elevated register occasionally edges away from plausibly lived lexicon but remains voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density and purposeful figurative work; motifs recur with intent rather than churn. A few lush metaphors risk saturation, but clarity holds and propulsion remains. Minimal scaffolding; varied rhythm supports momentum. Final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: envelope‑glue forensics, volcanic amphitheater acoustics, and “encrypted compassion” encoded into floodgate logic. The tactic—covertly reprogramming timers to mimic geologic breath—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks are aesthetic, not gimmicky, and they heighten the piece’s stakes. Originality resides in how the theme is engineered, not stated.</comment>
