<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bracken’s motives are clear and character‑particular (from body‑finder to keeper of voices), and his choices (leading the expedition, dedicating nights to decoding) align with them. Interiority is embodied through scent and tactile engagement with the leaf and grooves. Internal contradiction is mild—less struggle than steady vocation—so the arc reads as renunciation/endurance more than contested change. The relationship to the lost handler lends authentic pressure without melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the cylinder discovery → handler’s voice → choice to go east → archive → nightly resurrection forms a coherent tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he forgoes the old vocation to become the keeper of voices, with the settlement reweighted around resonance. Cost is legible in the renunciation of the hunt and the toll of nights decoding. Orientation is crisp from the outset (scrapyard, post‑war), with no causal slips.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The scrapyard, rust, shellac, and hand‑cranked dynamo are tactile and point‑of‑view filtered, with smell and texture doing heavy lifting. Environment and recurring objects (leaf, cylinders, turntable) constrain choices and charge the final image under his paw. World rules (bunkers, seed vaults, coded cylinders) feel consistent and learned through action. Tone and setting fuse to produce the “wild hush” nights credibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—tightens via the handler’s voice and the choice to act on coordinates. The eastward trek and archive discovery escalate pressure with a clear deepening rather than reversals. Costs are endurance/time and a vocational shift; no antagonist is needed under this lens. The final commitment to decode for the settlement reads earned and consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, mediation, and community are carried by specific images (tinted revelations, grooves as maps, nightly gatherings). Subtext arises in how he “matches voice to listener,” turning truth into presence rather than information. One aphoristic line (“truth wears many skins…”) approaches thesis, but it’s supported by action and avoids sermonizing. The last image reweights earlier motifs without stating a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice is sensorially distinct (olfactory bias, tool‑tactile attention) and consistent. Lyric compression is taught early and sustained without head‑hopping; brief dialogue fits the world and advances pressure. Rhythm modulates well from hush to discovery to communal ritual. No register drift undermines the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet largely precise; metaphors (tinted leaf, grooves as secret texts) are coherent and multi‑tasking. Minor purple tendencies never obscure causality, and sentences vary in cadence to maintain flow. Information density is high, with few redundancies. Opening and closing images are cleanly cut and mutually charging.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A retired cadaver hound decoding coded phonograph cylinders with a wax‑sealed leaf as chromatic lens feels genuinely fresh. The archive of voices reimagines post‑apocalyptic survival around resonance rather than salvage. Turns grow from established logic (handler’s voice → quest → communal praxis), not late rule changes. Risk—lyric accumulation and non‑action closure—pays off with clarity and emotional specificity.</comment>
