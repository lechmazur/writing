<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Vey’s interiority is specific (heartbeat unmoored, bureaucrat of seconds) and their actions align with motive, culminating in a credible shift to “curating echoes.” However, internal contradiction under pressure is lightly sketched; Lira catalyzes change without sustained interpersonal friction that would force harder choices. The relationship is evocative but low-conflict, limiting visible cost. Still, the final renunciation of counting seconds reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear and held: listings → meeting → capsule response → letter → fusion → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page via the fused urn’s chime and Vey’s heart resetting, a resonant reweighting with conceptual cost. Orientation is strong from the opening image; world rules are learned through action. Minor softness in explicit cost keeps it just below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The emerald silo and salt flats are vivid and functional; the silo’s core conditions the urn’s pulsing and the final ripple of panels. Objects-as-setting (capsule, urn) meaningfully charge the last image. Sensory texture is purposeful across senses (scent of rain and old paper, hums, ripples). World rules remain consistent and integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through a single meaningful deepening: Lira’s touch triggers the capsule shift, unlocking the letter and fusion. Stakes remain intimate and primarily conceptual, with limited foreclosing of options. The resolution is earned by collaborative action rather than coincidence, but the felt price is gentle. Tension operates mostly through wonder rather than risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of time as texture/accumulation emerge organically from particulars (recalibrated numbers, garage sale listings-as-breadcrumbs). However, overt statements—“Time isn’t broken. It’s breathing.” and “Time, Vey now knew, wasn’t to be measured.”—edge into moralizing, diluting subtext at the end. The imagery of echoes and curated moments does much of the work without needing the gloss. Resonance lingers despite the on‑the‑nose articulation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a stable close third on Vey; diction and rhythm suit the concept. Dialogue is minimal but functional and subtextual. Patterned elisions are taught and paid off; no head‑hopping. A few thesis-like lines slightly flatten modulation but not enough to harm coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is confident: strong verbs, vivid nouns, and multi-job sentences. Figurative language is rich yet mostly coherent and motivated; momentum rarely stalls. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; the closing image is clean. Occasional purple-leaning moments are balanced by clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑Recalibration numerics as textures, time capsule as adaptive archive, garage listings as summoning—is fresh and memorable. Turns feel earned and specific to this world rather than template twists. The piece risks lyric abstraction without losing legibility. Small on‑the‑nose statements keep it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
