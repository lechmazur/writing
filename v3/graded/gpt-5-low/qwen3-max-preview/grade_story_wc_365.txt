<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elira’s motivation is clear and particular, and her sensory-driven method reveals character through action. The grief and curiosity around her mother and the shard feel embodied rather than labeled. Internal conflict is present but underdramatized—access to the core and revelation come with little on‑page resistance that would expose more contradictions. The final acceptance of responsibility reads earned, if emotionally weighted more than behaviorally tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Single‑POV with one clean transition; the drive lens reads Hybrid with accumulative texture and causal turns. Orientation is excellent and the shard’s resonance links beats to a coherent closure. The revelation (data core) lands on the page with cost and reconfigures prior material. Slight convenience (friction‑free entry to “Archival Containment” and passive automatons) softens the chain of difficulties but not the closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The repair bay is vivid and sensorially specific, evolving from ruin to pristine and back with tactile detail. The shard functions as a charged micro‑setting/tool, constraining movement and anchoring the final image. Environmental logic remains consistent and learned through action. Minor note: the “automatons” are sketched rather than leveraged to pressure choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve the withheld truth) tightens through the universe jump and the core’s reveal. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than tactical; there’s little adversarial pressure or obstacle that forces a trade‑off on the page. Escalation reads as deepening knowledge rather than narrowing options. Still, the final renunciation of old ignorance creates felt consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of liminality, truth as burden, and the ethics of divergence accrue through recurrent objects and sensory motifs. The closing reprices the premise—knowledge creates responsibility—without sermonizing, though one aphoristic line edges close to statement. The mother’s choice reweights earlier images (shard, thresholds) with moral gravity. Resonance lingers and coheres with the story’s texture.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close carries a distinct perceptual signature—sound, vibration, scent—as cognition. Distance remains controlled and stable; no head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates well through the transition and reveal. Absence of dialogue is appropriate for the cathedral‑like solitude.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and sensorially dense with few redundancies; images generally cohere and carry multiple jobs. A handful of heightened metaphors (“syrup made of memory,” “film peeling from reality’s surface”) risk purple but remain legible and pattern‑consistent. Momentum holds; sentences vary and avoid scaffolding loops. Final line lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The sensory map maker and the resonance‑shard bring a fresh inflection to a familiar multiverse frame. The revelation about anchored existence reframes the trope with emotional specificity. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off at closure. Only the low-friction acquisition of the truth keeps it from feeling fully singular.</comment>
