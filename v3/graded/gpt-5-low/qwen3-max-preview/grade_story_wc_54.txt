<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elira’s motive—revelation via redirected flows—is vivid and consistent, and her micro‑choices (mounting the sextant, rerouting steam, installing kinetic tiles) align with it. Interiority is character‑particular, fusing engineering acuity with lyric perception. However, there’s little internal contradiction or genuine struggle; competence often meets minimal resistance. The ending shows an earned stance rather than a costly renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Structure advances coherently: observation → discovery (thermal flicker) → redirection → communal uptake → conceptual reframing. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a clean CR/RR at the end. Costs are modest but present (salvage, labor, partial decay persists), and the before/after is legible. It lacks a sharper pressure crest or cost at the close that would push it into exceptional territory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The spaceport is tactile and purpose‑driven: skylight angles, ducts, sub‑levels, geothermal lines, and cargo annex arches all shape tactics and images. The sextant as micro‑setting/tool charges the final image with fractured light. Details are filtered through an engineer’s bias, avoiding cataloguing. Strong constraint presence, just shy of transformative extremity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can decay be repurposed into function and meaning—tightens once with the geothermal discovery and its redirection. Escalation is primarily density and reconfiguration rather than clash; the pressure is coherent but gentle. Agency is clear and drives the turns, yet opposition is low and trade‑offs are light. The conceptual cost (accepting imperfection) lands more than any tangible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image—redirected flows as a praxis for hope—culminating in a reweighting of “purpose” via warmth, light, and footsteps. The equation H = Σ(ΔI • R) risks on‑the‑nose moralizing but is earned by prior particulars and does reframe the premise. Subtext in community return and repurposed systems deepens resonance. Complexity is embraced without false symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice blends technical precision with lyric poise, maintaining stable close third and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction choices (“load‑bearing ghosts,” “maze of intentions”) feel organic to this mind. Rhythm varies with scene needs; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Compression and patterned phrasing are purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, vivid, and economical; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional lushness serves tone rather than blurring sense; minimal redundancy. Syntax varies and momentum holds through transitions. A hair shy of elite due to a few near‑declarative theme lines that could carry more image than statement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Repurposing a sextant for structural light, treating entropy as architecture, and converting footfalls into power feel fresh and integrated. The synthesis of engineer‑lyric gaze with communal reanimation is memorable. Risk‑taking is controlled and coherent, with a clear final reconfiguration. It doesn’t revolutionize form, but it refines a distinctive stance at a high level.</comment>
