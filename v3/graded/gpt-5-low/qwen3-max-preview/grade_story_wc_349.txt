<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motive (to “unwrite herself”) and embodied ritual actions (arranging, pouring, incising, ledgering) reveal character under gentle pressure. The necessity vs. altruism tension is credible but never forces a hard micro‑choice. Interiority is textured without therapy‑speak. The endurance/renunciation at the end reads earned but quiet.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (each sale as measured absence; burden redistributed). Orientation is crisp in the opening sentence and remains stable. The ledger quantifications pay off the stated method on the page. The final image (open ledger, seven incisions) crystallizes the before/after without tying a bow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and cloud‑sea are vividly rendered through selective, POV‑inflected detail (pearlescent gates, whispering shelves, prismatic gleams). Recurring objects and space (counter, bottles, ceiling) charge the final image. World rules feel consistent and are learned via action (ritual incision refracting moonlight). The environment meaningfully frames and colors each choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes focus on the vendor’s need to redistribute/erase burden; escalation is an accumulative tightening through repeated sales and incisions. Costs are conceptual but legible (quantified regrets, dissolved home). The pressure remains coherent though quiet; no sharp turn, but density increases toward the “seven” tally. Resolution is earned as a stance rather than a decisive change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of absence as foundation emerges organically via method, objects, and ledger arithmetic; no moralizing. “Choose your emptiness” and the ledger’s quantified losses deepen the inquiry without closing it simplistically. The ending reweights beginnings as measured voids, inviting reflection. Minor direct formulations remain within lyrical integrity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consistent, distinctive lyric voice with clean focalization; diction matches the piece’s metaphysical register. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual, advancing stakes. Rhythm modulates well from awe to quiet resolve. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; sentences multitask without scaffold or loops. Metaphor is lush but controlled and coherent to the world’s logic (moonlight refracted by cuts, ledger mist). Variations in sentence rhythm keep momentum. No copy errors or muddled vehicles.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—clean slate vendor, glass orchard library, quantifying absence, bottled moonlight—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction heighten resonance without obscuring clarity. The ledger quantification coup is fresh and thematically integrated. Closure via ritual marks and open ledger avoids cliché.</comment>
