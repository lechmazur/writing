<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The artist’s motive is clean and character‑specific, and her breath‑led micro‑choices (aperture adjustments, packing the obscura, tracking by lungs, matching breath) align with it. Interiority is textured through sensory attention rather than labels. However, simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure are faint, and the cost of her surrender reads more as serenity than a foreclosing loss. The final shift feels earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: breath patterns, image inversions, and the tear’s reprise escalate toward a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on the page with the realization “Unused love was not stored; it was sung,” reweighting prior beats. Causality is coherent within the lyric frame, and orientation is solid from the outset. The cost is subtle (surrender of control) rather than sharply priced, limiting the upper band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The viaduct, bioluminescent flora, and the brass obscura create a tactile, rule‑consistent world filtered through a maker’s attention. The environment constrains and enables tactics (curving ascent, hidden chimes, breath syncing), and charges the final image (“The viaduct bloomed brighter”). Detail density serves pressure rather than pausing it. Specificity and micro‑setting integration are exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: locate the reservoir of unused love. Escalation deepens via pattern intensification—tear discovery, breath‑trail pursuit, pilgrim encounter, unfurling—but the pressure remains gentle with minimal narrowing or traded options. Agency guides each tightening, yet the price paid is more devotional than consequential. The beat structure satisfies but doesn’t bite.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The revelation reframes the central question without moralizing; images (inverted blossoms, tear to filaments) carry the thematic answer. Subtext operates through breath and seeing—healing absences by altering attention—yielding an earned, lingering resonance. Complexity is embraced without false symmetry. Slight neatness in the serenity of the ending keeps it shy of the highest tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with measured cadence and purposeful diction; perception is plausibly bounded by the artist’s sensibilities. Rhythm modulates with breath counts, and figurative texture feels curated, not generic. No POV leakage or unearned omniscience, and compression reads intentional. Minor risk of lushness never obscures intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, action, theme) with clean momentum, and repetition patterns (breath counts, inversions) are functional, not looped scaffold. Figurative language is vivid yet coherent; metaphors are consistent with the world’s logic. A few ornamental flourishes flirt with purple but don’t blur causality or the closure image. Technical execution is polished.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Camera obscura praxis fused with breath‑ritual tracking, Kwan Yin’s tear as repository, and a “pilgrim of sparks” synthesize into a fresh cosmology. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the taught pattern. The piece risks lyric abstraction yet remains grounded in tactile acts, avoiding template pathways. Only the softness of consequence tempers the ceiling.</comment>
