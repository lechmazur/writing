<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motivation is crystalline and embodied through action (playing as unbinding), with tactile micro‑choices (kneeling in moss, calibrating to the bowl) that align with her aim. Interiority is rendered via acoustic perception rather than abstract labeling, which keeps her individuality sharp. The relationship with the child offers a light crucible and a human cost vector, though internal contradiction is minimal. The endurance/renunciation stance at the end reads earned but not overtly costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: sound → ripples → greenhouse response → child’s emergence → charged stillness. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis in the held note, the petal’s float, and the hush transfigured into sacred canvas. Cost is conceptual—choosing incompletion over crescendo—on the page. Orientation is immediate and clean; no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse-shipwreck orchard is vivid and operative: glass hums, beams answer, a hatch exhales, and the setting echoes the music back. The mendicant’s bowl functions as a micro‑setting that directly charges the final image. Details are filtered through Lira’s acoustic bias, avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. World rules (sound animacy) are consistent and learned through interaction.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens: from tentative note to environmental response to the child’s revelation and the consecrated hush. The main tightening is the shift from sound testing to communal resonance, narrowing her performative options to the ethic of unfinishedness. Stakes are intimate but legible; explicit costs are subtle rather than biting. No antagonist needed, but a stronger on‑page trade‑off would elevate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in the unfinished) arises organically from image and action—no crescendo, unresolved chord, petal afloat. The grandmother’s bonfire credo seeds the ethic without sliding into sermonizing at the end. The final tableau reweights the “chronic hush” as sacred, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity feels purposeful, not evasive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close lyric voice is confident, with a distinctive acoustic perceptual signature and controlled cadence. Patterned repetitions (“The water shivers. The greenhouse exhales.”) are taught and purposeful, not crutches. Distance stays stable; no head‑hopping and no register slips. Rhythm modulates well through intensification to the charged stillness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is lush yet mostly precise; figurative choices cohere (sound as breath/ghost, hush as canvas). Information density is high, with minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops and good sentence variety. A few intensifiers stack (ash, ghost, memory) but do not blur sense or pace. The final image is clean and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑burn hush, shipwrecked greenhouse, echo‑harbor violinist, bowl as compass—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and texture pay off without gimmickry; the child’s descent reframes the piece from solipsistic elegy to communal ritual. Transformations arise from established motifs rather than late rule changes. Only the gentleness of on‑page cost keeps it shy of the very top band.</comment>
