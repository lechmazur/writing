<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is rich and embodied; the chronicler’s tactile noticing and micro‑choices (placing and later pocketing the jade cicada, inviting deferral) reveal character. The relationship pressure is credible, with his arrival functioning as a crucible that reconfigures her stance. The cost is quiet—refusing decision—so the change reads as Earned Stasis rather than decisive turn. A touch more contradiction-in-action under pressure would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: “You don’t have to decide tonight.” Orientation is immediate; one continuous scene coheres. The ending’s cost—choosing suspension—lands on the page and reweights prior material (cicada/thresholds). Small risk: the decision’s external stakes remain softly sketched, but the closure still reads felt and concrete for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto is immersive across senses and POV-specific (foam sigh, barnacle tremor, wind in molars) and it charges the final image (tide turning under stars). Environment shapes stance—the sanctified pause is legible because of this place’s rhythms and constraints. The jade cicada as object-with-setting synergy deepens the charge. Detail is purposeful and never museum‑tour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (leave/stay; can love survive migration) are signaled, with a meaningful tightening when the companion arrives and watches in silence. Escalation tracks via density and cadence rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. The price is a chosen deferral, foreclosing premature action; tension sits in the shared pause. Slight softness: no additional complication tests commitment after the offer to defer.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of liminality/thresholds integrates through particulars—the cicada, tidal rhythms, and the “held breath” of their relationship. Subtext in silence and shared stance carries weight; the village argument remains offstage yet shapes every beat. A couple lines verge on thesis (“Time…not measured in ticks or dates”), but they arise from earned perception. The final tide-turn image resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a distinct perceptual signature; diction suits the observer’s sensibility. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual, advancing the beat. Psychic distance is steady; no head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is vivid and precise; images carry multiple jobs without padding. Figurative language is dense but coherent and scene‑driven; no mixed metaphors or loops dull momentum. Sentence rhythm varies and lands the closure cleanly. A few high‑abstract lines could be trimmed to sharpen propulsion, but they do not blunt the ending.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—tidal pools + jade cicada + relational pause as sacred threshold—feels fresh and specific. The accumulative design avoids gimmickry, and the final repricing of time reads non‑obvious yet inevitable. Risks (quiet conflict, lyric density) largely pay off. Not revolutionary, but distinctly voiced and thoughtfully made.</comment>
