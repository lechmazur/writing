<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and character-specific, and her micro-choices (entering the shrine, reading the dream-constellations, placing the globe) align with it. Interiority is vivid without therapy-speak, but internal contradiction is minimal—she moves with serene competence and little friction. The cost is present but quiet: releasing the child’s echoes means relinquishing her own access to them. A touch more struggle or ambiguity under pressure would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the dream cameos accrete until the decisive placement of the globe reconfigures meaning. Closure lands on the page with cost (“The child’s cameo appearances will fade now...”), and the “sigh” of release gives a resonant cadence. Orientation is clean from line one; no lens ambiguity. The mosaic ripples after the act reinforce the before/after without flattening the present scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is tactile, sensorial, and charged; the carved window recess materially shapes the final act. Candlelight against blue-veined ice, breath as incense—details filter through purpose and voice. The setting evolves at closure when “the ice around it ripples, not melting, but remembering,” explicitly charging the final image. Object-as-setting (snow globe) and place entwine to constrain choice and pay off thematically.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are clear: salvage a pure echo and release it without harm; escalation is a deepening from pattern-mapping to an irreversible placement. Pressure remains gentle but coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in a choice that forecloses continued cameos. The felt price is acceptance and letting go rather than confrontation. A sharper on-page resistance or trade-off could have heightened tension without breaking tone.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically—truth as careful weaving, windows vs. doors, release over possession. The final image conceptually reprices the world: stewardship of memory mends rather than wounds, with ripple effects that resist neat moralizing. One line edges toward statement (“truth...need not wound—it can mend”), but the surrounding images carry the weight. Subtext operates via windows, warmth turning to water, and borrowed starlight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent; diction and rhythm match the contemplative stakes. Psychic distance stays steady; no head-hopping or register drift. Patterned phrasing supports the accumulative build without obscuring sense. Compression is purposeful, and inference reads as inference.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density and strong verbs; images pull double duty. Occasional lyric intensifiers risk purple, but coherence remains clear and cadence varied. No loops or scaffold clutter the progression. The final beats are clean and un-muddled by metaphor.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck-diver medium, glacier shrine, dream cameos, and a snow globe as mnemonic technology—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The “window within a window” is an elegant, earned reconfiguration. Risk-taking in form and imagery heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through.</comment>
