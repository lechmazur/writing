<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear and embodied (she wilts near dishonesty yet keeps moving), and choices under pressure reveal values (following the map, reading letters aloud). Interiority is concrete and character‑specific through tools and craft. Internal contradiction is present but mild—more endurance than torn impulse. The closing renunciation/acceptance (“become the archive”) feels earned with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative lens holds: map → atrium echo → chest of letters → voiced witness → identity shift. Closure lands on the page as a Conceptual Repricing: the goal reframes from finding to becoming the archive, with cost demonstrated by prior wilting and solitary labor. Orientation is clean from the outset, and causal links remain coherent. The cost is evident in the endurance through ambient lies and the burden of carrying others’ truths.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky are vivid and functional; environment shapes tactics (vents, atriums, filtration chamber) and directly pressures her body (wilting amid propaganda). The zinc fragment and overgrown infrastructure operate as micro‑settings and tools. Sensory texture is selective and purpose‑driven, filtered through a calligrapher’s eye. The final image (“emerald haze,” oasis as truth) is charged by the setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locating lost conversations) tightens as her physiological cost rises and the search path narrows from atrium to chest. The decisive deepening occurs when she reads the letters aloud, reversing the wilting and transforming the quest into witnessing. The pressure is mostly internal/external ambience rather than antagonist, but it coheres. The earned stance change at the end is clear and paid for.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of witness, candor, and archival care emerge organically from particulars (unsent notes, origami letters) and the act of reading aloud. However, the line “They’d been waiting — not for rescue, but for witness” states the thesis, slightly flattening subtext at the peak. The closing metaphor of the oasis refilling with truth is strong but a touch declarative. Resonance lingers, though it skirts moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature suits the material; diction reflects her craft without register drift. Rhythm modulates well between movement and stillness. Brief dialogue is natural and unobtrusive. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely precise, with high information density and minimal scaffold. Occasional metaphor stacking nears purple but remains coherent and purposeful. Sentence variety sustains momentum and clarity. Final beats land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a calligrapher physically affected by dishonesty tracking lost conversations through a greenhouse city via postal relics. The map in calligraphic ligatures and the reweighting from retrieval to witness are non‑obvious and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece reads as a singular vision, not a stitched template.</comment>
