<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elira’s “fiercely gentle” ethos drives every micro‑choice, from barefoot ritual to refusing force, and Kael’s rigid counter‑stance applies clean pressure. Their status dynamic flips subtly when the orchard restrains him and she anchors him by touch. Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual rather than labels. The closing “seedling” loosening reads as a credible, earned relational shift with cost implied in Kael’s softening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with a clear drive lens (accumulative/situational) and a legible closure beat (Charged Poise/RR) as Kael’s grip loosens and the roots begin to weave them together. Causality holds: Elira’s inlaying practice prompts the orchard’s collaboration. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, keeping it shy of a decisive turn. Orientation is strong from the opening line; no structural debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is richly integrated and functional: roots shackle Kael, resin holds the card, and bones/roots inform action and theme. Sensory specificity is high yet filtered through Elira’s ritual attention. The environment constrains choices and charges the final image. World rules are learned through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around the philosophical and practical clash; it tightens when Kael lunges and the orchard intervenes, pushing toward a stance crystallization. The escalation is primarily textural/deepening rather than high-stakes peril, but it narrows options meaningfully. The price is a renunciation/softening rather than a hard sacrifice. Clear, if quiet, cadence shift at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme (mercy vs. control; carrying the dead without breaking) emerges through ritual acts and the orchard’s collaborative reply. A few lines tilt toward overt thesis (“We don’t fix souls…”) which slightly blunts subtext. The Hanged Man’s re‑reading (“choosing”) provides a resonant conceptual turn. Ambiguity remains human and purposeful, avoiding false equivalence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and a consistent focal distance; diction suits an elegiac, ritualized consciousness. Dialogue is purposeful and differentiated—Kael’s cutting declaratives vs. Elira’s tempered, image‑driven replies. No head‑hopping; stance remains steady. The modulation at stress points keeps the voice taut without fray.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush but largely precise; imagery stacks are coherent and multi‑tasking (resin as “slow tears,” roots as “living manacles”). Minimal scaffolding and no harmful loops, with good propulsion for lyric prose. A slight density risk in metaphor frequency is managed by clear action beats. Final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Catacomb orchard” and bone‑root ecology feel strikingly original, with tarot as praxis rather than ornament. The barter-of-destinies frame is integrated through concrete ritual and a non‑obvious reprice of The Hanged Man. Risks in tone and concept land coherently and heighten stakes without gimmickry. The synthesis reads specific and memorable.</comment>
