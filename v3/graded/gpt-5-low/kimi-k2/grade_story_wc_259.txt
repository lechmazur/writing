<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and propulsive—she seeks forbidden truth and “purification” redefined as clarifying pain. Interiority is embodied (iron/salt air, teeth-vibration, the crushed firefly) and her realization (“not addition but subtraction”) credibly shifts tactics. Contradictory impulses surface in the urge to warn her younger self vs. accepting memory’s limits. The cost is felt in the weeping and destruction of the archive she came to save.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal backbone: arrival → core contact → resonance song → collapse → retrieval of the original prism. Orientation is clean from the first line; the taught pattern of the archive’s traps pays off in the collapse spiral. Closure lands with cost: she lifts the original prism and the pagoda crumbles—an earned decisive change. No causality breaks or soft resets; the beats tighten logically.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely vivid and functional: the archive’s rearranging script and pattern-traps shape movement and risk. The bronze pagoda’s resonance with her song charges the climax; environmental rules stay consistent. Sensory detail (verdigris, iron/salt, dust) is purposeful, filtered through her historian’s bias. The final image is inseparable from place—the outside pagoda crumbles because of her action inside.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth over comforting erasure—is clear early and escalates as the archive folds into “Möbius strips of regret.” The key tightening is her shift from observing memory to acting (singing) to crack the core, trading preservation for clarity. The descent to the foundation and the pagoda’s destruction make the price unmistakable. Internal and external conflicts interlock without redundancy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of nostalgia vs. truth, cultural erasure, and the end of innocence arise through concrete images (atoms crystallizing, then liquefying). The redefinition of “purification” avoids sermonizing and is dramatized via action and cost. Minor explicitness (“to let the raw grief breathe”) edges toward telling but remains anchored in scene. The final reweighting—choosing loss of the monument for honest memory—lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature (professional bias toward memory tech, ritual detail). Rhythm modulates well from hushed awe to pressured cadence during collapse. No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions are purposeful and paid off. Diction is elevated yet consistent with the character’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with high information density; recurring images (saffron, bronze prism, nostalgia atoms) work in concert. A few lush constructions flirt with purple but maintain clarity and propulsion. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors dull the climax; syntax varies with pressure. Final lines land cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fusion of archival architecture, nostalgia as a manipulable substance, and ritual song is fresh and coherent. Risks (lyric density, conceptual apparatus) pay off in a specific, inevitable-feeling ending. The “avoid patterns” tactic and Möbius-collapse add inventive pressure rather than ornament. Emotional truth grounds the fantasy premise.</comment>
