<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Hara’s drive to preserve hand-knowledge is specific and embodied (velvet pouches, trembling hands, “Teach me”). The quiet renunciation of seed-hunting for gesture-teaching lands as a credible change. Internal contradiction (collector vs. weaver) is present but understated; a little more friction under pressure could heighten cost. Actions align cleanly with motive, revealing humility and reverence without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: decoding → glow → weavers → fulgurite → keeper knot → charged mission. Orientation is crisp from line one, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as Hara takes the coil and a new path. Cost is present but subtle (abandoning prior identity), which tempers a push into the 9s. No causality breaks; each image logically deepens the prior pattern.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor fog, golden dock, and tactile rope are vivid and POV-filtered, with weather and tool charging the final image. The rope functions as micro-setting and constraint, literally teaching method and becoming the carried mission-object. Environmental evolution (fog thickens, then aurora) tracks the internal turn. World rules (weaving time, fulgurite’s charge) are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve ancient methods) tightens as the rope becomes a live language, then a charged artifact he must steward. The meaningful turn is the rope’s awakening and Hara’s choice to accept the weavers’ craft and future task. Price is mostly conceptual (identity shift, burden of patience), making escalation persuasive but quiet. A sharper on-page jeopardy or trade-off would push this higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of preservation vs. storage, time as fiber, and human patience accrue through concrete acts (decoding, knotting, keeper). “To preserve is to weave, not store” risks thesis-iness but is earned by the tactile sequence and reweighted by the ending image. The final aura/harbor exhale offers a non-literal answer: culture survives by hands willing to listen. Resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with maritime and artisanal lexicon stays consistent and character-bound. Rhythm varies and tightens around peak beats (“A final knot, the keeper, bites tight.”). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext and plea. No head-hopping or stance drift; the free-indirect coloration fits the mythic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, tactile nouns, and images that carry multiple jobs (fulgurite as lightning memory and bead). Figurative density is high but coherent; mixed-metaphor risks are avoided. Momentum remains through varied syntax and purposeful paragraphing; minimal scaffold. A few elevated phrases skirt purple but don’t blur sense.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Seed collector + knot-language + fulgurite + secret weavers is a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The rope-as-text and time-as-fiber conceit is handled with integrity and without gimmickry. The final mission (teaching by gesture) reimagines preservation in a surprising, specific way. Bold yet coherent risk-taking elevates the piece.</comment>
