<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lina’s drive to “excavate truth from the nation's comfortable lies” is clear and consistent, and her debunker stance clashes credibly with the painful revelations about her father. Her embodied perception (dosimeter, iodine/cinnamon wind) reveals character under pressure. The final renunciation—planting the Apple—feels earned and morally costly. Slight room remains for deeper moment‑to‑moment contradiction during the decision beat.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: orchard → Apple → satchel → reassembly → revelation (Council, graves, father) → choice. The closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when she replants the Apple and forecloses broadcasting, with cost legible on the page. Orientation is swift and solid, and the hybrid lens tilts causal at the end. The paper compass fuse charging the final act is a tight payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful: radioactive dust, dosimeter, and the orchard’s grisly origin constrain choices and infuse every beat with risk. The “stillpoint” quartz outcrop shapes tactics for the reassembly and charges the dawn contraction. Objects-as-setting (Apple, compass) decisively charge the final image. World rules remain coherent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to expose or bury memory; stakes escalate with the satchel confession and the father’s handwriting. The Apple’s faces intensify the ethical calculus, narrowing options to a meaningful trade‑off. The final renunciation exacts a visible conceptual and moral price. A hair more external pressure (e.g., threat of reprisal manifesting on the page) could have sharpened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: memory as seed/stone, state violence metabolized by roots, truth as fruit with bitter harvest. The closing reprices truth as stewardship rather than exposure, resisting a tidy moral. Images (paper compass, living quartz) carry subtext without sermonizing. The piece invites lingering reflection on complicity and witness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is controlled, lyrically precise, and consistent with Lina’s perceptual signature. Elision and compression are taught early and remain legible. No dialogue is needed; the narrative rhythm tightens toward the end effectively. One could argue a touch of register heightening, but it stays coherent to voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and vivid; metaphors are fresh and controlled (“serif reaching for the serif it lost”). Sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold, and rhythm modulates with pressure. No loops or muddled vehicles, and the final image is clean. Density never clogs clarity despite lyric texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The living‑quartz “Diamond Apple” that encodes memory, an orchard fed by denied graves, and the stillpoint concept synthesize into a distinctive, inevitable whole. The father’s handler note turns the premise without gimmickry. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes while staying clear. The final act feels both surprising and retrospectively necessary.</comment>
