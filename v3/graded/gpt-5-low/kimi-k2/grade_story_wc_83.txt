<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and continuous: she pursues the locus of “unused potential” to repurpose grief, and every action aligns. Interiority is particular and embodied (shrapnel, henna, veil), with credible contradictory currents of pain and “bleak exhilaration.” Micro‑choices under pressure—rerunning models, stepping onto the gantry, releasing the geode, then broadcasting—reveal a hierarchy of values at cost. A subtle renunciation occurs when she lets the larger geode half go, foreclosing one path for an earned stasis/agency shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (drone strike survivor in a floating observatory) and the accumulative/textural lens holds with clear causal steps. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she accepts a new identity as perturbation and broadcasts coordinates/frequency, paying with relinquishment and ongoing risk. The cooling breakers provide a clean temporal frame and the click/reboot marks the cadence shift. Minor hand‑wavy science never breaks causality or the closure’s cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The observatory, gantry, airlock, breakers, and instruments are not backdrop; they constrain tactics and time (must act before reset) and charge the final image (mirrors scattering violet light). The geode functions as a tool/object‑as‑setting with evolving states (split, sealed half, orbiting half). Environmental texture (coolant mist, auroras, wind) tracks internal pressure without cliché. The setting’s rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via modeled disturbance amplitude, the lurching observatory, the airlock step, and the release/broadcast choices. The tightening forecloses options (she sacrifices the intact geode half; the window closes as breakers reset). The price is palpable in the vision of the intact wedding that “sliced her open,” and in accepting a future defined by risk and grief‑powered work. Pressure remains coherent and culminates in a stance crystallization rather than a soft reset.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief transmuted into agency and the physics of “unused potential”—emerges through concrete events rather than moralizing. Recurring images (veil, geode, breakers, violet light) reweight meaning at the end; the final “I do” reframes vows as commitment to a new medium of being. One line (“Unused potential had pooled nowhere and everywhere”) edges toward thesis, but it’s earned by prior particulars and followed by action. The resonance lingers without tidy consolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric, disciplined voice is consistent and character‑specific, balancing technical lexicon with visceral perception. Psychic distance modulates cleanly under stress, with elision taught early and paid off at closure. No head‑hopping; whispers and brief responses function as action more than dialogue. Rhythm tightens around peak beats (airlock, release, breaker click) without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is high: sentences carry multiple jobs and propel momentum, with strong verbs and concrete nouns. The figurative density is rich but mostly controlled; a few repeated constructions (“intangibly tangible”) flirt with over‑insistence without blurring sense. No paraphrase loops or scaffold bloat slow the ending; images remain legible. Final images are crisp and load prior motifs effectively.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—quantum grief mapping via perturbation theory in a floating observatory—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Turns grow from the premise rather than twistiness; the geode’s fate and broadcast decision transform familiar trauma tropes into rigorous, specific agency. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The result reads as an authentic, memorable vision rather than a stitched prompt.</comment>
