<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Her motive—crystallizing a fleeting emotion while hiding and confronting truth—drives tactile micro‑choices (pressing ash into cracks, lifting and later removing the mask). Contradictory impulses are live: concealment via the mask versus a need to face grief. Embodied emotion is strong (ash‑stained fingers, porcelain cutting softly, heartbeat compressing dust). The only minor shortfall is a brief abstract turn (“incomplete information cannot birth understanding”) that skews from her otherwise visceral interiority.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through motifs (ash, mask, vanishing point) toward a charged poise. Closure lands when she removes and displays the fused mask, accepting the “mirage of safety” at real emotional cost. Orientation is clear (gallery, rocking chair, curator silhouette), and the single‑scene structure tightens with the chair’s slowing. The price is legible in the relinquishment of the mask’s protection and the swallowed final name.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The gallery functions as more than backdrop: its perspective lines, dimming lights, and spotlight shape movement and the final image. Recurring objects (mask, rocking chair, portrait ash) operate as micro‑settings that constrain and charge choices. The vanishing point and sealed doors inflect meaning at closure. Sensory specificity stays purposeful and filtered through grief.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (safety vs. truth) is signaled early and tightens as the mask fuses, the chair slows, and she chooses to remove the mask. The curator’s silent presence adds pressure without resolving anything. The cost—abandoning the shield of curated concealment—is on the page. Escalation is a textural intensification rather than a reversal, appropriate for the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of concealment, grief, and the “mirage of safety” emerge from action (weaving ash, lying into porcelain) and culminate in a reweighted final image (mask in the spotlight). Subtext thrums through objects and setting rather than statements. A few abstract lines edge toward thesis (“incomplete information cannot birth understanding”), slightly dulling the otherwise earned resonance. The last beat conceptually reprices the entire ritual with felt cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent, sensory‑anchored, and modulates with pressure. POV control is firm; no head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Occasional academic phrasing intrudes on the otherwise embodied diction, but the rhythmic control largely holds. Patterned elision is taught and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is rich and purposeful; images do more than one job and propel mood and meaning. Some metaphor density risks saturation, and one or two conceptual sentences read like scaffolding. Overall clarity and cadence remain high, and the final image is clean and potent. No loops or syntactic monotony materially impede momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Transformative use of ash, porcelain, and gallery geometry yields fresh, coherent symbolism. The rocking‑chair clock and vanishing point as absorber of the final name feel singular. Risks in lyric compression pay off without obscuring closure. A couple of abstractions temper the otherwise striking originality.</comment>
