<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, coherent interiority with a credible push–pull between vigilance and surrender (“a promise she had not yet decided to keep”). Micro‑choices (testing the sheet, stepping through, offering the pointer) track motivation and culminate in an earned reconfiguration. The stranger relationship acts as a catalytic crucible without stealing agency. A few aphoristic lines skim toward neatness but don’t undercut the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern awareness (currents, permeability, laser lattice) densifies to a resonant reconfiguration where walls become lungs. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the closure lands with cost—the grief diffused, the stranger gone, the offering made. Because/therefore linkages are soft but coherent within the lyric frame (test → breach → lattice → inhalation → offering). The price is legible on the page without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The mushroom farm is tactile and instrumental: bioluminescence responds to lasers, permeable sheets alter movement and meaning, spores and scent charge the climax. Environmental rules are taught through action (missing reflection, breathing plastic) and culminate in the final image of the red dot dissolving into the farm’s light. Multi‑sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered. No static cataloging; space and tools constrain choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—what to do when a boundary lets go first—and tightens through the lattice sequence and the farm’s “inhale.” The protagonist’s acts (testing, entering, drawing, offering) drive the deepening, and the cost (diffused grief, loss of the companion) is paid on the page. Stakes are internal-external braided, consistent with the accumulative lens. Not a combative conflict, but escalation is undeniable.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of permeability/letting go is embodied in concrete images (walls into lungs, beams rooting), and the ending reweights earlier material without a didactic moral. Subtext runs through gesture and image (the offering, the heartbeat echo), inviting afterthought. Slight overstatement in two lines (“Letting go is not subtraction…”) edges toward thesis‑speak, modestly blunting subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature; sensory choices reflect a spatially attuned mind. Dialogue is spare, carries subtext, and advances pressure without exposition dumps. Psychic distance is steady, and patterned diction is taught early and sustained. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; rhythm modulates effectively between hush and flare. Figurative language is lush but coherent to the premise; metaphors align (breathing membranes, diffusion) and avoid mixed vehicles. Minimal scaffold or loops; sentences propel rather than stall. A couple of aphoristic lines brush purple but remain within control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: intrusion detection recast through a bioluminescent farm and a permeability ethic, with lasers as relational tools. The internal science of “letting go” becomes literal physics without feeling gimmicky. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in retrospect from seeded images. Bold, specific, and memorable.</comment>
