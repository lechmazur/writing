<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lila’s motive is precise and pressurized: secure a stamped death to buy her father’s life, while wrestling with guilt. Interiority is embodied (the ink pot’s weight, counting Mississippis, the apology to Alvarez) and choice-driven. Contradictory impulses—devotion to her father vs. moral calculus—are active in-scene. The final renunciation (accepting complicity and disappearance) reads earned with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: director exits → Lila sets the con → director returns → she exploits the “breach” → the stamp lands. Closure lands on the page with cost in the stamp marrying “real and unreal” and her decision to vanish. Orientation is clean from the first line, and the persistent constraint (needing the director’s official seal) shapes tactics through the end. The dawn “pale ink” reweights the premise without soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The prep room and its implements (porcelain table, stamp, cabinet) are vivid and functional, constraining options and enabling the con. The ink pot functions as micro-setting: a tool that charges choices and the final image. Sensory selection (formaldehyde/lilies, iron/violet scent) tracks with urgency. The environment’s pressure culminates in the stamp’s impression and the exit into dawn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit and sustained: get the certificate stamped to end the hunt for her father. Pressure coheres and tightens at the director’s suspicious return and the “breach” pivot, forcing adaptation and risk. The price—moral complicity and self-erasure—is legible at closure. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her agency and timing drive the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Ink as guilt/border is thematically integrated and evolves toward a conceptual repricing (“fairness…a process”). The final image of dawn as ink reweights prior images with cost and ambiguity. One line edges toward explicit thesis, but most resonance arises from particulars and action. The dissident’s body as “prop” deepens ethical ambiguity without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (formal scents, ledger math, border metaphors). Free indirect texture suits a hyper-attentive, complicit teen without head-hopping; dialogue is sparse but purposeful. Elevated diction is largely character-coherent, though occasionally near-poetic for a 17-year-old. Rhythm modulates well around the breach and stamp.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery; few to no scaffolding loops. Metaphoric patterning (ink, borders, math) is consistent and clear, not muddled. Slight risk of saturation in stacked figuratives, but cadence and clarity hold, especially at the closure beat. Syntax varies and propulsion matches pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Forging a bureaucratic death in a prep room via a generational tool is an original synthesis. The ink pot’s ethical and tactical roles feel inevitable in hindsight. The asylum angle and “liquefying certainty” tactic freshen the con narrative without gimmickry. The closing repricing (process over number) is earned and specific.</comment>
