<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear motive and embodied action under pressure; the fear flicker as she steers toward danger humanizes her. Interiority remains mostly via image and action, with limited contradictory impulses beyond courage vs. fear. Backstory (parents, typhoon in B minor) effectively charges her credo without stalling the scene. The final earned stance (tune the obstacle) reads credible, though the personal cost remains subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on the page: reef reconfigured into a marimba and the orchard passes—a decisive reweighting of the hazard. Because/therefore links are lyrical but coherent (cloud reading → carving → resonance → reef pivots → final chord). Cost is implied risk and commitment to approach the hazard; clean single-scene arc with one tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and essential: a rotating raft-orchard with lashings at stake, lime mist, salt wind, and glass-reef physics learned through action. Environment and tools constrain choices (drift, lashings, branches, deck grooves), and the final image is charged by place (glass marimba over waves, limes as hammers). Sensory orchestration is rich yet purposeful. World rules stay consistent within the lyrical frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: preserve the orchard against the rising glass reef. Escalation coheres through density and tempo (warning → grooves → harmonics → whale cadence → shards surface → final chord). Cost is present but modest—she chooses to draw toward danger and commits energy and risk without a concrete loss. The reversal (obstacle becomes instrument) is earned and character-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of transmuting threat into harmony and art as survival emerge organically through events and recurring motifs (grooves, resonance, limes as bells). The final cadence reweights the premise with a forward-looking charge (“guide tomorrow’s listener”). Slight over-articulation in the penultimate generalization (“every horizon was a staff line”) trims subtlety. Subtext largely rides image and action rather than thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A confident, musical lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm feel of a tide prophet who reads the sky. Distance is stable; no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. The voice modulates with pressure (faster sketching, denser harmonics) and relaxes at the end. Slight risk of purple is managed by consistent image-system discipline.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with varied syntax; images do multiple jobs (action, world, theme). Figurative language is frequent but coherent within a single musical/oceanic palette. Minor lushness risks saturation, yet clarity of action and closure remain intact. No loops or scaffolding drag the momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a floating lime orchard, cloud-sight music, and reef reconfiguration into a marimba feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in world logic and lyric compression pay off cleanly. The final turn is both surprising and prepared by recurring craft (grooves, resonance, fruit as percussion). Emotional truth (risked approach, inheritance of credo) underpins the spectacle.</comment>
