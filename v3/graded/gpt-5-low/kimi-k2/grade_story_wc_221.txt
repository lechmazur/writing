<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (compassionate navigator) meets a live contradiction at the threshold: the urge to cross vs. the choice to translate and tether via sketches. Interiority is specific and embodied (frost, chime, trembling brass) rather than abstract. The renunciation of crossing is credible and value-driven, foreclosing a path. Slight softness: the rescue feels relatively frictionless once the tactic is found, reducing felt self-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain holds: return to deck → anomalous sky → compass alignment → glimpse of Lys → choice not to cross → sketching-as-bridge → field contracts. Orientation is swift and firm (03:17, emergency seal, observation deck), and the single-scene window is respected. Closure lands on-page with cost (refusal to cross; risk confronted), delivering a decisive change and reconfiguring identity. The compass’s function is taught through action rather than late rule-drops.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The deck, frost, frozen chronometers, and relativistic gradients aren’t mere backdrop—they pressure tactics and delineate a threshold that constrains choice. The compass functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Details feel filtered through a navigator’s priorities, with consistent world rules learned via use. Atmosphere supports theme without museum-tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (save those caught vs. risk joining them), and pressure tightens with the sighting of Lys and the threshold decision. Agency drives escalation: aligning the compass, choosing to sketch rather than cross, pressing the rose to the chronometer. Cost is present but somewhat mitigated by the success of the chosen tactic. Still, the renunciation forecloses a path with stakes felt at the decision point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: mourning refigured as exploration; “true north” recast as will; tradition leveraged to heal a rupture. Recurring images (frozen time, compass, sketches) reweight meaning at the end. A near-thematic statement (“turn confusion into exploration”) edges toward explicitness, slightly dimming subtext. The final cadence achieves resonant repricing without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>First-person voice is controlled, sensuous, and consistent with a navigator’s sensibility; the perceptual signature is distinct. Rhythm modulates with pressure (quiet hush to hum of engines), and elision patterns are legible. No head-hopping or stance leakage. Elevated diction feels earned by the mode and moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with almost no scaffold or loops; images carry multiple jobs (compass as tool, symbol, and plot engine). Figurative language is vivid but coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors under strain. Syntax varies to pace beats; the final image recharges prior lines crisply. No line-level artifacts cloud closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: family sky-sketching becomes a temporal engineering method; “true north” as vector of will steers both tactic and meaning. The compass rose as time vessel is a fresh escalation that reads inevitable in hindsight. Genre conventions are honored and transformed without gimmickry. Risk-taking in concept and image heightens stakes while staying clear.</comment>
