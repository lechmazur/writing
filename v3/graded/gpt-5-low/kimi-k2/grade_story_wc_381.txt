<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear from the outset (hush the prophecy before dawn), and her hesitation at “would she choose to silence the world to save it?” provides credible internal conflict. Interiority is embodied through tactile, specific images (pressing the wing to her lips; mapping silence). The final renunciation—transforming from caging silence to listening—reads earned. Slight distance from concrete human stakes keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure gathers via the river code, canopy, spiral, and the prophecy’s voiced threat. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she reframes the prophecy and adopts listening as tactic, transforming the code into peace downstream. The cost is conceptual—rejecting total silencing in favor of risked attentiveness—visible in her pause and recalibration. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The brook and nocturnal haven are not ornamental; the ripples encode fate and the lattice physically cups the murmurs, constraining choices. The origami wing functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image (bridge, lantern). Sensory specificity sustains mood without excess cataloging. World rules remain consistent through observed action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates as the prophecy resists (sharper glyphs, voiced floods). A meaningful tightening occurs when she hesitates and alters method from cage to ear. The on‑page cost is more ethical than visceral, so the pressure feels refined rather than acute. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of silence as presence, not absence, emerges through concrete acts (mapping, cupping, spiral) and culminates in a non‑didactic final image. The explicit line “the prophecy was not a warning but a question” flirts with statement but is supported by prior beats and reweighted in the ending. The piece invites reflection without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is calm yet charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close sustains a distinct perceptual signature (“mapping silence,” “terrestrially cosmic”). Rhythm modulates well between pressure and release, with no head‑hopping or stance drift. Elision is purposeful and legible. No dialogue to judge, but the voice carries subtext through image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; sentences often do double duty (world‑building and action). Figurative language is lush but coherent; repetition earns its keep via patterning rather than loops. A few phrases edge toward purple, but clarity is maintained through the climax and closing image. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>“Mapping silence,” the origami wing as tool/bridge, and the brook’s coded prophecy feel fresh and integrated. The turn from silencing to listening reconfigures the premise in a non‑obvious, inevitable way. Risks in diction and conceit heighten rather than obscure coherence. The vision reads singular, not templated.</comment>
