<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and intensifies: she alone holds the whales’ songs and must reprice isolation into independence. Interiority is embodied and specific (“knees buckled,” “brittle,” the taste of copper/rain) with a credible micro‑turn at “alone” → “all one.” The two-futures reflection concretizes contradictory impulses and culminates in a choice with cost. Slightly aphoristic phrasing (“isolation was not a prison but a seed”) trims a hair of grit from the emotional texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the stone circle ritual tightens pressure toward a Charged Poise/Decisive Change: Mira chooses descent over archival stasis. Closure lands on the page with cost—the foreclosed path of remaining in the library—and the final image (feather‑descent, cloak adjusting pitch) reweights the premise. Orientation is swift and clean from the first line; motifs set early pay off precisely. No causality breaks; every transformation grows from established rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: the tidal library, stone circle, and cloud deck are not postcard backdrops but functional constraints that produce options (projection, transformation, glide‑descent). The sundial/whale/mirror‑scales act as micro‑setting tools that literally sketch her path. Sensory detail is purposeful across senses (taste, sound, touch) and remains POV‑filtered. The environment decisively charges the final image and tactic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (translate isolation into independence by taking the songs below) is signaled early and deepens through the ritual and the “two futures” hinge. The meaningful tightening forecloses a live option (becoming a memory in the library) and reframes cost. Pressure is internal but coherent, with the circle’s hum and script functioning as catalyzing force. Slight absence of external counterpressure keeps it shy of maximal intensity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—translation, memory, loneliness measured and re‑spelled—culminating in a resonant answer: isolation reconfigured into shared motion. Recurrences (sundial → whale → cloak; “alone” → “all one”) accrue subtext without over-explaining. One line edges toward thesis‑saying (“isolation was not a prison but a seed”), but it still springs from on‑page experience. The final image carries lingering ambiguity and consequence without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The voice is singular, lyrical, and disciplined, with a stable close POV; diction and rhythm suit the world’s strangeness without drift. Compression and image‑logic are taught early and remain legible through closure. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. Occasional aphoristic tilt does not erode control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lines are dense yet clean; imagery layers with high information per sentence and minimal scaffold. Repetition is purposeful and reweighting, not looped. Figurative language coheres to maritime/astral motifs, avoiding mixed vehicles. A few heightened statements flirt with abstraction but do not blur action or stakes.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Concepts like a stone circle measuring loneliness, an atomically reflective sundial birthing a brass whale, and a cloak of mirror‑scales that hums are startling and organic. The turn from “alone” to “all one” feels inevitable in hindsight given the established translation mission. Risks in worldbuilding and diction heighten stakes without gimmickry. Emotional truth anchors the novelty.</comment>
