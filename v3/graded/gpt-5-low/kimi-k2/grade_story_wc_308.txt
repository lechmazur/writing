<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (“to learn to navigate without moving”) and embodied ritual with the arrowhead ground her. Interiority is particular and image-led rather than labeled, with the key renunciation—becoming a tower—reading as an earned cost. However, contradictory impulses are muted; she rarely wavers or resists, so complexity is more thematic than psychological. The arc is credible but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first line to closure, and the ending lands with explicit cost when she becomes a tower and the arrowhead roots. Orientation is immediate (who/where/what) and the pattern deepens coherently. Closure is a Decisive Change with Earned Stasis undertones; the price is the relinquishment of motion/self. No causality breaks or soft resets; motifs pay off exactly where promised.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon and bone towers are integral: they sing, echo, teach, and finally absorb her, directly charging the last image. The arrowhead functions as micro‑setting/tool, transmitting the towers’ song into her body. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across sight, sound, touch, and taste (“tasting the … dust”). World rules stay consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure escalates through pattern density: reading birds → reading herself → final renunciation. The dominant stake (mastering stillness) tightens into a single irreversible choice with visible cost: self‑translation into a tower. Agency is internal but decisive and legible; the flock freezing provides a clear turning point. Stakes are felt though largely conceptual rather than peril‑driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of stillness as accumulation, memory as navigation, and translation over death are organically earned through images and acts. Recurring motifs (pulse, dust, birds, arrowhead) shift meaning at the end, offering a resonant non‑literal answer. A few lines verge on aphoristic statement (“The map was not drawn…”), but they remain grounded in scene. The aftereffect is contemplative without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are consistent with the mythic mode. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible through closure. No head‑hopping or register slips. Refrains recur intentionally rather than mechanically.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful repetition; most sentences do multiple jobs. A few near‑loops (“centuries of layered dust,” “pulse left wandering”) skirt redundancy but function as motif rather than padding. Figurative language stays coherent and controlled; no mixed metaphors muddy peak beats. Overall propulsion and clarity hold through the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise and images feel singular: towers of bone as former birds, stillness as navigation, an arrowhead translating avian equations. The final reconfiguration is both inevitable and surprising in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten cohesion without obscuring clarity. The synthesis reads authentically visionary rather than decorative.</comment>
