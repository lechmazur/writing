<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Her motive—honoring maintenance as rebellion—is specific and consistent, embodied in tactile choices (climbing the parapet, whistling, using the whisk, handing it over). Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic (nets, knots, froth), and the guard moment reveals character under pressure with status softening. The visible cost is modest (relinquishing the heirloom whisk) but real. Internal contradiction is gentle rather than sharp, keeping the arc more devotional than conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is clear, and causal links are coherent (whistle → guard → handoff → echo to the boy). There is an implied closure in the transmission of craft, but the final sentence cuts off mid‑line, undermining on‑page closure and the cost beat’s resonance. The price (giving away the whisk) is present but lightly felt. The structure holds as a single continuous scene with a late echo, yet the incomplete ending damages cadence and final reweighting.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parapet after rain, lantern‑stitched harbor, puddled stones, and firefly currents are vividly filtered through the protagonist’s net‑tuned perception. The bamboo whisk functions as a charged micro‑setting, shading tactics (balancing, tilting, conducting) and the final handoff. Weather and season shape action (fireflies rise, reflections map paths). The environment doesn’t rigidly constrain options but deeply charges the images that matter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pressure is mostly interior and ceremonial; the lone hard turn is the guard’s arrival with a lowered spear, which quickly resolves into witnessing. The tightening is a deepening of the pattern motif rather than a narrowing of options, and costs remain primarily symbolic. The handoff of the whisk is the clearest agency with price, but the stakes never truly bite. The accumulative build is graceful but soft in consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme of care-as-rebellion and maintenance as a shared, transgenerational praxis emerges through action and recurring images (knots, moon paths, fireflies spelling “mend”). A few lines verge on thesis statements (“every act of maintenance…quiet rebellion”) but are mostly earned by particulars. The boy’s echo cements the communal transmission without sermonizing, though the truncated last line blunts the reweighting. Subtext in the guard’s memory and the tool’s “ghost” deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature holds steady; diction and imagery feel right for a “net‑mender philosopher.” Rhythm modulates well around micro‑turns (guard’s entrance, whisk transfer), and the lone spoken line carries subtext. No head‑hopping or stance wobble. The lyric density remains legible and voice‑true throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is often beautiful, with images doing multiple jobs and minimal scaffolding. There is a touch of purple repetition (“scintillatingly somber”), but it rarely muddies sense. The unfinished final sentence is a significant line‑level fracture that dulls the closure image. Overall momentum holds despite the lyrical density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—net-mending philosophy, a bamboo whisk as conductor, fireflies mapping moon‑currents into the word “mend”—feels fresh and organically integrated. The transfer of a humble tool as a rite of power shifts the familiar “castle parapet” into an ethic of care. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and most pay off. The incomplete ending is the only major drag on an otherwise distinctive vision.</comment>
