<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to measure the mass of her brother’s swallowed truth—drives every micro‑choice, from hesitating at the wheel to turning it despite skepticism. The contradiction (religiously skeptical yet carrying Saint Jude) is active, not decorative, and wavers at the 21‑gram reveal. Embodied perception (“cold brass,” “coal‑blackened gravel”) grounds emotion. The closing acceptance costs her a burden she briefly carries, though the epiphany’s neatness trims a hair of messier ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the scanner, callers, and wheel build a pattern that reweights meaning, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate, and cause→effect remains legible: audio overlays prompt bead glow → numbers → Jonah’s voice → the soul‑weight turn. The ledger reveal and Mara’s release provide on‑page cost. The radio‑psychic mechanism is slightly contrived, but taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The tunnel and alcove are tactile and purpose‑driven; the beaded valve wheel functions as micro‑setting that constrains choices and charges the final image. Multi‑sensory detail (oil scent, vibration through rails, damp walls) is specific and filtered through Mara’s priorities. The environment evolves with action (sigh of air, loom pulse, dawn on rails) and anchors the closure. Consistent internal rules keep the uncanny credible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are concentrated: will Mara risk touching, turning, and shouldering the truth’s weight. Escalation is clean—first notch to 137g (tongue), then the emergent Jonah clip and the wheel’s self‑spin to 21g—tightening pressure and narrowing her stance. The cost is felt when she holds and releases the burden. Conflict is primarily internal but interwoven with concrete external prompts; no wasted beats.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of guilt, labor’s residue, confession, and measurement crystallize without sermonizing; the wheel becomes a ledger rather than a haunt. The 137g/21g conversion reframes “swallowed truth” as material and moral weight. The final lines risk slight telling (“she finally understood”) yet carry a resonant image (turning the wheel; dawn on rails) that reweights the premise. Subtext hums through objects rather than declarations.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct—industrial‑lyric with controlled cadence—and remains coherent under pressure. POV distance and knowledge stay consistent; inference reads as inference. The modulation from “drowsy alertness” to sharpened attention and back is rhythmic, not showy. No head‑hopping or register slips; the Jonah clip is integrated cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density without scaffolding or loops; imagery is vivid yet purposeful (“smell of wet cotton and regret” earns its keep). Rhythm varies with pressure; transitions are seamless. A few metaphorically rich lines flirt with purple but remain coherent and scene‑driven. The final cadence lands cleanly without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—industrial ledger of guilt measured via talk‑radio psychic frequencies, with precise corporeal weights—is fresh and feels inevitable in hindsight. The beaded valve wheel, factory “ghost shift,” and numbers (tongue/soul) interlock elegantly. Risk‑taking in method and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids template comfort and claims a singular stance.</comment>
