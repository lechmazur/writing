<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—assembling absences into a navigational meaning—is clear and consistently enacted through tactile micro‑choices (pressing the valve to labels, stone, lens). Interiority stays particular and embodied, avoiding labels while revealing a disciplined, ritual logic. The refusal to cheer at the sight of returning sails reads as an earned renunciation that costs her ease in favor of vocation. Internal contradiction (yearning for return vs. archivist’s restraint) is present and resolved via endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: iterative acts with the valve build to the pendulum image that reweights sound/silence and absence/presence. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing when moonlight through the hung valve turns her path into notation. Cost is quiet but legible—loneliness, refusal of celebration, conservation amid scarcity—and informs the final stance. Slight softness remains in the truncated final sentence, but the closure image carries.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor, lighthouse, seawall, and weather are not postcard backdrops; they dictate tactics and yield resources (ink‑bled labels, cracked lens, barnacles’ “doors”) that shape each beat. The trumpet valve functions as an object‑as‑setting, culminating in a beam that literally configures the space and her history into a staff. Sensory texture is selective and POV‑true, with maritime detail working as apparatus rather than decoration. The environment decisively charges the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure accrues through patterned rituals (seventh planks, climbs, placements) that deepen the stake from cataloging to summoning return; the silence blown and the pendulum hanging are clear tightenings. Stakes remain primarily internal and conceptual, but they do narrow options toward an earned stance. The felt price is restraint and endurance under abandonment rather than a dramatic external consequence. Escalation is measured yet purposeful under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—making meaning from absence; silence as a farther‑carried signal than sound—emerges through recurring, reweighted images, not statements. The backward‑read lexicon, the glass eye, and the moonlit staff synthesize without didacticism. “Sound returns to the vessel that shaped it” risks thesis‑like phrasing but is grounded by subsequent action and reinterpreted by the pendulum beam. The ending offers a resonant answer: curation as beacon, with an ethic of restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyrical voice filters the world through an archivist’s sensibility; diction, cadence, and image logic stay consistent. POV stays close and confident without omniscience; elisions are purposeful and pattern‑taught. Rhythm modulates well from accumulative detail to crystalline closure. Minor repetition (“reactively visionary”) reads as motif rather than tic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; metaphors (ink, staff, pendulum) are coherent and pay off at the end. Lines move with momentum; very little scaffold or synonym churn. Lushness stops short of purple; figurative logic holds even at peak beats. The clipped final sentence is a stylistic flourish that doesn’t muddle the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The premise—archiving absence as navigational practice—feels fresh, with the trumpet valve’s evolving uses and silence as signal offering memorable turns. Risks in structure and diction pay off in a coherent, specific vision. The reconfiguration at the end feels earned and non‑obvious. Minor conventional beats (lighthouse ascent) are transformed by idiosyncratic use.</comment>
