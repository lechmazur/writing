<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motive (“prove that whispers travel farther than shouts”) drives each choice, from ignoring radios to selecting the oldest map. Interiority is embodied through tactile anchors (harness, coin heat), though internal contradiction is minimal—Mara is largely assured rather than torn. Micro‑choices (map selection, gait adjustments) reveal values without therapy‑speak. The closing endurance (measuring in softness) feels earned but exact cost is subtle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned cues (storm interference, coin pulses, map key, whisper) tighten toward the mic test and citywide echo. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, when) and causality holds: old map → key sigil → hidden door → pace challenge → mic. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—distance is redefined—but the on‑page cost is gentle, more wonder than loss, which limits the ceiling. No teleports or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the storm disables radios and feeds static into the mic; the container labyrinth and catwalks shape movement and risk; the coin/key function as micro‑settings that constrain choices. Sensory detail is selective and charged (violet ribbons, diesel, corrugation vibrations) without museum‑tour bloat. World rules are learned through action (coin heat, prints lighting) and stay consistent. The final image is charged by place (port hum answering “remember”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates: private mission → secret door → pace‑matching trial → whisper broadcast. The meaningful tightening is the rule to “match my stride,” which narrows tactics and leads to the mic’s dare. Resolution is earned by Mara’s softness, but the price paid is more conceptual than visceral; no option foreclosed beyond the coin cooling. Tension runs steadily, if quietly, rather than spiking with a hard reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of communication, memory, and mapping carry through particulars (maps vs living maze; whispers vs shouts; coin decoding walks). “Remember” reweights the whole port, turning infrastructure into a communal memory device without moralizing. Objects recur with shifted meaning (coin goes cold; maps as origins rather than updates). Resonance is strong and avoids platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual filter (maintenance worker noticing altitude, grooves, catwalk stitching). Diction is consistent and voice‑true; no head‑hopping, and the whispered lines function as action rather than exposition. Rhythm modulates well, with longer cadences easing into tight beats at the mic. Purposeful elision (maze “larger than physics allowed”) is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images do double duty (geomagnetic storm as plot device and mood), and sentences carry momentum without scaffolding bloat. Occasional lushness (“cotton candy” static) stays coherent and legible; no mixed metaphors that muddy cause/effect. Variations in syntax keep the ear engaged, and the final line lands cleanly. Minor density of figurative language is balanced by clarity in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a zodiac gait‑reading coin, an obsolete map with a constellation key, a whisper‑amplifying maze during a geomagnetic storm—each fused organically to character and stakes. The mic’s “speak softly, and I will shout for you” delivers a fresh, earned turn. Risks in premise and lyric texture heighten coherence rather than distract. The final repricing of distance via softness feels both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
