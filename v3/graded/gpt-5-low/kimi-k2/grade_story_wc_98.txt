<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—protecting cultural memory even at the cost of doubting what she loves—drives concrete choices (planting the seed, summoning witnesses, biting the fruit). Interiority is specific to her empirically whimsical gift (tasting tales), not generic sentiment. Contradictory impulses (skepticism vs. belonging) are dramatized at the end as a lingering, costly stance. Minor limitation: the cost to her skepticism is felt but not deeply dramatized beyond the final note.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: petals forgetting → seed planted → dream library browning → witnesses summoned → monsoon entering the dream → bite and wake. Closure lands with a decisive change (memories anchored; sapling alive) and a priced stance (luminous doubt persists). Orientation is clean from the first lines; no causality breaks. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it reads on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ridge in bloom and approaching monsoon are vivid and integral; the environment constrains choices (race the rain, plant at the ridge’s heart). Details are POV-filtered (“moss that hummed like a sleeping lute;” petals as syllables) and evolve with action. The setting charges the final image as rain arrives and the ridge “straightens.” A hair shy of 9+ because it shapes stakes more than complicating tactics moment-to-moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (anchor memory before monsoon) and tightens when the dream pages brown and the monsoon invades the dream. Mira adapts tactically by summoning witnesses and then paying the price of biting the fruit. The escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven. The danger remains largely symbolic rather than viscerally jeopardizing Mira, keeping the price high-concept.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: collective memory requires communal witnessing; truth and belonging coexist with doubt. The library-to-fruit-to-bite sequence earns the insight rather than stating it. The final image reweights the premise by preserving doubt within protection. Slight drag from the on-the-nose phrase “even protected memories must be...” and the truncated final word undercuts the last chord.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with a stable close third POV; imagery is consistent with Mira’s sensibility. Rhythm varies well, and patterning (petals/syllables; rain/lullabies) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or stance drift. Minor overrichness is restrained and readable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful metaphor; momentum generally holds. A single noticeable textual flaw—the final word cut off (“oss”)—nicks the landing. Figurative saturation is high but coherent; few, if any, paraphrase loops. The final typo prevents a higher band at this standard.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “reality checker” tasting truth, petals as syllables, and a communal dream-witnessing mechanism feel fresh and integrated. The dragon-spine dream and library-leaf fruit synthesis is inventive yet earned. Risks in tone and imagery pay off without gimmickry. Slight familiarity in the monsoon-as-clock image keeps it just below the exceptional tier.</comment>
