<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (“to trick fear into revealing its weakness”) drives concrete choices: unbosoming fears, seizing the black mirror exit. Interiority is embodied and particular (teeth falling upward; applause turning to laughter). The advisor applies immediate pressure that exposes contradiction (attraction/repulsion, courage/terror). Final endurance carries cost (repulsive allure clinging), earning the shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a causal spine: confession triggers the recursion; dictionary cues the “exit wound”; black mirror choice resolves. On‑page closure lands with cost: the advisor is trapped, reflections crack, and the narrator bears residue. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene coherence holds. Minor rule surrealities (clasp swallowing a book) are taught by pattern and pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The funhouse is tactile and determinative: mirrors as mouths, a single black one as the exit, and the concession counter hosting the dictionary. Objects-as-setting constrain tactics (choosing the black mirror; the clasp’s jaws). Sensory palette is vivid without museum‑tour excess. The final image is charged by setting consequences (mirrors cracked along every reflection).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the recursion by outwitting fear—tightens through the paradox/dictionary gambit to the forced selection of the black mirror. The unbosoming escalates pressure, spawning hostile reflections. Agency drives the peak turn; the price is carried forward (advisor imprisoned; narrator marked). No luck‑solve; the pattern forces a meaningful trade.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Resonant motifs (frame, mirror, witness, recursion) culminate in a conceptual reprice of fear. However, explicit aphorisms (“Fear’s weakness is the witness who refuses the frame”; “the story that refuses to end where it began”) edge toward stated thesis. Subtext otherwise works through image (Polaroid, black mirror inhalation). The ending lingers with conceptual cost despite slight moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric-horror voice with coherent POV distance and crisp dialogue rhythms. Diction and imagery remain consistent under stress, modulating intensity credibly. The advisor’s speech contrasts with the narrator’s interior texture without leakage. Purposeful compression reads taught by pattern and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density; images generally do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Occasional purple shimmer is disciplined by pattern; scaffolding is minimal. A minor copy blemish (final “pul” truncation) and a few lush clusters slightly nick polish. Clarity holds in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: cursed Polaroid, paradox‑dictionary method, and a wolf‑clasp that devours text shaping fate. The recursion/“frame” conceit feels inevitable in hindsight once the black mirror appears. Risks in imagery and logic cohere without gimmickry. The closing reconfiguration is fresh and memorable.</comment>
