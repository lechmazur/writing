<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—obedience versus mischief-turned-revolt—is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (scratching the sigil, aligning the sundial, socketing the quill holder). Interiority is embodied through tactile focus rather than labels. The internal contradiction is credible but lightly tested; the on-page cost is mostly risk rather than loss. The endurance at the end (remaining sentinel) feels earned as a chosen poise, if not a sacrifice fully paid.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: blackout → sigil → seam → sundial angles → forge → birds → return to post → pamphlet. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she remains sentinel while having catalyzed revolt, with risk visible (guards pass, Regent demands). Orientation is crisp from the first lines. Minor softness: the final “For she” fragment distracts but doesn’t break the closure already earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: fort, sundial, and forge constrain choices and enable tactics. The bronze quill holder functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Sensory selection is disciplined (metal heat, parchment, wings) and filtered through a sentinel’s priorities. World rules hold through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ignite revolt without exposure—tightens through the descent/programming and the patrol’s pass. The meaningful deepening is the return to post under heightened risk, not a neat reversal. Costs are implied (treason, danger) more than concretely paid. Still, pressure coheres and grows under a causal lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Light/ideas versus hoarded illumination resonates through recurring images (spiral sigil, sundial angles, “NOW” sparks). The final line’s repricing (“The lock is awake; the gate is listening”) reweights the sentinel role thematically. Minimal platitude; insight arises from enacted particulars. Slight on‑nose phrase (“to spark a silent revolution”) trims the edge but doesn’t sour the resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyric third-person close sticks to Lira’s perceptual signature and maintains distance consistently. Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction is cohesive and character‑plausible within the fable‑like register. No head‑hopping or unmotivated elision. Only blemish is the final clipped fragment, a copy edit rather than voice drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet generally economical; most lines carry multiple jobs (world, action, mood). Occasional intensifiers flirt with purple but remain legible. The terminal fragment (“For she”) and a few stacked metaphors in high‑pressure beats nick momentum and polish. Read‑aloud rhythm is varied, with minimal scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—sentinel as saboteur, quill as key/stylus, sundial angles as code, birds etching flight paths—feels fresh and internally necessary. Turns grow from established rules and objects without late rule changes. Risk‑taking is confident but not opaque. Emotional truth (quiet complicity recast as charged agency) undergirds the novelty.</comment>
