<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Marisol’s motive—uplifting the “silent contributors”—is concrete and embodied through tactile choices (weighing envelopes like spice, pinning the locket). Her interiority reads specific (locket warming, sea-spray tears), and Theo/Marta register as distinct with function under pressure. Contradictory impulses are mild; the piece leans idealized over conflicted, so the change skews gentle rather than hard-won. Still, the final vulnerability and renewed commitment feel earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative cadence and causal links (misaddressed letter → search → pact → growing cycle → locket’s return). Orientation is clean from the opening; the montage of “nights” and “months” stays legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: compassion’s loop returns the lost locket with an emotional price. The clipped final sentence slightly blurs the cadence at the last beat, softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The harbor/library world is vividly selective: arched windows, clerestory breeze, cocoa scent, anchors stamped on envelopes. Setting supplies resources and pressures (library as HQ, storm moving the symphony beneath the windows), and objects (locket, edelweiss) charge the ending. Details filter through vocation and memory without a tourist catalog. It’s atmospheric and functional, not just postcard.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on acknowledgment and communal uplift, tightening through the pact and public gathering under the library windows. Escalation is gentle; coincidence aids the locket’s return, and the price is primarily emotional rather than foreclosing a live option. Marisol’s agency initiates the project and declares continuation, but pressure never truly squeezes. The storm provides a useful but soft turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motifs accrue into a coherent theme of reciprocity: tides, freighters, ledgers, edelweiss, and lockets reweight meaning at the end. “The tide returns what it borrows” risks neatness but is grounded by concrete particulars and earned returns. Subtext of class visibility and lineage of care hums through action rather than sermon. The final understanding reframes giving as a loop, not a line.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with close third focalization; diction suits Marisol’s maritime/commercial sensibility. Dialogue is sparing yet functional, and Theo’s “whimsically attentive” register reads distinct. Rhythm modulates well between scene and montage without head‑hopping. The stylistic control holds under the story’s modest pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly precise; metaphors align with sea and trade, avoiding muddle. Information density is high with little scaffolding or repeat. However, the final sentence truncates mid‑phrase, dulling the closure image and rhythm at the peak beat. That artifact notably reduces the last‑line charge.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Harbor logistics braided with an underground economy of kindness feels fresh; the library‑symphony crossover and postage‑as‑smuggling are distinctive. The mistaken‑letter trope is revitalized by specific civic texture and object use. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; the piece chooses warmth over sharper complication. Still, the synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
