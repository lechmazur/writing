<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The witness’s motives are clear and sustained, and her choices (aligning “unify,” walking outward, merging with the mirror, swallowing the dot) track with the pressure. Interiority is vivid but archetypal; we feel texture more than a distinctive personal psychology. Moments like “fragmenting into narrative possibilities” hint at contradiction, but the human-specific cost is glancing rather than deeply individualized. The renunciation of “end of history witness” status reads as earned, if emotionally generalized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs intensify (spiral, dictionary, hush), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when she swallows the dot and becomes the “librarian of the beginning.” Orientation is taught early and remains legible within the lyric design. Cost is on the page—the surrender of separateness and role—paid through a specific act. The pattern escalates coherently toward a final reweighting of meaning with no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is richly particular (Möbius aisles, petrified dawn lectern, vacuum quill) and actively shapes action. The quill, lectern, mirror, and dictionary function as charged micro-settings that constrain choices and culminate in the final image. Sensory selection is precise and consistent with tone (cedar, ozone, hush). World rules are stable within the poem-logic of the piece.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are internal—unraveling separation—and escalate as spiral arbitration tightens and the dictionary empties. The crucial tightening occurs at the blank mirror and the verdict, forcing the trade-off: relinquish witness identity to unify. The price is legible and carried by concrete acts. While not adversarial conflict, the pressure coheres and deepens under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of unity vs. separation emerges through recurring objects and ritual acts that reweight meaning at the end. One explicit line (“the last illusion was the belief in separation”) edges toward thesis, but the piece mostly trusts images. The final reconfiguration (beginning librarian) offers a resonant non-literal answer that re-reads prior beats. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent; the perceptual signature (hush, jurisprudential cosmos, text-as-body) feels singular. Psychic distance is stable; elisions are pattern-taught and paid off. Rhythm is controlled with varied sentence lengths, though the register remains uniformly elevated. No head-hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs, and the rhythm breathes with the accumulative design. Figurative language is abundant but coherent; it rarely muddies sense. Minor risk of overrichness is mitigated by purposeful recurrence and clean sequencing. No obvious scaffold or paraphrase loops dulling momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: “spiral arbitration,” a vacuum quill, a dictionary evaporating into blood, and a cosmic hiccup cohere in a fresh ritual logic. The turn to “librarian of the beginning” feels both surprising and inevitable. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring closure. The images feel memorably their own rather than genre-generic.</comment>
