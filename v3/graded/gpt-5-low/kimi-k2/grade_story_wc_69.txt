<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ms. Vale’s interior conflict—her wound from a slur versus her vocation to harmonize—drives concrete choices (naming fears, changing how she sings, ultimately offering the rosette). Emotions are embodied through tactile cues (warmth of wood, breath, “flakes of rust”). The arc from control to listening reads earned and costly. A slight tilt toward abstraction in a few lines keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and patterns (silence, birds, geese, breath) densify until the charged offering of the rosette and the years-later return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the relinquishment of bitterness and transfer of stewardship. Orientation is clear from the outset and the two-shard coda coheres. The because/therefore is lyrical rather than causal, but consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The velvet autumn library and the rosette operate as charged environment-objects; the setting conditions her tactic (quiet listening) and culminates in the object at her sternum and then in the child’s hands. Sensory writing is vivid yet purposeful (woodsmoke, geese, wool skirt). The final image is inseparable from place and object. Economy is well-judged with recurring details accruing meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlearning hatred into active listening—tightens through the naming of noise and the risk of letting dissonance remain. The decisive act (offering the rosette) forecloses her private hold and commits to a communal future, with felt price. Escalation is quiet but clear under the chosen lens, cresting in the blend of songs and the vow. Pressure is internal rather than oppositional but coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: subtraction-as-space, listening as mercy, inheritance of care. The rosette’s hollow reprices “emptiness” as an ear, and the ending reframes harmony as shelter rather than sameness. No sermonizing; imagery does the work. The years-later return deepens ethical consequence without blunt moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person closely held to Ms. Vale sustains a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from hush to braided song to charged poise). Diction is consistent with the sensibility of a choir teacher steeped in sound and craft. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful motifs, and clean syntax. Lushness stays coherent; metaphors align (hollow as ear, birds lifting, rust falling). A few abstractions (“vanishing arts of mercy”) skate close to telling but remain grounded by adjacent images. Momentum is maintained without loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The zither rosette as portable silence is a fresh, specific conceit that anchors an otherwise familiar redemption arc. The non-obvious turn is conceptual—subtraction as hospitality—made tactile. Risks (lyric density, quiet plot) pay off with clarity and resonance. Distinctive synthesis feels inevitable by the end.</comment>
