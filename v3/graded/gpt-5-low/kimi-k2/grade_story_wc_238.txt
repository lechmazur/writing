<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Her motive—deliver an apology before the orchard falls—is vivid and steady, with embodied guilt (ether-roughened voice, the bottle’s “evaporated longing”). The micro-choices (using the pipe for induced currents, choosing metaphor over plain speech) reveal a practiced, idiosyncratic professional under pressure. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt; she’s resolute more than torn, which slightly limits complexity. Still, the final renunciation—leaving the emptied bottle and accepting an “imperfect miracle”—registers as a credible, costly stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when), and the live clock of the pending chainsaws tightens the frame. The accumulative design coheres: perfume → pipe → fluttering scores → ghost → apple-seed rest → saws, culminating in a charged poise closure. Cost is legible on the page: the orchard still falls; she surrenders the bottle and accepts a transformed, not reversed, loss. Setups (requiem, currents, orchard site of the prior rite) all pay off without stray threads.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archive and orchard are not just backdrops; the heating pipe and fragile scores enable the summoning and tune the atmosphere. The antique bottle and the requiem function as object-as-setting, charging the final images (empty bottle on stump; apple-seed rest). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (bergamot, dust spirals, temperature drop), maintaining rule consistency for this world. The environment constrains her tactics and frames the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—apology before destruction—stays tight and escalates with the saws starting mid-scene. Her agency drives the deepening: choosing induced currents, addressing the ghost in metaphors, and placing the drop on the blank measure. The price is acceptance of loss and a reconfigured outcome rather than reversal; the piece earns this with the “imperfect miracle” motif. Slightly muted antagonism (no adversary but time) keeps it just shy of maximal pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of forgiveness as re-scored memory emerges through action (apple-seed rest, “let their rings remember this rhythm”) rather than moralizing. Recurring images—orchard/artery, perfume/longing, requiem/rest—shift meaning at the end to yield a resonant, non-literal answer. The piece avoids sentimental closure by accepting a loss while repricing it as music “in another key.” Subtext in the archivist’s witnessing and the gossip-column myth rounds the moral calculus without stating it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person focalization is steady and character-specific, with metaphoric diction that aligns to her profession and psyche. Dialogue is sparse but loaded with subtext and intent (“words are blunt instruments,” followed by action via metaphor). Rhythm modulates under pressure without head-hopping or register slips. The gossip-column note is woven in with restraint, maintaining voice integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with purposeful imagery (“centuries of evaporated longing,” “fallen scales”) and minimal scaffold. A few stacked metaphors flirt with lushness, but they stay coherent and scene-advancing. Syntax varies and propulsion is clean through the summoning to the charged final images. No loops or muddled vehicles blunt the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—gossip-column exorcist, induced currents, a requiem completed by perfume—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (scientific-mystic method, apple-seed rest as closure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Specificity of tools and images prevents the premise from reading like a prompt collage. Emotional truth—apology that cannot undo harm—grounds the novelty.</comment>
