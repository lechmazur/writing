<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Interiority is precise and embodied—the button’s weight, dust murals, and the “Return to Sender” envelope reveal a character who makes careful, value‑driven micro‑choices under pressure. Her contradictory impulses (yearning for answers vs. a disciplined archival patience) surface credibly. The forgiveness beat is earned by prior images and actions. No therapy‑speak or safety hedging dilutes her stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: button → folder/Polaroid → vow/support‑group plan → forgiveness creates a coherent deepening toward a charged poise. Closure lands in the on‑page forgiveness and reframing of what she will tell—cost is the relinquishment of grievance. The final sentence truncation blunts the cadence of the last image, but closure has already occurred. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The file room and its dust function as lived‑in environment and micro‑setting; they constrain attention and enable the dust‑mural tactic that charges the ending. The button operates as an object‑as‑setting, anchoring motion and mood. Sensory detail is economical and POV‑filtered (“ghost of bleach,” “dust galaxies”). Space and tools evolve with action without museum‑tour static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconciling with unknown histories through a small relic) tightens via the Polaroid discovery and the choice to tell a different story. The meaningful turn is internal but concrete—envelope kept near the heart, vow to magnify kindnesses, and forgiveness of the father—foreclosing a grievance path. Costs are felt, if quiet. Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of re‑storying, caretaking of histories, and kindness as counter‑archive emerge from specific events and images. The recurring dust/button constellation shifts meaning at the end, offering a resonant non‑literal answer. One slightly declarative line (“she would magnify every kindness…”) edges toward thesis‑speak but is supported by action. The emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a careful archivist; diction and rhythm fit the character’s sensibility. Psychic distance remains steady; inference reads as inference. Patterned lyric moves (dust galaxies, inventory note) are taught and paid off. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lines are polished and dense without much redundancy; images usually pull double duty. A few stacked metaphors flirt with purple but stay coherent. The truncated final sentence is a clear text artifact that dulls the terminal cadence. Otherwise rhythm and clarity are strong with varied syntax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The foster‑care archivist frame with a soldier’s button as reliquary feels fresh and organically integrated. Accumulative dust‑cosmos imagery reimagines memory work without gimmickry. The piece risks a quiet, non‑event closure and largely earns it. Familiar healing notes are elevated by specific, tactile choices.</comment>
