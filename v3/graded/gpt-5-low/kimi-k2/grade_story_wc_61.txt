<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (break the family’s fire-borne pattern) drives embodied choices: lifting the gear to her sternum, singing, renouncing the heirloom, dispersing herself. Interiority is specific and image-linked (scratches as centuries; dents as rebellion), not generic. The internal contradiction—grief’s pull vs. the vow to “scatter the light without burning”—is active on the page. The final renunciation reads earned, with visible cost (letting the gear rest; choosing disassembly into light).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through recurring images (gear/petals/light) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gear stops and ancestors fold into the drift. Orientation is clean early (who, where, why). The cost is legible in the closing beats (releasing the object and self-dispersion). Minor deduction only because the very last fragment cuts off mid-phrase, softening the final cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden isn’t ornamental; it supplies the rule “the only place left where light could be shared without using fire,” directly shaping tactics and the end image. Petals actively answer her song, charging the environment as participant. Object-as-setting (gear) and setting interplay elevate the final mirror-like circle. Slight trim for the closing fragment’s textual hiccup.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending a generational cycle without fire—is pressured by the persistent inheritance embodied in the gear. Escalation arrives as the petals answer and ancestors coalesce, forcing a stance crystallization via the song and renunciation. The narrowing is clear: keep spinning the legacy or stop it; she pays by relinquishing object and self-form. Quiet but unmistakable tightening under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (gentle inheritance vs. destructive legacy) emerges organically via repeated light/fire, transit, and gear motifs, culminating in the gear’s earned rest. The ancestors’ incorporation into petals reweights inheritance with cost and grace. The explicit “equation” line risks a touch of spelled-out thesis, slightly dulling subtext. Despite that, resonance lingers through the reconfigured images rather than argument.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, coherent lyric voice with controlled imagery and consistent focalization. Diction and rhythm modulate purposefully (from hushed observation to charged singing) without head-hopping. Purposeful elisions are taught early and paid off in pattern. Only the final clipped phrase mars otherwise excellent cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lush prose largely earns its density with precise, layered images; momentum stays intact. Repetition (“approximating infinity”) is purposeful and reweighted. However, the last sentence truncates (“the light”), a line-level artifact that blurs the ultimate image and costs musical closure. This prevents top-band polish.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—cosmic lyricism, heirloom machinery, non-combustive light, sonar-petals—feels fresh and internally coherent. The gear’s metaphoric physics (infinite click → restful circle) is an inventive turn that pays off. Risks in diction and concept mostly land, with only the final fragment keeping this from exceptional. Specificity resists genre-template echoes.</comment>
