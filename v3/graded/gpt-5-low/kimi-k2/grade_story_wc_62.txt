<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s vocation and need are specific and embodied—reading the ribbon, questioning the mentor, and chiseling the grooves show motive under pressure. Her interiority is concise but present, with a credible blend of ritual duty and personal ache. Minor softness arises when insight is stated a bit declaratively (“grief is not a monument but a migration”), trimming some ambiguity. Still, her final choices (installing the stone; initiating a new custom) feel earned with a felt cost of time, discipline, and release.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: ritual repetition, butterflies, and poems build to a cadence shift where the migration completes and the single carved line reweights meaning. Closure lands on the page: villagers weep at the stone; Mara commits to a new custom—an RR/CR blend with visible emotional cost. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the montage of weeks is contained and purposeful. The causal thread (mentor → ribbon-map → carving → unveiling) stays intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The greenhouse is sensorially rich and functionally integral: it houses the mentor, channels the butterflies, and shapes the method (carving grooves that catch rain and feed wings). The ribbon and tools are used as micro-setting objects that constrain choices (“Retrace these lines…with chisel and mallet”). Environmental effects (vibrating glass, pollen, dusk) evolve with events and charge the final image. The setting is inseparable from the tactics and the outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving shape to collective grief—is clearly established and deepens through mentor guidance and sustained labor. The tightening arrives as the migration completes, foreclosing further iterative attempts and forcing acceptance of the single flowing line. Cost is felt as relinquishment of monumentality for motion, and the public unveiling risks communal response. Escalation is more deepening than reversal but remains coherent and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through concrete acts: tracing flight paths into stone, butterflies drinking from grooves, and the village’s tears reframing grief as process rather than artifact. Subtext surfaces in the spectral mother’s mentorship without collapsing into sermonizing; the final custom with living and dead extends the concept with resonance. A few aphoristic lines flirt with overstatement but are contained within diegetic poems, preserving integrity. The final image reweights prior motifs elegantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third-person closely tracks Mara’s perception; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. Dialogue is minimal but functional and subtextual (“Begin…”; “The shape you seek…”), acting as pressure rather than exposition. No head-hopping or stance wobble occurs, and psychic distance modulates with scene intensity. Elevated language fits the chosen register and remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines do multiple jobs—imagery, action, and theme—without slipping into muddle; metaphors are coherent to the greenhouse/butterfly lexicon. Rhythm varies and avoids scaffold or synonym loops, and the prose carries momentum through the montage. A few elevated phrases verge on declarative theme, but they are balanced by tactile specifics (mica flecks, grooves catching rain). Copy is clean and the final cadence is precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—gravestone carving guided by a spectral mother via butterfly migration mapped onto stone—is fresh and specific. Risks (lyric density, ritual structure) pay off in a cohesive, non-gimmicky design. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (the ribbon-as-map; grooves that feed butterflies) and the conceptual repricing of grief is earned. The piece commits fully to its peculiar logic and aesthetic.</comment>
