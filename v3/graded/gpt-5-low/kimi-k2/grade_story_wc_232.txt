<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s motive—keeping a promise to Lila—coherently drives every beat and culminates in an earned renunciation. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific (maps, numbers, ants) with credible contradiction at the mirror. His refusal forecloses a life‑reset with a felt cost. Minor note: the “empirically intuitive” label is more shown than tested by failure, but does not undercut the turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑scene, Situational drive holds: rising storm + time‑bound midsummer bloom + mirror choice cohere to force stance crystallization. Closure is Earned Stasis: he refuses to step through; the cavern seals, options foreclosed on the page. Cost is legible in the forfeited chance to unmake Lila’s choice and his own past. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: storm, creek, limestone fissure, phosphorescent bloom, and obsidian mirror all constrain access and time. The matrix chip as tool engages the environment; the bloom fading adds a live clock. The final image (stone dulling, path closing, creek singing) is charged by place. Sensory detail is purposeful across senses without excess drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (change Lila’s fate vs. honor her choice), and pressure tightens at the lintel: decide now or lose the door. The mirror’s offer creates a trade‑off with clear loss; the bloom’s fade and rising creek add situational squeeze. Resolution arises from Elias’s agency and renunciation with a visible consequence (door seals). Slightly quiet external opposition, but internal/external interlock carries.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of promise, truth, and the ethics of undoing choices emerge organically through objects (matrix “letter that always told the truth”), ants, and the door. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: remembering Lila “as she had chosen to be” lands as earned wisdom. Recurring images (maps, D for Decide) shift meaning at the end. No sermonizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (cartographic/measurement bias) remains steady. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure—lush in discovery, taut at decision—without head‑hopping. The single spoken line is spare and in character. No unearned omniscience; inference stays within his knowing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is controlled, image‑dense, and largely multi‑tasking; lines advance mood and action simultaneously. Minimal redundancy; metaphor chains are coherent (printing metal, truth, decisions). A few lush phrases flirt with purple but do not blunt clarity or momentum. Opening and final lines are well‑tuned and carry motif reprise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an antique map dealer, a type matrix that “casts truth,” ant‑led ingress, and a midsummer cavern reframing time and choice. The refusal rather than miracle fix is non‑obvious and inevitable in hindsight. The object ecology (chip → fissure → D lintel) ingeniously ties craft to fate. Risks in lyric density pay off with clarity and resonance.</comment>
