<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara’s desire “to discover what trees witness” cleanly motivates her ascent and careful reassembly. Interiority is concrete through tactile acts (tracing arcs, feeling sap), but contradictory impulses and visible struggle are minimal, making the journey feel low-friction. The final acceptance feels earned yet largely unopposed. More pressure or a conflicted hesitation would deepen the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds toward the resonant reconfiguration of the sextant. Closure lands with the reassembled instrument projecting a circle that reframes grief and witness; cost is conceptual (transforming sorrow rather than erasing it). Orientation is clear early, and the mosaic of beats coheres without causal gaps. The cost is soft but legible in the golden seams and the labyrinth’s hum.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The tower, broken dome, oak roots, and moonlight are vivid and purpose-driven; moonlight directly enables the repair. The sextant functions as a charged object-as-setting, constraining action (laid on the sill) and shaping the final image. Specifics (moss spirals echoing stairs) feel lived and thematically apt. Strong integration without overexposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconfiguring grief via the sextant) is clear and tightens as moonlight activates healing. Escalation is tonal/density-based rather than obstacle-driven, fitting the chosen lens. However, pressure is gentle; few options close or exact a price beyond relinquishing the desire to “fix back” versus “transform.” The end is earned but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Recurring images (oak, rings, brass seams, constellations) mature into a resonant thesis: grief’s shape can be honored and transformed. The final compass and oak-leaf shadow reweight earlier material without sermonizing. One explicit thematic assertion (“quantified sorrow wasn’t about reducing…”) edges toward telling but is supported by scene work. Thematic cohesion is strong and lingering.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent, sensate, and character-filtered; no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well from storm to hush, with a distinct perceptual signature (noticing moss spirals, dust planets). A few lofty abstractions flirt with generality but don’t break the spell. Overall control and specificity sustain the tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful images, and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-taught; no major metaphor clashes. Minor redundancy (“mapping scattered dreams” appears twice) and occasional abstraction slightly slow momentum. The final image is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a labyrinth custodian restoring a sextant via dream-mapping and moonlight, with quantified sorrow and arboreal witness. The oak-root catch and kintsugi-like golden seams feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is purposeful without obscuring clarity. Only the gentle conflict profile keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
