<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lira’s contradiction—ordered to “catalogue, never to intervene” yet choosing to act—drives credible, escalating micro‑choices. Her embodied bond with the stone (“pulse like a second heart”) grounds emotion. The sacrifice is concrete: she violates role to preserve hope, accepting future burden. Interiority stays character‑specific, not diagnostic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: shadow appears → archival comparison → realization of metamorphosis → anchoring act with names and stone → reversal. Closure lands on the page with cost (shadow bound, not destroyed; duty reweighted). The single scene holds time, space, and logic; the river‑stone mechanism is pre‑seeded and paid off. Lens: Causal with a resonant final poise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is integral—its petals, shelves, and dream‑index actively shape tactics and the threat (the library’s silhouette becoming the shadow). The river stone functions as a micro‑setting/tool constraining choice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is crisp from archive to summit. World rules are conveyed through action, not dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve hope) is clear early and tightens with the unbound shadow encroaching. The archival discovery forecloses recording‑only as a path, forcing a values trade‑off. Cost is felt—breaking orders, binding not erasing the threat, carrying future vigilance. If anything, the institutional consequence remains implied, not confronted on‑page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres through weight vs. light, memory vs. metamorphosis, and the ethics of witnessing vs. resisting. The stone reweights hope into something holdable; the ending’s charged poise lingers. The final whisper (“every shadow contains the memory of light”) edges toward articulation, slightly softening subtext. Still, resonance is earned by images and acts, not sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is consistent, precise, and modulates under pressure without opacity. Diction (“sharp‑eyed dusk noticer,” “glass petals”) feels native to Lira’s perception. Patterned elision is taught early and serves momentum; no head‑hopping or register drift. The cadence tightens at peak and relaxes into a charged final line.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines are dense but purposeful; metaphor is controlled and thematically coherent (petals/wings/lanterns/weight). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few high‑lyric constructions approach lushness but never obscure action or causality. Rhythm supports escalation, and the closure image is crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The premise—a cloud‑library of shareable dreams metamorphosing into its own devouring shadow—feels singular. The river stone as hope’s weight is an original, functional device, not ornament. Turns arise from seeded logic (silent footage comparison) rather than contrivance. Risk‑taking in image and worldbuilding heightens stakes without losing clarity.</comment>
