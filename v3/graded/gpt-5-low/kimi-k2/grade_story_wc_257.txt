<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (to forget, then to tend) evolves through concrete micro-choices: polishing lenses, leaving cranes, pricking the sky, planting the locket. The push–pull between erasure and remembrance reads on the page without therapy‑speak. The visible cost—relinquishing the mourning locket’s function—feels earned by prior actions. A slightly aphoristic self‑naming at the end (“You have become…”) edges toward neatness but remains character‑driven.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned actions (cranes, lenses, curtains) densify until the garden overlaps the observatory, then reprice grief. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: planting the locket and adopting “gardener of the possible,” with the caretaker’s winding‑down as cost. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why) and sustained. Cause comes via ritual sequences rather than plot turns, but the cadence shift at the map/garden manifestation is decisive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, dome, telescope, and “curtains of intention” constrain choice and charge the final image; stepping between curtains alters options. Tools (lenses, stencil, tripod) are tactile and mission‑critical, not postcard details. World rules (illumination projects coordinates; overlap of sky/soil) are taught through use and pay off at closure. The final alignment of telescope and bloom proves the setting’s agency.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around whether grief becomes tending; pressure tightens when the caretaker illuminates the cranes and the garden overlays the hall, forcing a stance. The turn—placing the locket into earth—forecloses a path and redefines her craft. Cost is legible (letting go of mourning function; the caretaker’s eventual death). Escalation is primarily density/texture rather than conflict, but it credibly narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of grief as lens, light as instruction, and cultivating remembrance arise from specific acts (mulching with jet beads, coordinates as wayfinding). Subtext lives in charged objects and rituals more than explanation. The explicit voiced moral lines risk overstatement, especially the closing aphorism, but they feel earned by the ritual journey and reweighted images. The caretaker’s last alignment offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct lyric perceptual signature threads the piece; diction and rhythm are controlled and apt to the protagonist’s craft‑inflected gaze. POV is stable, with dialogue sparse and effective (“Light is a form of instruction…” as a catalytic line). Voice modulates under pressure without head‑hopping. Elevated register matches the fable‑like frame and stays within the piece’s taught idiom.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (beads → mulch; lenses → focus of grief). Lush metaphors are coherent and legible; momentum rarely stalls. Minor risk of purple and aphorism is contained by concrete action beats. Syntax varies and the final images land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—mourning jewelry + observatory + curtains of intention + coordinates origami—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric fabulism, object‑driven ritual) heighten stakes and coherence rather than read as gimmickry. Turns grow from established patterns (illumination, folding) without late rule cheats. Emotional truth emerges through specific, fresh procedures.</comment>
