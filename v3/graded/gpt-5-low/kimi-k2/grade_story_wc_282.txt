<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific from the first line—Lira returns to become “the voice of the unknown”—and her shift from speaking for to letting-through is credibly earned. Interiority is embodied via tools and sensations (color pulses, smells at the fork) rather than abstract labels. The decisive choice—pressing the fossil to the sleeper’s forehead and surrendering authorship—reveals values with felt cost (recorder silent, map no longer hers). Minor note: internal contradiction is more formal than messy, but the renunciation still lands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through mapping, the fork decision, and the sleeper revelation; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early, and the fossil’s causal thread is consistent. The final cadence (“map no longer hers,” caves sealing, fossil rewritten) crystallizes a before/after. The cost is on the page and shapes the end-state.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The coastal cave network and the fossil function as charged environments/tools that constrain pathing (the fork by smell/heat signature) and culminate in the exit to sea. Sensory textures are purposive across modalities (salt wind, ozone, cobalt crabs), filtered through Lira’s occupational bias. World rules are learned in action (heat-mapping, fossil translating dreams). The final image is deeply charged by place: caves sealing and horizon lavender.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is set early and coherently tightened at the fork and again upon discovering the sleeper. The key turn is Lira’s renunciation: choosing to enable rather than claim authorship, with the price of relinquishing the map. Escalation suits the accumulative lens—density increases and options reweight rather than multiple reversals. Consequences persist (recorder silent, ownership surrendered).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres around voice-as-listening, transitional objects/beings, and mapping emotion into shared language, delivered through concrete acts (merging fossil, muralized heat). The final repricing is potent: authority ceded to a collective listening. However, the explicit statement on the wrist screen (“The voice travels forward by listening back”) flirts with moralizing and slightly flattens an otherwise rich subtext. Still, the images carry genuine resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV and calibrated certainty; inference reads as inference. Diction is precise and character-bound (professional noticing, color-emotion mapping) without academic drift. Rhythm modulates effectively at the climax (murals, first word of the after). No head-hopping or unearned omniscience.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax; metaphors are coherent and tethered to the world (veins as roads, serrations as shorelines). Minimal scaffold and no looped phrasing; line-level propulsion matches the accumulative build. Figurative intensity stays legible even in peak beats. A few luminous lines risk aphorism but remain grounded by action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: post-hibernation world, sensory cartography via emotional heat, and a “factually mystical” fossil used as a true method, not ornament. The transitional-object concept becomes tactic and theme; the closure reconfigures authorship with cost. Risks in tone and design pay off without obscuring clarity. Memorable images feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
