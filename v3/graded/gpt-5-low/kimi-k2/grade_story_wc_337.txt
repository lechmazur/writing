<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—to relieve accrued grief by untying silence—reads clear and consistent, and her competence is dramatized through tactile micro‑choices with the net and needle. The fisherman’s presence adds relational pressure and a tender teaching dynamic. Internal contradiction is modest (duty vs. burden) rather than adversarial, keeping the arc more endurance than rupture. The closing promise to return registers a credible cost without false heroics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens via beads of silence → suspended cloud → puncture, culminating in names released and hush dissolving. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost: Lira absorbs, then disperses, and accepts ongoing burden. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene holds. Minor line slips do not touch causality or the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight are richly integrated—refractions sketch faces, the faceted ceiling grants the exit path, and the net/needle interplay lives in the space. Sensory specificity feels earned and POV‑filtered (salt crust, pearl‑gray cloud). The setting charges the final image as spirits thread upward through facets. A touch of lyrical saturation prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are legible early (exhume names before forgetting’s “tide”), and pressure escalates through accumulation rather than contest. The decisive intensification is the gathered hush condensed to a cloud and Lira’s choice to pierce it. The process reads smooth—little resistance or risk—yet the burdened endurance and teaching beat with the fisherman provide felt cost. Closure arises from her deliberate act, not coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Silence, names, and repair braid into a meditation on mourning work: release requires precise unmaking and shared truth. The net’s reconfigured “lacework of absences” and the final promise avoid platitude, landing with earned tenderness. The fisherman’s spoken name functions as thematic hinge without moralizing. Slight tidiness holds it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lucidly lyrical, and consistent in focalization; images are controlled and character‑specific to a restorer’s tactility. Rhythm modulates well from intricate untying to the cloud’s puncture and quiet exhale. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with tonal distinction between Lira and the fisherman. Minor awkwardness in one phrase does not dent cohesion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, with many sentences carrying dual duty (world + emotion). A few blemishes—“accumulates silence”/tense hiccup, the awkward “across sharing a secret,” and a stray bracket—disrupt polish. Lyrical density occasionally grazes purple but remains mostly coherent. These small artifacts prevent elite‑tier cleanliness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The vocation (broken mask restorer) and the moon‑threaded needle untying silence from a fisherman’s net feel striking and specific. Accumulative ritual as plot engine is a fresh angle on grief rites. The cloud‑prick and name‑release sequence is inventive and inevitable in hindsight. High originality without gimmickry; only minimal genre echoes of ritual exorcisms.</comment>
