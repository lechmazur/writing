<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Marisol’s motives and sensory‑driven interiority are vivid and consistent, and her key choices (to prune, to graft, to share rather than eat) align with her values. The chef’s taste‑memory lens individualizes her reactions. Internal contradiction is light; she encounters little genuine resistance, so we see less struggle than the setup promises. Still, her micro‑choices under time pressure feel specific and revealing.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear, and the piece deepens via recurring objects and images, but closure is undercut by the abrupt truncation (“Mar”) that withholds the final cadence and cost. The ending gestures toward a Resonant Reconfiguration yet doesn’t land it on the page. Without a completed final beat, the before/after remains suggestive rather than decisively earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is tactile, sensorial, and rule‑setting; the alignment light, broken panes, and door‑threshold shape action and the final sharing image. Details filter through a chef’s palate, keeping specificity purposeful. The environment constrains choices (pruning, grafting, light‑drinking seed) and charges the near‑final image. Minor deduction for the missing closing cadence, not the setting work itself.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—saving/growing a living counter‑city through gentle means—is clear, and pressure coheres via the ticking alignment and looming officials. Escalation is primarily textural: prune → graft → ripen → share → officials arrive. Costs are soft; officials are conveniently outflanked and the protagonist faces no painful trade‑off on the page. The absence of a landed final beat limits the felt price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of grief transmuted into communal nourishment and “gentle rebellion” emerge organically from pruning, grafting, and sharing. A thesis‑sounding line risks overstatement but is largely earned by concrete action. The greenhouse‑as‑brain metaphor integrates with memory and community without didacticism. Resonance is strong, but the cut short ending blunts the lasting after‑image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A distinctive lyrical voice braided with culinary and botanical perception sustains control and specificity. “Synaptic plasticity” and sensory diction feel coherent to this mind and world. Modulation suits pressure, and the single dialogue line is apt. A fully landed final rhythm would likely have elevated the cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentences are musical and information‑dense with largely clean mechanics; sensory images do multiple jobs. The lushness stops short of purple, and figurative logic holds. Minimal scaffold or loops appear despite high lyric density. Slight risk of saturation in a few lines, but clarity is maintained.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—a memory‑tasting chef catalyzing a communal uprising through pruning and a knowledge fruit under a cosmic alignment—is fresh and specific. The greenhouse‑as‑brain reframe is imaginative and integrated into action. Risks feel purposeful rather than ornamental. The incomplete closure keeps it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
