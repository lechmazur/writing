<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Iona’s motive is clear and embodied—pressing her ear to glass, tracing rings, risking the rail—without melodrama. Her “featherly determination” threads action to theme. Internal contradiction is light; doubt seldom counters resolve, limiting complexity. Still, micro-choices under pressure feel specific and earned, culminating in the descent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned acts (grain, code, thresholds) accrue until the maze opens and the reunion lands on the page. Closure is both Decisive Change (reunion and workshop revealed) and Resonant Reconfiguration (earned threshold). Cost is legible in the risked descent and the foreclosed wandering as the maze closes. Orientation is crisp from line one.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, the glass floor, the rope ladder, and the living maze constrain tactics and charge the final tableau. Recurring objects (chair, knot, logbook) are integrated with setting logic. Sensory detail is selective and POV-shaped; the environment actively answers her moves. Rules (maze responds to breath/code) stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reach the father/understand sacred thresholds—is coherent and tightens via deciphering, stilling the maze, and committing to descent. Pressure stems from necessity and risk rather than antagonism; the terrace tilt and living maze create real stakes. The earned reunion springs from her choices, not luck. The felt price is quiet but present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motifs (thresholds, grain, feather, prism) deepen into a meditation on earned passage and distance. The final images reprice prior acts without sentimentality. Slight deduction for the father’s near-thesis line (“sacred thresholds are not crossed...”), which edges into thematic echo. Overall, resonance lingers through particulars rather than sermon.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Controlled lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature—technical “weather code” meets tactile wood and breath-responsive maze. Psychic distance modulates cleanly; the brief dialogue lands with subtext. No head-hopping or stance drift; compression is taught and legible. Rhythm suits pressure without overdecorating.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, action, and theme—without sludge. Minor repetitions (“fractured hush,” “featherly”) are purposeful, not loops. Figurative density is high but coherent to the world’s logic. Pacing and syntax shift appropriately at risk beats (rail, descent, opening corridor).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a prism-terrace airship remnant over a living maze, weather-code as prayer, wood grain as map. Risks—mythic logic, accumulative closure—cohere and pay off. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (knot/doorway → stalk/doorway → workshop). Emotional truth is specific and avoids generic fable tones.</comment>
