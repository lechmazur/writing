<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s desire “to find where unused love is stored” is clear, embodied in tactile choices (pressing the film, threading the projector, singing) and complicated by regret over Lin. Her contradictory impulses—archival duty vs. private errand; pursuit vs. renunciation—coexist on the page. The renunciation at the end (“She would not follow, but she would no longer stand still.”) feels earned and carries a felt cost. Slight hedge: interior conflict is more lyric than pressure-tested by an opposing force in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory density tightens into the letter’s manifestation and the conceptual pivot that love lives “in the interval between frames.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing coupled with Earned Stasis (she plants the quartz and chooses a new stance). Cost is legible in relinquishing the letter’s old function and the path toward Lin. Orientation is clean from the opening and all set-ups (tin, dead bulb, quartz) pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The projection booth is exquisitely lived-in and functionally constraining: the dead bulb, rewinder spindle, and windowed screen shape tactics and imagery. Objects recur with charged purpose (quartz, projector, tin) and culminate in the final reconfiguration. Sensory detail across smell, sound, and touch sustains atmosphere without drifting into postcard description. The space directly enables the magical act and the ending image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes cohere around reclaiming/locating unused love, with one meaningful tightening as the letter animates and the rule of storage is repriced. Agency drives the deepening (psychometry → threading → singing → beam at tin), and the final renunciation forecloses a path with cost. Tension is mostly internal and lyric, but it does escalate in texture and consequence. A more immediate counterforce might have sharpened pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete acts (handling film, singing, refracted light) and resolves to a resonant, non-literal answer about where love resides. The final insight reweights prior motifs (interval between frames; lyrics finding their tune). Slight ding for an explicit thematic articulation in the last line that edges toward summarizing the moral. Still, the afterimage lingers and feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with precise, character-inflected noticing (“hot carbon and velvet rot”) sustains point-of-view without leakage. Rhythm modulates well from hush to crescendo; elisions are pattern-taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift undermines credibility. Density is high but remains legible throughout.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line craft is polished, varied, and propulsive; most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme). Figurative language is lush yet coherent to the projector/film lexicon, with minimal redundancy. A few phrases flirt with purple (“transparent scar,” “nightjar warms an alien egg”) but do not blur causality or the closure image. No loops or scaffolding slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—psychometry cinema, unused love stored between frames, lyrics seeking a tune—feels original and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and conceit heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, and the projection booth premise is fully committed to. The metamorphosis of text into silhouette into song is a memorable, non-obvious turn grounded in prior particulars. It’s fresh without quirk-for-quirk’s-sake.</comment>
