<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elowen’s core contradiction—archivist of vows vs. participant in a living oath—drives credible micro‑choices from listening/translating to the costly pivot of speaking a new oath. Embodied perception (ear‑trumpet to bark, wax like dried blood) grounds emotion. The renunciation of detachment is earned and forecloses a path. Minor hedge: her change arrives smoothly, with little internal resistance on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural holding through closure. Orientation is immediate; beats cohere from silence → listening → accidental prophecy → reprice vow → new oath → charged image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (cracked cylinder; surrender of archival remove). Causal threads (voice via memory, orchard dictation) are legible without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard‑atop‑a‑skyscraper, roots around oath plaques, and the foghorned city are vivid and POV‑filtered. Environment and tools charge the final image (blossoms rising, cylinder halved into wings; bark as diaphragm). Details are economical, consistent, and world‑coherent. The setting shapes tactics by necessitating arboreal listening and oath‑speaking to the tree.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the city’s listening/foghorns) is clear, with escalation via the unbidden Latin, prophecy groove, and the realization of a broken collective promise. The tightening compels Elowen to trade archival purity for active vow‑making, a visible price. Pressure is more lyrical than combative but remains coherent under the chosen lens. No wasted turns or convenience fixes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of reciprocal listening emerges through objects and acts (ear‑trumpet, sap pulse, child memory used as diaphragm) and culminates in speaking back. The line “The promise was simple: to keep listening…” edges toward explicitness but is supported by scene pressure. Final images reweight earlier motifs without sermonizing. Resonance lingers with the cost of abandoning detachment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with intensity (from hush to charged release). No head‑hopping, no register drift; elision is purposeful. The voice’s precision sustains the uncanny without confusion. Imagistic logic remains consistent with the POV’s expertise and bias.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean syntax and varied rhythm; images do multiple jobs (wax as blood, skyline, wings). Metaphor remains coherent and purposeful; minimal scaffolding. Slight lushness in a few lines, but momentum holds and clarity never dims, including at closure. No notable loops or template cadences.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: oath archaeology via trees, a foghorn‑bound city, and a child memory as diaphragm for prophecy. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight and rooted in setup. Risks (mythic technics, lyric closure) heighten stakes and cohere. The final reconfiguration is fresh and memorable.</comment>
