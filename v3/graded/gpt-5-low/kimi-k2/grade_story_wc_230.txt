<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lira’s motive is crisp (forage, map, survive) and under pressure her skepticism rubs against wonder and fear (“I laughed… and the sound cracked a branch”). Micro-choices—pocketing the eye, reading cures, planting it, staying on—reveal a hierarchy of values. The involuntary truth compulsion creates credible social and tactical constraints. The cost is quiet but real: she accepts stewardship and exposure as the trees “sense fear,” foreclosing flight.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: Kestrel hires her → glass eye triggers an involuntary confession → cave/cures/world rule → storm pressure → planting the eye decisively changes stakes. Closure lands on the page with a felt before/after: compulsion eases, roots tighten, and she commits to remain caretaker. Cost is implicit in the renunciation of market anonymity and in maintaining “psychological safety.” Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ravine orchard and storms constrain choices and charge the final image; weather and cliff instability force the planting action and color every beat. Sensory specificity (“metallic scent of lightning,” “branches… like nooses”) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The glass eye as micro-setting object anchors the ending and reweights the landscape. World rules (trees sense fear) are learned through action, not dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keep the orchard/cliff from collapsing and manage Lira’s truth constraint) is clear early. Pressure tightens when fear itself threatens the roots, the branch cracks, and rain escalates; the only live option becomes a risky, belief-straining tactic: plant the eye. Agency drives the turn; the visible price is the ongoing vigilance and self-regulation embedded in her caretaker role. Stakes remain coherent and interwoven with her flaw.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of truth, belief, contraband sanctuary, and “psychological safety” integrate through concrete acts, not thesising. The smuggled relics and fungal networks refract honesty’s cost into ecology; the final glow under loam re-prices truth as a communal stabilizer rather than a market liability. Ambiguity lingers (magic vs faith vs biology) without confusion. No moralizing; resonance arises from image and consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Singular, assured first-person voice with lyrical precision and controlled cadence; diction fits a skeptical forager versed in sensory detail. Dialogue is minimal yet organic, and it moves the plot (“Plant it where the truffles cluster thickest”). Psychic distance modulates well under stress (storm beat shortens sentences). No head-hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs, with vivid yet coherent metaphors (“shattered mirror,” “chalices”). Rhythm varies and keeps momentum; little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. The lushness edges toward purple in places but remains purposeful and clear at the peak beats and closure. Mechanics are clean and copy-tight.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: empathy virus, truffle networks, an orchard that reads fear, and a saint’s glass eye weld into a coherent, fresh world. The solution grows from those logics rather than a late rule add. Risk-taking in tone and premise heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and, in hindsight, inevitable.</comment>
