<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation—to shed rehearsed roles and assume the costlier duty of witness—is clear and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (lifting the board, spelling words, arranging a circle, recounting gestures). Interiority is embodied and character‑specific (“smoke still clung to her hair like a reluctant crown”). The internal contradiction—tenderness paired with “benevolent ruthlessness”—is dramatized rather than declared. The final renunciation (STAY) credibly forecloses flight and nostalgia.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure deepens through patterned movement and ritual responses until the ending’s Earned Stasis/Charged Poise lands (“STAY”). Orientation is clean from the outset (interregnum, whispering gallery, crisis actor). The chessboard ritual and gallery’s replies escalate toward a reconfigured role with conceptual cost (self‑amputation of nostalgia). The closure is on‑page, with the final stasis charged by responsibility and endurance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and chessboard are vivid, selective, and integrated as functional setting; they shape tactics (word‑spelling walks, acoustics answering, the circle of pieces) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is tight and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. World rules (the gallery’s murmurs) remain consistent and are learned through action. The environment meaningfully frames the earned stasis rather than serving as wallpaper.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (renouncing scripted roles to become an archivist of the overlooked) tightens through ritualized attempts that gain potency (REMEMBER → FORGIVE → OBSERVE → STAY). The key cost is the commitment to “benevolent ruthlessness,” cutting away nostalgia and accepting duty. While quiet, escalation is unmistakable under the accumulative lens as the gallery’s responses grow from whispers to clear sanction. The final choice forecloses withdrawal and solitude without service.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: history erases pawns; memory and mercy must be actively constructed; small gestures anchor civilization. Symbols (missing pawns, luminous absence, traveling penumbra) shift meaning by the end as ghost‑pawns return through narrative. No sermonizing; the elegy of kindnesses supplies resonance and conceptual repricing. The final charged stasis offers a non‑literal answer about custodial memory’s cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks Mara with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control; images are purposeful and consistently filtered. The whispering “voice” of the gallery is integrated without POV leakage. Diction remains coherent with the piece’s elevated, ritualized mode. Compression and elision are taught early (patterned walking) and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, action, theme). Figurative language is controlled and internally consistent (light, absence, chess). Minor density risks never obscure causality or closure. Rhythm varies with the ritual cadence of the scene, maintaining momentum without loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A crisis actor surviving the “real crisis” framed within a whispering gallery and a pawnless chessboard feels fresh and integrated. The word‑spelling gait as ritual method is an inventive mechanism that accrues meaning. The final conceptual turn (ghost‑pawns returned by story) is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risk in tone and structure heightens stakes without confusion.</comment>
