<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s “affectionate skeptic” contradiction is vivid and enacted: she signs waivers, checks locks, then dissolves the pill and steps through. Embodied markers (behind-the-knees warmth; rib‑laughter) ground emotion and fuel micro‑choices (painting seams, circling with the brush). The encounter with the child‑self tightens the internal conflict into a choice to continue beyond safety. The cost is soft but legible: she accepts ongoing vulnerability as compass.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern density builds from shock → geode projection → somatic map → corridor → lens/circle → repricing of the recall. Orientation is crisp from line one (3:17 a.m., light painting studio, muscovite sliver). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: “recall = scarcity control,” followed by the decision to follow the tug into the city. The on‑page price is a relinquishing of safety for continued pathfinding; slightly understated but present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The studio and its tools (fiber‑optic vines, silver brush, mineral substrate) are specific and operative, not decorative. The geode‑studio system enables the projection and mapping, and the final lights snapping back charge the last beat. Sensory range is broad and purposeful (static, warmth, mirrored water). World rules are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illuminate hidden pathways—tightens when the seam folds and the corridor appears, forcing bolder tactics (painting lines, circling, sigil). Escalation is internally driven and coherent under the accumulative lens. The visible price is commitment to ongoing exposure and a redefinition of skepticism; there’s no external antagonist or sharp loss, so pressure feels exquisitely tuned but gentle. The corridor confrontation functions as the key deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Access vs. scarcity and skepticism vs. tenderness emerge through concrete actions and images (child‑self, lens, sigil) rather than lecture. The line “The recall had never been about safety; it had been about scarcity” edges toward direct statement but the surrounding images carry the weight. The final image reweights prior motifs (willowglass hope, warmth compass) without tidy moralizing. Subtext in the child’s silent charge keeps it resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyrical voice with precise, character‑plausible diction (“willowglass,” “mica windows”) remains stable under pressure. POV certainty matches experience; elisions are purposeful and paid off by the corridor sequence. Rhythm modulates well between crisp clauses and longer, breathing sentences. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; lines push momentum while layering texture. Figurative language is inventive and generally coherent; only a hint of lushness risks purple but doesn’t blur sense. No scaffold loops or template cadences; syntax varies. Opening and final lines are charged, with clean mechanics.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Telepathy residue painted onto mica to reveal empathic seams via somatic cartography feels fresh and integrated. The child‑self as intention‑mirror and the “warmth compass” are memorable turns that grow from earlier specifics. Risks in style and premise heighten coherence rather than distract. The realization about scarcity reframes the premise without deus ex machina.</comment>
