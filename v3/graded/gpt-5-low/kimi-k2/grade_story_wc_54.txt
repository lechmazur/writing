<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent—turn abandonment into possibility—and her micro-choices (aligning the sextant, rerouting conduits, feeding the vine) embody that drive. Interiority is specific and filtered through an engineer’s perception, though internal contradiction and visible struggle are muted. The endurance cost (working through the night, accepting that passengers won’t return) lands but remains subtle. The closing renunciation—resurrection over repair, reorienting goodbye into hello—feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate; the beat pattern tightens from hum → rotunda → fountain → water → vine → dawn, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of the terminal as sextant and hope as redirectable flow. Closure lands on the page (the rerouted pump, the bloom, the placed sextant), with cost present but soft (time, acceptance of loss). No causality breaks; the pressure coheres as density and pattern rather than plotted reversals.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The terminal is tactile and operative: vandalized signage, baggage belts, maintenance panels, coolant lines, and a skylight that informs alignment all shape tactics. The sextant-object-as-setting and terminal-as-sextant synthesis charges the final image. Sensory specificity is purposeful and POV-filtered, with world rules staying consistent in this lyric mode. Environment constrains and enables choices throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Stakes are dominantly conceptual—can Mara convert abandonment into life—and escalate via a deepening pattern (hum intensifies; geometry resolves; flows redirect; fountain to vine). The principal tightening comes at the rotunda/fountain where alignment enables action. Cost is more contemplative than peril-driven; the lack of a harder price keeps the category below the top band, but agency clearly drives resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Resonance arises from concrete acts that reweight prior images (terminal as sextant, water into vine), but the explicit thesis “hope is a vector that reverses loss…” states the theme too baldly late, undercutting subtext. Otherwise, motifs evolve meaningfully and the final image invites reflection without neat moral closure. The piece largely resists sentimentality by staying anchored in task and tool.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is coherent, lyrical, and character-specific, marrying technical lexicon to wonder without register slips. Rhythm modulates well from hush to hum, and psychic distance remains steady. No dialogue burdens it; free indirect texture stays clean. The diction’s patterned metaphors read taught rather than repetitive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and efficient; most sentences carry dual loads of image and function. While metaphor density is high, vehicles cohere (navigation, flows, geometry, music), avoiding mixed imagery. Minimal scaffold or loops; cadence varies with scene needs. Minor risk of purple overreach is contained by consistent system imagery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A fresh synthesis—abandoned spaceport as sextant, engineering as lyric ritual, carnival residue as ignition—feels distinctive and earned. The redirecting-flows method grounds the conceit beyond ornament. Quiet closure avoids gimmickry; only the slightly declarative thesis line tempers the sense of daring. Overall, the vision reads authentic and memorable.</comment>
