<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear motive (to understand/teach houses how to “breathe”) and consistent micro‑choices through the sanctifying ritual culminate in a credible renunciation (leaving the shard). The shift from noticer to listener lands with a felt cost (giving up role/tool). Internal contradiction is minimal, which keeps pressure gentle rather than crucible‑like. The widow beat adds a relational check but remains light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens taught early and held: object‑by‑object hush builds to the compass touch, bay stillness, and the role‑renunciation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she leaves the shard and exits as a different self. Orientation is crisp from line one; the note in her handwriting deepens rules without breaking coherence. The final cadence reweights the premise (absence as echo) on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: the bay, tide, lilacs, and streetlights form a living pressure system whose stilling marks the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑charged (violet dust, “rain inside drawers”). World rules are learned in action via objects and hush. The environment explicitly charges the final image (tide pausing mid‑breath).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes (relieve houses of noisy grief by witnessing) accumulate cleanly; the ritual’s repetition tightens toward the compass and bay‑level hush. The price—relinquishing the shard/identity—registers. Pressure is lyrical rather than adversarial, so escalation feels like deepening density more than narrowing options. Still, the widow recognition and compass beat credibly intensify the charge.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (sanctify as witness; life as echo of absence) arises from particulars—the displaced objects, widow, and hush—without sermonizing. The line “life is not the opposite of absence but its echo” risks explicitness but is earned by the houses’ voice and the ritual’s cost. The final return (children find the compass true; thunder‑lilacs) extends resonance beyond the protagonist. Complexity remains without false symmetry.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent psychic distance and sensory lexicon; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from object‑to‑object cadence to the stillness at climax. Purposeful elision (“she knew this was the first object she must sanctify”) reads as voice, not withheld info. The perceptual signature (how she notices absences) is strong and character‑specific.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean, varied syntax; images do multiple jobs (e.g., “rain inside drawers”). Occasional lushness never muddles logic; figurative network remains coherent (hush, breath, moons, tide). Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum is maintained through sentence rhythm. A few near‑purple moments are balanced by clarity and control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a “creeping normality noticer” sanctifying displaced objects with an orris shard to quiet houses’ grief feels singular. Risks in concept and diction pay off with a charged, inevitable closure image (bay’s held breath, renunciation). The ritual logic is internally consistent and reimagines haunted‑house tropes with tenderness. Emotional truth emerges without genre cliché.</comment>
