<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive is precise and persistent: to send “return” to her brother at any cost, culminating in the bead-and-puzzle sacrifice. Interiority is particular and embodied (dew, bead pulse, thimble barter), not generic. The internal contradiction—fierce hope vs. acceptance of one-way loss—registers at the end as Earned Stasis. Minor ding: her doubt and dread could tighten earlier to heighten pressure on the mid‑story choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds pressure through object recurrence and cadence, paying off with the bead completing the puzzle and dissolving into the loom-map. Closure lands on the page with cost: “She would never hear her brother’s reply.” Causality is clean across two shards (orchard → monks → orchard) with no teleports. The silence reweighted as bridge constitutes a clear conceptual repricing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard/bamboo atmosphere is vivid and consistent, filtering sensory detail through a textile worker’s bias (shuttles, warp, weft). Recurring objects (amber bead, puzzle, thimble) function as micro-settings constraining tactics and shaping the ending image. Weather and grove tone interact with agency (wind, fallen apples, monks). Slight holdback from 9+ as the physical orchard pressures less than the objects do.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early and deepens: failed couriers/pigeons → bead discovery → puzzle solution → irrevocable send. A meaningful tightening occurs when she trades the thimble and later inserts the bead, foreclosing future hearing in exchange for sending. Cost is explicit and carried forward. The escalation is gentle rather than harrowing, but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around silence remade into connection through sacrifice; the final image reweights earlier motifs (loom, roads, sap). Emotional honesty lands without sermonizing, though “the price of impossible distance was one-way hope” edges toward direct statement. Subtext resides in the tactile trades (thimble, bead) as love’s currency. The closing ordinary act (gathering apples) deepens meaning without neat moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The voice is a controlled lyric third with consistent perceptual signature (weaving lexicon, material attention). Rhythm modulates from hush to hum without head‑hopping; elisions are learned and paid off. No dialogue needed; narration carries subtext and pressure. A few heightened phrases repeat (“stoically sparkling”) but serve pattern more than bloat.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful, with images doing double duty (amber as memory vessel and message engine). Momentum holds; minimal scaffold or synonym churn; syntax varies to sustain cadence. Minor purple glints and repeated diction don’t obscure sense or action. The closure beat is crisp and unblurred by figurative overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: loom-puzzle mechanics, amber as time-stored speech, and silence reconfigured as a bridge. Each novelty grows from established motifs rather than late gimmicks. The one‑way hope cost sharpens distinctiveness. Risks in lyric density and mythic tone pay off with clarity and inevitability.</comment>
