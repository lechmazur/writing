<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (bearing witness to disappearances) evolves into a choice to plant—an earned reorientation with felt cost (“I will forget a little”). Interiority is specific and embodied (ash, crumbs, frost) rather than abstract. The tension between vigilance and the desire to uncloak plays on the page. Minor safety in calibration—she adapts smoothly—keeps it just shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the tea, bread, and seeds accrete into a charged act of planting that reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with cost (a treaty with time; partial forgetting) and a charged final image (first shoot through frost). Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is quiet but coherent. No beats contradict the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vivid and functional—setting supplies resources (seeds, sanctuary) and frames tactics (night planting in frost). Recurring objects (bread, porcelain, seeds) charge the final image. Weather and ruin tangibly shape action and tone. Specific sensory work (cardamom, moss swallowing marble) is purposeful and POV-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to bear and transform loss—tightens from witnessing to acting through guerrilla gardening. The decision to plant at the bakery site forecloses pure memorialization in favor of risky renewal, with the cost named. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the accumulative lens. A subtle cadence shift at the planting and “treaty with time” clarifies consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of sanctifying the ordinary matures through bread → seed → shoot; the final insight reweights earlier images without over‑explaining. Subtext rides gesture and exchange (offering bread, accepting seeds) and lands in a resonant answer. One line (“Absolution is not given; it is grown”) edges toward statement but is integrated by action that follows. Emotional aftereffect lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric, controlled voice with distinct perceptual signature; sensory lexicon matches the narrator’s noticing gift. Dialogue is spare, functional, and subtextual. “Heuristically gentle” slightly risks register jar but reads intentional for the keeper’s practiced mercy. POV is steady, with clean temporal control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; lines often do double duty (image and theme). Figurative language is fresh and coherent; rhythm varies and supports momentum. Minimal scaffold or loops; no muddled metaphors at the peak. Occasional elevated diction is contained and does not impede clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The “creeping normality noticer” and guerrilla gardening of grief produce a fresh synthesis; bread-as-sacrament transformed into soil praxis feels original and inevitable. Risks a quiet, non‑spectacular arc and makes it felt. Specificities (wax paper warmth, porcelain clinks) avoid template lyricism. The final shoot through frost is a precise, earned turn rather than a trope.</comment>
