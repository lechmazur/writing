<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—to listen and heal—drives each choice (investigate, gather stories, deploy the locket), rendered through tactile perception (“felt a faint vibration”). Internal contradiction is light; she meets little resistance and rarely wavers, so struggle feels cushioned. Competence is balanced by a credible, quiet cost (risking curfew; shouldering communal grief). The final act reads earned by prior listening rather than a sudden gift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive (Causal with Accumulative/Textural lyric): rumor → investigation via storytelling → locket retrieval → mailbox opening → communal reading. Orientation is clean from the opening lines, and set-ups (box welded shut; locket lore) pay off precisely. Closure lands on-page with cost: exposing sealed grief under curfew pressure and reconfiguring the courtyard’s silence. No causality gaps or convenience patches undercut the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The courtyard, sandstorm, rosemary, fig tree, and welded mailbox are vivid and used tactically; the environment hosts and shapes the ritual of listening. The mailbox and locket function as object-as-setting, constraining options and charging the final image (the locket hung on the door). Weather pressures time and mood, contrasting calm interior with roaring exterior. Detail is selective and POV-filtered, never a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unsealing the community’s grief—tightens from rumor to whisper to curfew-clock intrusion, culminating in an earned act. The sirens provide a clear escalation, and Mira chooses to proceed despite the risk. The opening itself happens swiftly once she commits; minimal pushback slightly softens cost and suspense. Still, internal/external strands braid convincingly toward the release and reading.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of listening as healing is woven through repeated, concrete acts of attention (object-listening, communal storytelling, public reading). Subtext blooms in the charged contrast between force (welded metal, soldiers, curfew) and voice (letters, whisper, names). The last sentence tips into explicit moralizing (“proving that listening—like dawn—can heal”), reducing ambiguity and subtlety at the final beat. Resonance remains, but the spelled-out thesis blunts the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close sustains a distinct perceptual signature—material-savvy, scent-forward, rhythmically varied. Diction stays consistent with Mira’s curator sensibility; brief quoted lines are purposeful. Psychic distance tightens around key actions without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Cadence modulates with pressure (sirens), maintaining clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double-duty (rosemary scent both grounds and cuts through dust). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and scene-servant, avoiding mixed metaphors. A few heightened phrasings verge on purple, yet momentum is preserved and syntax varies. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—curator who “hears” objects, a welded courtyard mailbox, a locket with “true voice” glass, and sandstorm-curfew pressure—feels fresh and coherent. Turns arise from specific premises (neighborhood storytelling as method) rather than generic plot levers. The magical register is integrated with social reality (recruitment letters, communal naming). Risk lies in the quiet, ritualistic resolution that still lands with consequence.</comment>
