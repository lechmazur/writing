<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Her motive (an encore, salvaging the collapsing timeline) is clear and sustained, and her actions—breathing life into the coin, pressing it into the tree, choosing to dance—align under pressure. The contradiction between craving applause and accepting dissolution is dramatized rather than stated. Interiority is embodied through synesthetic sensations rather than labels. The final renunciation (dissolving into motes) feels earned and costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from the coin’s thinning song to the hoop’s temporal scattering, to the tree absorption and crescendo of echoes, culminating in a charged poise: the hush before the overture is chosen and her form loosens. Closure lands with cost on the page (she lets go of being, not just the bow). Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and the piece keeps to one scene with a single stake. The pattern is taught and paid off cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard/maze is tactile and directive, funneling her to the heart-tree where the decisive act occurs. Objects-as-setting (coin, tree, apples-as-spotlights) charge the final image and constrain choice. Sensory specificity spans sight, sound, scent, even taste (cinnamon/thunder) in service of mood and stakes. World rules stay internally consistent through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit (“before the garden seals itself at dawn” and the coin’s warning), with one meaningful tightening when the minor chord signals lingering despair and she must escalate to dance and summon echoes. Agency drives the turns: she chooses the hoop, the tree offering, and the dance that transforms ovations into a knit timeline. The price—self-dissolution into dust—lands. The escalation is coherent and cumulative, not coincidental.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—performance as timecraft, memory as engine of possibility, the cost of release—without moralizing. Recurring images (coin/wheel, hush before overture, apples/spotlights) reweight meaning at the end. The final hush offers a resonant, non-literal answer: possibility requires relinquishment, not applause. Ambiguity lingers in the minor chord without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice is distinctive, synesthetic, and controlled; focalization remains steady and plausible for a stage ghost’s consciousness. Rhythm modulates with escalation, avoiding head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Purposeful elision is taught early and pays off in the closure image. No dialogue needed; the voice carries pressure and texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush but purposeful; images do double duty (world-building and pressure), with minimal redundancy. A few metaphor stacks flirt with excess, but clarity holds and cadence supports momentum, especially in the dance/echo sequence. Information density is high without loops or scaffold. The final lines are crisp and recharged by earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a synesthetic stage ghost mending a collapsing timeline in a hedge-maze orchard via echoes and a tarot coin that becomes a wheel/hoop—apples as spotlights—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, accumulative structure) heighten stakes and cohere. Turns grow from seeded rules rather than late conveniences. The final repricing of “encore” into “hush” is memorable and specific.</comment>
