<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and method are precise and embodied—she “tastes emotions,” sorts them by texture, and makes concrete micro‑choices with the mirrors. The internal contradiction is lighter; she reads as hyper‑competent with little visible falter, which softens felt risk. The cost lands via the fragment losing future‑sight, but her personal price remains largely conceptual rather than painfully dramatized. Still, actions consistently align with her core drive and reveal character under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear accumulative/textural build from mirror glimpses to a charged reconfiguration, with the treaty acceptance and the fragment’s loss as on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the motif pattern is taught early and paid off. The closure feels earned without mechanical over‑explaining. Slight softness remains in the absence of a sharp mid‑scene snag or complication.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, antique mirrors, and lantern room are vivid and purpose‑driven; the mirrors function as a tool‑setting that constrains tactics. Environmental stakes (ice, cliffs, treaty site) charge the final image with “light pooling on the ice like melted stars.” World rules are learned through action, not exposition, and the setting evolves with the ritual’s heat and retreating frost. It’s richly specific yet tightly integrated with choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: prevent a treaty rupture with real communal consequences. Escalation is a density deepening—mirrors warm, voices overlap, options reweight—culminating in a single integrated image and the merfolk’s reply. The price is present (the fragment’s sacrifice and the moral renunciation of vengeance), though the path to success faces little resistance on the page. The tightening works under the accumulative lens but lacks a hard pinch point.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece embodies “empathy mapped to action” through concrete craft (loom/shuttle mirrors) rather than moralizing, with restorative justice as the tacit stance. The final image reweights earlier shards, turning prophecy’s failure into communal attunement. A single explicit thematic echo (“when empathy was mapped onto action”) risks on‑the‑nose, but the resonance predominates through image and felt cost. Ambiguity remains where it should: vengeance is declined, not erased.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice filters perception through sensory bias and ritual precision; POV stays tight and consistent. Rhythm modulates well as pressure builds, with patterning taught and paid off; no head‑hopping or explanatory slack. The diction stays character‑plausible for this slightly elevated, fable‑adjacent register. Lyrical confidence never tips into confusion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful, with images doing multiple jobs and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language clusters are coherent (glass, ice, mirrors, fruit), avoiding mixed metaphors or loops. Momentum is maintained through syntactic variety and action‑tethered description. A hair’s breadth from purple in spots, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse orchard, merfolk diplomacy, empathy woven via salvaged mirrors—is striking and memorable. The reconfiguration of a failed prophetic tool into an empathy loom feels non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and worldbuilding pay off without gimmickry. Freshness arises from integrated particularity rather than surface novelty.</comment>
