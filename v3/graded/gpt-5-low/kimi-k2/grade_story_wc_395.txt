<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to recover Leo/what’s been erased) is clear and intensifies under the 0117 deadline; her choice to violate protocol and then go rogue reads earned. Interiority is concrete (heartbeat syncing to 117; the patch warming) rather than label-only. A flicker of convenience (the locker opening with the patch) leans magical, but her micro-choices drive each turn. Internal conflict is present but light; she leans decisively toward action with little wavering.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative finish: the 117 pattern deepens, leading causally to the locker, the drive, the lie, and the copy/forgery tactic. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she saves what she can, forecloses her role, and exits with cost. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/why) and the demolition clock imposes real pressure. The cost is legible on-page as exile/wanderer status rather than abstract sentiment.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The archive’s “chilled silence,” numbered racks, and harmonic server response are vivid and purposeful. Setting constrains choices (offline reader, evidence locker access, decommission clock) and charges the ending image (servers flicker with silhouettes). The patch functions as a micro-setting/tool that carries data into the world. Detail remains selective and POV-filtered, avoiding museum-tour clutter.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake (rescue-preserve the erased) tightens through pattern recognition → discovery → protocol breach → counter-forgery under a ticking clock. The lie and the data transfer foreclose her compliant path; the demolition crew’s arrival sharpens the cost. Pressure escalates coherently without deus ex machina. The silhouette flicker offers a brief victory tempered by loss, maintaining tension through the exit.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Memory versus deletion, song as persistence, and corporate erasure cohere through images and actions rather than moralizing. The “algorithm that harvested human longing” skirts exposition but is grounded by the lullaby motif and Leo’s line (“If the song stops, we become the silence”). The final cadence reframes deletion as migration into song, a resonant repricing. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited voice is consistent, textured, and modulates with pressure. Diction aligns with Mara’s technical-liminal role, melding tech and lyric without register breaks. Patterned images (117, song, silence) are controlled and paid off. No head-hopping or withholding artifacts undermine trust.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry momentum with high information density; figurative language is purposeful and not overstacked. Strong lines (“hive whose queen had vanished,” “silence that tasted of sensed absence”) avoid muddle. Minimal scaffold/loops; action order is clear. The final image is clean, not smothered by rhetoric.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>While some elements echo familiar SF tropes, the synthesis of social archive, lullaby-encoded memory, and numerological breadcrumbs feels fresh and coherent. The patch-as-data-jewelry and harmonic server response are distinctive touches. Risks are lyrical rather than structural, but they heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending achieves a specific, memorable stance.</comment>
