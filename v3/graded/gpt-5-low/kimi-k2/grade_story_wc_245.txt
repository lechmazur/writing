<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Desire and tactic are clear from line one, and micro‑choices (barefoot following, entering the stillpoint, naming grief) track to an embodied interiority. The blindness and tactile lexicon individualize perception without sentimentality. The final renunciation (“mapmaker no longer”) feels earned by prior beats. Slight neatness in the epiphany trims the peak: the realization borders on tidy rather than paradoxically knotted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing when she offers “grief” and reframes the quest—mapping herself with a visible cost (identity shift, acceptance of pain). The scene holds a coherent single window with one decisive tightening (melody densifies → stillpoint → naming). Orientation is clean and the causal thread within the lyric logic remains intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest, quartz trunks, and the platinum ring function as lived environment and constraint, not mere backdrop, and they charge the final image. Sensory detail is purpose‑driven and filtered through touch/sound, matching the POV’s priorities. World rules are consistent and learned in action. The setting directly shapes options (decoding vibrations, compass behaviors) and the closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (locate the stillpoint to plumb emotional depths) is signaled early, with pressure building via density and pitch of notes toward the stillpoint. The tightening beat—naming grief as the missing chord—forces a trade: accept pain to pass. Escalation is internal but coherent under the chosen lens, with a clear narrowing of options. External jeopardy is minimal, but the emotional price reads on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: cartography as self‑reckoning, language as embodied memory, grief as necessary coordinate. Recurring images (ring, notes, stillpoint) reweight at the end without moralizing. One line (“she had been mapping herself all along”) treads close to explicit thesis, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. The final image’s charge persists beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, tactile sonic voice sustains through the piece, modulating with pressure (from exploratory to hushed to reconfigured). POV certainty matches what she can sense; no head‑hopping or register drift. Lyric compression is taught early and remains legible. The cadence supports tension without collapsing into haze.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines are musical yet purposeful; most sentences do more than one job and avoid scaffolding. A few lush metaphors cluster, but they remain coherent to the sensory regime and rarely overgrow clarity. Rhythm varies and paragraphing breathes with the scene’s needs. Minor purple edges keep it just shy of the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind cartography via ultrasonic flora, a compass that points inward, and a stillpoint as temporal threshold—is fresh and specific. Risks in diction and conceit heighten meaning rather than distract. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight once grief is named as the key. The final reconfiguration is both surprising and aligned to the established pattern.</comment>
