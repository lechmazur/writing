<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—articulating long‑suppressed needs—drives concrete choices (pressing the cloudbloom, painting glyphs, singing). Interiority is embodied through tactile ritual and sensory triggers (“rain on copper”), not labels. The internal contradiction (silence vs. song) is dramatized via the ghost becoming harmony. The change feels earned with a modest but felt cost: vulnerability and relinquishing the protective silence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions accrete toward a cadence shift where silence reconfigures into song. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost turns from haunting to harmony, with the charged object closed and carried. Cost reads as the relinquishment of silence and the exposure of confessions. Orientation is clear early (courtyard above clouds, storm window), and set‑ups pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and purposeful: the sky‑raft courtyard, mist, and storm window constrain time and tone. The environment charges the final image (“a sky that listened”) and the marble dissolves into chords, tying place to transformation. The bolt plate functions as micro‑setting/tool, tactically used. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lira’s craft‑mind.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake: speak the unsaid before the thunder arrives. Escalation deepens via ritual (pressing, painting, door‑passage) to the imperative “Sing now,” which forecloses further deferral. The price—exposure and irreversible confession—charges the act of singing. The tightening is clear and protagonist‑driven under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of silence, need, and transmutation emerge organically through concrete images and repeated craft motifs. The final reweighting—ghost as harmony—offers a non‑literal answer without moralizing. Confessions as pressed flowers integrate theme with action and object. The resonance lingers with the city below humming, extending consequence beyond Lira.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric voice is consistent and character‑specific, with tinkering diction braided into music imagery. Psychic distance and certainty stay stable; the few dialogue lines carry subtext and pressure. Rhythm tightens at peak beats (“Between lightning and thunder…”) without opacity. No unearned omniscience or head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images do multiple jobs (quicksilver paint as tech and shimmer). Figurative language is rich yet controlled; metaphors align with established logic (gears, bolts, chords). Minor purple glints never blur causality or cadence. Final image is clean and earned without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: “ghost in code,” bolt‑plate floristry, and storm‑window timing feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and imagery pay off, avoiding gimmickry. The mechanical‑musical lexicon creates a distinct imaginative space. The turn from haunting to harmony is both conceptually and emotionally original.</comment>
