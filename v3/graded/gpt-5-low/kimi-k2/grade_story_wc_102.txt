<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied—she seeks the “unused love” and takes concrete, risky actions (opening the box, breathing on the tear, reaching into the image). Interiority is specific and textured, with contradictions (trembling curiosity versus fear of what she’ll uncover). Micro-choices under pressure—timed breaths, the touch through the ground glass—reveal priorities. The transformation feels earned, with the cost legible as grief uncalcifies and a prior path (rationing love) is relinquished.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breath-to-image-to-touch intensifies toward a charged reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (viaduct, camera obscura, dusk), and the closure lands on page with cost (sorrow expelled; fracture sealed with “living gold”). Beats link coherently through objects and breath rather than plot mechanics. No dropped setups; the tear’s dissolution and return as liquid light satisfy the core drive.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is not ornamental: the viaduct’s specific history, the jasmine’s responsive release, and the camera’s ground glass directly shape choices and the final image (“lens wept dew”). Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, with fog and fragrance intertwined with the breathing method. World rules (lyric-spiritual) remain consistent through action. The environment charges the ending and is inseparable from the healing act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaiming/transforming unused love) tightens via a decisive deepening: the pilgrim’s bowl crack revelation, then the touch that mends. Agency drives the turn (she chooses to breathe on the tear and to reach into the image). The felt price—relinquishing the misbelief of love’s finitude and releasing stored sorrow—is on the page. Escalation is coherent and culminates without coincidence solving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of compassion, memory, and wholeness emerge organically through image and action (breath stitching visible to invisible, liquid light sealing a fracture). However, late explicit statements (“healing was not erasure but revelation” and “every unused love waits only for breath to become light”) tilt toward moralizing and reduce ambiguity. Subtext otherwise operates strongly in object and setting interplay. The ending still resonates, but the spelled-out thesis trims the afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical POV with controlled psychic distance; the perceptual signature is distinct (optical metaphors, breath as method) and consistent. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful elision is taught by the camera/breath motif and paid off in the closure. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is vivid and musical, with images doing multiple jobs; propulsion rarely flags. The density of figurative language skirts overwriting but maintains coherence. A small artifact appears at the very end (“scenting the” truncation), and a few moments edge toward purple. Overall clarity and cadence remain strong, but the lushness occasionally crowds the air.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: camera obscura optics, breath as revelation, Kwan Yin’s tear, and a past-life pilgrim cohere into a singular vision. The touch-through-image turn feels inevitable in hindsight given the established tools. Risks (lyric mysticism, high-metaphor density) read intentional and largely pay off. The final reweighting is distinctive without gimmickry.</comment>
