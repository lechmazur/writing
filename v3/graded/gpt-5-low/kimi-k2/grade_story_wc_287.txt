<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira’s motive—tending life and “reflect[ing] light into dark corners”—is enacted through precise micro‑choices with the gauge tooth and the hummed cadence. The “protected vulnerability” is embodied (match‑flame image) and tensions her pragmatism credibly. Stakes remain intimate but clear: revive a failing heirloom rose and carry forward a legacy. Minor softness: little external counter‑pressure beyond winter; the struggle is almost entirely internal/ritual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds from the final petal’s fall to sap’s first bead to a coronet of buds, culminating in a charged final click. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she chooses to keep instilling light, accepting fragility as cost. Orientation is immediate (harbor, fire escape, night) and consistent. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially jeopardized, keeping it shy of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vividly particular (rust‑flaked fire escape, black water catching fractured moonlight) and filters through Mira’s bias. The gauge tooth functions as micro‑setting/tool that constrains action and charges the ending image. The harbor’s oar‑rhythm and hush shape tactics and tone. Minor note: the environment nudges more than traps, but integration is strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revive the rose/keep light alive) is signaled early and tightened by the “last petal” clock. Escalation arises through cumulative response—first vibration, then sap bead, then multiple canes, then buds—with Mira’s agency (humming/aligning) at each step. The visible price is chiefly endurance and risk of smothering the “match,” not a hard loss. Still, the cadence shift to dawn provides a meaningful deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around care as defiant light, inheritance (locks/garden), and the ethics of attention under darkness. Recurring images (oars’ rhythm, hush, tooth as key) reweight by the end without moralizing. The final image conceptually reprices the premise: light can be instilled, not merely measured. Slight neatness in “scatter light into every corner” edges toward explicitness but stays earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanics of locks transmuted into plant care). Rhythm modulates well from hush to listening to dawn, and backstory is anchored by concrete cues. No head‑hopping; dialogue is minimal and apt. A few high‑color metaphors cluster, but they track Mira’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and purposeful figurative language. Recurrences work as design rather than loops; no scaffold or filter stacks dull momentum. Density flirts with purple in spots, but vehicles stay coherent (locks/oars/light) and pay off in the closure image. Read‑aloud cadence supports the accumulative drive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a fire‑escape gardener using a lockmaster’s gauge tooth and oar‑rhythm to coax sap is fresh and memorable. The piece commits to its conceit without hedging and lets small stakes carry large resonance. The watchman’s silent acknowledgment and the “quivering hush” as active pressure add originality. Risk‑taking remains legible and purposeful.</comment>
