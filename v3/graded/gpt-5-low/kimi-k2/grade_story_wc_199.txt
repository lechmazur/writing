<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Elian’s motive evolves cleanly from compulsive order to decoding and finally consenting to transformation; fear vs curiosity is dramatized (“Fear pricked him—… but curiosity was stronger”). Micro‑choices (building shrines, climbing, pressing moonstone into his own skin) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Embodied specifics (walnut‑stained fingers, “mossy delight”) ground interiority without summary labels. The final renunciation of self has visible cost and reads fully earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: falling leaves/runes intensify toward the last‑leaf cadence shift. Closure lands decisively on the page with cost (body dissolves; guardianship/exile accepted). Setups (folklore, moonstone, choreography) pay off causally at the summit. Orientation is clear from the outset and sustains coherence through the transformation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor is not wallpaper: it limits access (climb), channels the ritual placements, and charges the final image. Sensory specificity (ashen bark softening to wet slate; silver‑ash storm) is selective and purposeful. Recurring objects (leaves, moonstone, seeds) function as micro‑settings that constrain choices. World rules feel consistent, learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode/accept becoming guardian—is signaled early and tightens at “only one leaf remained.” The decisive act (placing the last monument with personal skin) forecloses his human path with a clear price. Pressure grows coherently via density of signs and the hush deepening; escalation is protagonist‑driven, not coincidental. Consequences are not walked back; the outcome is irreversible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical transformation and memory arises organically from seeds, runes as choreography, and the looped constellation (seed→sprout→tree→ash→seed). The ending reweights all prior patterns without moralizing; the “next folklore” image delivers conceptual repricing. Subtext of control vs surrender plays through monuments and the arbor “dreaming into being.” Resonance lingers in the charged, quiet image of mossy laughter in the boughs.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The close third‑person voice has a distinct perceptual signature (orderly, tactile, seed‑lexicon) and modulates under pressure without slipping. Lyric diction is consistent and legible; no head‑hopping or register drift. Purposeful elision (folklore, choreography) is taught and paid off at the summit. Rhythm and syntax support turns without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet controlled; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, theme, momentum). Minor density risks never tip into muddle; images stay coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or scaffold clutter; cadence varies and accelerates toward the climax. A few ornate touches flirt with purple but remain voice‑true and clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—an aerial petrified arbor, seed choreography, moonstone runes—feels singular and fully realized. “Tiny monuments to forgotten things” is an inspired tactic that shapes plot and meaning. The final reconfiguration is inevitable in hindsight, not a trick. Bold, non‑derivative synthesis sustains emotional truth alongside high‑concept imagery.</comment>
