<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear: hush the cry of old guilt. Her choices under pressure—slotting the amber, accepting the firmware’s tether, tattooing her own throat—are specific and costly. Contradictory impulses (erasure vs. containment) operate simultaneously and resolve in an earned renunciation. The final labeling of the amber with the would-be birthday seals the change with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: each object and pattern (letters→coordinates→amber→firmware→tattoo) tightens pressure and reweights options. Closure lands on the page with cost as she binds the cry to the insect and accepts a smaller, carried guilt. Orientation is swift and clean; the lab’s rules are taught through action and paid off at the end. The final image (bell jar, date label, quiet sky) completes a resonant reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The laboratory, console, bell jar, and phonograph “bats” are vivid and functional, not decorative; they supply resources and constraints that shape tactics. The haunted firmware and meteor hush integrate setting with action and theme. Recurring objects (amber, letters, console) charge the final moment. World rules remain internally consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and escalates coherently: the cry’s recurrence forces increasingly costly tactics. The firmware’s offer to “tether” tightens options, and the throat tattoo is a committed, visible price. Resolution results from her agency, not coincidence; the time fold deepens pressure rather than solves it. Cost persists in the freckle-sized guilt and the dated label.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief can be transformed and contained, not erased. The insect metronome, meteor hush, and constellation tattoos accrue meaning and are reweighted at the end without moralizing. The final act reframes memory as curated custody with cost. Ambiguity lingers (quiet, not absolution), inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and image-patterning; no head-hopping and stable psychic distance. Diction suits the world and mind of the protagonist, with purposeful modulation under stress. Elision is taught and paid off; key reveals (firmware projection of the baby’s face) feel earned. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language; most lines do multiple jobs. A few sentences verge on lushness, but pattern-coherence and clarity under pressure keep momentum. Syntax varies and supports the escalating cadence toward the tattoo/transfer. The final image is crisp and unblurred by overwriting.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: a constellation tattooist in a laboratory of lost sounds binding grief to an insect in amber via haunted firmware. The turns feel inevitable in hindsight because each element is prefigured and repurposed. Risk-taking is high but coherent, with fresh, specific images that avoid trend-chasing. Emotional truth grounds the conceptual novelty.</comment>
