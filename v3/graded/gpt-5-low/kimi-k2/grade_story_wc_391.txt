<question>1</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—unyoking the town through a “patient revolution”—is clear and consistently enacted via moon‑tracking, cairn‑marking, and leading the vigil. Interiority is embedded in tactile choices and images (ear to ice, mirrored disks), not labels. However, she meets little real resistance; ambiguity or contradiction in her stance is minimal, keeping the emotional cost modest. The elders function more as chorus than crucible, limiting relational pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues patterned action and image (compass, moon holes, basalt shards) to a charged cadence shift when the ice speaks and the viaduct surfaces. Closure lands on the page (RR: a communal reconfiguration from panic to patience), with a conceptual price (surrendering impatience); orientation is clean throughout. Cost is felt but light—risk on the lake and social reversal are implied more than pressed.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is a live constraint: basalt sanctuary yields shards, the frozen lake’s breath and pressure dictate tactics, the buried rails’ magnetism redirects the compass and charges the finale. Sensory detail is vivid across modalities (iron scent, silver plumes, frost circles) and filtered through a mapper’s priorities. The environment materially shapes the plan and the final image. Minor note: the sanctuary’s “pillars breathing frost” is mostly tonal, not tactical.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming communal panic into patient action—is signaled early and tightens as Elara commits to the ice and convenes the town for listening. The key intensification is the on‑ice vigil: groan → crack geometry → surfacing rails; fear flickers, and her stance crystallizes. The price is mainly reputational/social risk and physical hazard, not an acute loss, so stakes read profound but cushioned. Agency drives the turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The theme (“patience sculpts”) is embodied by repeated, slow, exact acts culminating in a quiet revolution; the final image reweights prior material into communal ritual. The line “Impatience shatters. Patience sculpts.” edges into thesis‑statement, slightly flattening subtext at the peak. Elsewhere, subtext breathes through image (mirrored moons, iron mist) and the elders’ watching, which is stronger than declaration. Resonance lingers, if a touch didactic in that moment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with crisp, character‑bound noticing (“thunder wearing mittens,” “heartbeat under glass”). POV stays stable and modest; elision serves cadence without opacity. Dialogue is minimal, motivated, and functional. Rhythm modulates effectively from contemplative to ceremonial without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with fresh figurative choices and clean sequencing; lines often do double duty (world + motive). The imagery stack remains coherent and legible across the climax; no paraphrase loops or scaffold drag. Slight saturation of metaphor near the opening risks purple, but cadence and specificity keep it under control. Final lines land by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—geomancy of ice, ghost magnetism, and civic patience as revolution—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, ritualized science) pay off through integrated tactics and closure. Beats are earned by prior particulars without late rule changes. Emotional truth is quiet and specific rather than generic.</comment>
