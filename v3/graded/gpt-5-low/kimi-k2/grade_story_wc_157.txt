<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysander’s motive—smuggling living language past the Excise—is clear, embodied in concrete micro‑choices (seed under tongue, coded whisper, planting). His competence is vivid, but internal contradiction is light; he rarely doubts or pays a visible emotional price. “To stand guard over your own spark…” signals an ethos, and the mimic/pitcher‑plant beat reveals character under pressure. A deeper tug between fear and bravado would raise stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure and meaning build through planted ciphers to the citywide exhale. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure mostly lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when “every garden exhaled the same sentence,” but the final line truncation blunts cadence and cost. The price remains conceptual rather than felt, diluting the ending’s decisive snap.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The entomologist’s greenhouse is tactile, rule‑teaching, and tactically necessary (insects as carriers, pitcher plant disposal). Sensory specificity across smell, heat, and texture serves intent and character bias. The environment constrains options and charges the final image via the distributed gardens. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—getting the message past auditors—is clear and escalates via mimic arrival, sirens, and swarm. One meaningful tightening occurs as the warp accelerates under pursuit, but the protagonist faces limited risk on the page and dispatches the mimic easily. The massed auditors at the end heighten pressure, yet consequence is largely atmospheric. A sharper on‑page cost or trade‑off would strengthen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—language as living defiance versus monetized thought—emerges organically through insects, seeds, and gardens. The closing “fragrance of defiance” reprices the world’s tax logic without sermonizing, aside from the slightly on‑nose “Grow so loud they can’t hear the tax.” Recurring images (seed, question root, spiral sigil) reweight meaning at the end. The truncation steals some lingering resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive—lyric, inventive, and controlled—with consistent single‑POV focalization. Diction suits a “rogue scholar” and modulates under pressure without head‑hopping. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and subtextual. Lushness occasionally edges toward flourish, yet rhythm remains intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and economical for most of the piece; many sentences do double duty. Figurative density is high but coherent; images tend to earn their keep. However, the final line is truncated, an artifact that dampens closure impact, and a few intensifiers verge on purple. Minor repetition of motif phrasing is present but not obstructive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—taxed thoughts, insect dialects, and a living cipher propagated by gardens—is fresh and elegantly executed. Risks in concept and diction pay off with specificity (orchid mantis prayers, beetle ink, spiral that means “end/again”). Turns feel inevitable in hindsight as the city becomes a sentence. Only the softened on‑page cost and clipped ending prevent a higher tier.</comment>
