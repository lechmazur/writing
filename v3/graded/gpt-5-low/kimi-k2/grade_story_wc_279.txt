<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (to discover meaning) and a credible, embodied arc from grasping to permissive letting‑go. The tactile choices—drawing, widening the ring, palming the tile, leaving the grotto—track with her trait of reading social currents. The cost is legible when memories dissolve and silhouettes thank her for release. A slightly idealized competence (little real struggle) keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: hush pressures speech, so she argues via pattern; density increases toward the blossom/silhouette sequences, then reconfigures as she exports hush to the city. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: acceptance of unlearning and release of remembered ties. Orientation is firm from the first lines; no causality slips. Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the exit and curb scene lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The whispering grotto’s rules (hush thickening, tile flake, mist) constrain tactics, forcing nonverbal negotiation. Specific recurring objects (tile flake, chalk, mandala) charge the final image. Sensory palette is coherent and POV‑filtered (lilac mist, moth wings, bruise‑purple). World rules stay consistent and evolve with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to meet the hush on its terms—tightens as she chooses chalk over speech, widens the ring, accepts memory dissolution, and then carries the practice outside. The visible price is release of memories and abstention from speech; the payoff is agency redefined as facilitation of silence in a noisy world. Escalation is textural, not reversal‑driven, but it deepens options and cost appropriately for length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Silence, unlearning, and meaning-through-vanishing are integrated through concrete acts (chalk as language, blossom of hush, silhouettes’ silent goodbyes). The final image reweights all prior material without moralizing as she seeds hush in the city. Subtext is active—the relief in forgetting, the audience‑like hush, art that “interjects” instead of the artist. Complexity lingers without tidy closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; imagery and rhythm modulate with pressure (from grotto hush to city clatter). Diction choices (lilac, hush, moth wings) feel character‑bound and coherent. No dialogue needed; the narrative texture carries subtext and action. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High figurative density is purposeful and legible; most lines do multiple jobs (world rule, emotion, action). Minor repetition (“socially perceptive”) brushes redundancy but doesn’t bog momentum. Syntax varies and cadence supports escalation. The closing images are clean and un-muddled despite lushness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a whispering tile that translates chalk dust, an emergent hush with grammar, and unlearning as permission. Risks in diction and concept pay off with cohesive world logic and a memorable final turn. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the taught rules. The piece avoids genre shorthand and reads singular.</comment>
