<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and embodied—she promises a flawless goodbye and builds a plan from “decisive kindness.” Interiority arrives through sensory specificity (the scent of hope, the groove’s “secret smile”) rather than labels. Internal contradiction is subtle (fear vs. exhaled hope) but present. A touch more visible struggle or risk of failure would deepen the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens through layered sounds toward a Charged Poise closure: the wrist completes the missing shard as Mrs. Eland’s breath ends with the runoff hiss. Orientation is clean from the first lines and stakes are coherent. The cost—letting her own pulse complete the circle—lands on the page. The pattern taught (hymning the mundane) pays off at closure without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: skylight, window latch, oxygen hiss, and dawn not only color the scene but become instruments. The environment and objects constrain tactics and culminate in the final image (the vinyl on the warm windowsill). Sensory balance is excellent, integrating smell, sound, touch, and light. World rules stay consistent within the lyrical frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—give a flawless goodbye before death—is present early and escalates via the time pressure and the incomplete record. The tightening beats (objects yielding tones; shards trembling; missing sliver solved by her pulse) are agency-driven and foreclose alternatives. Cost is felt in the surrender of the self (pulse) to complete the song/life. The pressure remains coherent and grows without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Themes of memory, mortality, and the everyday as music emerge organically through action: “These were the true notes…” reweights the premise without moralizing. The final runoff-groove image reframes death as part of the music, a resonant, non-literal answer. Recurring motifs (scent of hope, vinyl, mundane instruments) evolve meaningfully. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality while inviting reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature sustains throughout. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from gentle cataloging to charged poise at the end) without opacity. No head-hopping or register drift; minimal dialogue is purposeful. The voice’s confidence matches the focalizer’s sensibility as a music therapist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet purposeful; images do multiple jobs and avoid muddle. Refrains like “the scent of hope” are patterned rather than redundant. Minor risk of density, but clarity holds at peak beats and the final image is crisp. Sentence rhythm varies and momentum never stalls.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Hospice ritualized as sound-making from ordinary objects, the “scent of hope,” and the pulse-as-missing-shard create a striking synthesis. The core turn feels inevitable in hindsight given the taught pattern. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring sense. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
