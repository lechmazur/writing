<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Halric’s motive—restore living beauty before the palace falls—is clear and embodied through tactile choices (assembling heirlooms, risking the egg, leaping). Interiority is specific (the silk pouch from his mother, the vial of rain), and the final renunciation of lineage/home lands as a credible cost. Internal contradiction is modest (ache vs. action) rather than deeply conflicted. Still, his turn reads earned and character‑particular.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: the stalactites’ progressive failure creates a ticking clock, Halric assembles a ritual, revelation reframes “flawed genesis,” and the leap triggers world reversion. Closure is on‑page via Decisive Change with felt cost (the palace/line ending) and a charged final image (sparks restoring wild color). Setups (egg, artifacts, cranes) pay off coherently. The slightly truncated last line is a cosmetic slip, not a structural wound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The suspended palace and moaning stalactites are vivid, specific, and materially constrain choices; their failure forces immediacy and shapes the climax. Objects-as-setting (egg, music box, rain vial, amber feather) are integrated into action rather than toured. The environment evolves with events (stalactites crack → waterfall, cranes fold into ivy). Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, particularly in the valley’s mechanical-to-organic transformation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (life vs. obedient mechanism), and pressure tightens via the anchors cracking and the imminent fall. The assembling ritual and the apparition’s admonition deepen rather than reset stakes, leading to a committed leap that carries real loss. The cost is visible (abandoning the palace/role) and the consequence reshapes the world. Escalation is clean without coincidence bailing him out.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of chosen beauty vs. trapped “preservation” are earned through particulars (artificers’ equations, egg, rewilding sparks) and culminate in a resonant image of wild color reasserting itself. However, the line “Beauty cannot be commanded… It must be chosen” states the thesis too explicitly in the final act, slightly flattening subtext. The conceptual repricing of “progress” lands despite that. Emotional aftereffect lingers through the waterfall and sister’s laughter.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close maintains a coherent perceptual signature—precise, image‑forward, and sensitive to pressure—and modulates rhythm as tension rises. Minimal dialogue is purposeful and charged. POV boundaries hold; inference reads as inference. Diction is elevated but fits the fable‑like register of the piece.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with varied rhythm; images are often doing multiple jobs (world, mood, theme). A few intensifiers verge on purple, and the explicit thesis line plus the final fragmentary sentence nick the finish. Still, momentum holds and syntax remains clear through peak beats. No significant loops or scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a suspended crystal court, clockwork ecology, heirloom‑ritual science, and a choice‑driven rewilding feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The transformation hinges on character agency rather than a gimmick. Recurring motifs (music box, rain, feather, cranes) reconfigure with surprising specificity. It risks lush fabulism without losing clarity.</comment>
