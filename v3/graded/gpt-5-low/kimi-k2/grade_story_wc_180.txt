<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mender’s desire to repair both orchard and relationship is specific and embodied (copper nails, prism, ribbon), and her reactions—heart buckling at the mother‑face of leaves—feel earned. Contradictory impulses surface (craft‑competence vs. grief/guilt), though they’re more implied than dramatized in direct friction. Key micro‑choices (healing the graft, tying ribbon to memory, releasing vows) align with motive and carry cost. The daughter’s on‑page presence at the end adds relational pressure without diluting single‑POV coherence.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: climbing → mending → memory fruit → reunion → vows released → communal thaw. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the vow‑song and ribbon linking reweight the breach into “sweet rot” with a felt cost (memories surrendered). Orientation is crisp from the outset (cathedral‑orchard, who/why). No causality slips; each image earns the next and narrows options toward the silent duet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard‑cathedral isn’t postcard décor; it dictates movement (branches as scaffolding), offers resources (pear‑memories), and embodies law (contract with trees). Tools and objects (bag, prism, nails, ribbon) are integrated into the space’s logic and charge the final image. Sensory specificity—sap like hot wax, rain on old stone—serves urgency rather than catalog. World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early: mend the breach and the bond. Pressure coheres and tightens through the climb and the graft‑healing turn, culminating in the on‑page choice to release vows via song, which forecloses hoarding memory. The daughter’s “uncertain sparrow” presence crystallizes the need to act without speech. The cost is legible and the trade‑off (memory for reconciliation/community thaw) charges the ending.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme accrues through particulars: memory as fruit, promises as deciduous vows, and the closing graft metaphor. The realization that wisdom is graft not bridge is explicit but earned by what precedes and reweights all prior images. Subtext of inherited harm and communal complicity registers without sermonizing, culminating in a transformation rather than erasure of breach. The final communal warmth extends the mother‑daughter arc into social resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical single‑POV voice with consistent diction and rhythmic control; the “quartz‑eye” sensibility shapes perception without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision and image‑logic are taught early and maintained to closure. No unearned omniscience; knowledge is discovered through tactile engagement. The lullaby moment leverages silence as action rather than expository dialogue.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line work is dense but disciplined; images carry multi‑functions (emotion, world‑rule, plot) with minimal redundancy. Metaphoric texture (“soldered the bark with accidental wisdom”) stays coherent to the orchard‑craft lexicon. No scaffold loops or cadence monotony; sentences vary and propel. The heightened lyricism never blurs sequence or cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard‑cathedral contract and memory‑as‑fruit economy feel singular, with tools (prism, copper nails, eye‑ground lens) recombined in fresh ways. Turns are inevitable in hindsight under the taught rules, especially the vow‑song as literal payment. Emotional truth rides the strangeness rather than hiding behind it. The piece takes aesthetic risks that heighten stakes and remain legible.</comment>
