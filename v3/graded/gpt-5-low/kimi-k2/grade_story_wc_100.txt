<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elias’s vocation and “inadvertent stubbornness” motivate a clear through‑line from pier to ledger, culminating in the earned, costly micro‑choice to write his own name. Interiority is lean but specific—recognitions of the lost and his refusal to let memory go unrested. The hesitation before inscribing himself provides credible internal conflict at the peak. A slightly deeper embodied emotional texture under pressure could lift this further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: package → pier → descent → book → names → self‑inscription → lens shatters → lighthouse relights → collapse → return. Closure lands with cost on the page (the lens sacrificed, the library collapsing, his own name entered), and the end state reconfigures stakes for the village. Orientation is crisp from the first line, and scope stays within a focused single‑POV arc. Hybrid drive leans causal at the end and holds without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater library and the broken lens are vivid, tactile, and rule‑consistent; details are purposeful (coral‑and‑bone stairs, barnacled domes, blank pages that bloom under the lens). Environment and object constrain choice and charge the finale (beam through the dome, library collapse, lighthouse rekindled). Sensory selection fits urgency, keeping the lyric from becoming a museum tour. The final image is inseparable from the place and tool.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around answering silent distress by naming the unburied, escalating to the irreversible act of adding his own name. Each step narrows options (descent, opening the sealed book, committing to inscription) and carries a legible price (lens fracturing, the library’s collapse). The tightening is efficient and protagonist‑driven. Stakes remain focused and unfragmented throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, duty, and answering quiet signals accrue through concrete acts, with the lens transforming absence into address. The last image—lighthouse guiding the lost—reweights everything with earned resonance. However, the explicit thesis line “Some signals are meant to be answered” edges into thematic echo/moralizing in the final paragraph, slightly dulling subtext. Despite that, the piece avoids sentimentality and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, assured lyric third‑person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual bias (undertaker’s ledgered regard for names and rests). Rhythm and diction flex to pressure without losing clarity; patterned images (silence, light) are controlled. Minimal dialogue is placed for effect. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—world‑building, momentum, and motif—with few redundancies. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and grounded in established images (light, books, sea), avoiding mixed metaphors. Syntax varies and keeps propulsion through peak beats (opening the book, writing names, collapse). Minor density spikes never obscure action.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—an undertaker answering “silent” distress by restoring a lighthouse through an underwater library ledger—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Familiar elements (lighthouse, lost at sea) are transformed by specific tactics and costs. The self‑inscription turn is elegant and grounded. Risk is taken in the bold, mythic logic, and it holds.</comment>
