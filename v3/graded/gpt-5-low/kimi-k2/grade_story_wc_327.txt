<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and compelling—she’s the last speaker executing a charged inheritance—and her micro‑choices (entering the tunnel, naming textures, lifting the diamond) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile translation rather than abstract labels. The primary limitation is a relative lack of contradictory impulses or visible internal friction under peak pressure. The endurance/renunciation at the end (ordinary words, cooled copper) reads earned and costs her something intimate.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: a steady intensification toward the diamond‑mediated murmuration translates into sound, culminating in the crystallized final note and collapse. Closure is on‑page with cost: the language dies, towers crumble, the diamond heals, and her voice loses ancestral charge. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and each beat coheres causally within the chosen poetic logic. The grandmother seed cleanly pays off in the final act of listening/translating.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The canyon, bone towers, and tunnel aren’t postcard detail; they shape acoustics, constrain tactics (moon‑shaft positioning, resonance), and determine outcome (absorption and collapse). The diamond functions as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the translator’s priorities (texture→sound). World rules stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve a dying language’s texture) is clear, with a live clock (“die with the sunset,” “Tonight the last speaker was herself”). Escalation arrives as density: from tactile phonemes to aerial grammar culminating in a single bird/sentence and the final syllable. The price is legible—the language’s death and her loss of ancestral resonance—even as she preserves its pattern. It’s a quiet conflict without reversals, but the tightening cadence and narrowing options read earned under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Inheritance, translation, and the ethics of preservation vs. loss emerge through concrete acts (texture→sound, murmuration→grammar) rather than thesis. The diamond’s curse reframed as instruction offers a resonant thematic pivot. The ending reweights the premise: salvation is pattern, not survival; what’s saved costs what was living. Ambiguity lingers without confusion, inviting reflection on what “saving” language means.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric voice is distinctive, precise, and stable in POV, with rhythmic control that flexes as pressure builds. No dialogue is needed; the perceptual signature (synesthetic translation, attention to texture/air) is consistent. Diction stays within the piece’s aesthetic without register slips or unearned omniscience. Elision is purposeful and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; metaphors are fresh and coherent to the story’s logic (bone towers as syllables, fracture as mouth). Minimal scaffold or repetition, and sentence rhythm varies to suit beats. The prose verges on lush but avoids purple excess by staying action‑linked and sensorially grounded. The final line lands with clarity and charged restraint.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: diamond‑fracture phonology, bone‑architecture linguistics, and avian grammar cohere in a non‑obvious, inevitable feeling design. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Beats arise from established images (curse→instruction; murmuration→syntax) rather than late rule changes. The result feels singular and memorable.</comment>
