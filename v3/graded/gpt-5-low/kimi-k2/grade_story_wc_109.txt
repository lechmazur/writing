<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and enacted: she aims to map the endless night and pursues it through tactile, specific choices (line, spiral, circle, dot, legend). Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and the gold-leaf ritual, though contradictory impulses are minimal; she rarely wavers. The sleeve-tearing and the whispered “Go” register cost and agency. Slightly narrow emotional range keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of “silence-mapping” intensifies to the dot that spreads to black and the star’s extinguishing. Closure lands on the page with cost—she says “Go,” the last star dies, and the world enters absolute dark, reweighting all prior mapping. Orientation is clear from the opening and never slips. The price (end of light) is undeniable, and the final image is reconfigured by that cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fort, storm, parapet, and sea are vivid and integrated, not scenic wallpaper; wind and lightning pressure the ritual, and the hush sealing pages materially matters. Object-as-setting (booklet, gold dust) charges the final image. World rules are learned through action (hush preserves, absorbs echoes) and remain consistent. The environment constrains and enables choices in ways that shape closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: complete the map before the last star goes. Escalation is a steady tightening via accumulating silences, the legend, and the central dot that turns the page to black; the whispered command triggers the irreversible ending. Cost is paid in-world (light lost), with smaller personal costs (sleeve, stamina). Pressure is coherent if largely internal and time-driven, not adversarial.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory vs. forgetting, the cartography of absence, guidance after endings. Recurring images (gold, spiral, circle, hush) shift meaning at the end when the star dies and the map glows as counter-light. No moralizing; resonance lingers as a conceptual repricing of “silence” into navigational value. The traveler vision extends stakes beyond the scene without breaking the lyric compact.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature—sensory hierarchy, material tactility, ritual diction. Distance is steady and apt; elisions are purposeful, with payoff in the closure image. The one spoken word is earned and potent. Rhythm modulates to match pressure without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly precise; metaphors cohere within a taught pattern (ambered/marbled/velvet hush) and carry action. Information density is high and sentences do multiple jobs. Slight risk of over-saturation in imagery, but momentum holds and clarity at closure is sharp. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: mapping silences with gold leaf at the end of starlight, an oracle whose command extinguishes the last star, and a hush that physically intervenes. The final reweighting (darkness as navigable via a map of absence) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and concept heighten stakes without obscuring readability. Distinctive vision beyond template fantasy or lyric tropes.</comment>
