<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (to mend ruin) drives embodied choices—placing the plate, sleepless walking, the chant. Interiority is lyric but character‑particular, and the shift from sleepwalking to “both eyes open” reads as earned. Internal contradiction is present but subtle (surrendering the treasured plate vs. need to reweave). A deeper on‑page tug‑of‑war under peak pressure could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated night journeys, object recursion, and the spiral culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (stone boat, sealing labyrinth, water’s return). Costs register (time, surrender of the plate, labyrinth closing). Orientation is strong early, and causal links are legible via pattern intensification. The final sentence truncation (“planted the orchid seed in a”) slightly mars the closure cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The red‑canyon labyrinth is vivid, sensorial, and integral; it functions as loom and constraint, reconfiguring space and options and charging the final images (closing walls, refilling tide pools). Recurring objects (orchids, thread, plate/boat) are spatially coherent and purposeful. Sensory balance and POV‑filtered detail sustain tone without museum‑tour excess. High integration without disorientation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find a pattern to mend unraveling) intensifies through ritual escalation: warming plate, nautilus corridor, revealed seam, chant, canyon’s response. The trade‑off of sacrificing the plate for the stone boat and the labyrinth’s gentle sealing constitutes a credible price. Escalation is accumulation/pattern‑break rather than adversarial reversal, consistent with the lens. Slightly soft on immediate jeopardy, but the cost is felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of reweaving, broken precedents, and memorial repair emerge organically through action and image (labyrinth as loom; phoenix/seed reversals). The final reweighting (stone boat + seed; water returns) answers the core question without sermonizing. One line edges toward explication (“knew the path from ruin to reverence”), slightly thinning subtext. Overall resonance lingers and feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a distinct lyric signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and character‑filtered. Psychic distance is steady and modulates with pressure; no head‑hopping. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext in images. The clipped final line nicks rhythmic closure but not POV integrity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and mostly precise, with strong image economy and momentum through variation. Occasional purple density skirts overload but stays coherent. The truncated final sentence is a notable line‑level fault at the close, dulling the cadence. Otherwise, high information density with minimal scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis—labyrinth as loom, sewing via footsteps, plate becoming stone boat—feels distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. Mythic motifs (phoenix, seed) are reinterpreted through specific, tactile beats. Risks in lyric structure pay off under the accumulative lens. Minor familiarity in a few metaphors keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
