<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (“uproot the spell that petrified beauty”) and embodied fear/resolve interplay drive choices, especially when she converts fear into signal. Contradictory impulses (hesitation vs. commitment) are dramatized rather than told. Micro-choices—stepping forward, increasing tempo, funneling fear—align with her ethos. The cost registers in the pendant’s loss and the risky stance on the dissolving bridge.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal beats inside an accumulative lyric: heart‑signal → statues falter → guardians escalate → climactic pulse frees them. Closure lands on the page with cost: the shell splits and crumbles, the bridge dissolves, and the orchard reconfigures. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and pressure coheres. The final conceptual repricing (“beauty decides to stay”) is earned by the on‑page change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the fragile sky‑bridge and patrolling statues physically constrain tactics and timing. Details evolve with action (iron fruit regaining blush, bridge becoming rain) and charge the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through use (heart rhythms threading through seams). The locust shell and violin act as micro‑settings that shape choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible and escalates: free the orchard before statues shatter the span. The tower of guardians and “seconds” beat is a concrete tightening that narrows options. Resolution is the protagonist’s risky conversion of fear into a single soft note, paying with her talisman. Costs and consequences carry forward in the reconfigured orchard and lost shell.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of fear/transformation and gentleness as power arise organically through action, motifs (iron to blush, verdigris to clover), and the heart‑signal method. The “gap between knowing and understanding” is defined a touch explicitly but is earned by the preceding struggle. The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing. Subtext of consent/choice in the statues’ slowing adds depth.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction coheres under pressure. Rhythm modulates well from hush to urgency at the tower beat. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. Elision is purposeful and paid off through tactile anchors (bow, shell, glass).</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with high information density and purposeful imagery. A few repeated qualifiers (“resonantly soft”) risk mild echo but function motif‑wise rather than padding. Syntax varies and carries momentum cleanly into the climax. No figurative muddle or scaffold that dulls closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: heart‑rhythm signaling via a locust shell in an orchard where statues ironize fruit feels singular. Turns are earned from established rules, not late conveniences. The dissolving bridge into rain and “statues choose to slow” reframes familiar liberation tropes. Risk‑taking in lyric texture heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
