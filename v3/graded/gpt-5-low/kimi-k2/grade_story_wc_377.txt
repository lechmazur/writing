<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—he seeks to “preserve the color of wonder”—and his choices (offering the bronze petals; catching and carrying the tear) align under pressure. The seasonally mute trait meaningfully shapes his stance as a listener-creator. Internal contradiction (preserve vs. let wonder stay wild) is present and resolved as partnership, not possession. Slightly low friction—the ritual mostly succeeds—keeps this shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds as images intensify from construction to color-sphere to tear; the cost (ice fragment spent, deepened silence, gift of petals) is legible. However, the final line truncates mid‑action (“he opened the sealskin; the tear rose, hovered”), reopening stakes and muddying closure. Prior charged-poise beats nearly land Earned Stasis, but the unfinished final beat undercuts on‑page closure. Orientation and coherence are otherwise strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff, wind, and clouds are tactically integral: wind powers the kinetic sculpture; droplets orbit in the thin air; auroras play on his face. Object-as-setting (ice fragment, bronze petals) evolves and charges the final images. Sensory detail is vivid without museum‑tour excess, and world rules stay consistent. The truncated end keeps the final tableau from fully sealing a 9+.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and escalates via pattern-deepening: construction → activation → sphere → offering → capture. The trade of bronze petals for the sphere’s acceptance is a true tightening with cost; the fragment’s dissolution is another. Tension operates through quiet agency rather than antagonism and works for this mode. The clipped last line blunts the peak cadence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—preservation vs. surrender; truth as resonance rather than speech—emerges through concrete acts and image (bells tuned to honesty; duet with wonder). The “duet” line risks explicitness but is supported by prior particulars. The final beats reweight the premise toward partnership and stewardship instead of capture. The abrupt cutoff reduces the lingering resonance that the piece otherwise earns.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical perceptual signature with controlled diction and rhythm; the mute listener’s sensibility anchors every line. POV remains steady and confident; no head‑hopping or register slips. Compression and image‑driven narration are taught early and sustained. Only the unfinished final sentence mars the otherwise impeccable control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely precise; images carry multiple jobs and rhythm varies well. No significant scaffold or synonym loops; figurative language remains coherent. However, the final sentence is truncated, a technical/line‑level fault at the closure beat that dulls impact. Minor density spikes skirt purple but stay intelligible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a bell tuner harvesting “ancient blue” from a singing iceberg via honesty‑tuned bells is striking and memorable. The risk—the accumulative, wordless symphony replacing dialogue—feels authentic rather than gimmicky. Turns grow organically from the premise (trade of petals; tear on tuning fork). The incomplete ending keeps this just shy of extraordinary.</comment>
