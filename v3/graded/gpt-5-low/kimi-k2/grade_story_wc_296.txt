<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (confront the lie and recover the conjurer) and escalates credibly as she chooses to plant the seed and then to bleed into the bloom. Interiority is specific and embodied—thorns, frost‑numbed fingers, iron‑and‑apple scent—avoiding label‑only emotion. Her contradiction (finder of lost things who refuses her own reflection) is dramatized and resolved at cost. The final renunciation of “armor of silence” reads earned by prior choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: failed trick → lake/ice conditions → seed planted → confession extracted → blood price → vortex slows → conjurer returns. Orientation is immediate (druid, cursed lake, aftermath) and held in a single scene. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change and felt cost, and the final image reconfigures options (bridge, two reflections). No teleports or soft resets; the planted setups all pay.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The orchard vortex, mirror‑trunks, thin ice, and “warlike moon” are vivid and specific, filtering through the druid’s sensibility. Environment constrains choice (thin ice center, hairline crack for the seed) and charges the final image (expanding circles becoming a bridge; trunks reflecting two). World rules are learned through action without dumps. Sensory balance (sight, touch, scent, sound) supports atmosphere without drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: admit the truth or remain cursed and alone. Pressure coheres and tightens when she commits to planting the seed, then doubles down by feeding it blood, foreclosing the path of continued denial. The visible price is unmistakable (thorns, public confession) and the turn earns the conjurer’s return. Tension threads sentence‑ to scene‑level without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of truth, reflection, and the cost of love emerge from concrete events (the seed “eating” a lie; mirrors refusing her) and culminate in a reweighted final image. Subtext is largely carried in images (amber confession, withering plant), avoiding sermonizing. One on‑the‑nose line—“I found what mirrors don’t show”—edges toward thematic echo but doesn’t derail resonance. The ending offers a non‑literal answer with lingering complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close holds steady; diction and rhythm suit the mythic register. Minimal dialogue lands with subtext and restraint, distinct enough to mark the conjurer’s presence. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress, and inference remains within the POV’s knowledge. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and propulsive; figurative language is rich but coherent to the world (mirrors, ice, roots, amber). No scaffold or paraphrase loops; sentences vary in rhythm and job. A few intensifiers risk purple but remain controlled and legible, especially in peak beats. The last line cleanly recharges prior motifs without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—a confession made botanical and predatory, ice mapping path, mirrors refusing reflection—feels fresh and purposeful. Familiar beats (confession → return) are transformed by specific images and tactics (feeding the bloom; amber tear). Turns are earned from earlier particulars with conceptual integrity. Bold tonal choice (“warlike serenity”) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
