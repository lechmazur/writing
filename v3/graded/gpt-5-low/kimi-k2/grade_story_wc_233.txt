<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and urgent (astronomers’ warning; climb to unravel dreams), and the internal contradiction (disenchanted ruler vs. longing for reconciliation) is embodied in concrete beats. The child‑self encounter externalizes conflict without feeling like a gimmick. The choice to take the flame into her chest reads as a credible renunciation of earlier ambition. Slight neatness in the emotional landing trims the edge of mess that might deepen cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure coheres through patterned images (lace, ember, bleeding starlight) to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single scene escalates cleanly to the grotto ritual and the sky’s repair. Closure lands on the page with cost—she reprices the crown and ambition, and releases the firefly. A hair shy of 9 because the external world‑ending threat resolves swiftly once the method is invoked, making the cost feel primarily internal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated—basalt stairs, quartz seam, ember grotto, and cobalt balcony all shape mood and movement. Environment constrains choices (the climb, the cave as locus of ritual) and charges the final image (release from the balcony; grotto cooling). Sensory craft is selective and character‑filtered. One could wish for a single concrete hazard or constraint in the grotto to further pressure tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (sky’s imminent unraveling vs. queen’s inner fracture), and pressure tightens from balcony to cave to ritual. The decisive act—embracing rather than resisting the spark—forecloses a path (conquest) with visible reweighting of status. Costs are mostly internal; external danger abates without counter‑force testing her commitment post‑choice. Nevertheless, escalation reads as coherent and protagonist‑driven under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of reconciliation with the self, power redefined as mercy, and memory as binding thread emerge organically through images (lantern/fall vs. firefly/ascend). The “lace” motif revalues itself at the end, and the crown’s burden shifting to blessing is earned. A couple of explicit lines (“the true miracle was smaller”) verge on stating the thesis. Subtext otherwise carries the weight through image and act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—mineral heat, frost breath, and “bleeding starlight”—is consistent and controlled. Rhythm modulates well between climb, pause, and ritual; diction suits the queen’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparing and charged (“Carry the spark or be carried by it”). No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; most lines do more than one job (image, mood, and causality). The figurative fabric is lush but coherent, with recurring vehicles (embers, lace, violet flame) rather than scattershot metaphors. Momentum rarely stalls; sentence variety supports cadence shifts. Minor risk of saturation is kept in check by clear action beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The firefly “shared exhale” ritual and bleeding starlight as literalized threat feel fresh, and the child‑self encounter is transformed by tactile method rather than abstract counsel. The final revaluation (ambition to mercy) feels inevitable in hindsight via seeded images. The queen trope is personalized through specific tactile memory (failed lantern) and geology‑rich setting. Strong, singular synthesis without gimmickry.</comment>
