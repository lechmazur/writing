<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, embodied desire (escape claustrophobia; savor silences) drives choices: leaving the doll as anchor, later muting the alarm, and teaching her father. Contradictory impulses (yearning for vastness yet returning to bunker; collecting hush as survival tool) read as textured, not neat. The father–daughter dynamic sharpens motive in “Teach me,” shifting status credibly. The change is earned with visible costs (sacrifice of the doll, risk under the one-hour inversion).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silences accrue, reweighted at closure when the doll becomes a bridge and the father a “gardener of hush.” Orientation is crisp from the outset (bunker, inversion hour, trellis). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—she foregoes the object as a tether and redefines silence as agency, carried back into drills. A live clock (“the hour is almost gone”) provides tightening without breaking the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the xenial trellis, inversion hour, maintenance shaft, and bunker all constrain options and tactics. Objects-as-setting (porcelain doll, trellis threads) directly shape choices and the final image. Sensory specificity (tasting silences like teas; cloud bells; ozone) feels motivated by Lira’s perception. World rules (gravity inversion, rooted silence) are learned through action and stay consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (carrying quiet to survive and transform bunker life) tightens via the time limit, the sacrifice of the doll, and the test of muting an alarm. Escalation is accumulative: gathering flavors → applying them under duress → teaching the father → years-later reconfiguration. Costs are gentle but legible (leaving the doll, the constrained window, emotional exposure in teaching and weeping). Resolution arises from Lira’s agency rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres: silence as presence, inheritance reworked from bunker survival to shared grace. The final image reweights all prior motifs without moralizing—father transformed from builder of walls to gardener of hush; the doll becomes bridge. Subtext in “salt and forgiveness” and “gravity optional” lands with emotional honesty. The piece invites reflection on trauma, restraint, and chosen tenderness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent close focalization; diction and rhythms suit Lira’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse yet decisive and subtextual (“Teach me” pivots status and intimacy). Elision is purposeful and paid off in the years-later shard. No head-hopping or register slips undermine the effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet disciplined; images do double duty (flavoring silence as tactic). Minor risk of purple is kept coherent by consistent metaphor logic (“intangibly tangible” reprises cleanly). Rhythm varies and momentum holds through the lyric density. No loops, scaffold, or muddled figuratives blunt the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: gravity inversion as hour of harvested hush; silence tasted and stored; doll-root bridge—fresh, integrated, and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric surrealism, invented physics) serve character and theme, not gimmick. Turns arise organically from established rules and desires. The final reconfiguration feels both surprising and earned.</comment>
