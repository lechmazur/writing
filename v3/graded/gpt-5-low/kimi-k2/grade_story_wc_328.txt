<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Vale’s motives (protect/find Orion; decode the missing) are clear and intensify as the phone surges, culminating in the choice to fuse arrowhead and phone and accept a mission. Interiority is embodied and specific (frost on ladder rungs; arrowhead as “private planet”), with tension between bitterness and wonder. Micro‑choices under pressure are distinct and revealing (listening, laughing, pressing the flint, etching coordinates, leaving the garden). The transformation into “both researcher and cryptid” feels earned with a felt cost rather than a tidy fix.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of phenomena builds (static → child’s voice → gravity play → metamorphosis) to a charged closure. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—“We were never lost, only rewritten”—paired with Vale’s mission and altered state. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the prior life, the garden collapses into a dewdrop, and she carries “frostbitten hope.” Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when), and the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underground garden and tools are tactile, lived‑in, and evolve with the action (frost, bioluminescence, gravity shifts). Recurring objects (phone, arrowhead) function as micro‑settings that constrain choices and decisively charge the ending image. World rules are learned through event (static as conduit; gravity bending) and remain consistent as stakes rise. The final skyline orbit of droplets is an environmental payoff that reframes the city and the mission.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving/redefining Orion and the missing—tightens through one meaningful deepening as Vale chooses to enact the fusion and then to leave with a charged mission. Pressure escalates coherently via pattern intensification (sound → metamorphosis → cosmic reweighting). The cost and narrowing of options are evident, though external antagonism is minimal. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve outcomes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of rewriting loss, translating grief, and turning bitterness into a cosmic joke arise organically from events and images (frost, orbiting scents, etched coordinates). The “harmony untamed” recurs and reweights meaning at closure without sliding into sermonizing. One line explicitly states the mission, slightly on‑the‑nose, but it’s earned by the scene’s prior pressure. The ending’s conceptual repricing lingers with layered ambiguity rather than a moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single, confident lyric POV with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm stay consistent as intensity rises. Patterned uncertainty is taught early and remains legible through closure. Dialogue is minimal but pointed (child’s voice line) and functions as action. Modulation under stress reads controlled without head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is lush but purposeful; images carry multiple jobs (world rule, emotion, escalation) with minimal redundancy. Metaphor density is high yet coherent, rarely straying into muddle; momentum is maintained through syntactic variety. No scaffold loops or template cadences blunt the peak beats. A few ornate stacks brush the edge of excess, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of cryptid research, underground herbalism, and gravity‑bent metamorphosis creates a singular vision. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (arrowhead toy → promise → key/stylus), and the phone’s evolution is ingenious and earned. Risk‑taking in tone and image heightens stakes without obscuring sense. The final orbiting droplet constellation is both surprising and inevitable.</comment>
