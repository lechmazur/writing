<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied: a deaf former composer aims to “translate silence into music,” and every micro‑choice (setting the camera, signing to the tide, stepping into the water, refusing to look back) flows from that drive. Interiority is textured through tactile, idiosyncratic perception rather than labels. The joyful sorrow contradiction is dramatized, not asserted, especially in the underwater conducting beat. Minor note: the “quietly charismatic” trait influences tone more than choices.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the scene coheres: ritual → intensification of signing → immersion → resurfacing and departure, with the harbor’s answering hush as the cadence shift. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: an earned stasis/charged poise where he accepts anonymity and carries the music forward. Cost is legible on the page (“Listen when I am gone,” footprints fading, no look back). Orientation is clean from the first lines; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The harbor is vivid and integral: moonlight, bollards, ladder, hull slaps, and the gull all fold into the music‑making. The camera as micro‑setting/object constrains ritual tactics and charges the final image. Environment shapes choice (descending the ladder, submerging) and the ending’s charge (harbor holds its breath). Detail is selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether he can make silence sing and be held by a world that’s forgotten him; pressure coheres and deepens as he escalates from signing to immersion. The meaningful tightening is the descent into the water and the final arpeggio, which forecloses the path of looking back. The price—enduring anonymity and choosing forward motion—lands in the departure beat. No antagonist is needed; internal and environmental pressures suffice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory, erasure, and art after loss emerge organically through image systems (camera without film, requiem/lullaby, footprints fading). Thematic statements are embodied in action, not preached; “He signed the word for ‘remember’” earns its weight via prior beats. The final image reweights prior material without a tidy moral. Ambiguity lingers productively: is legacy possible if unnamed?</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is controlled and coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature tied to silence and music. Rhythm modulates well, accelerating with the signing and breathing with the resurfacing. No head‑hopping or stance drift. A clipped final word is a minor distraction to cadence but doesn’t break POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is strong, with high information density and purposeful metaphors that mostly cohere to music/water. A few stacked figuratives skirt purple but remain controlled. The truncated last word (“metronome that tick”) is a noticeable artifact in the final third that dulls the closing cadence. Otherwise, momentum and clarity hold without looped scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a deaf composer inventing a sign language for wind and water, using a film‑less camera as ritual metronome to map silence. Risks in form and diction pay off under an accumulative design and a quiet but potent closure. Recurrences (camera, moon, harbor’s breath) reconfigure meaning without gimmickry. Only a minor line artifact keeps it from the highest band.</comment>
