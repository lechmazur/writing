<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive and methods are specific and embodied—choosing paths by marble memory, arranging and polishing them, burying the split one. The queen’s skepticism supplies relational pressure that reframes Lira’s actions without stealing agency. Internal contradiction is subtle (tender deception vs. pragmatic ritual) rather than overt, keeping tension quiet. The visible cost—leaving the split marble buried—lands, though struggle remains mostly serene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual stories and polishing build toward the wisteria’s revival and the device’s fracture. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: “Gardens keep their own accounts,” the queen’s belief shifts, and the cracked marble’s burial sets a price. Orientation is clean from the opening. The cost is legible on-page (device breaks; a deception remains buried) without mechanical explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The maze and its living architecture constrain choices (forks, shifting vines, the maze shortening) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered; marbles function as a micro-setting that inflects action. The world’s rule—measurable luck—integrates through the queen’s device, not exposition. The closing cascade of petals, device buried in bloom, reweights the space with consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear early: disprove “statistical indifference.” Pressure coheres and tightens via the ritual intensifying until the device silences, spikes, and cracks—the concrete reversal. The cost and option-foreclosure are present but delivered in a gentle register; Lira never truly risks failure beyond belief. Still, the burial choice and device rupture make the escalation feel earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Memory vs. measurement and care vs. control are dramatized through marbles, stories, and the cracked device—not asserted. “Some deceptions…must stay in the earth” reframes truth as sustained, costly tending rather than confession. The aphoristic final line risks neatness but is earned by particulars and charged images. Thematic counterweight (luck’s calculus) is not straw-manned and yields to lived practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature (chlorophyll-stained hands; “blooming withering”). Dialogue is sparse, apt, and subtextual; status dynamics register without overstatement. Rhythm modulates cleanly from meditative to charged without head-hopping or register drift. Elision is purposeful and paid off by the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs—image, world, and motive—with minimal scaffolding. Figurative texture is consistently controlled; no muddled metaphors or loops slow momentum. Sentence rhythm breathes and tightens around the closing beats. A few lush passages flirt with purple but remain anchored to action and pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of measurable luck with horticultural memory and cracked marbles feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “mended deception” turned into a planted, sustaining lie is a non-obvious pivot. Risks (lyric register, quiet conflict) pay off in a singular stance. It avoids template beats while delivering a charged, specific final image.</comment>
