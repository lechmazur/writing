<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clear motive and embodied perception anchor her actions; the ledger, frost-reading, and turquoise shard choices reveal a coherent hierarchy of values. The internal conflict—vengeance versus remembrance—lands credibly when she renounces revenge. Earlier beats could surface contradictory impulses more explicitly under pressure. Still, reactions are specific and aligned with her artisan’s mindset.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the frost pattern method, kiln discovery, and turquoise-triggered projection build to a Conceptual Repricing. Closure lands with the realization to remember rather than avenge, with a conceptual cost. The final sentence truncation blunts cadence but the closure unit is already present. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon, frost, kiln, and glass pool are tactile and purpose-driven, shaping both method and revelation. Objects-as-setting (ledger, shard) charge the final image. Sensory detail stays within her craft-biased perception. World logic remains consistent while the environment constrains pathfinding via frost and terrain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via discovery sequence: frost trail → obsidian shards → steaming gulch → kiln pool → projection. Knowledge deepens and narrows options, culminating in a moral stance shift. Cost is internal (renunciation) rather than external jeopardy but reads on the page. A touch more tangible risk would have heightened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motifs (kiln, pauses, frost, ledger) converge into a resonant argument about memory versus vengeance. The final image reweights prior material, though the line “her purpose was not to avenge but to remember” edges toward explicitness. Subtext largely works through image (the pause pattern becoming geometry). Ambiguity around mercy and complicity lingers productively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyric yet controlled voice with a distinct artisan’s perceptual signature; cadence modulates from nocturne to charged dawn. No head-hopping; distance remains steady and apt. Diction feels character-true and textured. The truncated last line is a mechanical blemish rather than a POV slip.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density and strong imagery with minimal scaffolding; syntax varies well. Occasional purple edging and repeated phrasing (“steadily adaptive”) create minor excess. The abrupt truncation of the last line is a visible artifact in the final third that dulls the closing cadence. Still, clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Glasswork epistemology, frost cartography, and a cartel-kiln repurposing feel fresh and organically fused. The turquoise-triggered projection is an inventive, character-true turn. Risks in lyric texture and motif braiding pay off without obscuring sense. Minor familiar notes (“remember vs. avenge”) are lifted by execution.</comment>
