<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The carpenter’s vow of silence versus his impulse to sing creates a credible internal contradiction that drives action. His choices (following the chime, singing, seating the halo in the carousel) align with a maker’s temperament and are embodied through tactile craft. The emotional cost of breaking his long‑held identity is felt but understated. Secondary pressure is minimal, so conflict remains mostly internal/lyric.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: singing + halo action deepens and reweights stakes toward a Conceptual Repricing (“silence had never been absence, only canvas”). Orientation is clear early (abandoned circus train, carpenter, frost), and the beats cohere through a single corridor‑like progression. Closure lands on‑page with the train moving and the world reconfigured, the price being his renunciation of silence and self‑redefinition. Slight softness in explicit cost keeps this just shy of the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly lived‑in and functional: cars, chandeliers, music box, carousel core, and rails all shape choices and the final image. The recurring objects (halo, bells, mirror) charge the ending (“coating rails with silver dawn”). Sensory selection matches POV (iron snow, sawdust) and supports tone. Minor lavishness never muddles spatial clarity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via density and cadence: finding the oasis, first song, halo blooming, shard‑to‑life conversions, then the decisive insertion into the carousel. The dominant stake (recasting silence) tightens as singing proves both tool and stance. Costs and reversals are gentle—no resistant force answers him—yet the renunciation at the climax reads as a real narrowing. The accumulative build earns the forward motion.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from action and image—art as translation of hush into life—without sermonizing. The final repricing (“silence...only canvas”) reweights every earlier bell, hush, and gleam and resonates with his earlier muteness. Subtext hums through the mirror, the unplayed ballerina, and the halo’s insistence on “another story.” A touch of explicitness in the last third is balanced by strong image‑led closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person limited is steady, with a distinct craftsman’s perceptual signature (tools, textures, gears translating to melody). Rhythm modulates well from hush to bloom to glide. No head‑hopping or stance drift; elision is taught and paid off. A few lush clusters flirt with purple but remain controlled by image logic.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful metaphors, and varied cadence. Repetition motifs (“hush,” “bells,” “gleam”) are patterned rather than looped. Minor richness risk is managed; no filter stacks or template cadences dull momentum. The last image consolidates rather than explains.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—a silent carpenter singing a circus train back to life via a halo fragment—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric accumulation, minimal antagonism) pay off through coherent world‑rules and charged images. Specificity (iron snow, music box ballerina leaping into the pole) lifts it above familiar “restoration” tropes. The ingenuity is organic, not gimmicked.</comment>
