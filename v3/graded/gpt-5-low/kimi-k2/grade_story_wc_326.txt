<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and intensifies: the radio’s “defragment” and the misprinted death certificate drive concrete choices (dropping the shard, tracing the mandala, stepping into the vortex). Embodied contradictions—“digital ghost” yet counting heartbeats—are dramatized rather than labeled. The heartbeat‑for‑stroke exchange creates visible cost and reveals values under pressure. The final acceptance (no longer counting) reads earned rather than tidy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds (ink → patterns → silhouette → mandala → vortex) toward an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (who/where/what pressure), and no causal cheats are needed. The closure image (shard fusing into a dark star, printer correcting the name) lands with conceptual and felt price. The counting mechanic functions as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The opal observatory and snow are not postcarded; they pressure action (frost shattering ink, dome receiving the shard) and charge the final image. Recurring objects (porcelain/opal, ink) integrate with space and culminate in the lantern‑like dome and dark star. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered, with weather as metronome. World rules stay consistent through observation rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrate a corrupted identity or remain a ghost) is signaled early and tightens through the heartbeat‑for‑action trade. The decisive deepening—choosing to “defragment” by tracing the ink and then stepping into the vortex—narrows options and exacts a price. Internal and external pressures interweave without an antagonist. Consequences reconfigure the world’s stance toward the narrator (the corrected printout) without feeling costless.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres (identity as pattern not deletion; forgiveness of systemic error) and emerges through concrete images (ink constellations dissolving, two faces resolving). Subtextual play between body/ghost, data/matter, and failure/wisdom resonates. However, the explicit thesis sentence—“identity is not a file to be deleted but a pattern to be completed”—edges into moralizing and slightly reduces the lingering ambiguity. The ending image remains strong enough to carry emotional aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent in a lyric register; diction and rhythm match the narrator’s perceptual signature (metronomic counting against opaline imagery). Psychic distance and tense remain stable; purposeful compression reads natural. No dialogue is needed; the radio interjections function as action. Under stress, cadence tightens without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with largely clean syntax; metaphors are vivid and coherent to the established palette (ink/constellations/opals). Minor risk of purple excess is managed by clear action steps and momentum (drop, trace, step, fuse). No noticeable loops or scaffold lines; the heartbeat counts vary rhythm effectively. Final images are sharply rendered without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—radio‑prompted “defragment” enacted through ink mandalas in an opal observatory to resolve a bureaucratic death—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects are not ornamental; they transform across beats and culminate in a charged reconfiguration. The piece takes stylistic risks (lyric, accumulative structure) that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity (heartbeat cost) grounds the conceptual gambit.</comment>
