<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—renewing a living treaty before she dies—is clear and embodied in specific micro‑choices (one branch, one wire, one page). The acceptance of mortality versus dwindling strength gives credible endurance with cost. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than contested, tilting toward serenity over struggle. The final renunciation (finishing the work and dying) is earned by prior labor and worldview.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned work, discoveries, and installations crescendo to the charged final image. Closure lands with cost—the moonflowers opening at her last breath and the diary seeded for the next keeper (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Each “architectural secret” reweights options and tactics, cohering causally within the lyric frame. Orientation is clean from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard’s living pillars, copper, springs, and moonflowers aren’t backdrop—they constrain tactics and charge the ending. Tools and environment (wire, altar core, canopy) directly shape what is possible and how it resolves. Sensory selection fits the caretaker’s botanical eye and purpose. World rules (grown stone, seismograph‑flowers) stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is renewing the interspecies treaty before death, and pressure tightens via finite time and successive secrets. Escalation is a density increase: each system added (doorways, organ‑vine, seismograph) narrows remaining options and drains stamina, culminating in the final climb and last wire. The cost—her life given into the system she built—is unmistakable. Lack of overt opposition keeps it quiet but coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Resonance is strong—reciprocity, transmission, and continuity are dramatized through living architecture and the diary’s hand‑off. However, the explicit line “Respect is not taught but transmitted…” states the thesis, slightly flattening subtext at the finish. Otherwise, images carry the theme without sermonizing. The final image still lingers beyond the stated moral.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Mara’s perceptual biases (botanical, architectural, acoustic). Rhythm modulates with pressure—methodical cadences for work, widened breath at the summit, hush at the end. No head‑hopping or register drift; diction is precise and character‑plausible. Patterned phrasing teaches itself early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sentences carry high information density with minimal scaffold; motifs recur purposefully. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and controlled; few, if any, mixed metaphors. Momentum holds; no paraphrase loops or template cadences dull the peak beats. Minor lushness remains within legible bounds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—grown stone architecture, copper‑guided sap, a seismograph that blooms—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and lyric mode heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The “treaty” frame for a temple/orchard is fresh and integrated with motive and ending. Turns arise from earlier particulars rather than late conveniences.</comment>
