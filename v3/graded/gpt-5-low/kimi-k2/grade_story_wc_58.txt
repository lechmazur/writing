<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear motive (to perform an obituary rite and map healing) manifests through concrete acts: warming the weft, writing on air, laying the thread. Contradictory impulses—summoning versus accepting absence—play in-scene (“rehearsing loss rather than reversing it”). The renunciation—“walked the path once more, this time without expectation of arrival”—feels earned and costly. Interiority is specific and embodied, not generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: escalating images (lantern words → gold swirl → moths → dissolving face) lead to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as she forecloses waiting and ties the thread—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when). Setups (thread, last ship) pay off in the final harbor and fountain images.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden is tactile and pressuring: cracked marble, dry fountain, quince scent, harbor lamps, all filtered through her mapping impulse. Environment constrains choices (the path she traces, the fountain where she binds the thread) and decisively charges the final image. Seasonal specificity (autumn) coheres with the elegiac tone and the cost of renunciation. World rules (words manifesting) remain consistent through setting-based enactment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure tightens via density and a key break: the near-resurrection (moths shaping a face) dissolves, forcing acceptance. The dominant stake—can ritual bridge absence or must she redraw its coastline—narrows to an earned refusal to keep waiting. The price (giving up the dockside vigil) is legible. Quiet but decisive, consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of absence/presence and healing-as-cartography arise organically from objects and acts (weft as vein, words as lanterns, harbor lamps). A few lines risk direct statement (“By naming the absence...”) but remain voice-true within ritual. The final image reweights the premise without a pat moral: memory as “anchor and sail,” lonesome splendor carried forward. Subtext hums in the garden’s responses and the seeds’ “explained absence.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; imagery and syntax modulate with pressure. Patterned diction (lists of “Here she…”) teaches and pays off without opacity. No head-hopping or register slips; the prose feels singular and confident. The whispered dialogue lines serve spellcasting rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images do multiple jobs (worldbuilding, emotion, action). Lush figurative language stays coherent and purposeful; few, if any, mixed metaphors. Slight risk of overrichness is managed by rhythm and clear beats. The closing cadence resolves cleanly without redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Obituaries for the living” and “projecting presence” through a stolen weft thread are fresh, integrated inventions. The ritual’s mechanics generate original set-pieces (words as lanterns, moths as a face) with emotional bite. The final reconfiguration (anchor and sail; seeds planning absence) feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk pays off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
