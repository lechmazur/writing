<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent: he seeks to read and preserve unspoken promises, and he chooses to stay, foreclosing return to the city. Interiority is implied more than dramatized; the recluse remains archetypal and emotionally cool. Still, his micro‑choices (opening the box, reading, adding his own strip) align with the pressure. A richer contradiction under stress would lift this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → interpretation → confession → ritual reading → vow. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration (box locks like a wingbeat; he accepts stewardship) and an earned stasis with cost (self‑exile, burden of weight). Orientation is crisp; props and images pay off. The slight trailing final phrase is a cosmetic slip but does not break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The oasis and scorched wasteland are vivid and specific; sensory detail (wax runes, thyme smoke, charcoal stilts) is integrated through action. Setting charges meaning and the final image (spiral hives, box tended), though it rarely constrains tactics. World rules (visible ghosts) stay consistent and learned through scene. The environment’s pressure could tighten once more to reach the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether silence can be translated and borne; escalation deepens via the realization that the covenant is a confession and through the ritual of reading strips. The cost becomes legible in the choice to remain and accept the burden. Pressure is coherent but largely internal and ceremonial, with limited jeopardy or hard trade‑offs. One sharper on‑page test of price would heighten tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: truth owed to bees, the ethics of silence, promises as weight. Recurring images (spiral hives, amber tears, wingbeat lock) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on speech, secrecy, and covenant without platitude. Slightly safe in its emotional risk, though conceptually rich.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with the recluse’s sensibility. No head‑hopping; modulations suit pressure. A few elevated metaphors push toward purple but largely remain precise. The unfinished last clause nicks polish but not coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, dense, and image‑rich; many sentences do double duty. Occasionally, figurative layering edges into ornament (“amber and sticky with regret”), and information recurs. The final trailing fragment (“let the mute eloquence”) reads like an accidental truncation, dulling the last beat’s crispness. Trim one or two lush phrases and land the last line cleanly to elevate.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Beekeeping ghosts, a covenant as confession, and a stained‑glass reliquary synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame. Risks in diction and world‑logic are integrated and pay off conceptually. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (truth to bees → silence as breach → ritual restitution). Small safety in conflict keeps it shy of breakthrough originality.</comment>
