<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyra’s motives are clear and active: she chooses to interfere, then adapts under pressure with the phase‑shift “mirror.” Interiority is embodied (“burnt sugar and regret,” sweaty palms) and the mentor’s credo sharpens her values without over‑explaining. The “numbers arriving with crystalline certainty” slightly shortcuts struggle, softening cost. Still, micro‑choices (fader adjustments, delay tweak) credibly reveal hierarchy of values: vigilance over fear.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—each choice prompts a concrete reaction (counter‑signal → crowd softening; tricksters’ counter → her mirror). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: a charged poise where the town’s stance shifts and the comet’s light “softens,” with the transmitter left humming. Cost is present but modest (overheating, risk of perverting hope, bodily strain). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The basement studio, antique transmitter, and astronomical charts are tactile and purpose‑driven; tools constrain tactics (tube risk, delay controls). Sensory texture is vivid across modalities (smell of solder/ozone; subsonic “taste”). Setting objects return at the end (charts/comet tail, transmitter lullaby), charging the final image. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled early (community cohesion vs. manipulation) and escalate when the tricksters layer a “colder” counter‑song. The mirror tactic narrows options and forces a trade‑off under risk (amplitude drift, hardware stress). The on‑page reversal is earned by her decision, not coincidence. The cost is felt if not catastrophic, keeping it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of signal vs. noise, power through persuasion, and ethical interference emerge organically from action. The mentor’s line risks thesis‑statement, but it’s dramatized and paid off by Lyra’s mirror choice. The ending reweights meaning (softened comet, quieter town) without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: victory is provisional, which deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled voice fuses technical lexicon with lyric perception, consistent to Lyra’s sensibility. Psychic distance stays steady; no head‑hopping or unearned certainty beyond her plausible inference. Rhythm modulates with pressure (tight, crisp during the mirror adjustment). Diction is unified and character‑plausible despite its poetry.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, purposeful images, and clean sequencing. A few figurative pushes (“Möbius strip of intent,” “burnt sugar and regret”) flirt with excess but remain coherent and legible. Minimal scaffolding; momentum rarely stalls. Minor purple glints keep it just below the very top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Radio‑studio counter‑propaganda via subsonic engineering is a fresh angle on alien influence. The mirror tactic and comet image feel both inevitable and surprising. Risks in diction and conceptual synthesis pay off without obscuring clarity. Slight genre familiarity (aliens sowing discord) is transformed by specificity and craft.</comment>
