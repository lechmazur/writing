<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Veyra’s motive—boredom sharpened into a risky hunger to know what follows goodbye—is clear and drives concrete choices. Interiority is specific (mapping magnetic lines, humming to tune the storm) and contradictions (yearning vs. risk of tearing the pocket) play in scene. The final shift from ennui to charged purpose feels earned. A hair light on palpable psychic cost during the peak beats, but credible within scope.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Coherent causal chain: curiosity → field realignment → shard fusion → threshold vision → amulet’s dissolution and re‑stabilization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “after goodbye” reweighted by the lantern hallway with cost implied in the near‑shred and the amulet’s sacrifice. Orientation is clean and the Hybrid lens with an accumulative finale holds. No unkept setups or convenience turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite, magnetic heart, and solar storm aren’t just backdrop—they constrain tactics (how she sings and shapes fields) and charge the ending image. Sensory specificity stays POV‑filtered and purposeful. World rules (magnetized shard, pocket geometry) stay consistent through action. The final dust‑in‑hair reprise binds object and place into the last beat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is present early: risk the pocket’s integrity to learn what follows goodbye. Escalation is tangible—storm intensifies, corridors fold, planes rebel—before the decisive fusion. Cost is felt, though largely conceptual/emotional; the amulet’s destruction and near‑annihilation mark a credible price. A slightly smoother path to success keeps it shy of top‑band tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece coheres around farewell, memory, and eternity’s boredom; images earn resonance at the threshold. However, “she understood that after goodbye there is not nothing but everything remembered at once” states the thesis a bit overtly, dulling subtext in the final movement. Still, the lantern hallway and reversed snow deliver a lasting afterimage. Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lyrical, controlled voice with a distinct perceptual signature suits an immortal’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm tighten under pressure (storm, groan, fold) without head‑hopping. Brief dialogue lines feel earned and in character. Confidence and distance remain stable and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with mostly clean, vivid metaphors integrated into action. A few lush stacks skirt purple, but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Sentence rhythm varies well, especially around the fusion and threshold. No notable loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—magnetic spatial mutiny as the path to a metaphysical answer about goodbye—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Familiar immortal ennui is transformed by specific tactics (humming frequencies, prism heart) and the lantern‑hallway recompense. Risks are aesthetic and structural, not gimmicky, and land cleanly. Slightly safer conflict contour keeps it below the very top.</comment>
