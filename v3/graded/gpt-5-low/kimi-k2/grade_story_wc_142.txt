<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lila’s motives are clear—protecting the living carnival while honoring the drowned city—and her “orderly intuitive” talent tracks to concrete tactics. Interiority is specific (the chip warming, the grid beneath chaos), and her exchanges with Tomasso add pressure without grandstanding. We see credible micro‑choices under stress (reading murals, testing lines, reorganizing the hull). The internal contradiction (dual allegiance) is present but not fully stress‑tested at the end due to truncation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads primarily Causal: Lila reads signals, reconfigures the maze, and confronts incoming buyers; the sequence is coherent. However, the text truncates mid‑climax (“Confused, the lead negot...”), so the closure unit (DC/RR/CR) is not on the page and cost remains unproved. Orientation is clean and set‑ups (chip, Whale, graffiti) pay forward, but the decisive after/before reconfiguration is missing. Without an on‑page closing beat, the story’s final cost and consequence are unresolved.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The raft‑city carnival is vividly realized and functionally constraining: murals become valves and alleys, the Whale repurposes basilica ribs, and the painted maze redirects buyers. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Lila’s trained perception. The stone chip and calliope/lanterns recur to charge images and tactics. Strong integration elevates atmosphere without stalling momentum.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (privatization vs. memory), and pressure coheres as dawn approaches with corporate barges. Lila’s proactive reorganization of the hull is a meaningful tightening that tests her competence. Yet there’s no visible price or narrowed option at the climax because the end is cut off, so escalation lacks a paid consequence on the page. We stop at confusion rather than a earned turn or cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory vs. commodification; dual allegiance) accrues through the chip/Whale and repurposed art, with “PROPERTY OF MEMORY” serving as a resonant emblem. The tone shifts toward defiant brass and the carnival barker’s line gestures toward Conceptual Repricing. But without a final on‑page consequence, resonance is capped at implication. Strong motifs, incomplete payoff.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is confident, lyrical, and sensorily precise, with a distinct perceptual signature (“orderly intuitive” grid beneath riot). Dialogue is lean and charged, especially Tomasso’s “knife you hold by both edges.” Diction stays coherent to the world and POV without register slippage. Minor lyric density is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs—world, action, and theme—without scaffold or synonym loops. Imagery is vivid yet controlled; metaphors (jokes into barcodes, love poems into QR links) stay legible and consistent. Rhythm varies with scene tempo and keeps momentum brisk through the night’s work. The sole craft issue is the abrupt truncation at the end, which undercuts the culminating cadence rather than the sentence‑level execution.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The raft carnival off drowned Naples, the basilica‑chip compass, and graffiti systems feel fresh and integrated rather than ornamental. The Whale’s organ‑pipe exhalation from San Gennaro is an inventive, memorable turn. Risks in concept and diction heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Only the missing ending keeps this from higher brilliance.</comment>
