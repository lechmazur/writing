<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (fulfill the dying keeper’s charge before dawn), and her agency is steady and purposeful in selecting, arranging, uncorking, and finally sacrificing the seed‑pearl. Interiority arrives via tactile, profession‑filtered noticing (amber‑stained fingers, the hourglass) rather than label‑speak. Internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely wavers, which slightly limits dynamic tension. The small but felt cost (giving up the wedding‑gown pearl) credibly earns the closing stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: button‑by‑button patterning intensifies into a midnight release, the prophecy reframed as a question, and a decisive insertion of the pearl. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the live clock (dawn) binds the sequence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost—emptying the jar, spending the pearl, and reweighting the prophecy from fate to choice. The before/after is legible in the warehouse’s softened walls, the hourglass’s reversed sand, and the cliffs’ changed faces.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and cliffside environment shape tactics (buttons as resources) and charge the ending (the warehouse sighing, cliffs smoothing). Sensory specificity is rich yet purposeful, filtered through her craft. Recurring objects (hourglass, jar, buttons) function as micro‑settings that constrain and orient choices. World rules (echo as light, possibility as motes) are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake: convert the echo before dawn or lose it. Escalation is achieved by density and cadence shifts (shivering echo → phrases → light → spindle → her answer), with one meaningful tightening at the choice to press the pearl. The cost is quiet but present: relinquishing a potent, symbolic button and releasing the captured echo. The final scattering of three spares extends consequence rather than deflating it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The piece enacts “shared wisdom” through concrete exchanges—buttons fastening lives, prophecy becoming a question, possibilities seeded as future buttons. The theme emerges from particulars rather than moralizing; the one explicit line about wisdom fits the voice and labor. The ending reweights prior images (fastening, echo, hourglass) into a resonant answer about stewardship over ownership. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close is consistent, with a distinct lexicon rooted in resin, buttons, and timecraft. Rhythm modulates well at pressure points (midnight, the pearl insertion). No head‑hopping or stance leakage; inference reads as inference. The voice feels singular and controlled without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and precise, with images doing multiple jobs (buttons as syllables and history). Figurative density stays coherent; no major mixed metaphors or loops slow momentum. Syntax varies with scene needs, and transitions are clean. A lush register is sustained without purple spillover at the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hourglass turner, jarred canyon echo, and buttons as semantic/fateful units synthesize into a fresh, inevitable system. The reconfiguration from prophecy to question is elegant and earned. Risks in concept and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final images (reversed sand; motes becoming future buttons) feel memorably original.</comment>
