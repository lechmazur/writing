<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—to learn the shard’s purpose and the “withheld truth”—is clear and deepens credibly as she encounters her younger self and the console. Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific (tasting metal’s memory; the chord that “tasted of ozone and regret”). The final renunciation (embedding the shard) forecloses further traversal with a felt cost. Slight neatness in the epiphany edges toward tidy rather than internally contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with causal throughline: shard pulses → fold to the live bay → console revelation → decision to stop cycling → embedding the shard. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she renounces further universe‑hopping, seals the shard, and revalues “world” as a moment, with cost legible in relinquishing ongoing crossings. Orientation is clean; the taught pattern (lyric, dream‑physics) holds to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay is vivid and functional: gantries, fuel lines, catwalks, and the console shape options and enable the key revelation. The shard operates as charged micro‑setting and returns in the final image embedded in the floor. World rules are consistent within the dreamlike logic, and the environment constrains and focuses choice. Sensory specificity (sound, taste, temperature) is purposeful and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (learn and release the withheld truth) are signaled early and tighten decisively at the console revelation. The major turn is Lira choosing not to reenter the cycle but to seal the shard, paying a price in foreclosed possibilities. Tension is quiet but coherent; internal and external pressures interweave. A touch more on-the-page resistance before the final act could heighten pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of truth, memory, and renunciation accrue through concrete images (rearranging fracture lines; “a world as a moment”). The final act reweights the premise: mapping “the spaces between” rather than destinations. A few explicit statements (“the weight had been discovered, the truth released”) flirt with telling, slightly softening the otherwise earned resonance. Subtext largely carries through image and action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lyric, sensorial voice remains consistent and plausibly tethered to a sensory map maker. Free of head‑hopping and register drift; psychic distance modulates smoothly at pressure points. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the quiet, charged ending. A few elevated abstractions graze purple but don’t break POV plausibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and concision with multi‑tasking lines; images often carry plot and theme together. Minor lushness and occasional abstract phrasing don’t stall momentum or obscure causality. No notable loops or scaffold; final image lands cleanly. A slightly leaner middle could sharpen propulsion even more.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of a sensory cartographer, a cyclically reconfiguring shard, and parallel bays feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The console scene transforms the premise without late rule cheats, and the renunciation is a non‑obvious, elegant choice. Risks in structure and diction pay off with clarity. Familiar multiverse motifs are revitalized by the tactile, synesthetic mapping angle.</comment>
