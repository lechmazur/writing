<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, embodied interiority with a credible contradiction: she hoards hush yet longs for “quiet in the storm.” Micro‑choices (clenching the stone, then opening her hand; placing it in the rivulet) reveal values under pressure. The relationship with the energy being applies soft but real pressure. Slightly declarative insight (“not to conquer but to teach”) trims the rawness of the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds, with a meaningful turn when she releases the stone and seeds the rivulet. However, the story cuts off mid‑final act (“She set it afloat, and it”), so closure doesn’t land on the page and cost remains implied rather than sealed. Orientation is strong; causality threads are consistent. The missing ending blocks a fully earned RR/CR cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Harmonic caves, ice fissures, and the echo stone are vividly integrated and used tactically (reading cracks, pressing the stone into the largest fissure). World rules are learned through action; sensory range is rich without cataloging. The setting meaningfully guides choices, though the incomplete final image limits how fully it can charge closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming hoarded silence into resonant balance) tightens through the confrontation and her relinquishment. The deepening is character‑driven: refusal, recognition, then surrender. Costs are felt (grief space carved; relinquishing her hoard logic), but escalation stays gentle and the cut ending mutes the final price beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through images (ice fractures, ripples, hush blooming) and action rather than thesis, culminating in repricing silence as resonance. A few explicit lines (“not to conquer but to teach”) slightly over‑explain. The emotional aftereffect is honest and earned, if softened by the missing last chord.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate with pressure. No head‑hopping; stance remains consistent. Dialogue is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext. The voice sustains intensity without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; line rhythms vary and carry momentum. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains coherent and specific; no major loops or filter stacks. Syntax supports the accumulating hush rather than clogging it. The final truncation, not the prose itself, blunts the last image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: teaching caves to “sing their own silence,” hush as resonance, and cartography of quiet mapped on skin. Recurring objects and methods reappear with evolved meaning. Risk‑taking in concept and texture feels integrated, not ornamental. Only the clipped ending keeps it from the very top band.</comment>
