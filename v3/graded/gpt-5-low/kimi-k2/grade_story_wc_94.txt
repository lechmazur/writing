<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The poet’s drive—to reclaim and understand censored language—feels specific and embodied (“defusing memory,” scars on palms), and her micro‑choices (timing, rarefaction, climbing to project) align cleanly with that motive. Internal contradiction (“furiously tranquil”) gives an undercurrent of tension without melodrama. However, the conflict remains largely one‑sided; doubts or competing impulses don’t materially disrupt her tactics. The endurance/renunciation at the end (emptying the envelope, accepting luminous scars) is credible and earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned objects (timer, negatives, telescope, storm) escalate density to a closure image that reweights meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: she releases the poem into the sky, pays with the loss of secrecy and the permanence of scars, and the empty envelope evidences cost. Orientation is clear by line one (who/where/what tonight) and the pattern is taught early and paid off. Causality is lyric but coherent: the storm enables development and projection; the timer’s backward run tightens cadence, not logic.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: stormlight affects the developer, the observatory’s telescope enables projection, and the dome/storm materially shape options. Recurring objects operate as micro‑setting (timer, envelope, timetable), culminating in a charged final image. Sensory detail (“rain that tasted of ink”) is selective and POV‑filtered. World rules are consistent within the poetic conceit.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberating censored verses—tightens via a clear cadence: expose fragments, realize the vigil is listening, climb, project. The timer’s reversal and the lightning‑enabled projection mark the meaningful deepening. Cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally; external risk isn’t dramatized, but the renunciation (empty envelope, acceptance of scars) reads as a real price. Pressure remains coherent and grows toward a decisive final act.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme coheres: censorship, scars as cartography, and public witnessing interweave through concrete action rather than lecture. The revaluation (“scars are roads,” vigil as listening) arises from on‑page process and culminates in a socially charged sky‑projection. A couple of lines tilt toward explicit statement, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. The final image resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, steady lyric voice with clean single‑POV control; diction and rhythm are purposeful and consistent. Patterned elision is taught early and used confidently. No head‑hopping or register slips; metaphoric texture tracks the character’s sensibility. The voice modulates under pressure (timer shifts, climb to projection) without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images often do double duty (ink as censorship and weather). Figurative language is abundant but coherent to the motif set; rhythm varies and propels. A few near‑aphoristic articulations edge toward over‑explicitness, but no loops or muddled metaphors blunt the climax. Line‑level clarity holds through the final beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—darkroom alchemy with storm astronomy to uncensor language—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects reconfigure at closure without gimmickry. Risk‑taking in conceit and diction heightens stakes and coherence. Minor familiarity in a couple of formulations prevents a higher score, but the overall vision is singular.</comment>
