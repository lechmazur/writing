<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The janitor’s motive—answering an ache of absence and honoring his order—drives concrete, evolving choices (aligning the glass, tracing meteors, opening his chest). The internal turn from “brooms are useless” to embracing darkness reads as a true shift rather than a pose. Contradictory impulses are present but relatively gentle; struggle is more contemplative than contested. Still, his agency is clear and the renunciation carries felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: patterned attention and ritual actions densify until the cadence breaks at “he opened the vault of his chest.” Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: station revived, time rewound, and a final offering that reweights the premise. Cost is legible in admitting the void and letting it equalize him. Orientation is clear early and the single-scene arc holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The station and its machinery are tactile and functional: the meridian, orrery, and floorboards directly shape tactics and pay off when meteors seed and instruments awaken. The yellow glass as micro‑setting/object anchors geography and the final image. World rules are consistent and learned through action (gears thaw as attention and warmth accrue). Atmosphere and specificity serve pressure rather than posing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes (reviving a silenced sky) escalate through a meaningful deepening: from observation to empathic tracing to the high‑cost opening of his chest. The tightening forecloses a safer, aloof stance and makes him a conduit, after which meteors reconfigure their behavior. The price is felt in bodily flicker and surrender to void. Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of vulnerability as strength, listening as repair, and reciprocity in attention emerge organically through ritualized action and object returns. The final constellation‑heart image resonates and reweights prior motifs. One explicit thesis line (“vulnerability was not a wound but a doorway”) states what is already earned, slightly dulling subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with controlled imagery and rhythm; diction feels native to this consciousness. Psychic distance is steady; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Patterned elision is taught early and carried through cleanly. Cadence modulates at pressure points, especially at the chest‑opening and the closing offering.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet mostly purposeful; images do double duty for world and emotion (“brooms were useless; the dust was memory”). Minor risk of over‑saturation in metaphor density, but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Syntax varies and paragraphs earn their space. The final images are sharp and unblurred by purple drift.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>“Cosmic janitor” and the lantern glass synthesize cosmic myth with tactile maintenance in a fresh, inevitable way. The meteor‑as‑seed and constellation‑hand heart are striking turns grounded by prior setup. Risk‑taking in lyric texture and quiet stakes heightens meaning without losing clarity. The vision feels singular rather than stitched from familiar tropes.</comment>
