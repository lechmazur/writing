<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (to hear the sound of trust breaking) drives every choice, and the renunciation—leaving the device—reads as an earned cost. Interiority is vivid and embodied through synesthetic perception and tactile work with tiles and slag. Contradictory pulls (understanding vs. flight; warning vs. witness) operate on the page. Minor safety lies in how competently the protagonist proceeds without much visible struggle until the flare-memory turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned labor (collect–imprint–tile) densifies until the aurora flare reweights meaning with the hush realization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: swapping “warning” for “witness” and leaving the aid behind. Orientation is clear early (sunken greenhouse, forge, hearing-aid designer) and the causal thread within the lyric structure remains legible. The persistent constraint (biological clock of cell division) charges the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The environment (sunken orchard, shipwreck ring, forge, aurora) is not postcard; it constrains process and charges the final image (device left on cooling forge as the greenhouse “keeps dividing”). Sensory specificity is rich across modalities, filtered through synesthesia. The rules (biological clock, slag tiles, aurora’s influence) stay internally consistent and purposeful. The forge and greenhouse directly shape tactics and the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent: transform absence into a device tuned to betrayal. Escalation happens via density and a decisive deepening when the aurora flare unlocks the brother’s memory, reframing the sought “sound” as hush. The renunciation (leaving the aid) is a visible price that shifts the goal from prevention to witness. Pressure remains internal but tightens credibly under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: trust’s fracture as hush; warning versus witness; life dividing despite betrayal. Recurring images (cells dividing, forge, aurora colors) are reweighted at the end without moralizing. The brother’s memory grounds insight, avoiding abstraction. The final bloom-underwater image reframes the premise with earned, resonant ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with synesthetic perception offers a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well through making, revelation, and leave-taking. No head-hopping or stance leakage; elisions are taught and paid off. Slight risk of ornamental flourish in places, but control holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High-density prose largely earns its lyricism; most lines do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Occasional purple weight and stacked metaphors tread near excess but stay coherent. The truncated final word (“The sunk”) is a small copy artifact that dings finish without breaking closure. Otherwise, syntax and cadence are varied and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Collecting absences to cast a mosaic that resonates with the frequency of trust breaking is startlingly original, and the subtractive hearing aid is a fresh inversion. The synesthesia integrated with a drowned orchard-forge ecology feels singular rather than quirky. The witness-not-warning turn is an elegant, non-obvious reweighting. Bold risks heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
