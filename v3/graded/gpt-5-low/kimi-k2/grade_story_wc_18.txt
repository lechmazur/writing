<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—she seeks the runaway dream to understand why it fled—and her craft‑driven mindset shapes tactics. Interiority is embodied through breath and toolwork, culminating in the “crack across her own heart” realization. The internal conflict (control vs. welcome) is resolved credibly if a touch swiftly. A slightly greater felt struggle before the surrender would deepen cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through ritual, image density, and object transformation toward a reweighted end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: she renounces trapping and becomes a door‑maker, with the sextant recalibrated to forgiveness. Orientation is crisp early; the recurring ritual and moth guide progression without causal gaps. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, legible but not searing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard of glass mountains and thick fog is vivid, integrated, and operative—breath draws from fog and trunks; chiming mountains harmonize with her rhythm; the environment softens into the sextant. Object‑as‑setting (sextant) and the place both charge the final image. Sensory specificity remains POV‑filtered through a craftsperson’s attention. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover/understand the dream) tightens through the breathing method and the decisive recognition that she must become a bridge, not a cage. The key deepening is when the sextant’s reflection reveals her complicity—this reweights tactics and forecloses the trapping path. Escalation is lyric rather than confrontational but coherent under the chosen lens. The price is renunciation of her prior practice, lightly but clearly felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme develops organically: boundaries as doors, control vs. receptivity, forgiveness as navigation. Recurring images (breath, glass, sextant, moth) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The final act—craft doors that welcome—offers a non‑literal answer to the central question. A hair more friction or counter‑pressure would sharpen the ambiguity and deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third carries a distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft and breath. Rhythm modulates well, with longer cadences during ritual and tighter lines at turns. No POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; elisions are purposeful and legible. The diction remains unified and confident without register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prose is polished, image‑dense, and purposeful; most lines do multiple jobs (world, psychology, and action). Figurative texture is consistent with the glass/astral lexicon and avoids mixed metaphors. Minor risk of lushness crowding momentum is held in check by clear turns. No loops or scaffold distract from the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Highly original synthesis: glass orchard, dream‑moth, and a sextant recalibrated to the distances between souls. The transformation from mirror‑trapping to door‑making feels inevitable in hindsight and arises from established motifs. Risks (lyric density, ritualized escalation) pay off without obscuring clarity. A small increase in on‑page cost would push it into rarer air.</comment>
