<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Elias’s constraints (prosopagnosia, methodical counting, painting negative space) drive concrete micro-choices and culminate in a credible renunciation: he lets the woman go and gives the charged canvas to the police. Interiority is embodied (numbered strokes, tears, tactile mist) rather than labeled. The motive—to pierce a seven‑year silence and unify absences—intensifies under pressure when the woman arrives. Slight limit: internal contradiction is implied more than dramatized in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned painting, object recurrence, and cadence shift culminate in a resonant reconfiguration (the eye, reunited ribbon, search dogs). Orientation is crisp from the outset (quarry, mist, night, Voss’s condition). Cost is present—he sacrifices pursuit/identification for an offering that summons authorities—though it’s quiet rather than scalding. The closure image reweights the premise without needing procedural resolution.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist and shadow actively erase evidence, shape tactics (lowest ledge, ash‑colored gesso), and charge the final image (moon igniting the ribbon; search dogs breaching the rim). Details are selective and POV‑filtered through an artist’s tactile habits. The ribbon as micro‑setting object fuses into the canvas, functioning as environment at closure. Strong atmospheric integration with no white‑room slippage.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres: from solitary setup to the woman’s arrival, to the charged act of uniting ribbons and transforming voids into an eye, to authorities converging. The dominant stake—lancing silence/animating empathy in cold cases—tightens when Elias chooses offering over interrogation. The price is felt but understated; escalation is more tonal/depth than overt hazard. Still, the arrival of search dogs marks a tangible narrowing of options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image: absence, negative space, and the pivot from identity to shared human cost. The ribbon’s circle and the eye enact a conceptual repricing of empathy. The explicit line “Empathy isn’t memory” risks overstatement, though it’s earned by the scene’s particulars. Resonance lingers without tidy moral bookkeeping.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A confident, textured third‑person close filters the world through an artist’s perceptual logic; diction and rhythm are controlled and purposeful. Dialogue is spare and subtextual, functioning as action. No head‑hopping or stance drift; the lyric compression is taught early and sustained. The voice modulates with pressure without lapsing into explanatory scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, coherent metaphors (negative space portraits; mist “erasing” evidence) and clean sequencing. No loops or scaffolding; sentence rhythms vary and propel. The figurative load is heavy but disciplined, avoiding muddle. Minor risk of purple flourish is checked by consistent POV utility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a face‑blind portraitist solving cold cases by painting absences in a mist‑erased quarry, culminating in a reconfigured symbol (ribbon‑iris) that summons consequence. The risk of a quiet, conceptual climax pays off in specificity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (unifying opposites triggers the break). Distinctive without gimmickry.</comment>
