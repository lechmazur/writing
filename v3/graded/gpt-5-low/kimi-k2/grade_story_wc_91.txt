<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s drive—to comprehend how giving alters her—is clear and deepens through embodied choices (uncorking jars, pressing her palm into glass). Contradictory impulses (emptiness vs. ongoing release) operate simultaneously. A credible renunciation occurs: she parts with her last, long‑kept bug and accepts emptiness as echoing space. Slight abstraction surfaces in a few thesis‑like lines, but the interiority remains earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from releasing jars toward the final charged image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: giving redefined as translation, sealed by the glass handprint and trapped light—cost legible in the emptied belt. Orientation is clean from the first line (who/where/what). The volcano/glass motif grounds the cadence shift without causal fractures.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The volcano beach is vivid and functional: heat turns sand to glass, enabling the final imprint and encasing a bug’s light. Setting details (black sand, ash, plume, lava mouth) are filtered through her purpose and escalate the imagery. The environment constrains and charges choices rather than serving as mere backdrop. Sensory texture supports the theme without over‑touristing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but coherent: whether she can reframe “giving” without self‑erasure. Escalation arrives via successive releases culminating in the kept, heartbeat‑pulsing bug flying into the volcano, narrowing options toward acceptance. The cost is tangible (emptied jars, relinquished talisman, moving into shadow). Low external opposition, but pressure builds appropriately for the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurring images (bugs, hush, glass) and resolves in a non‑literal answer to the giving/emptiness question. The “giving is not subtraction but translation” line is explicit yet earned by the ritual of release and the final image, avoiding sermonizing. Subtext (coincidences, echo space) invites reflection beyond the page. A hint of stated thesis tempers the score slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely held voice is consistent and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (vibrant hush, emerald galaxies). Rhythm varies and tightens at key moments (final jar, handprint). No head‑hopping or register drift; compression is taught early and maintained. Occasional aphoristic assertion skims the edge of over‑glossed but stays within voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet disciplined; images carry multiple jobs (bugs as galaxies, glass as imprint/cost). Minimal redundancy and strong sentence‑level propulsion. A high metaphor density remains coherent, avoiding mixed vehicles; cadence shifts support escalation. Minor potential for purple in isolated lines, but clarity and momentum hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—destitute philanthropist, bottled lightning, active volcano, and coincidence web—feels fresh and inevitable by the end. The final glass‑trapped bug reframes the premise with specificity. Risks in tone and lyric structure heighten stakes rather than obscure them. The piece avoids template sentimentality through unusual, charged particulars.</comment>
