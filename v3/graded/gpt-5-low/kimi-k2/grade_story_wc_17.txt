<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—uncovering the corridor’s dreaming walls under the weight of her grandfather’s secrecy—is concrete and coherently intensified by on‑page discoveries. Interiority is sensorial and character‑particular (sound‑mapping, heartbeat mortar), with a credible tension between honoring legacy and breaking silence. The sensory overwhelm at the chamber provides embodied cost. Minor ding: the “sensitively perceptive” label recurs rather than letting action fully carry the trait.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (abandoned observatory, ivy‑veiled passage, Mara’s role), and the causal chain is clean: diaries → coordinates on the negative → chamber → vision → choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts the duty to remember and leaves a charged artifact/note. Cost is legible in the acceptance of burden and the sensed sorrow; the accumulative/textural lens holds throughout.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The setting is vividly particular and functional: the passage, hearth, and fossilized‑starlight chamber constrain actions and enable the key turn (the negative slot, the ember revealing coordinates). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mara’s sonic bias. Recurring objects (film strip, bricks, ivy) charge the final image and shape choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to unseal and translate the corridor’s dreams despite legacy’s imposed silence. Escalation occurs via the discovery and use of the negative’s coordinates, culminating in the chamber’s vision that forces a stance. The price is an accepted burden rather than an external antagonist; it reads as sufficient at this scale.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Memory, stewardship, and “legacy’s burden” emerge organically from particulars (burned pages, star‑chart bricks, negative light) and culminate in a reweighted final image. However, the explicit note—“keep the dream alive, not bury it”—edges into thesis articulation, slightly flattening subtext at the finish. The piece still invites reflection via its charged images and conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature keyed to echo and touch. Rhythm modulates effectively at the chamber’s crescendo. A few repeated labels and constructions mildly thin the texture, but POV distance and certainty remain stable and apt.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet largely precise; sentences carry multiple jobs without bogging. Minor repetition (e.g., the exact “half‑burned diaries found in the fireplace” phrase) and occasional stacked modifiers brush purple but don’t obscure sense. Momentum holds and the final image is clear.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Echo cartography, film negative as stellar key, and walls that dream form a fresh synthesis with thematic bite. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, not gimmicked. The vision and the fused strip/star deliver an original, memorable closure.</comment>
