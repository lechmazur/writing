<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority: Liora’s meticulous, word‑wary nature shapes concrete micro‑choices (stone‑shifting, logging the time, “delayed disclosure”). Contradictory impulses—integrity versus openness to the watcher—operate simultaneously and drive her tactic. The renunciation (not confronting, hiding the tube) forecloses a path with felt cost. Embodied perception (“graphite sweet” wind, kiss to the tube) keeps emotion lived rather than labeled.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational undertow; pressure thickens from being followed to the latch click to the stashing act. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses delayed disclosure and leaves the watcher a path, with conceptual cost on the page (“This is not concealment; it is delayed disclosure”). Orientation is clean early (courtyard at dusk, followed from the observatory), and causality is coherent. The cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible and tied to stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting and object-as-setting are vivid and purposeful: the quiet courtyard enables concealment; the fountain cavity materially constrains choice. Sensory specificity is filtered through a storm recorder’s bias (air textures, razor fences, instruments). World rules (quarantine zone) stay consistent and charge mood and stakes. The final image recharges place (“moonrise silvered… layered tranquility”) without slipping into postcard static.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (integrity vs disclosure under surveillance) is signaled early and tightens once via the soft latch and watcher’s presence, culminating in the stash decision. The price is foregoing immediate confession and risking misinterpretation or loss. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; one meaningful narrowing occurs when she chooses concealment over confrontation. A slightly stronger on‑page jeopardy would raise the felt cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of integrity versus curiosity circulates through concrete motifs (tube, charts, “delayed disclosure”) and resolves in a non‑moralized stance. The quarantine zone mirrors ethical containment, reweighted by the final acceptance that truth can travel laterally. No sermonizing; resonance grows from image and choice. Ambiguity remains purposeful (who finds the tube, at what cost) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent lyric voice with a storm‑recorder’s lexicon; perception is selective and plausible to her expertise. Psychic distance is steady; elisions feel purposeful and paid off by the closing stance. No head‑hopping; the watcher remains silhouette/pressure, not leaked interiority. Rhythmic modulation at key beats (the kiss, the logging note) heightens effect.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with lines doing double duty (image + motive). Figurative language is lush yet mostly controlled; a few stacked metaphors flirt with excess but don’t blur sense. Minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies to manage momentum. Final cadence is precise and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorology ethics + quarantine aura + clandestine courier ritual, filtered through a lateral, non‑confrontational tactic. The tube and fountain cavity as moral instruments feel original. Risks a quiet, concept‑driven closure and lands it. Small uptick available if the external pressure cut deeper on the page.</comment>
