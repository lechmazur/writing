<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Arin’s motive—to preserve the color of wonder—drives concrete choices and culminates in a costly renunciation. Interiority is vivid (“surplus of vision felt like a leak”) and embodied through craft gestures. Internal contradiction is present but gentle rather than combative, making the sacrifice feel inevitable more than wrestled‑through. Still, the cost lands and the knife‑planting promises a meaningful renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: ritual actions intensify, the toll mounts, and the closure image (tree remains; Arin gone) lands with on‑page cost. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and causality flows from the weaving’s toll to the final loss. The Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration co‑exist cleanly: worlds rewoven, pruner surrendered. The price explicitly shapes the ending (“roots found the silvering in his bones”), satisfying the cost proof test.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The waterfall and parapet are not backdrop; spray prisms enable the weaving, and the cascade itself pauses then resumes, charging the final hush. Objects-as-setting (seed, copper threads, pruning knife) are tactically used and reprise at closure. Sensory detail is selective and character‑filtered through an orchardist’s craft lexicon. The setting constrains and reweights choices, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: bind two fraying realms or lose wonder. Escalation deepens via the toll (“hands began to silver,” “breath grew thin”), narrowing options toward sacrifice. The tightening is driven by Arin’s agency and craft, not coincidence. One clean intensification suffices at this length, though a sharper micro‑reversal could have amplified tension further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from grafting and reciprocation: preservation of wonder requires giving years back as sap. The orchard/cosmos braid reframes creativity as stewardship rather than extraction. Final images (children tasting starlight in cider) reprice prior motifs without stating a moral. Sentiment is earned through specificity and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is a controlled, luminous third-person with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft and ritual. Diction, rhythm, and image patterns stay consistent and modulate with pressure, avoiding head‑hopping. Lyric compression is taught early and sustained without opacity. A few high-flare metaphors flirt with excess but remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, action, theme) without loops. Figurative density is high but coherent and tethered to tactile action, with minimal redundancy. Syntax varies to pace beats, and the final cadence resolves motifs cleanly. Occasional stacked modifiers approach purple but don’t blur causality or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of orchard grafting with cosmic weaving feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The method of capturing “essences” as graft-stock is inventive and enacted, not merely declared. The legacy pivot (knife planted, tree remains) avoids cliché through specific, living images. Risk-taking in diction and conceit heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity.</comment>
