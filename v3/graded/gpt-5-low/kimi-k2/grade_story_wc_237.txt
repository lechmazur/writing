<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation—transform scars into stories before the rock falls—drives micro-choices under pressure (holding breath, tapping the quill, choosing to “shed”). Contradictory impulses—exhale vs. endurance, shame vs. agency—operate simultaneously. The final alteration (soft skin, book made of former scars) feels earned by on‑page effort. Slight neatness to the resolution keeps it shy of a 9.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and sustained; pressure coheres around the held breath and rune‑making. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration on the page: scars become a book, the rock rises, rain arrives—paid for by lung‑burning endurance and risk of plummet. Orientation is clean and the causal chain is consistent within the story’s rules. The cost is legible at the ending beat (“lungs burned,” “molten glass inside her ribs”).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The floating tea platform, lantern hush, and storm‑breath create a tactile, rule‑bearing environment that constrains choices (time window, no exhale) and charges the final image (rock ascends with stories shed). Details are selective and POV‑filtered (ink like melted starlight; lattice like frost). Setting evolves with action (lanterns, thunder, rain) and affects tactics. The quill, cedar plank, and inkstone function as micro‑setting tools.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit: complete the ceremony before breath breaks or fall. Escalation is crisp under the chosen lens: the platform lurch, crystallizing scars, the sky’s growl, lung pain—tightening toward a single decisive shedding. Agency resolves the conflict; coincidence does not. Costs are felt, though aftermath is tidy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting shame into narrative converges through concrete acts (runes, pages from scars, book settling). Recurring images reweight at the end (teardrop to feather; storm’s breath). A mild overtness in the closing sentence articulates the thesis, edging toward moralizing. Despite that, resonance lingers via the book and the dawnward drift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyrical voice is steady, textured, and modulates with pressure (hush to rain). Diction and imagery feel character‑bound to a rune scholar’s sensorium. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; compression is purposeful. Minor repetition (“crow quill trimmed tip”) is stylistically consistent, not disruptive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with vivid, controlled metaphors that mostly support clarity; rhythm breathes with the scene. Minimal scaffolding and no major loops; syntax varies and propulsion holds. A few stacked images risk lushness but remain coherent to the motif set. Clean mechanics and sharp line‑level control throughout.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: floating tea rite, storm‑breath timing, scars that crystallize into pages, and a book literally made of past failures. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the taught rules. Risks in imagery and conceit heighten stakes without obscuring sense. The final reconfiguration is both surprising and earned.</comment>
