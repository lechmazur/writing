<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elian’s motive—returning the last memory instead of selling it—emerges credibly from embodied grief and occupational history, with micro-choices (uncorking, pressing the vial to his lips) revealing values under pressure. Contradictory impulses (“aromatically cautious” vs. breathing it all) are dramatized, not told. The renunciation carries a visible cost: relinquishing the vial’s last memory and his broker identity. Slight idealization in the coda sands down rough edges of flaw but doesn’t undercut the earned turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on-page when he releases the drop, reconfiguring the premise—extinction becomes scent—and paying cost through relinquishment and identity shift. The sequence tightens through repeated UV surges and scent escalations, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with felt price. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the later shard reinforces the afterstate without reopening conflict.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse and UV lamps are sensorially vivid and integrated, with details filtered through a scent-broker’s priorities. The object-as-setting (vial) and environment jointly charge the final image (leaves rekindled as lanterns, empty vial). While the space doesn’t physically constrain access, it meaningfully frames the choice and payoff. Rich sensory layering avoids tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around whether to hoard or return the last memory; escalation is achieved through the scent deepening and the UV lights’ cadence shifts. The decisive act (uncorking and releasing) forecloses his old path with cost and recasts the stake from commerce to restitution. Tension is internal but present at line and beat scales. No antagonist is needed; the live trade-off is legible.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Memory as seed and commodity is embodied through action and then repriced at the end into elegy; the final glow reweights prior motifs without didactic explanation. The line “every scent is a seed, and every tear is rain” courts moralizing, but it’s earned by accumulated particulars and housed in character voice. Subtext in images (pressed grief, lantern leaves) does most of the work. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality by tying insight to cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and sensory bias fits a scent-broker’s mind; psychic distance modulates purposefully under peak beats. No head‑hopping; elision patterns (UV dim/surge) are taught and legible. Diction is consistent and tonally apt, avoiding register drift. The coda retains coherence while widening scope.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet purposeful, with varied syntax and few redundancies; images pull double duty for mood and meaning. Occasional recurrence (“crystal shadows,” “ultraviolet”) is patterned rather than looped. Figurative language stays coherent; no mixed metaphors muddy closure. Minor lushness doesn’t impede momentum or clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lantern-broker economy of scent-memory inside a greenhouse for extinct plants feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The revaluation of extinction into fragrance and back into bloom is an elegant, non‑obvious synthesis. Risks in lyric mode and concept are fully integrated with character and stakes. The final image refreshes familiar memory themes through a new apparatus.</comment>
