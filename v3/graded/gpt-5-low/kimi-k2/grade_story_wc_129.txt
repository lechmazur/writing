<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lira’s longing for witness and kinship motivates every choice, and her embodied “luminescent ache” keeps emotion concrete. The reveal that each reed bears the name of a vanished witness adds specificity and vulnerability. Internal contradiction (solitary artist seeking community) is present but lightly pressured. The change—accepting translucence to let others’ light pass—feels earned, though the cost remains mostly emotional, not contested on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds by arrival and contribution, culminating in “Now we are the tag,” a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when). The closure is on-page and the price—relinquishing solitude and exposing one’s work to communal ownership—reads. Slight softness in causal tightening keeps it just short of extraordinary.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and integrated into action: they lower voices, shape materials, and charge the final image. World rules (singing crystal, glasswork) are learned through use rather than exposition. The environment constrains behavior (quiet, delicate handling) and supplies resources (glass, obsidian) that define tactics. Rich, purposeful sensory choices avoid postcard description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—belonging versus solitude—is signaled early and deepens when Arbor’s glyph appears, forcing a choice to act together. Escalation arrives through communal making and the vow scene, not via antagonism; it still narrows options by binding identity to the tag. The price is vulnerability and shared authorship rather than loss or conflict. Pressure is coherent but gentle, so tension never fully bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of witness, chosen kinship, and art’s communal demand emerge organically from particulars (names woven into reeds; strangers adding offerings). The final reweighting—becoming the tag—answers the opening ache without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and offerings does the work; the “you were expected” coda extends resonance into time. A few lines lean close to thesis-stating but remain supported by scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person lyric voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that fits Lira’s sensibility. Dialogue is spare but natural, advancing meaning (“Arbor signs where strangers decide to become kin”). Rhythm and diction modulate well from hush to dawn‑lift without head‑hopping. No stance leaks or register jolts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet purposeful; images carry multiple functions (reed, glass, arbor as body). Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing keep momentum. A high figurative density flirts with purple but stays coherent, with no metaphor clashes or cadence loops. Final lines land cleanly without scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—street art as kinship sigil in a mineral orchard, a sculptor weaving named reeds—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in worldbuilding and lyric tone heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Key turns arise from established materials and desires rather than late rule changes. Only the low‑friction conflict tempers the sense of radical ingenuity.</comment>
