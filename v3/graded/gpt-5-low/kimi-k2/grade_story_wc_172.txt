<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lira’s contradictions—amoral architect of drought yet secretly sentimental—are dramatized in action (the egg to ear; the water poured; the refusal to re‑seal the sky). Her final renunciation (“she could have stopped it…but she stood motionless”) carries visible cost and feels earned. Embodied emotion (salt nest, iron scent, boots creaking) grounds the interiority. No hedging: she loses her empire to honor a fragile echo.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Hybrid drive: accumulative lyric density with clear causal triggers (egg → note → ground’s harmonic → water returns). Closure is decisive and on‑page: she chooses not to command the orbital array, ending her drought scheme. Cost is explicit and tied to prior setup, with the final image reweighted by that loss. Orientation is clean early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The salt flat, cracks, and feather‑shaped crystals are tactile and taught through action, not catalogued. Environment constrains tactics (following the cracked “map,” dissolving salt into brine) and charges the ending (river refilling its ghost; feather under newborn water). Weather and terrain actively affect outcomes. Specific sensory cues (wet reeds, iron, old bone sky) reinforce tone without excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—beauty/echo versus profit/power—is flagged early and tightened through concrete steps (placing the egg, pouring contraband water, the song summoning the river). The key pressure point is her withheld command to reseal the sky, a costly renunciation. Internal and external stakes braid cleanly. Tension escalates sentence‑by‑sentence to the charged refusal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Beauty preserved as echo versus exploitation deepens through recurring images (egg, feathers, mirror, fractures) that reprice meaning at the end. The piece resists moral neatness while landing an earned stance; “a gift that cost her everything” is dramatized, not preached. The final feather and rain offer a resonant, non‑literal answer to whether echoes can redeem harm. Subtext hums in the ground’s “song” answering her act.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Close third with controlled lyricism; diction and rhythm modulate under pressure without head‑hopping. The perceptual signature—techno‑tyrant with tenderness—remains consistent and biases what’s noticed. Patterned elisions and metaphors are taught early and paid off at closure. No dialogue needed; the voice itself carries action and subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: high information density, varied cadence, and images that pull double duty. A few intensities press close to purple but remain coherent; momentum rarely stalls. The final fragment “a fractured grace sharp” reads slightly jagged, momentarily distracting at the last beat. Overall propulsion and clarity hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—black‑market egg, engineered drought, salt‑map cartography, and a sonic reawakening—feels rare and inevitable in hindsight. Turns grow from established particulars and her agency rather than late rule changes. Risks in tone and conceit heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity prevents the premise from reading like mere allegory.</comment>
