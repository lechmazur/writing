<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elias’s reticence, skepticism about ghosts, and caretaker ethic create a credible, felt interior engine. His micro-choices—stacking stones, setting the sea glass on the lens, deciding to “bottle” safety—align with his learned codes and deepen under pressure. The contradiction of believing in tides, not ghosts, yet heeding the widow lands as earned evolution, not a flip. The visible cost is accepting the ache’s stewardship inside himself.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: letters, stones, and ghostly presence intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration as he literally bottles safety and commits to ongoing duty. Orientation is clear by the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost via the flask marked “Return” and the vow to keep the chain. The tightening is modest but purposeful: the widow’s gesture forces an action beyond his usual stone code.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lantern room, lens, sea scents, and lilac haunt actively shape choice; the widow’s presence constrains tactics and redirects from a purely material fix to a soulful one. Tools/objects (lens, sea glass, flask) function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection is precise and character-filtered (tides, ballast stones, bilge). The setting’s rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving safety—tightens when the haunting demands more than his established stone grammar. The escalation is quiet but real: from routine signaling to internalizing and decanting an ache into a flask, a choice with ongoing cost. No reversals per se, but the widow’s intervention reweights options and compels a deeper commitment. The lack of external peril (no active storm) caps intensity but suits the piece’s mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around custodianship, communal safety, and translating care into tangible ritual. Recurring images (stones, glass, letters, lilac) reprice themselves at the end without moralizing. The final act—“I keep the light, and the light keeps me”—reads as earned, not slogan. Subtext of grief-work and inheritance (mother’s codes, widow’s ache) deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through a seafarer’s perceptions; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Patterned images are taught early and reprise cleanly. No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions feel intentional. The brief dialogue fragment is spare and true to character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density and vivid metaphors that mostly serve motion and image. A few lush vehicles (“throat that had swallowed the moon,” “luminescent ache”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or cadence ruts; syntax varies and propels. Punctuation and mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh fusion of maritime signaling, anonymous care-chains, and the literal bottling of safety feels organic and surprising. The haunted lens and sea glass function as newly charged ritual objects rather than genre décor. The final “Return” etching reframes the premise with inevitability. Risk-taking is quiet but sure-footed, avoiding template beats.</comment>
