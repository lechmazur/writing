<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent desire (“rediscover the wild frontier of her mind”) drives concrete choices (choosing DELUSION, inserting the gear). Interiority is vivid and embodied, with a credible surrender of identity as cost. The internal contradiction—craving wilderness vs. the city’s certainty—animates the path choice and the renunciation of the map. A slightly softer depiction of simultaneous push–pull under peak stress keeps it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural structure tightens coherently from awakening → delusion path → “unravel” → gear insertion → repricing of the forest. Closure lands on the page as a conceptual repricing with cost: she surrenders name, regrets, and the map, and does not return. Orientation is early and steady despite the surrealism. Recurring constraints (gear/orchid, rainforest’s humidity and sorting) shape the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is richly specific and functionally constraining (humidity at 42%, labeled conveyor belts, fork toward DELUSION, brass orchid). The gear-as-object and orchid micro‑setting decisively channel the climactic act. Sensory detail is purposeful, filtered by the protagonist’s technical/philosophical bias. The final re-seeing (symbiotic, not mechanical) recharges earlier specifics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are singular and legible: either preserve certainty or risk the mind’s wild frontier. Pressure escalates via choice points and a deepening instruction (“unravel”) that exacts a visible price (loss of name, identity anchors). The tightening is earned by her agency, culminating in inserting the gear and surrendering the map. The conflict remains largely internal and lyric in register, slightly softening felt jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme (certainty vs. discovery; frontier as direction) emerges through action and image, not lecture, with the forest’s repricing aligning with her renunciation. The binary “frontier/direction” aphorism on the leaf edges toward overt statement but is grounded diegetically. Subtext accrues in the hum shifting to a maternal lullaby, tying curiosity to lineage and cost. Resonance is strong without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with disciplined control and consistent psychic distance; diction and rhythm suit the character’s mind. Patterned motifs (hum, wind through trees) are taught early and paid off. No head‑hopping or register drift; compression remains legible. The modulations in cadence mirror escalation without opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with precise, fresh images (“humidity to 42%,” “sorting stations labeled MEMORY, DELUSION, and TOOL”). Figurative language is abundant but coherent and largely purposeful; momentum rarely stalls. Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep cause/effect clear. Slight lushness in the middle avoids purple but approaches saturation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest, probabilistic macaws, and humidity-as-doubt are original and integrated beyond ornament. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (the gear’s final use, repricing of the forest). Risk‑taking in form and imagery heightens stakes without losing clarity. The synthesis reads singular rather than stitched from familiar templates.</comment>
