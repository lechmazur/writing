<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (guarding the sister’s memory while seeking rest) drives concrete choices: ensconcing, planting the postcard, compiling the chapbook, and finally stepping outside. Interiority is vivid and embodied through oceanic, tactile images rather than labels. Contradictory impulses—rest without erasure—persist until the earned armistice. The felt cost (centuries of insomnia and surrendering the vigil’s rigidity) is legible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring images (postcard, shell, wind-lullabies) thicken toward a conceptual repricing—the treaty is between memory and forgetting. Closure lands on the page as he steps outside and feels the armistice “settle…like a seed,” with cost implied by relinquishing total vigilance. Orientation is taught early (who/where/what) and maintained. A minor text artifact (“He” fragment) follows a fully landed ending and does not collapse closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ammonite shell is integral: it shapes sound (off‑key wind), access (smallest chamber), and tactics (planting the postcard in a crack), and charges the final image (glowing lantern). Sensory specificity is rich across modalities (scent of wisteria/gunpowder, bioluminescent poems, liquid‑night trunk). World rules remain consistent and are learned through use. The environment constrains and enables choices, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting grief without erasure—is clear and escalates via density: wind’s verses → planting → vine → dream revelation → chapbook → stepping outside. The realization forecloses a path (eternal sleepless vigil) in favor of earned stasis with cost. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without needing antagonists. The postcard’s dissolution and renunciation of rigid mourning mark a strong tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief’s transformation and the ethics of remembering deepens through concrete particulars (photosynthesis, star‑flowers, “reef‑shadow joy”). The reweighting—armistice between memory and forgetting—arrives via dream and is enacted in choices, not sermonized. The ending’s seed image invites lingering reflection without tidy moralizing. A single explicit sentence states the insight but is earned and not reductive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice sustains across the piece, with marine/celestial lexicon that matches POV and world. Psychic distance is steady; patterned elisions are taught early and paid off. Rhythm modulates with pressure; syntax remains legible. Minor risk of lushness is managed; no head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is luminous, with high information density and purposeful figurative language. A few moments brush purple but remain coherent and character-inflected. The final stray “He” is a copy artifact that slightly mars the last beat’s polish. Otherwise, cadence and clarity carry momentum without loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: ammonite cathedral, galaxy postcard sprouting constellations, and “blossom armistice” feel singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes and coherence without obscuring clarity. Turns grow organically from established motifs and choices. Emotional truth lands without cliché.</comment>
