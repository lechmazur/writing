<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vale’s motive—maintaining “affectionate detachment” while selling curated feelings—is clear and pressurized by the buyer’s clean curiosity. Contradictory impulses act on the page: she both sells the lie and is pierced by an unfiltered need. Her micro‑choices with the blotter (grounding, then trying to seal, then finally taking the buyer’s hand) read as earned. A slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in peak beats keeps this just short of elite.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: static → blotter absorption → swelling/dissolution → hand‑taking. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: “to feel truly with another is to lose the privilege of distance,” paid by relinquishing her practiced insulation. The grotto, blotter, and static provide a persistent constraint shaping tactics and final image. No orientation debt; causality is lyrical but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto is tactile and operative: resinous walls hum with diffusing feelings and dusk’s “copper breath” modulates tone. The blotter petal functions as micro‑setting; its dissolution physically releases half‑truths and forces the final stance. Sensory selection matches Vale’s profession and urgency. Environment charges the last image rather than decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect detachment vs. accept costly empathy) is signaled early and tightened as the blotter over‑absorbs and dissolves. The key turn arises from Vale’s agency in taking the buyer’s hand, foreclosing the dealer/client distance. Cost is legible: surrender of her survival method. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but it’s coherent and sufficient at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme integrates through particulars—bottled grief, half‑truth labels, static as ersatz attunement—culminating in authentic connection. The echo of theft (“Noble Sorrow (vintage)”) reweights prior actions with ethical cost. One explicit line (“to feel truly…lose the privilege of distance”) tilts toward moral statement, slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the final image carries resonance without tidy absolution.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a precise professional lexicon grounds perception; imagery patterns (resin, static, dissolution) stay coherent. Dialogue is sparse, pressurized, and subtextual (“I want the formula…”). Psychic distance tightens appropriately without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well from poised description to charged staccato at the end.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and often do multiple jobs; images mostly cohere around resin/static/chemistry. A few moments verge on purple or abstraction, and one repeated clause (“as the transformation completes”) reads ornamental. Momentum remains intact, and clarity holds through the climax. Minor overwriting keeps this just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The counterfeit‑emotion dealer, static as empathic sensor, and blotter‑petal as catalyst are fresh and organically fused to character and stakes. The moral calculus (commodifying grief) turns non‑obviously into a personal reckoning. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight because the system’s own mechanics undo her. Bold but coherent choices elevate without gimmickry.</comment>
