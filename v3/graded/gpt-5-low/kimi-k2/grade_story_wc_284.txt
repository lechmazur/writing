<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motives are clean and embodied: he withholds the pill, follows codes, burns the violet, climbs, and offers the apology. “Prudently daring” shows in tactile micro‑choices (testing snow impressions, careful descent). The relationship crucible pays off with a credible renunciation of defensive secrecy. Minor risk of epigrammatic reflection, but it’s anchored in concrete action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with an accumulative lyric build toward a charged poise: the clue‑trail tightens options and culminates in the pillbox click. Orientation is clear from line one; the throughline (Return/compass) coheres. Cost lands as risked trust before proof and the surrender of control to Mara’s terms. The smoke‑spelled “Roof” borders on contrived but doesn’t break causality or closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting does real work: mist muffles, wet stone alters movement, snow preserves code, rusted ladder groans under risk. The pillbox as micro‑setting/object charges the final image. Seasonal tilt and lifting mist reweight the ending without preaching. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, not a catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—risking vulnerability to repair trust—tightens through the escalating breadcrumb code to a climb and a relational bet. The meaningful turn is the decision to ignite the violet and then to offer the pillbox (trust before proof). Prices are primarily emotional and conceptual rather than physical, but they’re felt. Slightly soft external pressure keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Recurring images (compass, “Return,” unused courage) develop a coherent theme of repair through trace, not erasure. However, the explicit line “Fixing what’s broken… tracing it until it became a map” states the thesis and trims ambiguity. Subtext in actions (sharing the pillbox, not taking the antidote) does most of the good work. The final lifting mist and joined compass reprice the earlier material effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; no head‑hopping. Dialogue is minimal but natural and charged with subtext (antidote/apology exchange). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure—quicker on the climb, more spacious at the reunion. Elevated language fits the POV’s sensibility and stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum; images are vivid and purposeful. Occasional purple density (“drum wrapped in wool,” repeated “silver hush”) brushes excess but doesn’t occlude sense. Syntax varies and avoids loops or scaffolding. The smoke‑spelling beat risks ornamental flourish yet remains clear on the page.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Spycraft meets pastoral lyric with fresh, specific touches (rice‑paper code in snow, pillbox halves, burning a violet to read “Roof”). The reunion turn feels earned by prior particulars. Risks in imagery and structure heighten resonance without gimmickry. A few symbolic moves read familiar, but synthesis feels singular.</comment>
