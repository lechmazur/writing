<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lin’s pacifist ethos motivates every tactic—stitching, naming wounds, sacrificing the relic—with embodied beats (floating as sorrow lightens). The internal conflict is quieter than it could be; she rarely wavers, so ambiguity is limited. Still, the offer of the Tear reads as a credible, costly choice. Echo’s nudges don’t undercut her agency.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned acts (stitching, naming, offering) deepen pressure toward a clear on‑page closure. The Decisive Change lands when she dissolves the Tear to open the door; cost is explicit. Orientation is clean from the first lines (ship, Lin, chapel, AI), and set‑ups (photos, sigil) pay off. A minor truncation on the final word does not harm closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The recycled ship palpably shapes action: emergency blanket provides thread; airlock sigil dictates method; hydroponics and the creaking hull texture stakes. Objects-as-setting (Kwan Yin’s Tear, photographs) directly constrain choices and charge the ending image (garden on weapon bones). World rules (gravity tied to joy) are consistent and meaningfully reprise. Sensory detail is vivid without touristic excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking the sealed dimension through shadow work—is signaled early and tightens through stitching, the corridor of shadows, and the final offer. The price (relinquishing the Tear) is unmistakable and grows organically from earlier beats. Pressure is coherent; no coincidences resolve the problem. A single, clean deepening rather than multiple reversals fits the form.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of pacifism as relentless presence and grief transmuted to mercy emerge through images and acts (naming wounds → lanterns; garden on weapon bones). The AI’s line “Only the unflinching mirror of memory can pry it open” edges toward stating theme but is earned by subsequent dramatization. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around what the opened space costs beyond the Tear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is controlled and consistent; metaphoric texture matches Lin’s sensibility. Echo’s brief, water‑light diction contrasts yet fits the tonal palette. Rhythm modulates well across escalation to a measured cadence at closure. No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with strong verbs and precise nouning; figurative density is high but coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing keep momentum. A small truncation on the last word and a few lush metaphors in proximity slightly nudge clarity. Overall, the read‑aloud rhythm and image economy are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Original synthesis: pacifist SF ritual where shadow work becomes a literal unlocking mechanism via stitched grief and a sacrificial tear. The threadwork of photographs and the gravity‑joy tie feel distinctive and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and mythic register pay off without obscuring sense. The final garden on weapon bones transcends trope.</comment>
