<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (save the archive, repair trust) is clear and drives concrete actions; her three-month silence and “carefully reckless” stance add credible tension. The embodied choices—writing promises, guiding melody to Arden, shattering the ink well—align with character and stakes. Arden’s turn (“I was afraid”) lands, but reads a touch swift and tidy, softening the crucible between them. A little more on-page friction or cost in his reversal would deepen the relational change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Hybrid drive leaning Causal: promises cause music; music draws Arden; his decision halts demolition; the shattering seals the shift. Closure is a Decisive Change (protection announced) plus a charged final image (“Listen”) with conceptual cost. The demolition crew’s pause and Arden’s rapid pivot feel convenient, trimming felt resistance. Still, the because/therefore chain holds and the ending lands on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The archive, cedar lectern, brittle tablets, and the ink well are vividly rendered and used functionally. The environment and objects shape tactics (binding promises through tablets; carrying the ink well) and charge the final image (shattering the glass). Sensory integration (sound as music, cedar, vellum) is purposeful and filtered through Lira’s profession. Strong specificity without tour-guide excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (save the archive by dawn) is present early and tightens with Arden’s entrance and the crews’ arrival. Escalation comes via accumulative music-to-collective binding, culminating in Arden’s public decision. However, resistance is limited—Arden yields quickly and the crews simply pause on hearing song—so the price is felt but light. A sharper test or trade-off at the threshold would raise pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Listening, truth, and promise-keeping thread through action rather than lecture, and the final “Listen” reweights the whole. The glass ink well’s transformation and sacrifice embody trust made active. A near-aphoristic line (“Trust is a symphony you must keep performing”) edges toward moralizing, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance persists without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature suits an arcane linguist focalizer. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure; dialogue is spare, subtextual, and functional. No head-hopping; elision patterns remain legible. Minor aphoristic flashes don’t break voice coherence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is musical, image-rich, and mostly disciplined; lines often carry multiple loads (world, action, theme). A few heightened metaphors (“tasting like starlight,” “silence with teeth”) verge on purple but stay coherent. No noticeable loops or scaffold; momentum is preserved. The aphoristic sentence in the final third trims the top end but doesn’t blunt closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The musical-ink/linguistic-promise engine feels fresh and integrated, transforming a familiar “save the archive” frame. The interconnected promises as social tech is an elegant, specific twist that pays off in the final image. Resolution is slightly smooth, but the conceptual synthesis is memorable. Risk-taking in form and conceit heightens cohesion without muddying clarity.</comment>
