<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motives are specific and evolving: from euthanasia tourist to listener of endings, her renunciation is earned by on‑page experiences (the storm, the droplets singing). Interiority is vivid and embodied (ice language, “fold in patience”) without therapy‑speak. Dialogue is minimal but distinct (“Your ending is not here”) and redirects her. The cost—staying to listen “until the last floe melts”—lands as a lived commitment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: the parasol tip, ice sounds, and storms accrue toward a reconfiguration. Closure lands when Mara accepts endurance over escape (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis) with a visible cost. Orientation is clean from the first line; causal links (storm → trawler → old woman’s guidance → listening) hold. The final image reweights prior beats without explaining them away.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina and storm are tactically present, constraining movement (sandbag chain, bucking pier) and enabling the listening ritual. The parasol tip functions as a charged tool/object‑as‑setting in the final image. Sensory detail is balanced (salt, diesel, creaks, black water) and filtered through Mara’s priorities. Environmental shifts (rising wind, rearranged floes) track causally and charge choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—death as destination vs. death as companion—tightens through the storm and the old woman’s verdict. The deepening occurs when the droplets “sing,” reconfiguring what Mara seeks; her agency is to refuse the easy exit and choose endurance. The price is ongoing: staying to listen in a perilous, grinding environment. External and internal conflicts braid cleanly without clutter.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: endings as a progression rather than a chord; dignity reframed as attention. Subtext works in images (trawling darkness with lace; refugees; sealskin as sail) rather than moralizing, though “endings were not destinations but companions” edges toward explicitness. The final shadow‑net image reweights the premise. Complexity persists: solace and labor co‑exist with loss.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A consistent close third with a distinct perceptual signature (industrial‑lyric diction, ice‑listening) sustains pressure. Rhythm modulates with the storm; dialogue is spare and effective. No head‑hopping; certainty stays within Mara’s grasp, with purposeful inference around the old woman. Elision (days into weeks) feels earned and supports the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images are precise and fresh (droplets singing specific registers of loss). A few repeated phrases (“windborne solace”) verge on recurrence but function as motif rather than churn. Syntax varies and propels. Figurative logic remains coherent under pressure, especially in the listening/trawling sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—euthanasia tourism reframed through an arctic relief marina and a lace parasol that ‘hears’ endings—is arrestingly original. Turns arise from established motifs, not late rule changes. The choice to stay and listen provides non‑obvious, inevitable closure in hindsight. Risk is high but controlled, with lyric strangeness serving character and stakes.</comment>
