<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Emilia’s interior tilt from doubt to purpose is legible, but it’s achieved largely through summarized reflection rather than embodied micro‑choices under pressure. The “forgiving skeptic” trait never meaningfully constrains her behavior; she accepts the tooth’s promise with minimal friction. The nostalgia/innovation tension is named but not dramatized in action. The final resolve to embark feels pleasant yet low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens fits: a reflective scene that crescendos to a symbolic resolve. Orientation is clean (Emilia, hedge maze, secret garden) and the tooth recurs to frame closure. Closure is a mild Resonant Reconfiguration—newfound purpose—but the cost is faint and no option is truly foreclosed. The “substitute body” thread is gestured at without structural consequence, leaving causal pressure thin.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze provide a tranquil, slightly numinous atmosphere that suits the reflective mode. Details are serviceable but skew generalized—vibrant flowers, lush greenery—more postcard than lived‑in specificity. The tooth functions as micro‑setting via object recurrence that charges the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains or redirects choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain internal and largely declarative; there’s no credible tightening or loss that reshapes options. The tooth’s “power to reveal hidden truths” never forces a choice or consequence, and the “substitute body” has no on‑page pressure. The turn is essentially “she decides to feel purposeful,” with no price. As a result, tension is low and escalation minimal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Themes of transforming error into beauty and balancing nostalgia with innovation are explicit, sometimes slogan‑like (“turn mistakes into constellations”). Resonance arises more from repeated assertion than from subtext in image or action. The final glow of the tooth offers a modest symbolic lift but little reframing cost. Overall, sincere but close to platitude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent; the lyrical register is even, if generic. The voice lacks a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature—phrasing leans toward abstraction and stock cadences. Still, it’s clear and controlled, with no head‑hopping. Rhythm is steady but could vary more to track emotional pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentences are clean and readable, but there’s redundancy (“the changeling’s baby tooth still in hand” recurs; nostalgia/innovation is reiterated). Abstractions and modifiers often substitute for concrete action, reducing momentum. Figurative language is restrained but also safe; information density is moderate. Tightening loops and sharpening images would lift propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The changeling tooth + bone‑setting + secret garden cocktail hints at originality, but these parts remain ornamental rather than integrative. The arc—a reflective epiphany toward purpose—is familiar. Moments like “turn mistakes into constellations” aim for freshness yet read as ready‑phrases. With the tooth or bone‑setting made tactically consequential, uniqueness would rise.</comment>
