<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emilia’s motives (skeptic drawn to decode the tile) are clear, but internal contradiction and cost are minimal. Her “courageously kind determination” is told rather than dramatized under pressure. Micro‑choices exist (searching, transcribing), yet they never force a trade‑off. The end registers a gentle reorientation rather than an earned, costly change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the piece builds through transcription beats toward completion and conceptual repricing. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when are legible), and the closure—peace settling as memories “given a voice”—lands, though lightly. Causal turns are scant; progression reads as steady rather than tightening. Cost at the end is implied (endurance, relinquishing doubt) more than felt on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower, sea, and whale migration produce a consistent, immersive atmosphere filtered through Emilia’s task. Recurring objects (tile, latticework, whales’ song) charge the final image. While the environment seldom constrains choices, it frames and flavors them effectively. Sensory palette leans auditory and visual in a purposeful way.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily conceptual (unlocking “entangled memories”), with little on‑page resistance or narrowing of options. Transcription proceeds smoothly; no reversal tests her commitment. The end grants resolution without a visible price or foreclosed path. Tension remains low and largely static.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Patterns, memory, and song cohere into a clear theme of connection and reconfiguration. Resonance arises in the final melding of whales’ song and symbols. However, several lines tip into thesis‑like abstraction (“the very fabric of reality”) rather than letting subtext carry it. The insight feels earned but cushioned by summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Third‑person close is stable and suitably lyrical. Diction is consistent, though occasionally elevated to generic mysticism. Rhythm is smooth but sometimes uniform, with repeated abstract constructions. The voice remains coherent through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Readable, with some vivid images, yet the prose leans on repeated abstractions and recycled phrases (“unheard symphony,” “fabric,” “tapestry,” “alchemy”). Paraphrase loops and intensifiers appear without adding new pressure. Figurative density occasionally blurs specificity. Momentum is steady but not sharply honed.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Magic square tile + whales + tower is a pleasing synthesis, but many moves feel familiar. The transcription conceit adds a modestly fresh angle. Risk remains low: implications are gestured at more than pushed into surprising consequence. The final image is graceful rather than startling.</comment>
