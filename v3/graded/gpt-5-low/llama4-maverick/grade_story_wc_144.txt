<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Emilia’s motive—to make the hummingbird fly true—is clear and consistently pursued through tactile calibration and programming tweaks. Her blindness colors method but rarely imposes cost, and internal conflict is minimal to nonexistent. The competence-forward portrayal flattens tension, though the tactile, vibration-guided work offers specificity. The final touch on the drone reads earned but emotionally untested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single scene, anchored early, with an accumulative/textural drive that culminates in the drone’s steadiness. Closure arrives as an earned stasis/charged poise image—the drone hovering—but on-page cost is faint; coincidence with the ship’s launch adds aura rather than pressure. Causality holds at the scale attempted (adjustments → improved response → final tweak). The lack of a visible price at the end limits impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The depot’s mist, fountain, and refracted light are vivid and filtered through Emilia’s tactile focus. Crucially, the fountain/light refraction method is not merely atmospheric—it directly shapes tactics and charges the final image. Sensory integration is strong beyond the visual, with vibration and sound textures. World rules stay consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—calibrate the drone—remains coherent but low-pressure. Escalation is a gentle intensification (“light became more vivid,” “responses grew more precise”), with no real narrowing of options or credible risk. The ship’s anchor and auspicious timing do not apply pressure, and no tangible cost is paid. Resolution is competent rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Harmony between craft and environment is threaded through mist, water, and vibration motifs, re-weighted in the final hover. The piece resists overt moralizing and lets the images carry meaning. However, the resonance leans tidy, with little counter-pressure or complexity to trouble the calm. The auspicious ship moment reads symbolic more than transformative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, lyric cadence that suits Emilia’s methodical attention. The perceptual signature (touch/vibration/aural) feels character-true, though a few repeated constructions dull edge. No head-hopping or register drift; stance remains controlled. The calm rhythm risks monotony under peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clean sentences and purposeful images carry momentum, with occasional paraphrase loops (“beacon of calm,” mist refrains) and mild purple lean. Information density is adequate; some lines do one job where two would sharpen. Rhythm is steady, perhaps too uniform for peak turns. Copy is clean with clear action order.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A blind artisan decoding a drone via water-refraction is a fresh synthesis; the fountain-as-tool is memorable. The ship’s maiden-voyage counterpoint is a distinctive but non-pressuring flourish. Emotional truth skews serene over conflicted, keeping the innovation more conceptual than dramatic. Still, the specificity of method elevates the piece beyond template.</comment>
