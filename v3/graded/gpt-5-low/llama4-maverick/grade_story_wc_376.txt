<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent (she seeks candor and the “place where lost conversations go”), but interior conflict is minimal and mostly summarized. Embodied emotion appears rarely, with little contradiction under pressure. The final change to “newfound purpose” is stated rather than earned through on‑page strain. Choices read as steady, not contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean; the map → tunnels → repository sequence coheres and lands in a quiet RR/CR (repricing of truth/candor). Cost at closure is mostly conceptual; the scene avoids a concrete price beyond fatigue/decay atmosphere. The piece reads more as narrated progression than pressured causality.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid, specific worldbuilding (toxic mist, greenhouse undercroft, corroded zinc plate) saturates the piece and charges the final image. The environment modestly constrains action (decay, labyrinth), though it seldom forces tactical choices. Sensory selection aligns with Aria’s priorities. Rules feel consistent and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear but pressure scarcely tightens; obstacles and trade‑offs are summarized rather than dramatized. There’s no decisive on‑page loss or foreclosed option; the journey unfolds without meaningful reversal or cost. The “treacherous tunnels” do not generate a concrete squeeze that alters tactics.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of truth, preservation of intimacy, and the ethics of memory recur through images (gilded scripts, lost conversations, palimpsest). Some lines verge on direct statement, but the repository scene reweights earlier motifs effectively. Resonance is real though somewhat declared at the end. (Capped by modest pressure.)</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the diction consistent, with occasional lyric lift that fits the world. The voice is competent but leans generic summary over distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue; rhythm is steady but rarely modulates under stress. Elision is legible but not especially charged.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clean, readable sentences with some evocative turns (“palimpsest,” “misty rain continued to fall”). Repetitive scaffolds (“As she…,” “The…”) and summary loops slightly dull momentum. Figurative language stays coherent, but density and propulsion are mid‑range. Final lines are clear but could compress and sharpen.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—calligrapher whose ink reacts to dishonesty, zinc postal plate, repository of conversations—is fresh and memorable. Execution favors safe summary over risked scene, limiting impact. Still, the premise feels singular and thematically aligned. The palimpsest/map conceit pays off conceptually.</comment>
