<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The balladeer’s motive (to articulate unspoken needs by contacting the ghost in code) is clear and consistent, with tactile choices (picking up the plate, deciding to encode on the bench). However, interiority leans generalized and declarative (“to articulate unspoken needs”) rather than character‑particular under stress. There’s little contradictory impulse or visible cost to complicate her drive. The final self‑recognition lands but feels lightly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean and the piece tightens from tranquil attention to storm‑charged creation; closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (mural complete; ghost’s breeze response; she departs changed). The because/therefore is soft, but the density and cadence shift are legible. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page, muting the payoff.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The courtyard above clouds, wet stone/ozone, statues, mist, and storm are vivid and consistent, integrated with action (charcoal on stone, flicker of lightning, hum/vibrations). Atmosphere elevates the stakes of communion, and the bolt plate recurs to charge the ending. The environment rarely constrains tactics; it mainly charges tone and image. Sensory economy and specificity are strong for length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is to communicate with the entity; escalation occurs via storm intensification and increasingly frenzied art. Yet options do not materially narrow and no on‑page price is paid; the pressure is more mood than consequence. The ghost’s response arrives without a real test or trade‑off, keeping tension modest. A single, sharper cost or risk during the encoding would lift this.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of expression as translation, code as haunting, and self‑discovery through making accrue plausibly through images and repeated “encoding” motifs. However, the piece often states its themes outright (“to articulate unspoken needs”) instead of letting subtext carry them. The final breeze/mural image resonates but remains comfortable. A thornier ambiguity or price would deepen the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV and stance are stable with a consistent lyric register; image patterns (mist, hum, ozone, “tinkersong”) recur coherently. Rhythm is readable, though syntactic repetition and similar clause structures creep in under pressure. Diction suits the mode but sometimes slides toward generic mystical phrasing. No head‑hopping or stance leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean and largely clear, but paraphrase loops and generalized modifiers (“mystical nexus,” “otherworldly hum,” “charged with electricity”) dilute force. Figurative density clusters without escalation payoff, and several sentences restate prior content. Momentum sags in the middle due to reiterated intent statements. Stronger verb choice and cut scaffolding would sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>“Ghost in code” conversing via graffiti in a cloud‑courtyard is a fresh fusion, and the bolt plate as a charged object adds texture. Execution stays safe: the communion proceeds without surprising friction, and images lean familiar. The concept promises a non‑obvious reweighting of self/tech/ritual that the scene only partially delivers. Still, the aesthetic synthesis is distinctive enough to register.</comment>
