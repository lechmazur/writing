<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (uncover where unused love is stored), and the choice to perform psychometry follows. However, interior conflict is minimal; the crystal gazer meets little resistance and makes few pressured micro‑choices. Emotions are largely summarized in lyrical terms rather than embodied contradictions. The final acceptance/renunciation cost is faint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to a conceptual repricing—goodbye letters reframe as enduring love absorbed by the gazer. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the pattern (object → trance → re‑entry) is legible. Closure lands quietly with a reweighted final image; cost is implied (taking on the “unused love”) but not strongly dramatized. The causal chain is light but coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The projection booth is vivid (celluloid scent, reels, hum) and the film strip functions as a charged object. The setting permeates tone and frames the trance but rarely constrains choice. Environmental details evolve slightly (thunder outside, projector hum) and charge the final image. Strong atmosphere, modest functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is understood, and pressure accumulates (letters swarm, air thickens, melody coalesces). Yet escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options or a trade‑off; the gazer isn’t forced to sacrifice or choose between competing goods. The turn is primarily a mood deepening rather than a tested commitment. Stakes remain abstract, so tension never truly bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Resonance arises from the film/letter imagery, culminating in a conceptual reweighting of love as energy carried forward. However, the theme is repeatedly stated in overt terms (“a testament to the enduring power of love”), edging into moralizing. Subtext yields to declaration at key moments. The ending’s image works, but subtlety is undercut by explicit theses.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent; lyric register suits the premise. Diction and rhythm are controlled but somewhat uniform and incantatory, with repeated constructions and phrases. No dialogue to test modulation or subtext. The voice is competent, if a touch generalized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Line‑level clarity holds and images are coherent, but redundancy (“enduring power of love,” “unused love”) and template stems reduce propulsion. Figurative density skews purple in places without adding new information. Rhythm is steady rather than dynamically varied, and a few paragraphs paraphrase prior content. Clean but not taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The psychometry‑via‑film in a vintage booth is a pleasing synthesis, and the visual of suspended letters is striking. Still, the arc resolves to a familiar epiphany about enduring love without a non‑obvious moral calculus or surprising turn. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural. Freshness is present in texture more than in outcome.</comment>
