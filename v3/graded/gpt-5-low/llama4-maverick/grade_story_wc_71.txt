<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—Eli’s compulsion to understand “alive” houses—but interiority leans abstract and low-conflict. Her choices (buying the shard, performing the ritual) align with that aim, yet contradictory impulses or cost are underplayed. Embodied emotion is muted, with generalized awe more than character-particular texture. The change at the end is asserted as humbling rather than dramatized with a felt price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: sensory density builds from bay to shop to ritual to expanded perception. Orientation is clean and the throughline is coherent, but the closure’s cost is light (a realization without a meaningful price). The final reconfiguration (“the house as living entity”) lands conceptually, not decisively. One tightening (twilight to night, increased attunement) suffices but lacks bite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid—the quiet bay, perfumery, and streetlights “daydreaming” create a consistent, lyrical world. The shard functions as a charged object and carries through to the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics; it mostly bathes the action in mood. Specific sensory textures could be more character-filtered under pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes (understanding a house’s aliveness) remain largely internal and face minimal resistance. Escalation is a gentle deepening of attention; there’s no credible trade-off or foreclosed option. The ritual proceeds without complication, so tension stays low. The final insight doesn’t force a new cost calculus on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres around sanctity, attention, and the “hush” of living spaces, with the shard as a conduit. The last image reframes the house conceptually, though it borders on telling (“not just a physical structure”). Subtext exists in the quiet ritual and object placement. The resonance is pleasant but not piercing due to low on-page cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is steady, lyrical, and appropriate to a noticing character; no head-hopping or stance slips. Diction is controlled, if occasionally generic (“latent energy,” “forever changed”). Rhythm is calm and consistent with the piece’s aims. Voice could sharpen with more character-specific idiolect to distinguish Eli beyond mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean and largely fluent, but abstractions and repeated formulations (“hush,” “energy,” “alive”) dilute precision. Some paraphrase-like restating slows momentum (“sensed,” “realized,” “understood”). Imagery is competent yet sometimes leans purple without adding actionable detail. No grammatical issues, but density could do more work per sentence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The perfumery/orris root shard plus sanctification via displaced objects offers a fresh angle. The “shard of hush” conceit is intriguing, if under-exploited for consequence. The quiet-bay ritual frame avoids cliché, though the resolution is familiar in its epiphanic cast. Overall, thoughtful and gentle rather than boldly inventive.</comment>
