<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Aria’s motive (debunker driven to expose lies) is clear and aligns with her choices (following the trail, reassembling letters, pushing into the orchard). However, interior conflict is thin—she rarely wavers or pays a visible price, and the “feeling watched” never forces a moral or tactical trade‑off. Embodied emotion is present (shiver, awe) but generic. The final stance shift is curiosity widening, not a conflicted renunciation or costly decision.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: shredded paper → reassembled letters → revelation of the heart‑site → arrival at the stillpoint. The closure is a Charged Poise image (pulsating glow) that reweights reality, but the cost is mostly conceptual, with minimal on‑page price. Orientation is solid from the outset. The orchestration of the liquidation reframes stakes but reads as told rather than earned through a decisive turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard, radioactive dust storms, and sickly yellow light create a cohesive, oppressive atmosphere that supports tone and action. Environment lightly pressures choices (buffeting storms, looming trees) and the diamond/stillpoint charges the final image. Some details skew generic (“sickly yellow glow,” “howled and buffeted”) rather than character‑specific. Still, setting integrates with plot and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the diamond/stillpoint) is clear, but escalation is linear and low‑friction. The meaningful tightening is the deciphering of letters, yet no option is foreclosed or paid for; “being watched” and storms do not force a trade‑off. The final image is charged but cost‑light, so pressure never fully crystallizes into consequence. Conflict remains mostly task‑completion rather than decision under duress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus orchestrated deception is explicit but largely told in summary (“carefully orchestrated event designed to conceal the truth”). The final image reweights the premise (stillpoint as threshold) without sermonizing, but subtext is minimal and ambiguity is safe rather than destabilizing. Resonance lingers conceptually more than emotionally. The piece avoids tidy morals but stops short of a reconfiguring insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and legible, with a consistent third‑person limited stance. Diction is serviceable but leans on stock connectors and repeated stems (“As she…”), with little idiolect specificity to Aria beyond labels. The voice carries the scene cleanly but lacks a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure. No head‑hopping or register breaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear and coherent, but repetition and scaffolding (“As she walked,” “As she worked,” “As she continued”) dull momentum. Several lines summarize where specificity could carry pressure, and figurative texture is generic. Information density is acceptable; line‑level risks are minimal. Final image lands, though diction is familiar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard + diamond as stillpoint marker is a fresh combo with genre promise. Execution is cautious: the investigation proceeds by summary beats rather than inventive complications, and the “orchestrated liquidation” reveal feels asserted. The closing glow as threshold is evocative but familiar. Ingenuity shows in premise more than scene mechanics.</comment>
