<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Aria’s pacifist resolve is clear, but internal contradiction is minimal; she has already chosen, so we never watch her struggle under pressure. The sword functions as a symbol of renunciation, yet no on‑page micro‑choice tests that stance. Interiority is calm and consistent but leans on summary rather than embodied, pressured moments. The healer/rebuilder identity is persuasive, not transformative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: tending, teaching plants, welcoming refugees, and a final quiet affirmation. Closure reads as Earned Stasis—she has left the sworded path—but the cost remains mostly conceptual. Orientation is solid early; pattern is consistent. Lack of a meaningful tightening keeps the structure from landing harder.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass‑domed desert rose farm, airship scrap planter, and engraved stone are vivid and coherent. Details recur and color the final image, though the environment rarely constrains choices beyond tone. Sensory texture is strong if somewhat repetitive. World logic (post‑collapse oasis) holds without strain.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stakes (weave continuity vs. the world’s chaos) remain largely declarative; no external or internal pressure escalates on the page. The renunciation lives in backstory; the scene offers no turn that narrows options. Visitors’ arrival is reported rather than creating fresh friction. The ending resolves without a visible price paid in‑scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—peaceful cultivation over violence—emerges through the sword/rose counterpoint and the “engraved quiet” motif. However, it’s spelled out rather than earned through conflict, edging toward sermonizing in the final paragraphs. The imagery resonates but doesn’t complicate itself with counter‑pressures. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stable third‑person close with a consistent, softly lyrical register. Some diction (“senselessly perceptive,” repeated “glass‑domed enclosure”) feels mannered and repetitious, dulling the voice’s edge. Distance control is even, but modulation under pressure is limited because pressure is low. No dialogue to test idiom or subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clean mechanics, but paraphrase loops and repeated constructions sap momentum. Key phrases recur without new charge, producing mild purple overtones. Information density is adequate but could compress and vary rhythm more. Final lines repeat established insights rather than sharpening them.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oasis after a collapse, airship scrap as planter, and “engraved quiet” talisman are fresh inflections. The core move—renouncing violence for cultivation—is familiar and executed safely. The piece avoids riskier structural or moral turns that might deepen surprise. Specifics help, but the arc remains conventional.</comment>
