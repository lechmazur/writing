<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The noticer’s yearning for peace and “the sacred in the ordinary” is present, but her choices are limited to returning, sipping tea, and watching; internal contradiction and cost remain abstract. The gardener’s presence offers a relational mirror, not real pressure. The hinted guilt (“past transgressions”) lacks specific embodiment, blunting motivation escalation. The closing gratitude reads earned emotionally but not stress‑tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: details repeat and deepen toward a gentle repricing where the bread becomes a “key.” Orientation is clear and scope contained, but the closure’s cost is soft, with no concrete foreclosed path. The seasonal montage supplies cadence but little tightening. Quiet resonance lands, not decisive change.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tea house and overgrown courtyard are vivid and sensorial (vines, weathered wood, jasmine, murmurs), shaping tone and subjectivity. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it frames rather than pressures. Still, the setting is cohesive and integrated with the piece’s contemplative aim. Strong atmosphere without functional constraint.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes stay low and largely internal; the “absolution” concept never faces a concrete test or trade‑off. Escalation is a calm accumulation (birds flying south, repeated visits) without a decisive tightening. The gardener’s arrival doesn’t force a choice or loss. Resolution is reflective rather than earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Themes of renewal, forgiveness, and finding sacredness in the ordinary are coherent and recur via bread, tea, and gardening. Some lines overstate the thesis (“a key to unlocking a deeper understanding”), reducing subtext. The final image gently reweights earlier motifs but avoids complexity or counterpressure. Resonance is pleasant, not piercing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and diction consistent, with a calm, lyrical register that suits the meditative mode. Perceptual signature is modestly distinct (attention to small shifts and hidden spaces). Occasional generic phrasing and summary soften immediacy. No dialogue means voice carries the load adequately but without notable virtuosity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean and readable with some evocative lines, but it leans on abstractions and light paraphrase loops (“tenuous absolution,” “beauty and wonder”) rather than fresh image under pressure. Sentences are balanced but rhythmically safe. Information density is fair; some repetition could be cut for momentum. No major artifacts, just mild genericity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The “creeping normality noticer” and guerrilla gardener are intriguing, but their potential isn’t fully realized in action or consequence. The vanished bakery and bread as absolution offer a gentle twist, yet remain largely thematic props. The piece chooses safety over bolder turns. Pleasant synthesis, not strikingly new.</comment>
