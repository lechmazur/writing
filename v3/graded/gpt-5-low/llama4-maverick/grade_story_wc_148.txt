<question>1</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The boy’s motive—“to thread the labyrinth with his own story”—is clear and consistent, but internal contradiction and micro-choices are thin. He pushes a door, walks, touches a lock, and resolves to continue; none force a trade-off or reveal layered values. Emotions are largely summarized rather than embodied. Legacy pressure is stated but not dramatized into a concrete cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Orientation is strong early (reef, lighthouse prison, ajar door), and the piece holds a single scene with an accumulative/textural drive. Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise (resolve to continue at the lock), but there’s no on-page cost or decisive reconfiguration. The “before they found the bodies” clock appears late and is not cashed in. The lock’s “waiting” energy promises a turn that never arrives.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, sea rot, and confessional lattice create vivid atmosphere filtered through the boy’s sensibility. “Copperlight repose” and the lattice’s patterning give the space a distinctive, near-mystic texture. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond mood and pathing. Strong specificity without functional pressure keeps this out of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract (truth, legacy) with a late, underused “bodies” clock. Escalation is linear: corridor → lattice → big door/lock; no narrowing options or felt price. The touch of the lock implies threshold pressure but does not force a trade-off. The desire to continue is not tested against a credible loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, truth, lies, and authorship thread coherently through recurring images (scuffs, lattice, hush). The ending’s resolve to “follow the threads” offers resonance but little reweighting; the moral calculus never sharpens. Some lines state theme rather than let it emerge from conflict. The “bodies” hint could have deepened repricing but remains unused.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV and register are consistent; the lyric diction suits the haunted setting. Recurrent phrases (“thread the labyrinth,” “copperlight repose,” “hover between shadows and light”) unify tone but verge on sameness. Distance control is steady, with no leakage or head-hopping. The voice is distinctive but not dynamically modulated under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is clear, rhythmic, and image-forward, but repetition and synonym loops reduce momentum. Figurative density sometimes outstrips action, and several metaphors are reiterated rather than evolved. The cadence risks sameness across beats and relies on similar sentence constructions. Still, the lines generally carry sense without confusion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fusion of lighthouse prison, confessional lattice, and the son of the boy who cried wolf is intriguingly specific. The “chasing hush” motif and copperlight aesthetic add freshness. Execution favors atmosphere over transformative turns, muting the promise of its unique premise. The piece hints at a novel mythos but stops short of a non-obvious reconfiguration.</comment>
