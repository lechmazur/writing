<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivations are clear (alchemist seeks awakening; ghost repays a debt), but interior contradiction and micro‑choices are minimal beyond “she reaches for the bead.” Emotional states are often told rather than dramatized, with little friction or competing impulses. The relationship dynamic is evocative yet largely declarative. The cost (ghost fading) lands but with limited on‑page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: grasping the bead awakens the greenhouse and advances the ghost’s debt repayment. Orientation is clean early, and the because/therefore chain (guidance → bead → awakening → fading) holds. The cost is legible in the ghost’s diminution and the alchemist’s bittersweet realization. The structure is simple but sound.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and specific (luminescent orbs, sandalwood and myrrh, winter‑cracked fields). The bead functions as a charged object that reshapes the space’s behavior, and the greenhouse’s perpetual night reinforces tone. Setting mostly frames rather than constrains choices, but it meaningfully charges the final image. Detail selection stays thematically aligned.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are primarily internal/spiritual: awakening the flora and repaying a karmic debt. Escalation hinges on one turn (the bead’s grasp) with a clear but gentle cost (ghost fading), yet pressure remains low and largely uncontested. There’s little narrowing of options or trade‑off beyond that beat. The resolution feels earned but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of indebtedness across lifetimes and guidance with a bittersweet cost emerge organically from the images and final cadence. “Lovingly venomous” intent is more labeled than dramatized, but the closing realization reweights prior material. The ending’s mournful elation offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Depth is felt, if not deeply contended.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The third‑person lyric voice is consistent and suited to the material, with stable distance and clean stance. Some diction repetition and summary texture flatten immediacy at peak turns. Nonetheless, rhythm and tone control are steady, and the prose avoids confusing shifts. No head‑hopping or stance leaks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clear and serviceable, but redundancy and purple leanings (“ethereal light,” “bathed,” “otherworldly”) sap momentum. Several paraphrase loops and intensifier reiterations appear, especially around the awakening/fading beats. Information density is adequate, yet sentences often do one job where two were possible. The final image is intact, if familiar.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The blend of alchemical greenhouse, ghost‑bride debt, and “resonant awakenings” feels fresh enough to register. The carved bead as a practical key is a smart, unifying choice. Execution leans toward familiar lyric registers, moderating novelty. Still, the synthesis has integrity and a memorable aftertaste.</comment>
