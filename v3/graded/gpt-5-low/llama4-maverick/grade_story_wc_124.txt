<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara’s motive (grief mediated through scent) is clear and consistent, and the vial anchors her interior. However, conflict is largely one‑note and the epiphany lands tidily without a sharp contradictory pull. The “lantern broker” facet never pressures choices, remaining decorative.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: UV lights hum on, pattern density thickens, leading to a quiet reconfiguration as she releases sorrow. Orientation is clean, single scene respected, and closure (earned stasis/charged poise) is on‑page. Cost is mostly emotional and modest but present.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse is sensorially vivid (scent, UV patterns, extinct flora) and filtered through her profession/predispositions. The crystal vial charges the final image. Yet the environment rarely constrains choice; it supports mood more than action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Pressure is soft: the hum/UV “transformation complete” serves as the single intensification. Stakes remain internal without a clear trade‑off or foreclosed path beyond catharsis. The release reads credible but low‑tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Memory, scent, and loss cohere thematically and recur in images (vial, extinct plants, UV patterns). Final insights verge on stated moral (“carry the lessons,” “impact of memories”), dulling subtext. Resonance is earned but somewhat sentimental and over‑explicit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and lyric, but diction loops (“As…,” “crystal,” “ultraviolet”) flatten rhythm. Expository lines about studying perfumery feel told rather than embodied. Voice holds, yet lacks modulation under peak emotion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Frequent paraphrase and motif reiteration create drag (multiple near‑identical sentences about UV patterns and the vial’s glow). Purple tendencies and scaffold phrasing dilute impact. Line‑level density could be halved for greater propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Greenhouse of extinct plants plus perfumery and UV‑revealed patterns is a fresh mosaic. The arc—a gentle grief release—is familiar and safe, with limited risk in structure or stakes. Moments of image ingenuity exist but don’t transform the template.</comment>
