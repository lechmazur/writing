<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lena’s motives and legacy conflict (con artist father vs “justice”/fair trade) are clear and character‑particular, and the ink pot reveals her attention and temperament. However, conflicting impulses rarely clash in action; most tension lives in her thoughts and in declared readiness. The father’s “You’re a natural” lands a bit conveniently, easing pressure rather than testing her. We get credible interiority, but the decisive micro‑choice is deferred.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single scene, single POV, clear anchors; the Situational lens is apt (pressure of the director’s reluctance, plan to breach, they wait for the moment). Closure is a Charged Poise: readiness to act, options legible, risk named, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The “reconsideration requires a breach” is a meaningful mid‑scene tightening. The effect lands, but without an on‑page price paid, it stops short of elite closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The prep room’s formaldehyde, cold steel tables, and low lamps create a specific, immersive atmosphere that coheres with the tone. The ink pot functions as a micro‑setting object charging the final image. Still, the environment rarely constrains options or alters tactics beyond mood and cover for waiting. Strong texture, modest functional pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes (client’s asylum vs getting caught) are signaled, and the “breach of protocol” proposal tightens the situation. Yet escalation remains mostly verbal and anticipatory; we don’t see a test or a foreclosed option with an on‑page cost. The plan and waiting method are clear, but pressure doesn’t crest into a consequential turn. Tension hums rather than bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fair trade vs grift, and “waiting actively” as a moral calculus, recur through images (ink pot) and stance. Some thematic statements are declared rather than earned (“mathematics of a fair trade”), softening subtext. The final charged poise reprises the motif effectively but doesn’t reprice the premise with fresh cost. Resonant, not profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and plausible; diction suits a reflective, observant protagonist. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, carrying status dynamics succinctly. Occasional elevated phrasing (“deathly vitality”) fits the mood without breaking voice. Minor reliance on “seemed”/abstractions slightly blunts immediacy.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Clean sentences with sensory specificity; rhythm is generally smooth. Redundancies and near‑loops (“waited actively,” “mathematics of a fair trade,” multiple “seemed”) dilute force, and some metaphoric phrasing leans purple. Information density is acceptable but could cut scaffolding to sharpen momentum. Final image is clear but not linguistically surprising.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Con artistry in a funeral prep room, asylum stakes, and the charged ink pot offer a fresh constellation. However, the piece stops at poised intent, so ingenuity in turns/tactics remains underused. The object motif is nicely integrated, but the scenario’s promise isn’t fully transformed on the page. Solid originality with conservative risk.</comment>
