<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (seeking strength in vulnerability) but interiority leans abstract and generic, with few embodied micro‑choices beyond sweeping and relocating the lantern glass. The janitor’s contradictions (reverence vs. labor; solitude vs. empathy) are stated rather than dramatized under pressure. Emotional progression is steady, not layered by real friction. The final stance feels declared more than earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a quiet build toward a charged final image (the glass placed prominently; departure at dawn). Orientation is clean, single scene, single POV. Closure lands as a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration, but cost is faint and largely conceptual. The beat sequence has minimal cause/pressure; turns feel iterative rather than consequential.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is strong: hum of machinery, dim sanctuary, and a recurring object (yellow lantern glass) that charges the final image. Details skew visual/aural and remain filtered through the janitor’s contemplative bias. The setting seldom constrains choice; it mainly supports tone. Still, the object‑as‑setting functions as a soft anchor for the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal and largely static; escalation is minimal and not forced by external pressure or a narrowing of options. “Empathy” and “vulnerability” are reiterated rather than tested. No decisive trade‑off or foreclosed path is made legible on the page. The final repositioning of the glass suggests meaning but not cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme is coherent (strength through vulnerability; stillness as flourishing) but over‑stated, with explicit moralizing lines late. Subtext is thin; symbolism (lantern glass) is direct and undemanding. The ending offers resonance but little reweighting beyond assertion. Ambiguity is safe rather than productive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV and distance are stable and apt for lyric accumulation. Diction is consistent but trends toward uniform elevated register, flattening pressure. Rhythmic control is competent yet repetitive, with similar sentence moves and sentiment echoes. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops (“flourishing stillness,” “strength in vulnerability”) dilute momentum. Figurative language is safe and sometimes purple, with stacked abstractions that reduce specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences do single duty. Mechanics are clean but the cadence becomes predictable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>“Cosmic janitor” offers a fresh angle, and the lantern glass is a mildly distinctive anchor. However, the meditative cosmic‑awe palette and moral frame feel familiar. Risks are modest; the piece avoids sharper, scene‑borne turns that might make the premise feel inevitable.</comment>
