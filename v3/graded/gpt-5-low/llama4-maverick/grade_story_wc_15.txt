<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Aria’s motivation is clear and consistent, but she faces little oppositional pressure and makes few micro‑choices under stress. Interiority leans declarative (“hauntingly optimistic vision”) rather than embodying contradictory impulses in scene. The completion of the tapestry reads as persistence rather than a pressured, high‑cost choice. Emotional cost is gestured at (“weight of her task”) without a concrete trade‑off.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens: the piece builds to a quiet RR/Charged Poise—tapestry complete at dawn reweights the labyrinth from ruin to promise. The closure lands on the page, but the cost remains mostly conceptual. Orientation is stable and the single‑scene drift is coherent. The plate’s reprise and dawn image give a mild cadence shift that reads as earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vivid environment—the red canyon labyrinth, damp earth, tide pools—filters through Aria’s sensibility. Setting charges the final image (labyrinth reconfigured in light) though it rarely constrains choices beyond mood and metaphor. Object details (plate, glowing fabric) integrate smoothly with atmosphere. Sensory selection and tone are cohesive and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (“from ruin to reverence”) stays abstract; escalation is minimal and largely tonal. “Weight of her task” and the fabric’s glow are deepening beats, not tightening turns that foreclose options. No credible loss or forced trade‑off appears on the page. Resolution stems from steady endurance rather than tested agency under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—art as redemptive transformation—is coherent but over‑articulated via repeated thesis lines (“carve a path from ruin to reverence,” “power of art to transform”) rather than emerging from conflict. Subtext mostly converts to statement in the final paragraphs. The plate/tapestry/dawn images carry some resonance, but sentiment skirts platitude. Ambiguity and counterpressure are limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person with clean distance and no head‑hopping. Diction suits the meditative mode; rhythm is mostly controlled. Some repetition and abstract phrasing dulls edge in peak beats. No dialogue to test modulation or subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean and musical, but paraphrase loops and formulaic reiterations (“path from ruin to reverence,” “power of art to transform”) dilute momentum. Figurative density is steady without egregious muddle, yet several modifiers feel purple. Information density is acceptable; more cut-to-the-nerve specificity would lift propulsion. Final image is clear despite the abstraction.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The wharf‑weaver in a canyon labyrinth and the charged plate offer fresh texture. However, the arc leans on familiar “art heals the world” contours without a non‑obvious turn or cost. The glow motif is pretty, not transformative in a new way. Originality sits in image synthesis more than narrative calculus.</comment>
