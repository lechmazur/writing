<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Aria’s motive (resolve “inner static” while protecting the farm) is clear and consistent, and she makes concrete containment choices under pressure. However, interiority leans on abstract labels (“inner static,” “fragmented wholeness”) rather than embodied contradictions. The fear‑box motif gestures at vulnerability but rarely drives on‑page micro‑choices. Emotional cost is stated more than felt.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The controlled burn provides a coherent frame and a recognizable before/after: Aria contains flames and lands in a reweighted stasis. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration (she can carry her fears with less weight), though the practical mechanics and cost of containment are under‑specified. Orientation is clean; escalation is present but gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dome, machinery hum, smoke, and heat create a credible, focused micro‑world that reflects Aria’s internal state. The environment lightly constrains tactics (amplified heat, enclosures), but technical specificity is thin where it would heighten choice. Sensory detail skews visual/olfactory, with some repetition. Still, the setting supports tone and action without white‑room effect.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Stakes (protect roses/resolve inner static) are legible, and pressure coheres during the burn. The main tightening—choosing to contain rather than flee—reads, but reversals and prices are muted. We seldom feel options foreclosing or tools failing; consequences remain largely conceptual. As a result, tension plateaus rather than bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The controlled burn as a metaphor for curated self‑destruction and renewal is apt, and the box reprise supports a modest thematic shift. However, theme is often told directly via repeated abstractions instead of arising from subtext and image. The final “lighter box” insight lands but skirts sentimentality due to over‑explained phrasing. Complexity feels asserted more than dramatized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and coherent, but the diction trends generic and abstract at peak beats. Repetitive phrases (“inner static,” “fragmented wholeness”) flatten rhythm and distinctiveness. The voice is serviceable and readable, with occasional strong images, yet lacks a singular perceptual signature. No head‑hopping or stance slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Line‑level repetition and paraphrase loops reduce momentum (e.g., consecutive sentences reassert “contain chaos/miniaturize” without new pressure). Figurative language leans on vague intensifiers rather than precise verbs; mechanics of action are glossed. Rhythm is steady but monotonous, limiting propulsion. Clean grammar, but density is diluted by scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Android caretaker + glass‑domed desert roses + controlled burn is a fresh constellation with promise. The synthesis hints at an intriguing self‑reprogramming/ritual‑purification angle. Execution plays it safe, leaning on familiar therapeutic abstractions and avoiding bolder, costlier turns. The premise feels distinctive; the treatment less so.</comment>
