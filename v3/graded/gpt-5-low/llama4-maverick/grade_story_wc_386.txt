<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Aria’s motive—salvaging something pure by exposing hidden patterns—is clear, and her actions (touching the globe, tracing the pattern, stepping out) align. However, interior contradiction is thin; she rarely struggles against herself or pays a visible personal price. Moments like her “gift and curse” label don’t translate into pressured choices. The character remains textured but largely passive and untested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: touch → vision deepens → pattern → “windows of connection” open, yielding a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation (Aria, shrine in glacier) is established early and maintained. Closure lands as a charged poise—she exits with purpose—though the cost is only lightly implied (weight of the mission), keeping it out of higher bands. No major causality slips, but the escalation remains gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and candlelight are vivid and consistent, with the snow globe operating as a charged micro‑setting that returns decisively in the ending. Sensory detail (scent of melting ice, flickering flames) supports tone without overwhelming clarity. While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, it meaningfully charges the final image. Strong atmosphere and specificity throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stakes (find and expose truth) stay mostly conceptual; pressure rises by density rather than narrowing choices. The key turn is the snow globe’s pattern igniting a vision and the windows opening, but little is foreclosed and no clear price is paid. Internal/external conflict interweave softly without a demanding test. The result is evocative but low‑tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Themes of connection, salvage, and truth accrue via recurring images (wreckage, snow globe, borrowed starlight) and culminate in a hopeful repricing when the windows open. However, abstract statements (“aimed to expose hidden patterns”) sometimes replace scene‑driven resonance. The ending image is gentle rather than piercing, with limited moral or emotional complexity. Still, it invites reflection and avoids sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, diction is coherent, and the lyric stance is controlled. The perceptual signature is consistent (ice, light, whispers), though rhythms flatten at times into similar sentence openings and structures. No head‑hopping or withheld knowledge artifacts. Repetition slightly dulls the pressure beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Line‑level writing is clean and often musical, but redundancy and purple drift recur (“borrowed starlight,” “ethereal,” stacked “The…” openings). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase similar ideas, softening momentum. Figurative density is high without always sharpening stakes. The final cadence is clear but could be tighter and less expository.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The wreck‑diver ghost whisperer in a glacier shrine with a melted snow globe as conduit feels fresh and coherent. The “windows of connection” concept gives a distinctive slant, though the execution leans on familiar lyric mysticism. The final reconfiguration is apt if not surprising. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, landing solidly but not daringly.</comment>
