<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Azure’s motive (protect and tune the artifact) is clear and consistent, and her competence is legible, but internal contradiction is minimal and largely told (“logically emotional”) rather than dramatized under pressure. Embodied emotion lands in places (ice creak through her body) yet decisions rarely carry visible cost. Micro‑choices exist (attuning to creaks, proceeding despite fragile ice) but never force a trade‑off. The ending’s satisfaction reads earned but easy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres as a single scene accruing sonic and environmental detail toward a quiet alignment. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the artifact harmonizes and she commits to vigilance. Cost is soft (fatigue, ongoing watch) and not strongly legible on the page, which dampens impact. Orientation is clear early; structure holds but lacks a decisive tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drift‑ice marina, creaking dock, gull cry, and lighthouse hum are vivid and filtered through an engineer’s sonic attention. Environment shapes tactics lightly (care across ice; matching the marina’s “signature”) and charges the final image. Details integrate with action rather than museum‑tour listing. Not quite 9‑band because constraints don’t significantly foreclose options.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect/harmonize) is stated early but opposition is minimal and success is largely assured; no meaningful reversal or costly trade‑off occurs. The “tightening” is mainly a fade of light, which doesn’t force altered tactics beyond pacing. Internal pressure is calm and confident rather than contested. Resolution feels untested by stress.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Themes of harmony between logic and feeling, stewardship, and “sonic absolution” emerge through images, not outright moralizing; the final quiet cadence fits. However, “sonic absolution” remains an abstract banner rather than a concretely reweighted idea with cost. Subtext is gentle but thin; the ending reaffirms rather than reinterprets. The best resonance comes from the body‑sound world mirroring duty.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, lyric cadence; sensory lexicon suits a sound‑focused engineer. Some diction (“fleshly ethereal,” repeated “ethereal”) leans purple and repetitive, flattening modulation under peak moments. No head‑hopping or stance drift, but rhythmic variety could tighten momentum. Voice is competent but not singularly distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Readable and mostly clean, but paraphrase loops and adjective stacking (“ethereal” recurrences; similar creak images) slow propulsion. Figurative density sometimes outpaces pressure, edging toward purple. Information density is modest; several sentences restate purpose or mood. The final image is clear, yet the line‑level lacks compression and sharpened verbs that would elevate it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of sonic engineering, sacred artifact, and icy maritime mood feels promising. The conceptual angle (“vibrational matching” for protection) is intriguing, but the scene avoids risk—no turn that reweights premise or forces a hard cost. Specificity lifts it above generic mysticism, yet the execution stays safe. A bolder complication or price would unlock its distinctiveness.</comment>
