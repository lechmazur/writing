<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (seek the stillpoint to reckon with sorrow), but interior conflict is largely told rather than dramatized via micro‑choices. The mapmaker meets little resistance; competence and serenity dominate. Trepidation is named, yet no concrete trade‑off or contradictory impulse is tested on the page. The emotional pivot at the end reads more as serene acceptance than costly shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sound/scent patterns builds to a cadence shift at the stillpoint. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—ring pulsing blue, tattoos shimmering, and a broadened understanding. Cost remains soft and mostly conceptual, slightly muting the ending’s force. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered through non‑visual senses and integrates with action via the audible trail. The compass ring as object‑setting charges the final image. World rules are consistent and learned through perception, not exposition. Constraint is present but mild; the environment guides more than it corner‑pressures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled (find the stillpoint for inner reckoning), and pressure increases through sensory intensification. However, escalation lacks a visible price or narrowing options; following the melody meets no credible obstacle. The final turn is a deepening rather than a tested choice, keeping tension modest. Agency is present but minimally contested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Harmony between outer world and inner grief emerges through motifs (notes, ring, tattoos). Some lines lean toward statement (“understood the hidden harmonies of the universe”) rather than image‑driven implication. The ending resonates, but the insight feels slightly declared. Subtext is present but not richly conflicted.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical, sensorily attuned diction fits the protagonist. Rhythm is controlled with recurring phrases that mostly feel intentional. Occasional sameness of cadence and reiterated constructions flatten peaks slightly. No POV slippage or head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clean and often luminous, with strong sensory economy for a lyric mode. There is some repetition (“quiet blaze,” similar sentence openings) and a touch of purple in generalized declarations. Information density is decent, but momentum softens with paraphrase‑like restatements of awe. Final image is clear despite the ornamentation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind cartographer, ultrasonic forest, skin‑absorbed languages, musical navigation to a stillpoint—feels fresh and cohesive. Risks are taken in sensory focus and worldbuilding, largely without gimmickry. The arc itself is familiar (quest → epiphany), but the particulars give it character. Greater cost or a surprising turn could elevate ingenuity further.</comment>
