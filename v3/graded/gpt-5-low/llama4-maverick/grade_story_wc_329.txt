<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Luna’s motive—to reawaken beauty—is clear and consistent, but interior conflict is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. She encounters little resistance; success arrives without visible struggle or trade‑off. The locust shell hints at fragility but doesn’t force a difficult choice. The final renunciation (leaving to continue the work) carries little felt cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive: the music’s spread builds to a resonance that reconfigures the orchard (RR). Orientation is clear early (orchard, statues, sky‑bridge), and the cause‑effect of music → stirring → rebirth tracks. However, the cost at closure is light, and pressure never tightens beyond a single soft swell. The structure lands a quiet cadence shift but lacks a charged price.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Vivid, cohesive atmosphere—orchard, sky‑bridge shimmer, living statues—suffuses the piece and charges the final image. World rules (music affects stone) are consistent within the enchantment. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it meaningfully transforms, reinforcing the ending’s reconfiguration. Sensory focus skews visual and olfactory but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes (beauty vs. mechanical grip) are declared, but on‑page pressure stays gentle and largely uncontested. There’s little escalation: Luna plays; the statues awaken; the orchard brightens. No option is foreclosed, and the “price” of change isn’t confronted. The turn is serene rather than crucible‑like, muting tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Themes of restoration and resistance to mechanization emerge through recurring images (music, statues, locust shell), but they’re reinforced by explicit statements that verge on moralizing. Subtext exists (fragility versus rigidity), yet insight is told rather than earned via fraught choices. The final note reiterates the thesis more than it reweights it. Resonance lingers, but complexity is limited.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person voice suits the fable‑like frame. POV distance is stable; no head‑hopping. Rhythm can flatten into repetition (“resonantly soft,” mechanical world) and explanatory telling, which blunts intensity. Still, diction is coherent and the cadence supports the serene closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lines often double back on the same idea, and adjective stacks/purple notes creep in, softening momentum. Repetitions of key phrases function more as redundancy than pattern with payoff. Syntax remains clear, but density sometimes displaces specificity of action or cost. The final image is clean, though not sharpened by line‑level tension.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Music awakening stone in an enchanted orchard is familiar, but the sky‑bridge and locust shell offer modest fresh inflections. The piece commits to a unified mood of tarnished wonder. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; the design chooses safety over complication. Ingenuity is present but not transformative.</comment>
