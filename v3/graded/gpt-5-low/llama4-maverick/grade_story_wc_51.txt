<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Her motive—to “collect the weights of different burdens”—is clear, but her interiority remains largely serene and unconflicted, with few micro‑choices under pressure. The main actions (enter, weave, light/extinguish the lamp) don’t reveal contradiction or cost. The final endurance (quiet completion and departure) reads earned but low‑stakes. Emotional embodiment skews abstract over character‑particular texture.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: a single continuous scene accrues to a quiet closure as dawn arrives and the tapestry stands complete (a resonant reconfiguration). Orientation is clean throughout. Cost is conceptual rather than felt, so the ending lands more as serene cadence than decisive change. The causal throughline (arrive → weave → understand → depart) is intact but soft.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, fungi glow, and seasonal damp are vivid and consistent, with tool‑as‑setting touches (lamp, loom) enriching atmosphere. Sensory details stay selective and tonally aligned. However, the environment rarely constrains choice beyond offering a sanctuary. Strong mood work, modest tactical pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract; pressure scarcely tightens beyond sustained concentration. No clear reversal or narrowed options—work proceeds smoothly to completion. The cost of “collecting burdens” doesn’t test her resolve on the page. Tension exists mainly as meditative focus.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Patterns, balance, and burdens cohere as theme, with the tapestry as an effective emblem. Some lines drift toward telling (“a reminder of the delicate balance that governed the world”), blunting subtext. The final image resonates but edges into summary. Still, the motif chain (lamp/loom/grotto/dawn) creates a reflective aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is steady, lyrical, and confident; diction is consistent with a contemplative, mythic register. Psychic distance stays stable; no head‑hopping. Some purple lushness and formulaic cadences recur, but rhythm generally suits the mode. Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean, but there’s noticeable redundancy and abstraction (“weights of different burdens,” “balance” recur without new pressure). Occasional stock metaphors (“ripples on a still pond”) and decorative modifiers soften propulsion. Figurative density is moderate and coherent, if sometimes ornamental. Momentum is gentle rather than driving.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The “fractal weaver” in a bronze grotto under fungi‑light is a fresh frame with cohesive imagery. The arc (nightlong weaving → dawn) is familiar and risk‑averse; originality arises more from texture than turn. Still, the synthesis of craft, burden‑weighing, and reverie feels distinct. No late rule changes; conceptual integrity holds.</comment>
