<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear desire (decode the leaves) and a few micro‑choices (prodding the speck; building a tiny monument), but interior conflict is thin and largely untested. Emotions are expressed in generalized, decorative terms (“mossy delight”) rather than embodied contradiction. The “emerges transformed” beat reads asserted more than earned, with limited felt cost. Still, actions align with her orderly, reverent temperament.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density increases with the speck’s glow and the revealed leaf code, culminating in a quiet reconfiguration (she decodes the prophecy, the glow fades, a new stasis). Orientation is clean, and the throughline holds. The closure’s cost is underarticulated—no sacrifice or constraint is made legible at the end beyond a declared “forever changed.” The turns (“prod” → glow → pattern reveal) connect, but stakes never bite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the seed sorter’s sensibility; the moonstone speck charges the final image. Sensory specificity and mood are strong, with recurrent lunar shimmer and mist textures. Environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain choices, so it falls just short of the highest band. Still, the setting is the piece’s signature strength and integrates with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the message) is present but low‑pressure, with escalation mostly as intensification of glow and pattern rather than narrowed options. The “prod” offers a modest turn; building the monument deepens but doesn’t force a trade‑off. No visible price or foreclosed path lands at the close. Tension remains gentle and static despite lyrical accumulation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Themes of honoring the past, listening rightly, and transformation emerge coherently through images and ritual action. However, several lines state theme outright (“one emerges transformed always”), muting subtext and complexity. The ending offers a resonant image but leans into affirmation over complication or counter‑pressure. Reflection is more declarative than discovery‑led.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single‑POV lyric voice is steady and appropriate to the contemplative mode. Diction is consistent, if occasionally generic in its mysticism, and stance control is solid. Rhythmic variety is modest; repeated “As she…” openings and similar cadences create sameness under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and readable, with some luminous phrasing, but it relies on adjective stacks and phrase loops (“soft, ethereal radiance”; repeated “As she worked…”/“As she…” openings) that dilute momentum. Several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same content (working, decoding, transformed), reducing density. Purple‑leaning modifiers outpace concrete embodiment in peak beats. Final third repeats ideas rather than sharpening them.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The cloud‑arbor and seed‑code premise has fresh texture, and the moonstone speck adds a nice occult instrument. Still, the mystical‑prophecy‑transformation arc proceeds along familiar lines without a non‑obvious moral calculus or risky turn. The monuments conceit is the most distinctive element but isn’t pushed into an idiosyncratic consequence. Overall, pleasing but safe.</comment>
