<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (translating silence into music) and embodied emotion are present, with a credible collaborative bond with Eli. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are light; the survivor’s nerves smooth quickly without a sharp choice under pressure. The relationship deepens but doesn’t truly force a risky trade‑off. Actions align with motives and reveal character, though stakes remain gently held.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene coheres and escalates by density—device activation, fork selection, discord, then “rectify” toward a charged cadence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a completed “symphony of silence” and the departure into cold with carried music. Cost is modest (enduring an altered world; choosing felt vibration over sound), which tempers impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vivid and integrated—the frosted panes versus interior warmth, light‑spectrum sunrise, and plants subtly charging the final image. Tools (forks, device) feel tactile and purposeful. The setting shapes tone and enables tactics but doesn’t strongly constrain choices, keeping it short of the top band. Consistent world rules are conveyed through action rather than dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (can they translate silence into felt music) and signaled early. The “rectify” moment provides a single meaningful tightening, guided by the heat‑map. Pressure remains gentle; no option is dramatically foreclosed, and the price of success is largely conceptual. The resolution is earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of resilience, collaboration, and art as survival emerge naturally from image chains (heat, frost, vibration, light). Subtext lives in the silent exchange and mutual labor rather than pronouncements. The closing image reweights prior material without sermonizing, though a few lines flirt with familiar phrasing (“symphony of silence,” “unshaken marvels”). The resonance lingers despite a slightly tidy uplift.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The third‑person close is steady and assured, with lyrical but controlled diction and a distinct perceptual signature. Narrative certainty stays within what the focalizer can infer; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well across calm intensifications, though the register remains uniformly elevated. Dialogue absence suits the premise and subtext.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Clean, fluent lines with purposeful imagery and few hedges. Minor repetition and a couple of familiar constructions (“like ripples on a pond,” “symphony of silence”) soften freshness but don’t stall momentum. Information density is good; sentences often carry double duty (atmosphere and action). Cadence supports the accumulative lens without purple overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The post‑catastrophe silent world plus tactile music via tuning forks and an emotion heat‑map feels fresh and well‑synthesized. The conservatory and nonverbal partnership lend distinctiveness. Some phrasing leans familiar, but the method‑driven collaboration offers a memorable angle. Risks are measured and coherent rather than flashy.</comment>
