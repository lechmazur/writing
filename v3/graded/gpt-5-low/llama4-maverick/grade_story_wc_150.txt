<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya’s motive—to restore heritage and faith—is clear and consistent, and her tactile engagement with the sundial base adds credibility. However, internal contradiction is minimal; curiosity never meets meaningful resistance. Micro-choices (kneeling, brushing, documenting) feel procedural rather than pressured. The final shift reads earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens holds: excavation sequences accrete meaning until the closing reconnection. Orientation is clean and the sundial motif threads structure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and the cost at the end is implied more than felt. The middle lacks a pivotal turn that tightens options.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” with damp earth, dappled light, and roots among bones is vivid and specific, shaping tone well. The sundial base functions as a recurring object that charges the final image. Still, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics beyond mood. Detail is purposeful but largely atmospheric.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely internal and static: uncovering and documenting proceed without impediment. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; no option is foreclosed or trade-off demanded. The sundial’s pull hints at deepening, but it doesn’t force a costed choice. The resolution arrives without a testing beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Heritage and restoration resonate through concrete images (bones, roots, sundial), producing a gentle afterglow. Some thematic assertions are told outright (“not just about uncovering the past… restoring a lost faith”), blunting subtext. The ending reweights prior images but skirts sentimentality via neat fulfillment. Ambiguity remains mild rather than prismatic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, with a calm, lyrical cadence that suits the meditative excavation. Diction is consistent, if somewhat generic at times. Rhythm varies enough to maintain clarity and flow. Voice lacks a singular edge that would imprint memory.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lines are clean and readable, with sensory specificity and minimal errors. Some redundancy and abstract phrasing (“purposeful wandering,” “cautious enchantment”) recur without adding pressure. Figurative language stays coherent but leans familiar. Information density is adequate, not taut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard and sundial motif give the premise a fresh sheen, and diaspora return animates the frame. Execution settles into a conventional meditative arc without a surprising reweighting. The final image is pleasing but not startling. Ingenuity is present in concept more than in turns.</comment>
