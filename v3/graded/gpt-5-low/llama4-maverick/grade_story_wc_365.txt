<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (to uncover a withheld truth) but interiority is generic and repetitive (“she felt,” “she knew”) with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The map maker rarely makes fraught micro‑choices; she mostly observes and proceeds. Emotional embodiment leans on summary rather than specific, character‑particular reactions. The final reconfiguration (“she would never see the multiverse in the same way again”) isn’t earned through on‑page struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean, and the piece builds toward a Conceptual Repricing when clarity “washes over her.” However, escalation is mostly stated rather than dramatized, and cost is light; the shard’s glow/blur → revelation sequence functions but feels preordained. Closure lands, but with minimal price paid on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vivid at the start (grimy windows, rust, skeletal ships) and returns in the final beat for a soft frame. Beyond the bay, worlds are named as a “succession” without distinct specifics, blunting atmosphere. The green shard operates as a micro‑setting object, lightly charging the final image. Overall, selective detail is effective early but thins when pressure should heighten.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncover the withheld truth) is stated, but pressure doesn’t tighten via a concrete trade‑off or foreclosed option. The shard intensifies (glow/pulse), yet the protagonist faces no real risk or dilemma; she advances linearly to revelation. Escalation reads as volume increase, not narrowing of choices. Cost at resolution is mainly conceptual, not felt as a sacrifice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme centers on pattern recognition and withheld truth, but it’s asserted rather than earned through textured scene work. The green shard’s reprise adds light resonance, yet lines like “she knew she would never see the multiverse in the same way again” flatten subtext into statement. The piece invites reflection, but ambiguity lacks consequence. The conceptual shift lands, though it feels generalized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, but diction is uniform and filter‑heavy. Repetitive stems (“The map maker… she felt… she knew…”) create a drumbeat that undercuts rhythmic control. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond stock lyricism. Clarity is good, but the texture is interchangeable.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Line‑level repetition (“The map maker… The green glass shard…”) and paraphrase loops sap momentum. Filter‑verb stacks (“felt,” “knew,” “began to”) dull immediacy, especially in peak beats. Information density is moderate but summary‑leaning, with minimal multi‑function lines. The prose is clean but mechanically patterned and low on propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sensory map maker + green shard talisman in a derelict spaceport offers a mildly fresh angle on portal fiction. Execution hews to familiar beats and generic language, limiting distinctiveness. The accumulative design to CR is coherent but safe. Some originality glints in the profession premise, not fully leveraged in tactics or image.</comment>
