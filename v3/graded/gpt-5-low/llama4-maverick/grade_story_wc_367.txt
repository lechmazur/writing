<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The herald’s motive (upholding ancient ritual to “steer the dawn”) is clear, but interior conflict is thin and largely declarative. Micro-choices exist (angling the lantern, trimming the wick) yet they don’t force a costly trade-off. Emotion skews summarized (“shadowed elation”) over embodied specificity. The end acknowledges responsibility but no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural build is consistent: ascent, ritual adjustments, dawn’s emergence, descent. Closure lands as a quiet cadence shift (charged poise) when the day is shaped and responsibility is accepted, but cost is light. Causality is intact yet the middle lacks a decisive tightening. Pattern is taught early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, starry night, and the lantern are vivid and recurrent; environment and tool integrate with action (angling glass, beam slicing night). Specificity supports mood and serves the tactic (light-bending). Some description repeats without evolving, but spatial and sensory anchors are clear. The lighthouse charges the final image credibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract (shape the dawn/day) with little on‑page resistance; escalation is a steady hum rather than a tightening. The wick adjustments and physics motif don’t force a trade-off or loss. No reversal or narrowed option is dramatized. The weight of duty at the end gestures at cost but isn’t tested in scene.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tradition vs. a fleeting digital world and light/shadow as craft vs. chaos are coherent themes. However, they are stated directly (“In a world after the last print newspaper…”) rather than earned through subtext. The final image resonates modestly but avoids complication or counterpressure. Symbolic recurrence is present but not reweighted with evident cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third-person with a steady cadence; diction fits the mystical register. Occasional capitalizations (“Otherworldly routine,” “Accidentally”) and explanatory lines flatten texture. Voice doesn’t deepen under pressure; rhythm stays uniform. No POV leakage, but the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond motif repetition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clean mechanics overall, but paraphrase loops and repeated constructions reduce momentum (“beam slicing,” “coalescing,” “shadows” recur without new torque). One typo (“an soft”). Figurative density is moderate and coherent, yet several sentences do single duty. Line-level propulsion plateaus during the ritual sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fusion of lighthouse ritual with “total internal reflection” as mystical method is fresh. The post-newspaper frame is intriguing but underused tactically. The piece plays it safe in conflict, limiting its ingenuity payoff. Still, the premise and image system show a distinctive angle.</comment>
