<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aria’s motive—uncovering the truth of the unsent letters at the charged threshold before choice—is clear and her actions align with it. Interiority is textured but generalized; contradictory impulses (fierce/tender, compulsion/hesitation) are implied rather than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The confrontation with the manifestation shows compassion under pressure, but the cost to her is largely atmospheric. The final renunciation/acceptance reads earned but not harrowed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, escalation coheres: spirits crescendo → windowpane messages → apparition solidifying → release and fade. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the reflection image and the “weight lifting,” though the cost is soft. Orientation is strong early (who/where/what) and the object setup pays off. A single tightening happens at the clearing; the lens holds through the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth, luminescent fungi, singing spirits, and suspended windowpane create a vivid, sensorially integrated world. The shard and condensation method are object-as-setting elements that meaningfully charge the final image. Environmental pressure is subtle (choral escalation, window between mangroves) rather than tactical constraint, but it shapes the ritual path. World rules remain consistent and are learned in action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Aria can surface and release the burden of unsent words—tightens once at the clearing with the apparition’s coalescence. She exercises agency by invoking and confronting, and the spirits’ crescendo deepens pressure. The price paid (emotional exhaustion, relinquishment) is felt but not cutting; options do not narrow to a painful trade so much as resolve into release. The escalation is coherent but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of unspoken apology, regret, and the ethics of evocation develop organically through letters → messages → apparition → reflection. The final charged poise (“a reflection that was both Aria’s and not her own”) reweights prior images without moralizing. “Fierce tenderness” is enacted rather than declared, though some lines verge on stating stakes. The resonance is real but not surprising.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A consistent close third with lyrical texture and steady psychic distance; perception favors wet, fungal light and choral sound. Rhythms modulate with crescendo, though syntactic habits (“As she…”) repeat. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and legible. Minor diction monotony prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose is polished, image-rich, and mostly efficient, with good sensory layering. There’s some purple drift and repetition (“singing spirits,” “mist,” “unsent letters”) that creates mild loopiness and softens momentum. Figurative language holds together without mixed metaphors, and the final image is clean. Slight over-decoration in mid-beats dulls pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination—mangrove seance, condensation-scribed messages, gargoyle shard, moon-healing skin—feels fresh and coherent. The evocation as redress for unsent letters is an elegant angle on haunting. Risk is taken in committing to lyric accumulation over causal fireworks, and it mostly pays off. Emotional specificity could cut deeper to elevate originality from strong to indelible.</comment>
