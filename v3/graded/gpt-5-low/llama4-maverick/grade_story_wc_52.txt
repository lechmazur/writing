<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation (ritual carving to manage grief) and embodied actions (handling ash wood, tea) ground the widow. However, interior tension is low; contradictory impulses rarely clash in scene, yielding a smooth path to acceptance. Emotional language occasionally trends generic (“hauntingly practical truth”), dulling character‑particular depth. The final renunciation/acceptance reads earned but modest in visible cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: rain, kettle, wood, and repetition build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—carving completed, kettle empty, a contained grief. Orientation is crisp from the outset. The cost is legible as endurance: peace arrives without the pain disappearing. Escalation is gentle but coherent; one tightening beat comes via the kettle‑clock and empty pot at closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The skylight loft, rain, kettle, and ash wood form a cohesive micro‑setting that permeates action and mood. Sensory specificity is strong (steam, scrape of tool) and filtered through craft. The kettle and loft frame time and enclosure, charging the final image. It stops just short of 9‑band because the environment minimally constrains choice beyond cadence and mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contain grief during the ritual window) is clear, and the live clock adds mild pressure. The meaningful tightening occurs as the kettle moves from simmer to empty and the carving takes shape. Still, conflict is largely internal and steady; few costs or foreclosed options surface beyond acceptance. Tension hums rather than bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>“Here and gone,” kettle‑clock, and carving create a coherent meditation on impermanence and making meaning from loss. The ending reweights earlier images with quiet resonance (empty kettle, completed carving, small sad smile). Some lines verge on direct statement, sacrificing subtext for paraphrase. The piece avoids sermonizing but stays safe in its insights.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stable close third with controlled, lyrical cadence; tactile craft language suits her psyche. Repeated syntactic frames (“As…”) and occasional abstract phrasing slightly flatten rhythm. Diction remains consistent and plausible for the POV. The final cadence is poised and clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clean sentences and pleasant rhythm, with purposeful sensory detail. Some paraphrase loops and abstraction (“harvest lessons,” “hauntingly practical”) reduce density, and repeated constructions soften propulsion. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, but momentum stalls in mid‑paragraph reiterations. The final image lands despite modest line‑level redundancy.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>A widow’s grief ritual via woodcarving is familiar, but the lion‑tamer angle and kettle‑clock lend a fresh tint. The execution favors quiet craft over surprising turns; risk is limited. Images integrate well but avoid bolder, idiosyncratic choices that would make the piece singular. The closure feels true if not groundbreaking.</comment>
