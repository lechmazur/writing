<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aria’s longing to cross into “stillness” versus her compulsion to finish the emerald creates a credible, contradictory drive. Her micro‑choices (attuning, resisting, focusing) align with motive and craft. Emotional embodiment skews abstract at times, softening the pressure. The final renunciation feels earned, if gently priced.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear anchors (Aria in a sky grotto working an emerald) arrive early; the piece holds an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the infusion, the threshold recedes, and readiness replaces urge. Cost is present but muted, residing in the foregone crossing and the pang of sorrow. Structure is one continuous scene with a clean cadence shift at the glow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The aurora‑lit grotto and crystalline acoustics are lush and particular, filtered through Aria’s craft‑bias. Environment functions: the aurora’s essence is the resource she captures, and the grotto’s resonance mirrors and supports her method. The final sentinel image recharges place and object together. Occasional adjectival excess does not blur spatial sense.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture one last spark before oblivion—is signaled and coherently tightened as the “threshold” draws closer. Escalation is textural: density and resonance build as she attunes and infuses, culminating in the glow and a recalibrated stance. The price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the peak quiet. Still, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Beauty-as-ritual against mortality accrues through object and method, not didactic thesis. The emerald’s reweighted meaning and the sentinel grotto offer a non‑literal answer about acceptance and readiness. A few overt statements (“fragment of the divine”) brush sentimentality, but the images hold. Subtext of craft as elegy is coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV stays close to Aria with consistent lyric diction; perception is craft‑tuned (light, vibration, hum). Rhythm modulates from meticulous to hushed without head‑hopping. Some phrase recurrence and elevated registers feel slightly generic in places. Overall, voice is unified and apt for the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are clear and rhythmic, but redundancy (“soft,” “radiant,” “gentle,” repeated “threshold of stillness”) dulls momentum. Figurative texture occasionally tips purple without adding pressure. Despite that, information density is decent and sequencing is clean. The final image lands without syntactic clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of mortuary craft, auroral essence, and pattern‑finding in static is fresh and well‑synthesized. The premise risks quiet minimalism and mostly earns it with specificity. The emotional calculus is not groundbreaking but feels authentic. The skyborne grotto and sentinel close add memorable distinctness.</comment>
