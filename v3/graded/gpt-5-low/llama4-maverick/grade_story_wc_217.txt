<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (seeking beauty in the incomplete) with embodied attention, but little contradictory impulse or pressure to force difficult choices. The poet mostly receives and reframes rather than struggles. Agency is primarily attentional; “tending the poem” doesn’t face friction. Emotional progression is gentle and credible but risk‑light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the feather’s arrival and the kite‑string snap build to a quiet repricing where acceptance of transience reweights the scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she departs changed, carrying the moment—though the on‑page cost is soft. Orientation is clean from the start. The beat sequence is coherent, if modest in consequence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensorial (mist, reeds, cobalt water) and braided through action without white‑room gaps. The feather and lagoon charge the final image, though the environment rarely constrains choice beyond mood. Weather evolution (mist dissipating) subtly tracks the internal arc. Strong atmospheric economy with specific textures.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stakes remain internal and low‑pressure; escalation is a single cadence shift at the kite‑string snap. No option is foreclosed beyond a gentle renunciation of grasping, so the felt price is limited. The poem‑tending faces no real counterforce. Tension operates mostly at the sentence‑mood level.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Transience and imperfect beauty recur via feather and lost kite, culminating in a peaceful acceptance. Some thematic lines skate close to telling (“to discover beauty in the incomplete”), diluting subtext. Still, the final carry‑forward of the moment provides genuine resonance. The piece avoids sermonizing but offers a relatively familiar insight.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third‑person close with a controlled, gentle cadence. Diction matches the contemplative POV and stays stable. Occasional repetition and elevated phrasing risk sameness, but clarity holds. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line craft is graceful but leans into purple repetition (“burnished hush,” “woven”) and synonym loops that could tighten. Sentences often do one job where they could do two; momentum occasionally stalls in restatement. Figurative language is largely coherent, if lush. Clean mechanics and sequencing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lyrical lagoon meditation with a classic acceptance beat; the kite‑string snap is the freshest turn. The vision is sincere but not risk‑taking in form or consequence. Specific images are strong, yet the arc could occur in many near‑identical settings. Pleasant, not strikingly singular.</comment>
