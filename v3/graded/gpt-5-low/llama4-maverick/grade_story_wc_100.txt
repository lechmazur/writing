<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (“to give rest a permanent address”) and a consistent melancholy temperament, but the stubborn trait is mostly labeled, not dramatized under pressure. Micro-choices are summarized rather than staged, so internal contradiction never truly bites. His endurance at the end reads as Earned Stasis but the cost of renunciation is implied, not embodied. Stronger embodied conflict during the device repair would lift this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Causal spine is clean: package → journey → repair → signal shifts → guardianship. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with the undertaker choosing to remain as guardian. However, key pressures (the descent, repair risk) are summarized, softening cost on the page. Orientation is solid from the outset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The underwater library and device are vivid and coherent, with tactile touches (treacherous currents, luminescent creatures, musty tomes). The setting charges tone and final image, though it rarely constrains tactics beyond travel and discovery. The object-as-setting (lens/device) integrates well but lacks moment-to-moment pressure. Economy and consistency are strong.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal (turning a distress call into a beacon of rest), but escalation is mild. The repair succeeds without meaningful complications, and no hard trade-offs are forced in scene. The “years pass” montage resolves tension without testing commitment on the page. Conflict remains largely conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Recurring images (signal, stillness, lens) gesture toward a theme of transforming grief into sanctuary. Yet the piece states its thesis repeatedly (“give rest a permanent address”), slipping into overt moralizing near the end. Subtext is light; resonance comes more from assertion than earned scene pressure. The signal’s shift is a promising image that could carry more of the thematic load.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and modest; diction fits the solemn register. Cadence is even but leans repetitive (“weary,” “stillness,” “signal”) which flattens peak beats. No dialogue means the voice must bear all texture, and it manages clarity more than surprise. A few sharper syntactic turns during the repair could add urgency.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clean, comprehensible lines with occasional evocative phrasing. However, paraphrase/repetition loops and motif reiteration blunt momentum (e.g., repeated “stillness” and “rest” claims). Figurative density is restrained, but the final third leans declarative rather than image-driven. Tighter cuts and varied rhythm would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fusion of undertaker, broken lighthouse lens, and an underwater library transmitting solace is fresh and appealing. The core turn (distress → invitation) reframes the premise elegantly. Ingenuity is tempered by safe staging that avoids harder choices. With one charged on-page complication, this could feel singular.</comment>
