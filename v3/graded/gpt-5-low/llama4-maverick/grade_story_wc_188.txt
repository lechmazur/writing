<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clear want (recover inspiration) and a stable interior lens, but the emotions are largely told in generic terms (“hopelessness,” “ambient awareness”) with little embodied contradiction. Micro‑choices are minimal beyond strolling, watching, and reading the mosaic note. The renewal reads credible but low‑pressure, without a visible price or renunciation. The fire‑spinner and note reveal more about theme than Lyra under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: a quiet walk that layers mood until the mosaic note reconfigures stance. Orientation is clean and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (renewed purpose), but cost is faint. Beats are linear and low‑stakes; the scene relies on ambience over turn. The final image coheres, yet lacks a concrete trade‑off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The blooming fortress, lanterns, and starless hush create a tangible atmosphere, filtered through a fireworks designer’s eye. The fire‑spinner and mosaic integrate into place rather than feeling postcard‑like. However, the setting rarely constrains choices; it mainly inspires. The closing glow reprises environment effectively but without added pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal (resisting hopelessness), but pressure scarcely tightens; there’s observation → note → uplift with no credible loss or foreclosed path. The mosaic provides a single cadence shift, not an escalation that narrows options. The fire performance doesn’t challenge her, only enriches texture. The cost of recommitment is declared, not felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme—finding a spark in stillness—emerges but leans on explicit statement via the note, flirting with platitude. Recurring images (flame, knot, lanterns) support resonance, yet little subtext accrues from tension or omission. The ending answers the question openly rather than through reweighted particulars. Emotional truth is present but safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent, with a gentle, lyrical register suited to a contemplative walk. Diction occasionally repeats (“she felt,” “she sensed”) and filters distance rather than sharpening immediacy. Rhythm is even but lacks dynamic modulation in peak beats. No dialogue to test nuance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clean mechanics, but paraphrase loops and near‑duplicate sentiments slow momentum (multiple lines restating calm chants, ambient sensing, and inspiration). Figurative texture is mild and safe; specificity sometimes gives way to generalities. Sentences do not always multitask, reducing density. The final image is clear but not sharply cut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A fireworks designer in a “blooming fortress” is a fresh pairing, and the kerosene knot as a mental hook is a nice touch. Yet the arc—a walk leading to a found note that restores inspiration—tracks familiar. Risks remain modest, with little structural or moral boldness. Ingenuity shows in texture more than in stakes or turn.</comment>
