<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (to decode the echoes’ “shape of intentions”), but interior conflict is minimal and largely summarized rather than dramatized. The gardener’s tenderness informs action (lavender sachets, patience untangling), yet we seldom see contradictory impulses under pressure. Emotional costs are implied (obsessive devotion, time) rather than made legible in a charged choice. The final renewed purpose reads earned enough, but light on visible sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: steady detailing in the silo accrues until the crystal and decoded tapestry reweight the premise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—world now thrums with echoes and purpose reframes tending the graves. Cost is soft (time, immersion, renunciation of ordinary reality) and not sharply dramatized, limiting impact. Orientation is strong early; single scene coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Specific, sensuous setting—cobalt silo, lavender, stars, frayed tapestry—creates a distinct atmosphere that supports theme. The silo functions as a repository and stage for discovery, and recurring objects (sovereign case, tapestry) charge the final image. However, the environment seldom constrains choices; it frames mood more than tactics. Still, integration is purposeful and textured.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes center on deciphering the echoes; escalation is gentle: patient untangling → pattern → crystal → hidden message. Pressure does not tighten through a visible trade-off, and the chess clock detail doesn’t shape tactics once “run down.” The reveal deepens knowledge but doesn’t force a difficult choice or loss. Tension remains mostly atmospheric rather than conflict-driven.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of legacy, intention, and attention-as-devotion emerge through the gardener’s work with the tapestry and case. The ending reweights caretaking as communion with echoes beyond death—a clean, resonant idea. Some statements lapse into telling (“found a sense of purpose,” “reminder of the intentions”), thinning subtext. Ambiguity is inviting but not deeply double-edged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third-person closely held to the gardener; diction (“velveteen gloom,” “shape of intentions”) gives a distinct texture. Rhythm is measured and appropriate to the meditative task. Occasional abstraction/purple edges the line-level but doesn’t disrupt POV modesty or clarity. No dialogue; interior cadence sustains.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clean sentences, steady cadence, and vivid nouns anchor the prose. Some redundancy and decorative phrasing (“uncharted echoes” repeated; lush modifiers) slightly slow momentum. The “chess clock” and “velveteen gloom” are strong images but can feel over-curated. Overall clarity holds with moderate density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The juxtaposition of cemetery gardener, cobalt silo, sovereign case, and tapestry-decoding feels fresh and coherent. The crystal/echo motif gives a new angle on caretaking and inheritance. Risks are tasteful rather than bold; the conflict frame stays safe and gentle. Still, the synthesis lingers.</comment>
