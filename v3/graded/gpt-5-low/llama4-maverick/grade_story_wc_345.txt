<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria’s motive (to orchestrate a collective effort) is clear but interiority and contradictory impulses are largely absent; we’re told her aims rather than feeling them under pressure. Lyra is named yet functions as color rather than a crucible. Actions align with motives, but micro-choices and embodied emotion at key beats are missing. The resolution requires little personal cost or renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds from chalk messages to planet‑wide pathways, landing in a resonant reconfiguration but with minimal on‑page cost. Orientation is clean and causal links are intact, though much is summarized rather than dramatized. The closure (energy network realized and reweighting of community/planet) lands, but pressure and trade‑offs are soft. No decisive turn challenges options beyond deciphering messages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, and butterfly garden are vivid and specific, giving the piece atmosphere and a unifying pastoral-tech tone. The arches and bell recur and faintly charge the final image, though they rarely constrain choice. World rules stay consistent and integrated through action. Sensory detail favors visual lyricism over tactile pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract (“nourish the planet”) and conflict is gentle; puzzlement yields quickly to cooperation and success. There’s no meaningful tightening that forecloses options or imposes a visible price. The settlers “work tirelessly,” but no loss alters tactics. The result reads as smooth execution rather than tested commitment.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Themes of communal trust, stewardship, and interdependence emerge coherently from the collective effort and the bell/garden motifs. However, resonance leans toward sentimentality and is told rather than distilled into charged images with cost. The final harmony feels earned conceptually, not emotionally. Subtext is thin; symbols function decoratively more than adversarially.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>A consistent, gently lyrical omniscience carries the narrative without head‑hopping or stance drift. Diction is even and readable, though it flattens immediacy into summary. Rhythmic control is steady but rarely presses or releases to match tension. The voice feels serviceable rather than distinctive.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clean lines with occasional evocative phrases (“brambled hope,” “pulsing pathways”), generally clear syntax, and few technical slips. Some redundancy and abstract summary dampen momentum, but no major loops or figurative muddle. Information density is moderate; sentences often do one job. The final image is clear yet not sharply cut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The blend of an altruistic ghost, chalk‑coded coordination, and a nebular energy network on an orchard world is fresh. Execution stays safe, summarizing the most interesting moves rather than dramatizing their frictions. The butterfly bell reprise is a nice touch but not transformative. Ingenuity is evident in premise, less so in scene pressure.</comment>
