<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (preserve/revive the sanctuary, end isolation), but interiority leans abstract over embodied specificity. The trait “burns bridges carefully” is told, not dramatized in a pressured choice. The final shift—choosing to step forward—lands but with soft, low-cost ambiguity. Emotional contradiction is gestured at (“loaded emptiness”) rather than enacted in scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the arc coheres: fading threshold → reconnection via scars → descent → flame rekindling → choice to reengage. Closure is on-page (revived flame, revitalized threshold, decision), though the cost is implied more than felt. Orientation is steady; sequence reads cleanly. The causality is simple but intact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and consistent: the ashen charcoal sanctuary, the doorknocker, the flickering flame. While largely symbolic, the setting anchors the journey and charges the final image. Sensory detail skews visual/tonal; concrete tactile constraints are limited. Still, place and objects meaningfully recur and evolve.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes (sanctuary’s essence fading) are signaled, but pressure rarely tightens against resistance; success arrives without friction. The middle deepens mood rather than narrowing options. The choice to reconnect and revive lacks an on‑page price or foreclosed alternative. Escalation reads as tonal rather than consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of isolation, stewardship, and renewal recur, with a final repricing toward connection. However, phrases like “to teach suffocating to breathe” are asserted multiple times instead of being dramatized, dulling subtext. The doorknocker’s reweighting helps, but the resolution feels tidy. Ambiguity exists, yet complexity is undercut by abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Consistent lyric third-person with a stable distance and coherent texture. Elevated diction suits the mood, though repetition creates a mild drumbeat. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Voice is competent and unified, if somewhat generalized.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft shows rhythm and image, but repetition and abstraction (“loaded emptiness,” “teach suffocating to breathe”) recur without new pressure. Some sentences paraphrase prior content, softening momentum. Figurative density verges on purple in places, with limited concrete, embodied action. Clarity holds, but propulsion suffers.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The “tender shadow keeper” and “linking through scars” offer fresh inflections, and the doorknocker reprise is a nice touch. Yet the arc resolves in familiar, low-resistance renewal. The piece favors mood over invention in turns and tactics. Originality is moderate, not transformative.</comment>
