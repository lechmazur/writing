<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit and consistent, but heavily labeled (“phobia-ridden,” “firmly adaptive,” “prove vulnerability is power”) rather than dramatized through contradictory micro-choices. The inner conflict rarely plays simultaneously on the page; fear doesn’t perceptibly deform tactics beyond summary. The stunt-double identity never pressures an on‑page choice in the scene. The closing decision to “step out of the shadows” lands, but with minimal embodied cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with a light causal spine: find seashell → find cast → decode → realization. Closure arrives as a decisive internal reorientation (conceptual repricing) but the price paid is mostly asserted, not felt. Orientation is clear, scope is contained, and the single scene holds. The decryption functions as the tightening beat, though its process and resistance are largely summarized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>“Rusted library under the stars” offers an evocative image and the seashell recurs to charge the final note. However, the environment rarely constrains options or alter tactics; it’s more backdrop than pressure. Sensory detail is mostly visual with some sound (the hum) and integrates smoothly. Specificity is serviceable but generic in places (“dusty shelves,” “dim light”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is internal (owning fear), but escalation is mild: decoding difficulty is told rather than tested. No option is foreclosed on the page; the choice to change stance reads low-cost. The whispering object and cryptic note offer potential pressure that isn’t fully leveraged. The final stance crystallization is earned but feels easy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than discovered (“vulnerability is power,” “truth is in the shadows”). The phrase decoded reweights the protagonist’s self‑image, providing some resonance, but subtext is thin and moralizing creeps in near the end. The seashell and shadow motif could carry more implication if allowed to speak through action. Emotional aftereffect is modest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is steady and legible, but the voice leans on generalized diction and therapy‑speak. There’s little idiosyncratic noticing tied to a stunt performer’s perceptual habits. Rhythm is even, if somewhat flat, and no head‑hopping or stance slips occur. The final cadence lands cleanly but without a distinctive texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clean mechanics with some redundancy and generic phrasing (“I felt a sense of purpose,” “I was ready to face whatever lay ahead”). Figurative language is sparse and safe; a few paraphrase loops slow momentum. The “smudged note” beat is summarized rather than dramatized, leaking energy. No major artifacts, but information density could be higher.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The seashell, child’s cast, and “rusted library” are intriguing particulars, but the arc (coded message → empowerment) is familiar. The betrayal premise promises depth that remains mostly off‑stage. A bolder exploitation of the stunt double angle or a more idiosyncratic code would sharpen distinctiveness. As is, it’s competent but not risk‑forward.</comment>
