<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—she repairs the net to ground spirits—and the labor reads as a chosen discipline under pressure. Interiority is mostly declared rather than conflicted; “lucid unrest” hints at ambiguity but rarely manifests as competing impulses in action. Micro-choices (teasing knots, pacing breath) align with goal yet lack a sharp moment of value trade‑off. The final felt cost is modest: she carries the hush with her rather than confronting a harder renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The unraveling yields a steady intensification—whispers swell into a “living entity” of silence—and culminates as spirits dissipate: a clear cadence shift and on‑page closure (Resonant Reconfiguration). Cost is present but soft: the dense hush that follows and her lingering unrest. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what), and the pattern remains coherent through the last image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight are vivid and consistently filtered through the restorer’s task; the needle and net serve as micro‑setting objects. World rules stay stable and the environment charges the finale (“starlight…kaleidoscope,” hush as entity). While setting doesn’t strictly constrain choices, it meaningfully colors the stakes and closure image. Sensory selection stays purposeful and tonally unified.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bringing peace to the spirits—is legible and pursued through one method: undoing knots. Escalation is a density increase rather than reversals; each knot releases pressure/whisper, tightening toward the final release. The price paid is mainly exertion and the “accumulated silence” she must carry, which reads more atmospheric than consequential. A sharper constraint or lost option would heighten the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Silence as craft and cost coheres with themes of restoration, memory, and release; the hush transforming into a vessel for the spirits lands. The needle/net motif reblooms at the end without moralizing. Repetition edges toward overstatement (“interlaced hush,” “accumulated silence”), slightly dulling the subtext’s bite. Still, the closing reweights prior images with a quiet, earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single close third is steady; diction and rhythm are controlled and suit a meditative mode. Some lexical recycling creates a drumbeat that flattens peaks, but voice remains coherent. No head‑hopping or stance drift. A touch more modulation at climax would sharpen pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is clean but repetitive; several adjacent sentences paraphrase the same idea (silence accumulating; needle glinting), creating momentum drag. Modifiers stack into purple patches without adding new information, and cadence often defaults to similar structures. The loops persist into the final third, softening the closure image’s impact. Cutting redundancy and varying syntax would markedly lift propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, net‑bound spirits, and the “restoration through silence” angle feel fresh and integrated. The method—untying a centuries‑old net to free energies—twists familiar ghostwork in a specific, tactile way. Risk is lyrical rather than structural; it pays off but stops short of a surprising reconfiguration. Strong synthesis, if not startling.</comment>
