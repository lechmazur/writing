<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (unlock the shell’s “density of presence”) and profession give her a frame, but she faces little friction and makes few pressured micro‑choices. Internal contradiction is thin; awe and method align too neatly. The overheard line sparks resolve but doesn’t force a trade‑off. The closing satisfaction arrives without a visible personal cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: attention deepens from observation to a quiet realization (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is clean; one continuous scene. The whispered phrase is the closest thing to a turn, but consequences remain soft. Closure lands as revaluation rather than change with cost, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>“Ember nexus,” grasses, salt, and the shell create a tactile, coherent atmosphere woven through action. The setting charges the final image but doesn’t constrain choices. Sensory detail is strong and POV‑filtered by her vocation. World rules are stable within this lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to understand/capture essence) is present but escalates modestly. The whispered “truth” is a soft inflection, not a narrowing of options or a costly turn. No competing pressure tests her commitment. Resolution doesn’t require sacrifice or foreclose a path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of presence, revaluation, and wonder cohere through the shell and light motifs. However, lines like “the truth lies in the density of presence” verge on thesis, reducing subtext. The ending offers resonance but little ambiguity or moral pressure. Insight feels earned in tone, not in conflict.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stable close third with consistent lyric diction; the “scientifically romantic” voice colors perception. Rhythm is mostly controlled, if occasionally repetitive (“As she…” openings). No head‑hopping or stance drift. Register matches the contemplative mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vivid lines sit beside redundancy and purple abstractions (“density of presence” repeats; “quiet alchemy”). Several paraphrase loops state the same progression of wonder without adding pressure. Sentence openings and structures echo, creating mild syntactic monotony. Clarity holds, but momentum sags.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pocket‑sun alchemist, ember nexus, and nautilus columella curl yield a distinctive tableau. The premise feels fresh even if the arc is safe. The whispered maxim as catalyst is modestly inventive. Greater risk in consequence would lift it further.</comment>
