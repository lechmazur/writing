<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Aria’s motive and actions are clear (prune, plant, cook), but she faces little friction and shows limited contradictory impulses. Interiority leans declarative (“informally wise,” “gentle rebellion”) rather than embodied conflict. The final recognition of healing reads earned but low-cost. A stronger on‑page dilemma would deepen character change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the celestial alignment ratchets mood toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in the sprout and meal. Orientation is crisp early; the scene holds. Closure lands conceptually but the cost is soft—no meaningful foreclosed path beyond a reaffirmation of purpose. The middle lacks a decisive tightening beyond the alignment’s crest.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vivid and sensorially integrated (vines, corroded beams, pruning tactile detail). The setting supports tone and discovery (seed found in tangles) and charges the final image. However, it seldom constrains tactics beyond atmosphere. Strong specificity without turning into a decisive pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (create a dish at the alignment) is stated early but opposition is minimal. The key turn is the seed’s discovery via pruning; afterward, pressure doesn’t tighten—no risk of failure, loss, or trade‑off on the page. The alignment functions more as backdrop than live clock. Resolution arrives without a visible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rebirth from decay and art as healing emerge coherently, and the sprout reframes the greenhouse. Yet the text often states its theme (“not just about cooking but about healing”) rather than letting image and action do the work. Symbolism (knowledge fruit) trends tidy and unambiguous. The ending resonates but edges into moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Consistent, measured close third with a gentle lyrical cadence suited to the material. Some diction repeats (“reverence,” “otherworldly glow”) and generic abstractions flatten peaks. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm holds, if a bit uniform.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clean syntax and mostly precise sentences, but redundancy and mild overwriting sap momentum (“reverence” appears twice in close proximity; several lines paraphrase prior claims). Intensifiers and abstractions substitute for concrete complication at times. The prose carries atmosphere yet could cut 10–15% to sharpen force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—memory‑tasting chef, abandoned greenhouse, cosmological convergence—is fresh and coherent. “Synaptic plasticity” as stated method reads grafted rather than organic. The piece risks a high‑lyric register but stays narratively cautious. Originality stems more from premise than from turn-level invention.</comment>
