<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Her desire to protect and invigorate her business is clear, but interiority leans abstract (“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal approaches”) and lacks character‑specific contradiction. The main action—deciding to design a new room—reads credible but low‑pressure. Embodied feeling is modest (pacing, handling the seed), with little friction beyond sleeplessness. The arc ends with renewed purpose but without a visible moral or relational cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (nocturnal brook, cottage, dawn), and the piece holds a single scene with a two‑shard feel (night to morning). Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the seed shifts from mystery to catalyst. Cost is light (fatigue), and the tightening is modest (decision to outline the plant‑themed room). The throughline is coherent, if gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The brook, moonlight, and dawn create a consistent, atmospheric container that supports tone and mirrors her inward vigilance. Details integrate with action (pacing along the brook, returning to the cottage). However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mostly mood‑paints. The corpse flower seed as object‑setting fares better by charging the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and professional (creativity and innovation), but pressure scarcely escalates beyond contemplation. The single meaningful turn is the decision to design the new room; the visible price is only exhaustion. There’s no opposing force testing commitment or foreclosing options. Tension remains soft, with cadence deepening more than tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Themes of receptivity, mystery as catalyst, and safeguarding creative space emerge coherently through images (seed, brook, night into dawn). Some lines risk platitude or self‑summary, especially near the end where the thesis is articulated. The final image (seed as emblem beside the outlined plan) offers a modest reweighting rather than a hard epiphany. Subtext is present but not combative or ambivalent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and consistent; the diction is gently elevated and mostly controlled. Recurrent phrasing (“flow,” “storm‑born silence”) builds a pattern but edges toward sameness. The perceptual signature is competent yet generic; little idiolect sets her apart. Rhythm is even, with limited modulation under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and readable, with steady cadence and clean syntax. Redundancy and motif overuse (“flow,” “storm‑born,” repeated abstractions) create mild loopiness and dilute impact. Figurative language tilts purple in spots without adding precision. Line‑level economy could be tightened to increase momentum and density.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The pairing of an escape‑room designer and a corpse flower seed is a fresh angle, and the quiet, accumulative approach avoids melodrama. However, the execution chooses safe options: minimal complication, light cost, familiar inspirational cadence. The final reconfiguration is apt but not surprising. More distinctive sensibility or a risked trade‑off would raise originality.</comment>
