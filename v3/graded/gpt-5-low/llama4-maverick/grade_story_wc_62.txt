<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clear desire and profession-grounded actions (chiseling, ribbon, poem) but few pressured micro-choices or contradictory impulses on the page. The mentor relationship adds warmth but exerts little immediate pressure. Interiority leans reflective rather than dramatized struggle. The final acceptance reads earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: work → mentor → ribbon/poem → butterflies → repriced understanding. Orientation is clean early, single scene coherence maintained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a felt shift (“she had finally discovered the shape of collective grief”), though cost is gentle. Tightening is present via density increase rather than causal turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse, dusk, and incoming butterflies create a vivid, sensorial atmosphere that filters through the carver’s priorities. The environment charges the final image (lunar glow, clustering butterflies among headstones). Details are purposeful without tourist cataloging. It shapes mood and insight more than choice but does so decisively.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal understanding; escalation occurs through accumulating images and the mentor’s nudge, not through a hard choice. There is a cadence shift as butterflies arrive, but no sharp foreclosure or trade-off. The peace gained implies cost (accepting grief) yet isn’t stressed under pressure. Tension remains low-grade and steady.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonance arises from concrete particulars (carving, ribbon, poem, butterflies) but is undercut by explicit theme statements (“shape of collective grief,” “beautiful and terrible”). Subtext exists in the migration/headstone pairing, yet the final paragraphs lean toward telling. The insight feels sincere, if somewhat generalized.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Consistent close third with lyrical restraint; diction fits the character’s contemplative stance. Some generic phrases (“complex and wondrous thing,” “thundering calm”) thin the distinctness. Rhythm is even, if occasionally uniform. No head-hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clean sentences and clear sequencing; imagery is coherent. Repetitive stems (“The carver…”) and summary abstractions near the end slow momentum. Occasional purple-ish phrasing and paraphrase-like reiteration dampen density. Overall readable but not sharply cut.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gravestone carver in an ancient greenhouse with spectral mentorship and butterfly migration is a fresh synthesis. The ghosts/poetry/ribbon thread personalizes grief without gimmickry. Risk is modest, with familiar lyrical cadences tempering novelty. Ending image is lovely if not surprising.</comment>
