<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (restore harmony), but internal contradiction and cost are minimal, yielding a largely untroubled competence arc. The mapkeeper’s method and attention offer specificity, yet her emotional texture stays generalized (“driven by a deep motivation”) rather than embodied or conflicted. Micro-choices (study cracks, conjure hush) occur, but without visible stakes if she fails. The resolution grants fulfillment without a felt trade-off or loss.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual attention to ice patterns and resonance builds toward a hush that lands on the page. Causality is soft but coherent (study → conjure → beings attune → hush blooms). Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration, but cost is under-articulated, dulling impact. The single-scene flow is clear with no orientation debt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harmonic caves, ice crack patterns, and energy beings create an atmospheric, sensorially integrated world. The echo stone and ice function as micro-setting tools that guide method and charge the final image (“gentle luminosity”). World rules are consistent and learned through action rather than dump. Depth of constraint is moderate rather than decisive, keeping it below the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding quiet) is clear, but pressure barely tightens: no reversal, no hard trade-off, and minimal consequence for failure. The “storm of vibrations” establishes conflict, yet the protagonist meets little resistance en route to success. Escalation is a smooth cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options. The ending lacks an unmistakable price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of balance, attentiveness, and restorative quiet coheres through recurring images (cracks, resonance, bloom of hush). Some lines verge on declarative moral (“sanctuary of peace”), trimming ambiguity. Resonance is earned texturally more than by ethical calculus or subtextual reversal. The final image offers serenity but little reframing cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Consistent, gently lyric third-person with a steady diction tied to acoustics and frost. Repetition (“bloom of hush,” “harmonics”) provides pattern but edges into sameness. Psychic distance is stable, though interiority leans summary over idiosyncratic thought. No head-hopping or register shocks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clean sentences and clear sequencing, but paraphrase loops and stock stems (“The mapkeeper…”) recur and thin momentum. Figurative language is controlled, yet repetition reduces density and propulsion. Some phrasing leans abstract rather than concrete embodiment in peak beats. The final cadence is gentle but not particularly compressed or surprising at the line level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Original inflections—the “ripple-mark mapkeeper,” “echo chamber stone,” and “bloom of hush”—feel fresh and coherent. The arc itself is familiar (ritual attention restores balance) and risks little conflict-wise. Still, the specific method (reading ice stress as resonance) gives it texture. The ending’s serenity is earned but not reimagined with a striking, costly turn.</comment>
