<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation (thaw mistrust with transparency) is explicit and consistent, but interiority leans generic and declarative rather than character‑particular. The registrar makes small micro‑choices (stooping for tickets, raising the lens) but faces little opposition or contradictory impulse. Emotional shifts (“freed by honesty”) feel told more than earned on the page. The final resolve reads credible but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: images recur until the raised lens offers a gentle reweighting. Orientation is solid, and closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when the lens reframes the scene. However, there’s minimal on‑page cost or constraint at the ending; the decisive change feels conceptual rather than pressured. The single scene holds, but escalation is faint.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt after rain and the “resonant hush” are vividly rendered with consistent sensory texture. The lens acts as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. Yet the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; it mostly moods the scene. Specificity is strong but not functionally binding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes (overcoming secrecy/mistrust) remain abstract, with little concrete pressure or counterforce. The primary tightening is the act of raising the lens, which shifts perception but doesn’t foreclose a live option. No reversal or visible price is paid; tension stays steady rather than climbing. Resolution is more acceptance than tested choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Themes of honesty, transparency, and clarity are coherent and threaded through recurring objects. Subtext is limited because the story often states its thesis (“freed by honesty”) instead of letting images carry it. The final image offers conceptual repricing but skirts sentimentality via repetition. Complexity and counter‑readings are minimal.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close is stable, with consistent diction and cadence. Voice suits the meditative mode, though it leans toward generalized solemnity rather than a distinct perceptual signature. No head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm is even but risks sameness.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft shows fluency, yet repetition (“resonant hush,” “mistrust and secrecy melted away,” “freed by honesty”) creates paraphrase loops and softens impact. Figurative density occasionally turns purple without adding new information. Momentum is slowed by restated insights rather than layered detail. Clarity is fine, but cuts could heighten propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The night registrar in a crystal forecourt with a projector lens is a fresh constellation of elements. However, the core turn—clarity through honesty—lands familiar and platitudinal. The doodle‑tickets as a listening method adds a nice, if under‑pressured, twist. Overall ingenuity is present but not transformative.</comment>
