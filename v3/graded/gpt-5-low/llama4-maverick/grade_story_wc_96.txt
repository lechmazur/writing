<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—forge beauty from anarchy, rebuild as resistance—but internal contradiction (molting personas) is told, not dramatized under pressure. The friendship motive is moving yet functions as summary rather than a live crucible. Embodied emotion appears in small touches (coffee tin, moonlight) but peak choices lack felt cost. The final stance feels earned but a bit frictionless.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the poet commits and begins rebuilding; dawn reframes hope. However, the cost is lightly implied and obstacles never test the resolution on the page. Structure is coherent with a single scene glide, but beats often summarize rather than tighten.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rusted library, moonlight, and the coffee tin create a palpable atmosphere; sensory detail is selective and consistent. The setting charges the final image (dawn in the library) even if it seldom constrains choice. World rules and spatial anchors are stable. Some imagery leans conventional (“beacon of hope,” “phoenix”) but the place feels lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rebuild the library) is signaled early, yet pressure scarcely escalates—no obstacle or trade‑off narrows options. The “resistance” remains conceptual and never forces a tactical shift or priced choice. The tightening beat is the decision to begin, which is not tested. The result reads aspirational rather than hard‑won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Themes of redemption through art, friendship as method, and hope amid decay are consistent. Subtext is present in objects (false‑bottom tin as hidden reserves), yet the piece states its thesis more than it lets images do the work. The ending’s dawn image offers resonance, but edges toward sentimentality. Complexity is suggested (molting identities) without on‑page complication.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and lyrical with a distinct texture; diction is mostly controlled. Some clichés and repeated constructions (“beacon,” “phoenix,” reiterated resolve) flatten the voice in high beats. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. The rhythm suits the contemplative mode but rarely sharpens at moments that should bite.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line‑level clarity is solid, but paraphrase loops (“rebuild,” “beacon of hope,” reiterated purpose) slow momentum. Figurative choices occasionally turn purple or familiar, dulling precision. Information density is moderate with summary dominating action. Cadence varies, yet peak beats could cut deeper with concrete, priced detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The false‑bottom coffee tin and prison‑library friendship hint at fresh angles, but execution leans on familiar resistance/hope rhetoric. The premise risks the safety-middle: big ideas without specific, costly turns. Still, the synthesis of vagrant poet, derelict library, and dawn has a memorable silhouette. Greater tactical specificity would lift originality.</comment>
