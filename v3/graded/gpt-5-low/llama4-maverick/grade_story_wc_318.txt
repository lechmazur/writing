<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Elwes’s goal is clear and consistent, but interior contradiction and micro-choices are thin; he mostly performs, with little dramatized hesitation or competing impulse. Embodied emotion appears (“mournfully eager,” exhaustion), yet reads label-forward at times. His endurance pays off in a credible shift (laughter returns), but the price is modestly felt. No relational crucible on the page limits complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the performance densifies from roar to hush to laughter, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with a gentle cost (exhaustion; bittersweet stasis). Orientation is clear despite a clunky, duplicated hourglass line. The single-scene arc stays coherent without causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel and the leaf blower function as lived micro-setting; acoustics plausibly shape the tactic and final image. Sensory and tonal specificity build atmosphere without losing spatial clarity. Some symbolism edges toward overt, but the environment remains active and consequential. The ending reprises the setting/tool to charge the legacy image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are singular (restore laughter), and pressure accumulates as sound transforms, but escalation is gentle and largely linear. The key tightening is the shift from cacophony to lullaby to emergent whispers/laughter. Cost is present but underplayed, keeping tension modest. Agency drives the outcome without reversals or hard trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Themes of tending to the unspoken and music as healing arise organically from the act of conducting and the house’s response. However, explicit thesis-like phrases (“a testament to the power of tending to the unspoken,” “a true haunting”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. The final image still resonates as a quiet repricing of grief into bittersweet beauty. Emotional honesty is intact if somewhat declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice is stable and apt, with controlled cadence and consistent distance. Some diction trends purple or clichéd (“vanished into the shadows,” “true haunting”), but the tonal fabric holds. No head-hopping; stance remains coherent. Rhythm mostly serves the accumulative build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line-level overwriting and repetition occasionally dull momentum; the hourglass sentence contains a visible duplication error. Several near-duplicate phrases and intensifiers (“haunting,” “mournful”) create synonym churn. Figurative density is high without always earning it, though basic clarity survives. Trimming would heighten propulsion and precision.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The leaf-blower-as-symphony-conductor premise is fresh and memorable, energizing a familiar haunted-house healing arc. The choice to stage music via a mundane machine shows ingenuity without gimmickry. The resolution, while tender, follows expected contours. Risks are taken in conceit more than in structure or reversal.</comment>
