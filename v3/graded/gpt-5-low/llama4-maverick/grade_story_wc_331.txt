<question>1</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—she tends the library’s “analog memories” and seeks to reawaken stories—but interiority remains generalized and largely declarative. There’s little on‑page conflict or contradictory impulse; she simply persists. Micro‑choices (“pencil moved with increasing urgency”) exist but lack consequence. The result is a steady portrait rather than a pressured character turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density and urgency build as lamps fade and the scarf shimmers, culminating in the stories’ “gentle hum.” Closure arrives with the reawakening, but the cost is soft (time, solitude) and not distinctly priced. Orientation is strong: who/where/when are clear early. The single scene holds together, yet the ending’s Charged Poise lacks a sharper before/after cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library is vividly rendered (old paper, sandalwood, reading lamps), filtered through a professional gaze. The scarf and lamps recur to charge the final image, though they don’t constrain a choice. Sensory balance is solid; the environment coheres and supports tone. Strong atmosphere, even if not tactically determinative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract: reawaken stories versus failure has no concrete pressure beyond time passing. Escalation is minimal—a cadence shift as lamps fade and urgency rises—without a narrowing of options or trade‑off. No antagonist or counterforce tests her aim. The resolution lands, but the price paid is barely felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Themes of stories as living entities and art/science entwined are clear, but often told outright (“She believed…”) rather than earned through friction. The scarf’s glow and the hum of stories give some resonance at the end. Ambiguity is limited; the piece affirms rather than interrogates its premise. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not profound.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV distance and stance are consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register. Diction suits the meditative mode, and rhythm steadies as urgency rises. Some repetition of sentence stems (“As she…,” “The librarian…”) flattens cadence. Still, the voice is coherent and apt for the design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clean, grammatically sound lines with occasional lushness; however, paraphrase loops and repeated constructions reduce momentum. Several sentences restate the same idea of tending/mapping/reawakening without adding pressure. Figurative language is controlled and not contradictory, but density sometimes approaches purple. The final image reads clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fusion of hyperbolic geometry with a “scientific poetry library” is fresh and appealing. The scarf as a quasi‑instrumental talisman adds texture. Execution plays it safe—no surprising turn or cost that reframes the premise. Strong concept, moderate ingenuity at the level of scene craft.</comment>
