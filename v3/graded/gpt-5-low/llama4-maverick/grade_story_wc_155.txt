<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (to rekindle joy through creation), and small choices (pocketing the fragment, deciding to display the mural in situ) align. Interiority is mostly told rather than dramatized, with minimal contradictory impulses under pressure. The emotional turn lands, but at low heat, without a visible cost beyond relinquishing the work to the fog. Stronger on devotion than on conflict-driven self-revelation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer toward a charged final image where the orchard seems reanimated by the mural. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration—the fragment integrated, the film transformed, the place briefly “reborn.” Cost is soft and largely conceptual (leaving the art to the ruins), which tempers impact. Orientation is clean and the single-shard structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fogged orchard is vivid and sensorial, with tactile details (damp earth, decaying leaves) and recurring images that charge the ending. The environment shapes tone and the decision to leave the mural there, though it rarely constrains choice. Recurring objects (fragment, film) are integrated into space effectively. Strong atmosphere without overburdening logistics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering joy) is clear but faces limited pressure; escalation is gentle rather than tightening. The key “turn” is the decision to unroll and use the abandoned film, but consequences are largely aesthetic. No live option is dramatically foreclosed on the page. Tension remains low and untested by genuine risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of reclamation, art as resurrection, and permeability of reality/dream accrue through image patterns. Occasional telling (“She had been feeling lost…”) blunts subtext. The final image reweights the orchard with quiet resonance, if not surprise. Complexity is modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is steady and controlled; lyric diction suits the piece. The voice is consistent, if sometimes generic in phrasing. Lack of dialogue is appropriate to the solitary mood. Rhythm is smooth with few register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clean sentences and effective sensory detail carry momentum, though some lines paraphrase adjacent content and lean on familiar formulations. Figurative language is tasteful and not overstacked. Minor repetition and declarative scaffolding in reflective beats slightly dull sharpness. Ending image reads clearly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The exposed film repurposed as a “curtain of color” and the fresco fragment’s glow offer fresh touches within a familiar “artist rediscovers spark in ruins” frame. Synthesis is cohesive but not daring. Risks are tonal rather than structural, landing softly. Memorable atmosphere more than a novel turn.</comment>
