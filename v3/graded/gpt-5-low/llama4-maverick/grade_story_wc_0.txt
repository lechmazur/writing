<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Maria’s motives are clear (cleanup, curiosity, demystifying drama) and her interior lens is consistent, but her emotional life remains abstract and minimally embodied. Micro-choices are slight (collecting dust, continued examination) and face little pressure. Contradictory impulses rarely spark on the page, so change feels more affirmed than earned. The closing humility reads true but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens, oriented early (greenhouse after a flood) and sustained. Closure is a conceptual repricing—decay and cosmic order unify—yet the cost is light and largely asserted. The scene’s arc is more meditation than turn, with one continuous cadence. Still, the final image coheres under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse and flood debris offer tactile anchors (damp earth, grimy panes, sediment). Professional bias filters details plausibly through a scientist’s eye. Setting enhances tone and motif but rarely constrains choices. The butterfly dust functions as micro‑setting with modest charge at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pressure scarcely tightens; conflict stays internal and largely declarative. No decisive foreclosing choice or visible price materializes, only reaffirmed outlook. The dust find could have escalated inquiry but remains reflective. Stakes feel conceptual more than lived.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme is coherent—gradual change, decay as creative, chaos/order—but often stated outright (“reality preprocesses itself”) rather than earned by scene. Recurring dust imagery provides some subtextual carry. The final peace resonates mildly without sentimentality, but the essayistic assertions dilute depth. A sharper on‑page test would deepen thematic consequence.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is steady and diction suits a contemplative scientist. Rhythm is even, if somewhat uniform, with occasional repetition of conceptual phrasing. The voice maintains modest distance and confidence without head‑hopping. It could use more texture and modulation under “pressure.”</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and consistent, but conceptual repetition (“gradual change,” “preprocesses”) yields minor loops. Sentences often tell rather than compress multiple jobs via image. Line rhythm is steady to a fault, reducing propulsion. No major figurative muddle, just over‑articulation of thesis.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fusion of neutron‑star inquiry with post‑flood greenhouse and butterfly dust is fresh. The “preprocessing reality” notion is distinctive even if abstract. Lack of dramatic turns keeps ingenuity from landing with force. Still, the synthesis feels personal and coherent.</comment>
