<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The skipper’s motives (guarding the lighthouse, seeking safety) are clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (pocketing the glass, building the cairn, resolving to protect) reveal him. Interiority is concrete and character‑specific through observation rather than analysis. However, internal contradiction and felt cost remain mild; the ache soothes rather than forcing a difficult trade‑off. The Earned Stasis is credible but low‑pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrue from lantern room to cairn to sea glass reprise, culminating in a Charged Poise resolve. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. Closure lands as a quiet stance crystallization but with limited on‑page cost. The anonymous letters setup doesn’t cash out structurally, slightly thinning the pressure lattice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and selective: lantern room dust, prisms, rocky shore, chill air, and the sea’s rhythm all filter through his seafaring gaze. The sea glass functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image. While the environment strongly tones the piece, it rarely constrains options beyond mood. The haunted presence is evocative but not tactically engaged.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on preserving a sense of safety against encroaching darkness, but the pressure escalates gently rather than decisively. The outage and letters create unease, yet no turn forecloses a live option. The main tightening is his choice to build the cairn and commit to tending the light. Cost remains mostly internal and soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of watchfulness, communal signaling, and the desire to fix safety in a dangerous world emerge organically from objects and ritual. The final image (blue ember, sentinel lighthouse) reframes earlier motifs with earned tenderness. Repetition of “luminescent ache” risks overstatement but doesn’t collapse into moralizing. The letter motif promises a paranoia thread that isn’t developed thematically beyond mood.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third‑person limited remains steady with a distinct perceptual signature—practical, tactile noticing turned lyrical at edges. Syntax varies well and the cadence supports the meditative drift. No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few phrases recur (“luminescent ache”), flirting with sameness but not breaking control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean, rhythmic lines with efficient concrete detail carry momentum for a quiet piece. Some paraphrase/adjective loops and motif reiterations (“glow,” “luminescent ache”) soften impact. Figurative language stays coherent and within the narrator’s lexicon. The prose could cut a few near‑duplicates for tighter propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse melancholy is familiar, but the cairn‑as‑message and sea glass as portable ember add fresh inflections. The anonymous‑letter rumor hints at a bolder angle that remains untapped. Emotional truth feels specific to this keeper‑adjacent skipper rather than generic. Not risky, but cohesive and considered.</comment>
