<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clear roles and aims (actor-pragmatist, survivor-contemplative, historian-mission-driven) but interiority is thin and largely told. The actor’s alliance proposal is the only real micro-choice under pressure and carries little visible cost. Emotional texture leans abstract over embodied contradiction. Final repricing for the survivor (pawns as opportunities) is nice but lightly earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: the walking-words and chessboard motifs build to a quiet Charged Poise. Orientation is clean; one continuous scene. Closure arrives via a reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, but costs and narrowed options remain vague, keeping it short of stronger structural impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery and the chessboard create a coherent, moody space with acoustics and echoing footsteps that suit the concept. However, the environment seldom constrains choices or tactics beyond amplification. Details feel selective and consistent, if more emblematic than lived-in. The final image is atmospherically charged but not materially pressured by setting.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stakes stay abstract: “unbind the past” and fill a void; opposition is essentially absent. The alliance forms without friction, and escalation is a soft deepening (words spelled; they follow) rather than a pressured narrowing. The final re-seeing of the pawns suggests potential but no on-page trade-off or loss. Tension operates mostly at the conceptual level, limiting urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Coherent themes of absence, agency, and reframing history accrue through recurring images (missing pawns, interregnum, luminous absence). Subtext exists but is frequently overtaken by declarative mission statements (“I have come to unbind the past”). The final repricing—seeing pawns as opportunities—lands, though it leans symbolic over felt consequence. Little moral calculus or ambiguity is tested in action.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stable third-person with a controlled, gently lyrical cadence; repetition (“luminous absence”) feels intentional. Dialogue is sparse but functional; no head-hopping or register clashes. Rhythm is even, perhaps too even for pressure, but readable and consistent with the piece’s aims. Voice is distinctive enough without becoming precious.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is clear and mostly economical; some conceptual redundancy (“luminous absence,” “unbind the past”) softens momentum. Images are coherent and not over-mixed; syntax is steady but can verge on inert. A few lines do double duty, yet concrete embodiment is limited. The cadence supports mood more than propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The walking-as-words device, the crisis actor/survivor pairing, and the whispering gallery are fresh inflections that cohere. The piece risks an abstract, accumulative structure, which fits but dampens dramatic novelty. Conceptual ingenuity outpaces dramatic ingenuity; no surprising turn arises from character pressure. Still, the synthesis feels intentional and memorable.</comment>
