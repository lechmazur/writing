<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The protagonist’s motive—share light without fire—is clear but largely declared, not stress-tested. Interiority is generalized (“troubling serenity”) with minimal contradictory impulses in scene. The only micro-choices (holding the gear, increasing sonar pings) do not force trade-offs. Change at the end reads as endurance rather than a choice with felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: a lyric drift culminates in the fading sonar and a legacy image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (gentle sharing over fire) but the cost is soft and mostly asserted. Orientation is clear early (nebula garden, single POV). Structure is linear and coherent, though turns are minimal.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and consistently filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility. Sensory selection supports tone (petals/starlight metaphor, tendrils, echoes). However, the environment rarely constrains action; it’s more canvas than crucible. The recurring gear acts as micro-setting but doesn’t shape tactics.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain abstract (“share light without fire”) and face no concrete resistance. The sonar pinging increasing in frequency suggests deepening, but no option is foreclosed or price paid. Pressure does not tighten toward a consequential decision. The ending coasts on mood rather than escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of gentleness over destructive passion is explicit and often told (“true illumination came not from flames”). Recurrences (gear, sonar, petals) echo the thesis but rarely evolve to deepen ambiguity or cost. Subtext is thin; the piece nears sermonizing in final paragraphs. Some resonance lingers in the “legacy” and fading pings image.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Consistent third-person lyric voice with steady diction and rhythm. Repetition creates mood but risks monotony and abstraction. Distance control is stable, though the prose sometimes generalizes instead of embodying perception. No dialogue, and the narrative certainty fits the meditative frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is clean but leans into redundancy and purple abstraction (“infinite beauty,” “otherworldly energy”) without fresh turns. Several sentences reiterate the same idea across adjacent lines, slowing momentum. Figurative clusters (flowers/petals/echoes) are coherent but overused. Rhythm is smooth yet uniform, muting propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The nebula-garden + sonar-pinging + anti-fire ethos is a fresh constellation of images. However, the execution stays safely abstract, avoiding bolder structural or ethical complications. The gear as talisman is a nice touch but underutilized. Originality is more in palette than in turning choices.</comment>
