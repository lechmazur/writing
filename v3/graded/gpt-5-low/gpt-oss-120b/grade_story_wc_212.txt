<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (reopen the covenant; feel “borrowed time”) are clear and embodied (“furiously tranquil”) and her choices—placing the acorn cap, surrendering the present, planting the seed—align with them. Internal contradiction is present but subtle, more tonal than pressured. The absence of a counter‑force or relational pressure limits the felt cost of her acceptance. Still, her final act reads earned by the scene’s build.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the vortex intensifies, the atrium transforms, and the ritual crescendos into a reweighted end where she plants the seed and internalizes the covenant. Orientation is clear from the start; the pattern is taught and sustained. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive contest, with a conceptual cost (surrendering present, borrowing future) legible though soft. No causality breaks or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and copper basin are vivid and functional; environment coevolves with action (ice to mist; humming glass) and the acorn cap materially constrains the ritual. Sensory detail is purposeful across sound, touch, and smell, filtered through Mira’s vocation. The setting charges the final image (aurora glow; frost‑kissed soil) and shapes options. Minor symbolism edges close to overt but stays in service of action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (reopen the covenant; accept guardianship) are legible and deepen as the vortex thickens and the atrium melts. The key tightening is her surrender of the cap—foreclosing a path of holding back. Cost remains largely conceptual and lyrical, so tension never fully bites. Nonetheless, escalation coheres under the chosen lens and resolves via her agency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship and time’s texture arises through concrete actions and recurring images (acorn cap, mist, “borrowed time”). The final planting reframes time as tactile and cultivable, a resonant answer without moralizing. A few direct invocations (“Teach me the feel of borrowed time”) flirt with statement, but the scene earns them. The phoenix’s temporal “gears” rain adds a memorable thematic turn.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely held to Mira, with consistent diction and patterned rhythm matching the accumulative mode. Imagery clusters are coherent; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional lushness risks sameness of cadence, but voice remains distinct and legible under pressure. Elision is purposeful and paid off in the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is rich and mostly precise, with strong verb choices and multi‑tasking images. However, figurative density is high in peak beats (“vortex inheritance” repeats; stacked metaphors like mist singing lullabies, time as gears, sap, grain) creating mild purple pressure. Momentum holds and clarity survives, but a trim would heighten propulsion. No mechanical errors or confusing sequencing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Seed‑saving fused with a frost‑feathered phoenix and a ritual of entropy‑reversal feels fresh and committed. The acorn cap as vortex anchor and “borrowed time” as texture yield distinctive images and a non‑obvious synthesis. The cost frame is gentler than the premise promises, slightly blunting risk. Still, the vision coheres as its own stance rather than assembling tropes.</comment>
