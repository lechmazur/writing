<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s “forgiving skeptic” stance and bone‑setter competence are clear and consistent, with embodied interiority (tingling hands, coaxing vertebrae) that suits her aims. The contradiction between yearning for resolution and holding onto skepticism is present, but the cost of this balance never quite bites. Her micro‑choices—kneeling, aligning bones, deciding to keep the tooth—reveal values under pressure. However, struggle is low; success feels largely unopposed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds to the last vertebra set, the garden’s “inhale,” and the reweighted star maps (RR/CR closure). Because/therefore chains are minimal, but motif escalation is coherent and lands on the page. The cost is mostly conceptual—accepting the impossible while preserving skepticism—rather than dramatized. A small logic wobble appears when she pockets the tooth but the garden later “nurtures” its light.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze are vivid and functional, supplying the tooth and charging the final image; environmental breath and roots entwine with action. Object‑as‑setting integration is strong (tooth, vines, spine clicks) and filtered through her practitioner’s eye. Sensory detail supports tone without static postcard description. World rules feel consistent for a lyrical‑fantastic mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mend the substitute body / narrow the “cleft in certainty”) is clear but faces little resistance. The tightening is a gentle cadence change—aligning bones to the final click—rather than a foreclosing trade‑off. Consequences are largely asserted as possibility rather than tested under pressure. The ending’s choice to keep the tooth hints at cost but doesn’t force a visible loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motifs (constellations, cleft, tooth) braid into a coherent meditation on error, redemption, and belief. The final images reweight earlier material; the sky literally takes on her revised constellations. However, “Mistakes are not failures; they are the dark matter…” states the thesis directly, dulling subtext in the final third. The piece otherwise resists simplistic moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Mara’s perception with consistent stance. Diction and rhythm are distinctive and mostly disciplined; patterning (clicks, breath, stars) feels intentional. Some phrase repetition (“shrewdly innocent,” recurring abstractions) slightly flattens modulation under peak beats. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is largely strong with purposeful syntactic variety and charged images (“each click of vertebrae”). There’s occasional purple density and paraphrase looping that could be trimmed for sharper momentum. The thematic aphorism reads as an expository tell. Clarity remains intact through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fusion of bone‑setting with a changeling relic to repair epistemic fracture is fresh and coherent. The constellations/redemption mapping feels earned through specific tactile acts, not just concept. Stakes are intimate rather than grand, keeping ingenuity grounded. Lack of a sharper on‑page price keeps it shy of the top tier.</comment>
