<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (“interpret silence with empathy”) drives concrete actions (projector setup, map overlay). The interior contradiction—“shielded openness” versus potential overwhelm—adds nuance but the felt cost remains modest. Micro‑choices (pausing frames, aligning raindrops) reveal value hierarchy credibly. A deeper, riskier emotional or ethical trade‑off would raise stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image layering and pattern alignment build toward the realization that the tear is a portal, culminating in the chapel’s muted reawakening. Orientation is strong and single‑scene containment is clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with implied cost (bearing communal grief), though that cost isn’t sharply priced on the page. The sequence of projector → overlay → alignment reads coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is richly particular and functional: rain, vault, map, projector, and henge coalesce to enable the tactic of alignment and charge the final image. Sensory selection feels POV‑true and purposeful rather than touristic. Environment actively constrains choices (a wall for projection, rain as timing cue) and is not mere backdrop. Vivid without overdetailing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reopening the whispered chapel) is clear, and pressure coheres around the technical–empathetic task of alignment. The meaningful tightening is the decision to overlay the torn map and sync raindrops across decades, which reweights options and produces the portal insight. However, the on‑page price paid is subtle; there’s little risk or loss beyond emotional exposure. Tension is steady rather than sharply escalating.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—empathy reconfiguring boundaries between known/unknown—emerges through recurring images (tear, rain, projection) and the final quiet activation. Some phrasing edges into tell (“Her motivation—to interpret silence with empathy”), softening subtext. The last image reweights the premise without a tidy moral. Resonance is earned via particulars rather than abstraction.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, lyrical cadence that fits the character’s observant mind. Diction is controlled and textural without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates as the alignment intensifies, keeping legibility. A few repeated constructions/phrases slightly flatten the peak.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with strong nouns and purposeful figurative economy; images often do double duty. Minor redundancy (“shielded openness” appears twice) and occasional lushness skirt purple but don’t blur sense. Momentum persists despite lyric density. Final image lands cleanly without metaphor muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis of cartography, archival footage, and sacred architecture feels specific and memorable. The portal-as-tear reframe is elegant and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in quiet, non‑confrontational structure pay off. A sharper price or unexpected reversal could further elevate originality’s bite.</comment>
