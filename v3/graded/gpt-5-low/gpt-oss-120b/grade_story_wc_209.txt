<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and specific—Mara seeks to understand night‑blooms and to thaw her “lingering winter.” Interiority is embodied in images (postcards, lenses, tears) rather than therapy‑speak. The epiphany leans easy because the glass/postcards mechanic grants swift revelation with limited friction. Still, the shift from doubt to charged acceptance reads earned within this quiet register.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence coheres (pavilion → cathedral → lens‑garden vision → return), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the “dawning hush” reframed as promise, with her winter relinquished. Causality holds (postcard alignment triggers lenses), though the cost is soft and the mechanism verges on convenience. Orientation is crisp from the opening and carries cleanly through the single transition.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is lush and purposeful: the amber pavilion frame, the etched‑glass cathedral, and the lens “dew” directly enable the core turn. Weather/season texture (last snow, autumn amber) harmonizes with the theme and charges the final image. The environment isn’t mere backdrop; the window’s hidden layers constrain access to the vision. Sensory selection favors visual but remains precise and integrated.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are internal and steady—reckoning with a lifelong question—but pressure escalates modestly via discovery rather than hard choice. The meaningful tightening is the postcard alignment that unlocks the lenses; beyond that, risks or trade‑offs remain abstract. Cost is emotional, not situational or relational. The resolution feels earned for a lyric piece yet lacks a concrete price that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres around darkness/light dialogue and promise in liminal time; recurring images (amber, hush, lenses, night‑flowers) deepen resonance. The final image reweights earlier motifs with tenderness. Slight overstatement (“the dawning hush was not silence but a promise”) tips toward telling. Nonetheless, the insight grows from particulars rather than assertion alone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent, sensuous, and confident in a close third, with a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm varies and sustains lyric momentum without head‑hopping. A few diction choices verge on purple, but the register remains coherent with Mara’s artist sensibility. No dialogue, but the prose carries subtext through image and cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is generally clean and musical, with vivid, information‑dense images (lenses “like dew,” “frozen waterfall” of glass). Some repetition and stacked modifiers (“amber,” “hush,” “umbral tenderness”) create mild saturation and risk dulled contrast. Momentum holds, but a few sentences could be tightened without losing texture. No major clarity or grammar faults.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—postcards as communal memory unlocking a cathedral’s hidden lenses to witness nocturnal bloom—is fresh and specific. The risk lies in fusing mystical mechanics with a grounded emotional need; it works. The arc is quiet, but the conceit feels singular rather than templated. Only the low‑friction revelation limits it from higher bands.</comment>
