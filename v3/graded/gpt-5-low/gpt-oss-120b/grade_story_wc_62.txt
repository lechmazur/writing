<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—Eliam seeks the “shape of collective grief”—and his actions (bringing the ribbon, tracing butterfly paths, carving the monument) align. Interiority is textured but largely serene; contradictory impulses under pressure are minimal, so the arc reads more devotional than conflicted. Mara provides gentle pressure rather than friction, keeping choices low-stakes. The closing endurance—devoting his craft to a communal language—feels earned, if not costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece layers butterflies, ribbons, stones, and poems into a final reweighting. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the ribbon resolves into a heart and he carves the rain-basin monument that embodies the town’s grief. The cost is conceptual—subsuming individual artistry into a communal pattern—present but soft. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the sequence coheres across the migration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse at dusk, cracked panes, arches, humidity, and rain-basin integrate setting with action and final image. The space constrains tactics (arch convergence points, stone placements) and charges the ending’s ritual. Sensory texture is vivid and consistent with Eliam’s craft-minded gaze. The environment’s rules remain stable and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent—can Eliam translate collective grief into form—but pressure escalates gently through accumulation (migration phases, growing spiral) rather than friction. The decisive tightening arrives with the final wave and heart-shaped ribbon prompting the monument’s design. Costs are implied rather than dramatized. The resolution is earned but not hard-won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: grief as flow and communal tapestry rather than wound. Recurring motifs (butterflies, ribbons, water, poems) deepen and reconfigure at the end without explicit moralizing. The spectral mentorship folds tradition and craft into an ethic of care, creating resonance beyond the literal. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with a meditative craftsman’s perception. POV stays stable and confident, with metaphor and rhythm in tune with the material. No dialogue is needed; the narrative texture carries subtext. Under pressure, cadence tightens without breaking legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet mostly disciplined; images serve pattern and momentum. Occasional purple tendencies (“thundering calm,” repeated) skirt excess but don’t obscure clarity. Sentences vary, and information density is high with few redundancies. The final lines land cleanly through image rather than summary.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A gravestone carver guided by a greenhouse-bound ancestor spirit, using butterfly paths and family-poem ribbons to shape a communal monument, feels distinct. The synthesis is specific and thematically integral, not a collage of ornaments. Risks in tone and motif cohere and pay off. The turn to rain as an active element is particularly fresh.</comment>
