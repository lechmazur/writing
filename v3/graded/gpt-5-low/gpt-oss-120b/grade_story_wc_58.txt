<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—he maps a “geography of healing” by writing living obituaries—and his choices (kneeling, drawing the thread, projecting, placing it by the rose, departing) align. Interiority is image‑driven and particular, if somewhat one‑note in its solemnity. Contradictory impulses (doubt vs. faith, grief vs. hubris) are implied but not dramatized under pressure. The endurance choice at the end is earned but the cost reads soft.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs intensify toward a cadence shift when the rose revives and the shadows recede. Orientation is clean early (traveler, autumn garden, after the last ship), and the pattern holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: his “living obituaries” become maps that effect small healing, and he commits to the ongoing cost. The cost is present (endless solitary labor) though not sharply priced on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden is richly rendered through tactile and visual specifics (mosaics dimmed by moss, veined marble, bruised violet sky) and filters through his task. The recurring objects (golden weft thread, wilted/reviving rose) charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain options, it meaningfully mirrors and modulates the action (shadows receding, breath/pulse of recovery). World rules stay consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely conceptual (honor absences, enable healing), and pressure is gentle; opposition is atmospheric rather than active. The primary tightening is the shift from witnessing to effecting (reviving the rose) leading to renewed commitment. There’s little felt price or foreclosed path beyond continued solitude, so escalation never quite bites. The turn is graceful but low‑conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—healing through witness and naming absences—emerges organically from action and motifs (thread, statues, rose). The final commitment reframes obituary as waypoint rather than end, avoiding moralizing. Subtext works in the charged intimacy of projection and the “world holding its breath.” Slight sentiment creep is held in check by concrete images.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person close holds steady, with diction and rhythm consistent to the traveler’s sensibility. The perceptual signature is strong (cartographic grief, textile metaphors) and modulates with the cadence shift near the end. No head‑hopping or stance confusion. A few high-register phrases skirt preciousness but remain voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line work is polished and musical, with varied sentence rhythm and high image density. Occasional purple overtones and metaphor stacking risk saturation but rarely blur sense; momentum mostly holds. Minimal scaffolding or loops; images often do double duty. The lushness slightly dampens pressure in peak beats, moderating the ceiling.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Obituaries for the living” and a glowing palace weft thread used for intimate projection feel fresh and integrated. The revival of a rose via narrative attention is an elegant, non‑obvious turn. Though the garden setting is familiar, the textile/cartographic synthesis distinguishes it. The piece takes aesthetic risks without obscuring clarity.</comment>
