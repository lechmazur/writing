<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—“to teach dust to tell stories”—is clear and consistently enacted via specific micro‑choices (tuning the dial, donning the shawl, transcribing, pressing play). Interiority stays lyrical rather than conflicted; contradictory impulses are muted, so pressure on her psyche feels low. Actions align with her vocation and worldview in satisfying ways. The ending delivers quiet pride rather than a hard cost, which limits depth of character turn.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, when), and the accumulative/textural drive holds as density and communal attention build to the broadcast. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city receives song, dust now “tells its own tale,” and Mara embraces the conduit role. Causal threads (crackle → recognition → transcription → alignment → play) are coherent. The cost at closure is implied rather than explicit, keeping it strong but not peak.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, dust, and the shortwave radio’s glow create an immersive, coherent atmosphere that filters through Mara’s musician’s sensibility. Recurring objects (dial, shawl, ledger) charge the final image and guide tactile choices without expository weight. Sensory detail is selective and integrated with action (mist curling tighter as the signal emerges). While setting doesn’t strictly constrain options, it meaningfully charges tone and outcome.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reviving a silenced city) is signaled early; escalation comes through the signal’s arrival, the crowd’s gathering, and the precise alignment to catch the chorus. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara chooses to amplify and publicly play the pirate broadcast. Prices are soft (exposure, holding a secret for future nights), so pressure reads more ceremonial than risky. The cadence shift lands, but with limited felt jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of recovery, communal memory, and art as conduit emerge organically from actions and images (dust learning to “speak,” scores as resurrection). The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, offering a quiet, resonant answer to famine with collective song. Subtext of authorship versus transmission (copyist as creator/conduit) operates beneath the surface. Complexity is present, though the piece favors grace over tension.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person close distance maintains coherence and suits the premise; diction and rhythm match the misted, musical world. Repetition motifs (“thistled calm,” luminous glow) feel intentional and patterned. No head‑hopping or register slips. Voice remains distinctive without clogging clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant, with purposeful images doing multiple jobs (dust as atmosphere, carrier, and theme vehicle). A few near‑purple recurrences (“luminous,” “mist,” “thistled”) edge toward excess but maintain coherence and momentum. Syntax varies and paragraphs breathe with scene needs. No significant scaffolding or loops dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—an orchestra copyist channeling a pirate broadcast to teach dust to tell stories—feels freshly imagined and internally consistent. The shawl as amplifier and the radio’s luminous ink bleed are memorable twists. Risk‑taking in concept and tone pays off without obscuring the arc. Emotional costs could cut deeper, but the vision is distinctive.</comment>
