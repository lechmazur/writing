<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—decoding the “mathematics of emotion”—is clear and consistently embodied in choices (printing the ambiguous line, pressing ink to the halo, mapping feelings to intervals). The interiority is vivid but largely unconflicted; contradictory impulses are implied (self-dissolution vs. control) rather than dramatized in a pressured beat. The earned shift is her acceptance of ongoing self-disorientation, with a conceptual cost of eroding boundaries. A sharper on‑page tug between fear and pursuit would lift the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via pattern density—printing, infusion, refracted ciphers—culminating in the halo’s cracking and the shard collection. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: emotion redefined as a transposed function, with the price of continued self‑unmaking. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the ending image reweights prior details without a causal break. The cost is more thematic than visceral, but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, dust, press, and brass cradle are specific and purposeful; the topaz dust’s refraction directly conditions the cipher’s legibility. Atmosphere and setting evolve with the action (violet pulsing walls, halo brightening, final galaxy‑like glow) and charge the last image. World rules are learned through tactile interaction rather than exposition. Strong integration without over-tourism.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is focused (discover the theorem of emotion), and escalation is a density increase: ambiguous line → infusion → echoing verses → bodily alignment → object rupture. The decisive tightening arrives with the halo cracking, which both rewards and prices the pursuit. Pressure is largely internal and aesthetic rather than antagonistic, keeping costs conceptual rather than concrete. One more constrained choice under pressure would heighten stakes.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The piece coherently pursues how empathy can be transposed and encoded, culminating in shards as micro‑verses—an effective non‑literal answer. However, explicit thematic statements (“emotion is not a static variable but a transposed function”) blunt subtext. The final images resonate, but a touch less didactic phrasing would allow the imagery to carry more of the wisdom. The ambiguity generally serves reflection rather than confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A steady, lyric close-third voice with a distinct perceptual signature sustains control; diction and rhythm fit the sensibility of a meticulous printer-philosopher. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head‑hopping or unjustified certainties. Occasional purple inflections verge on over-saturation but rarely obscure sense. The modulation at the climax is clear and earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prose is lush and mostly precise, with strong image economy (cracked mirror, violet pulse, refracted ciphers). Figurative density is high across most lines, creating minor heaviness and occasional near‑redundancy (“lucid turbulence” motif recurs without adding pressure). Momentum holds, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. Trimming a few abstractions would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress craft, halo fragment, empathy as transposition under a topaz dome—feels fresh and coherent. Turns arise from established methods (ambiguous printing, refracted reading) rather than late rule changes. The shard‑gathering finale reconfigures the premise elegantly. Novelty is earned through specificity rather than quirk for its own sake.</comment>
