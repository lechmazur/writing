<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s goal and temperament are clear (ambitious herbalist seeking serenity), and her micro-choices—slipping the seed into her satchel, planting it, journaling, and whispering to the soil—track coherently. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific through scent. However, internal conflict is minimal and largely untested; she faces little resistance or contradictory impulse on the page. The final acceptance costs her little beyond patience and an overwhelming scent.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern (seed → sprout → bloom) tightens toward the communal inhalation and the sealed doodle with essence, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset (treetop village, herbalist, seed). The closure lands, though the legible cost is light (time, endurance, the potent perfume). Causality is more ritual accretion than pressure-driven turns, but coherence holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The treetop village and balcony birch create a vivid, sensorially balanced atmosphere (mist-clad river, hanging terrariums, shifting perfumes). Details are filtered through Lira’s olfactory bias, enriching tone and mood. While the setting deeply textures the piece, it rarely constrains action or choices beyond providing a balcony plot. Strong specificity without functional constraint keeps it below the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes (will Lira cultivate serenity and earn the corpse flower’s bloom) remain largely abstract and unopposed, with escalation expressed as gentle accrual rather than tangible narrowing. The single tightening is the transition from sprout to bloom and the village gathering, but no option is foreclosed or traded. The “price” is patience and enduring a powerful scent. Pressure is coherent but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motifs (seed, scent, doodles, wildflower hush) align around serenity within motion and communal wisdom, and the final image reaffirms it. However, the piece states its thesis outright multiple times (“serenity can be cultivated within motion”), especially near the end, blunting subtext. The realization feels earned but tidily articulated. More implication and fewer thesis statements would deepen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is consistently lush and sensorial, with a distinct olfactory signature that matches Lira’s vocation and desire. Distance and tense remain steady; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control is generally strong, though the diction occasionally edges toward ornamental repetition (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “wildflower hush”). Still, the lyric register feels intentional and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with varied syntax and strong image economy in places (“leaves unfurling like pages of a forgotten manuscript”). Some overwriting and motif repetition create a mild purple sheen and small momentum drag. The prose remains clear; no major scaffold or loops obscure cause/effect. Tightening redundant assertions in the final third would sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a corpse flower ritual, scent-led perception, and a family doodling custom in a treetop village is fresh. It risks a fully lyric form and commits to it without gimmickry. The final reweighting is lovely but not surprising, and the moral clarity is safe. Still, the olfactory focus and wrapping-paper vows give the premise distinctive texture.</comment>
