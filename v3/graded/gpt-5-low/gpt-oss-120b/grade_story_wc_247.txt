<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Arlen’s motive is clear and embodied in specific actions (camera clicks as beats, hands shaping signs), and Lira’s vow gives a quiet continuation. Internal contradiction is light; joy and sorrow coexist but rarely strain choices under pressure. The cost of being forgotten is more thematic than felt in-scene, keeping the arc lovely but low-friction. Still, the character actions align with motives and reveal a coherent, particular sensibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: Arlen composes the silent music, then months later Lira tests and inherits it. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—silence mapped to light becomes an ongoing practice with a living price tied to erasure. Orientation is crisp early; the two-shard structure is legible. The cost remains conceptual more than dramatized, trimming peak impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The harbor’s moonlit environment is vivid and functional: wind and water translate signs into music, the pier and camera imprint charge the ending. Sensory detail prioritizes line-of-action elements (ripples, wind chords) rather than postcard listing. The setting shapes tactics and the final image without over-symbolizing. Constraint is gentle rather than hard, hence just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure builds as Arlen decides to “disrupt” the harbor’s rhythm and commits to a method that could fail; Lira’s reprise carries the stake forward. However, escalation is tonal rather than consequential: no option is truly foreclosed, and risk remains abstract. The cadence shift at the moon’s zenith provides one meaningful tightening consistent with the lens. Costs are implied (forgetting/erasure) rather than incurred on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Silence, memory, and the ethics of being forgotten emerge through concrete images (empty camera, camera imprint, wind‑translated signs). The final vow reframes absence as renewable creation without sermonizing, though the last sentence edges toward explicit thesis. Subtext operates in how bodies and environment “hear” without sound. Resonance lingers, if gently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is steady, with controlled cadence and an apt elevated register; the shift to Lira is clean and sectionally cued. Diction and rhythm suit the contemplative stakes without head‑hopping. Occasional ornamental phrasing risks saturation but remains legible. The perceptual signature—sensory translation of silence—feels consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with musical rhythm; images often do double duty (tool-as-metronome, harbor-as-stave). A few purple clusters and near-repetitions (“joyful sorrow,” “mapping silence”) flirt with excess but don’t blur sense. Syntax varies well; no scaffold loops or muddled metaphors mar the closure. Momentum breathes without drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>“Mapping silence onto light” via sign language and an empty camera is an original synthesis; the harbor’s responsive music feels fresh. The two‑shard continuation moves beyond a one‑off conceit into transmissible practice. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and pay off cleanly. Only the soft stakes keep it from the very top.</comment>
