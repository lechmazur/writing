<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystal clear and consistent—he seeks quiet—but internal contradiction is minimal and he faces little pressure that complicates his values. Embodied moments (“breath shallow,” “reverent hands”) help, yet he moves with near‑perfect competence. The energy beings do not act on him directly, so stress rarely degrades perception or triggers dilemma. The closing vow hints at endurance but exacts little felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: pressure builds through echo density and resolves as a cadence shift. Causal beats are clean (reading ice→panel→tunnel→stone→placement→hush), and closure lands with a reconfigured soundscape. Cost is soft—quiet is achieved without sacrifice beyond the beings’ departure. Orientation is strong and the single-scene arc holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: crack‑mapped ice, sapphire tunnel, basalt pedestal, and acoustic rules shape tactics and the solution. The environment constrains discovery and charges the final image with a physical hush. Sensory detail is purposeful and coheres with the mapkeeper’s expertise. World rules are learned through action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—restore balance to the caves—but escalation is linear and largely unopposed. The single tightening (decoding ice to access the stone) resolves smoothly without reversal or visible loss. The energy beings’ pressure is atmospheric rather than coercive. The resolution feels earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of balance vs. absence of sound are coherent, with images (ice fractures smoothing, dimmed beings) reinforcing the idea. The explicit statement “quiet…not the absence of sound” edges toward telling, though it aligns with the enacted outcome. Resonance lingers in the guardianship vow and softened maps. Modulation is tasteful but not daring.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A steady lyric register suits the piece; diction and rhythm feel controlled and apt for a contemplative, sensory‑attuned POV. No head‑hopping or stance confusion. Repetition of key phrases (“gently luminous,” “bloom of hush”) reads patterned rather than lazy. Compression is confident and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished and imagistic, with strong nouns and purposeful cadence. Occasional purple drift and motif reiteration risk mild redundancy, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Sentences often carry dual loads (world‑rule plus atmosphere). Final images land cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The acoustic‑mythic synthesis (map by crack‑song, hush as artifact) feels fresh and coherent. The solution via resonance‑reading is elegant, not generic. While conflict is gentle, the conceptual frame is memorable. Risk is tasteful, if not radical.</comment>
