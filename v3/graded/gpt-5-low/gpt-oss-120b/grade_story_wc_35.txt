<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lir’s motive—“to sandpaper rough memories”—is clear and embodied through tasting and ritual motion, with tactile costs as the remorse spreads. Interiority is sensory‑particular (burnt cumin, citrus) rather than label‑speak. The internal contradiction (risking spread to heal) is present but could press him harder into a sharper trade‑off or visible self‑doubt. Agency drives the outcome through iterative tasting and calibrating, earning the final shift.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain → pavilion → tasting → contagion intensifies → dissolution → humming aftermath. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost as sorrow spreads before release and the coral “cracks with a sigh,” a clear before/after. Orientation is clean early, and the price of action registers in the environment. A hair more narrowing-of-options or a sharper on‑page risk would push it higher.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: rain enables tidal pools; the coral ice pavilion and fortress surfaces conduct and return the remorse. Environment constrains and charges choices (cold as carrier; contagion via stone), and the final image is setting‑driven (humming fortress, sandstorm carrying taste away). Sensory filtering through a chef’s palate deepens specificity without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transmute collective remorse) is signaled early, and pressure tightens when tasting spreads sorrow, risking amplification before release. The meaningful deepening is the shift from containment to catalyzed dissolution with the coral’s cracking. The cost is legible and environmental, though a more explicit threatened failure or time pressure could heighten consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of communal guilt, transformation through balance, and the ethics of contagion accrue through images (fresh water clinging to salt; bitterness vs citrus). Insights arise from doing, not sermonizing; the final “brittle resilience” resists tidy moral. A few direct assertions about method slightly reduce ambiguity but do not undercut resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person close is steady, with a distinct sensorial lexicon anchored to a chef’s perception. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from poised observation to crack‑and‑sigh release). No head‑hopping or register slips; inference stays within plausible knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet largely clean; metaphors are coherent and sensorially grounded (“burnt cumin,” “sugar in rainwater”). Minor repetition around method (“sandpaper,” “balance the taste”) skirts redundancy but mostly reinforces motif. Momentum carries through the paragraphing to the charged final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise and execution feel fresh: a memory‑tasting chef transmuting contagious remorse via tidal‑pool logic in a coral ice pavilion. The synthesis is specific and inevitable in hindsight, with environmental logic shaping both method and ending. Risk‑taking is high without obscuring clarity.</comment>
