<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—she preserves “the sound of forgotten names”—and her micro‑choices (lighting, aligning, recording, offering the orchid) consistently embody that aim. The interiority is specific (“foxglove regret” dissolving into gratitude) though the conflict stays gentle rather than actively torn. The traveler’s brief arrival tests her role just enough to reveal values without a dramatic rupture. Change is credible as Earned Stasis: purpose over comfort with a felt, ongoing cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds until the traveler’s arrival breaks the pattern and reweights the stake. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—the work continues, but the world is measurably re‑tuned (hope note; softened regret) with the price of endless tending intact. Orientation is clear early (caretaker, opal library, museum frame). The causal chain is ritual → echo → preservation → traveler’s uptake → renewed ritual, coherently tightened.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The opal library, glass orchids, and cracked bamboo operate as lived environment rather than postcard; they shape tactics (the candle’s light traveling through orchids; the echo architecture catching sound). Sensory specificity is rich and character‑filtered. The setting charges the final image (traveler stepping into clouds; solitary chime note). Small ding only because constraint tends to enable mood and method more than corner a choice.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates via a pattern break: the first outside traveler arrives, forcing a choice to relinquish a preserved name (the glass orchid) and accept renewed loss. Stakes remain primarily internal and conceptual; the price is endurance and the risk of feelings fading again. The tightening is sufficient for this length but not severe. Resolution feels earned by her recommitment with visible cost (the ritual resumes, regret returns “in a softer shade”).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: memory’s preservation as a counter‑desert, loss to purpose, and the cyclical nature of tending. Recurring images (orchid, chime, candle, echo) return charged in the ending; no moral is stated. The traveler’s embodied response (dew of names on his tongue) supplies concrete, non‑platitudinous meaning. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close remains consistent, with a distinct sensibility (opal, vellum, foxglove textures) and controlled cadence. No head‑hopping; psychic distance is steady. A few lush clusters flirt with purple, but the voice holds its pattern and supports the accumulative design. Dialogue’s near‑absence suits the solitary ritual.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Imagery is vivid and mostly precise; sentences carry layered work (world + mood + action) with decent propulsion. Occasional density stacks (“foxglove regret,” “violet sorrow”) risk saturation and minor synonymic echo, but clarity survives. Repetition of certain constructions (“gently systematic”) and adjective clusters slightly slow momentum. Final images remain crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The “museum of extinct feelings” with glass orchids and recorded names feels freshly synthesized and committed to its implications. The ritual technology (light through orchids, echo harvesting) is inventive without gimmickry. The ending’s small but resonant reweighting (traveler’s dew‑names; solitary hopeful note) lands. Originality is high, held back only by the relative gentleness of conflict.</comment>
