<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—seeking the maze’s exit/meaning and decoding the mother’s code—and actions align (palm to copper, reading grain, choosing to return). Interiority is textured and particular to a child attuned to thresholds. However, internal contradiction is light; the piece rarely stages simultaneous competing impulses under pressure. The final stance (keeper of thresholds) lands but the felt cost remains gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-dense progression from terrace → seam → glass corridor → maps → charged return. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing: thresholds as moments where distance collapses into memory, reweighting his goal and lineage. Orientation is solid early; causality is associative yet coherent. The cost is implied (taking on guardianship, shedding loss) but not sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: terrace hum guides tactics; chair grain maps routes; the glass corridor and temperature-ink maps evolve with his presence. Sensory range (light, vibration, scent of husk and paper) supports tone and choice. Environment constrains discovery and charges the final image (the terrace pulsing as he chooses). Minor risk of decorative lushness, but most details do work.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to find/understand thresholds and exit loss) is clear, and escalation occurs via the hidden seam and deepening in the corridor. Agency drives turns (pressing copper, reading grain, choosing to return). Yet pressure remains soft; no concrete foreclosed path or tangible risk tests commitment. The visible price at climax is more symbolic than felt.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of threshold, lineage, and “necessary distances” accrue organically through recurring images and choices. However, the final explicit thesis (“the true distance one must travel is the space between wonder and understanding”) states the moral, blunting resonance. Subtext is otherwise strong in the hush/echo motifs and the mother’s coded legacy. A lighter touch in the last lines would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable and attuned; diction and rhythm suit a lyric, wonder-forward consciousness. The perceptual signature (“fractured hush,” measuring distances) remains consistent. Occasional abstract stacks risk drift, but remain legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue to test, but narrative stance carries subtext well.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush with strong images and clean mechanics; sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum. There is some figurative density and motif reiteration that borders on overwriting in places. Clarity remains intact, but a few lines tell what images have already shown. Trimming redundancies would quicken the hinge beats and sharpen impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: drifting prism terrace, weather-code copper, grain-reading as navigation, temperature-ink maps; the “necessary distances” idea feels specific. The path from tactile decoding to metaphysical guardianship is non-obvious yet coherent. Risks in tone and worldbuilding pay off without confusion. Slightly soft stakes keep it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
