<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and steady—rebuild art and self after arson—embodied by tactile choices (following frost, arranging shards). Interiority is present but largely declarative; contradictory impulses are muted, so pressure reveals little ambivalence. The survival tremor and kiln‑side decisions ground emotion credibly. The final acceptance feels earned but low-conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image density builds (frost → crevice → mine → shards → kiln) to a resonant reconfiguration where the glass’s song reframes loss. Causal links are soft but coherent; orientation is clean from the first lines. Closure lands on the page with felt cost (workshop scorched, risked trek) and a reweighted meaning (purpose in pauses). The decisive change is quiet yet legible through the kiln’s charged reprise.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon, frost, kiln, and basalt are sensorially specific and tactically relevant (frost lines guide movement; starlight charges the final image). World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. The environment constrains and enables choices and echoes internal state without heavy-handed symbolism. The final night‑under‑stars tableau is charged by prior setting particulars.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—reclaiming craft and purpose—with one meaningful tightening (dawn melts frost, revealing the groove) and a discovery turn (mine, luminous shards). Escalation is gentle and primarily textural rather than adversarial; the cost is implied more than dramatized. Agency drives the search and the kiln’s reassembly. The ending’s stance crystallizes without a sharp trade‑off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motifs (scorch, frost, song, ledger) braid toward a resonant answer, but the sentence “purpose lived not in grand gestures but in the quiet pauses” states the thesis outright, dulling subtext. The best thematic work is in images—the singing glass and frost‑taught light—rather than declarations. Emotional aftereffect is genuine, if a touch sentimental. Complexity is present but comfortingly tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (light, fracture, resonance) remains stable and apt; no head‑hopping or stance wobble. Rhythm modulates well between hush and movement. A few repeated diction choices (“drifting resonance”) skirt sameness but don’t sap control. Elision is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, image‑dense, and mostly efficient; sentences often carry double duty (world + theme). Occasional purple drift and motif repetition slightly thicken the texture without adding new pressure. Syntax varies and reads cleanly with good momentum. The closing image is crisp and unconfused.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: glassmaking entwined with smuggling routes encoded in frost is vivid and non‑obvious. The luminous shards and the canyon’s acoustic “song” feel singular, not templated. Risks are taken in quiet, accumulative design and largely pay off. A hair more structural daring or a costlier choice could elevate further.</comment>
