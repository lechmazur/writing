<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent (tend the lagoon; honor the incomplete), and micro‑choices (placing the feather, whispering verses, arranging stones) align. However, internal contradiction is minimal—he’s certain rather than tested—so the arc reads as steady devotion rather than struggle. Emotional cost is mostly conceptual (renouncing “flawless endings”) and doesn’t bite on the page. The “warmly attentive” trait shows but rarely complicates him.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is strong from the outset; one continuous scene coheres. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he reframes “mending” as honoring the incomplete, and the final image (feather as star; woven dawns) crystallizes this. Cost is subtle but present in the renunciation of fixing; a stronger on‑page price would raise this.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lagoon, reeds, wind, and post‑rain glassiness are vivid and purposeful, not postcard garnish; the gust and surface tension directly affect tactics. The feather functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail is lush and filtered through the poet’s sensibility. It stops short of physically constraining a hard choice, keeping it just under the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can he coax harmony without erasing incompleteness) is clear, and the gust/kite‑snap supply a credible perturbation. Escalation is modest: ripples → ritual actions → deepened hush. The cost is more philosophical than felt; no real foreclosed option beyond “fixing” is dramatized. The tightening works under an accumulative lens but lacks a palpable consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Recurrences (feather, ripples, woven dawns, hush) build a coherent meditation on honoring incompleteness. The final image reweights the premise effectively. However, a few explicit theme declarations (“true art was never a finished picture,” “gentle rebellion against the demand for flawless endings”) edge into moralizing, thinning subtext. When the text trusts image, it resonates more.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close with a distinctive perceptual signature; diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional. No head‑hopping; stance stays within what the poet can infer. Repetition of leitmotifs is pattern‑taught and mostly earned. Slight sameness in cadence at times, but not enough to dull legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with strong images and clean syntax; momentum holds through a quiet mode. That said, metaphor density is high and occasionally verges on purple; some phrases recur with minimal new pressure (“woven dawns,” “burnished hush”), creating mild loop feel. Explicit thesis sentences flatten the lyric once or twice. Clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ritualized tending of a lagoon via verse, keyed to a drake’s feather and “woven dawns,” feels fresh and integrated. The kite‑snap echo is a nice, specific complication. While the aesthetic of honoring incompleteness isn’t new, the execution through these particulars stands out. Greater risk in on‑page cost or a bolder reversal could elevate ingenuity further.</comment>
