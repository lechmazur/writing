<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira’s motive is clear and particular (a ghostwriter seeking “the thread that connects all things”), and her actions align with it. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from curiosity to acceptance with little friction. The choice to “rejoin” reads genuine but low-cost. Embodied emotion is present through sensory proxies rather than competing impulses.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the spiral’s hum, petal, and silver light tighten the pattern toward a conceptual repricing where Mira accepts the keeper role as conduit. Orientation is strong early, and the closure lands on the page with a reweighted final image (ink constellations, thread glowing). Cost is soft but legible as a renunciation of mere anonymity in favor of public stewardship. One scene, single POV, coherent beat flow.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated; the lotus temple/pond/spiral actively shape action (the spiral’s apex placement, breeze, petal). Sensory specificity is rich across sight, sound, and scent without disorientation. The environment charges the final image (ink-and-water constellations). A strong object-as-setting synergy supports theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Pressure escalates gently through pattern intensification, but opposition and concrete cost remain abstract. The dominant stake (rejoining/connecting threads) is signaled and resolved, yet no option is meaningfully foreclosed beyond a conceptual shift. The petal placement is a clean turn, but the risk to Mira is low. Tension operates atmospherically rather than through hard trade-offs.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Themes of secrecy, connection, and time-traveling love accrue through recurring images (thread, mosaic of confessions, ink constellations). A few lines tilt toward explicit statement (“She understood that the act of rejoin…”), slightly dulling subtext. Still, the final image resonates and invites reflection on relational stewardship. The motif network reweights earlier particulars effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent lyric third-person with a distinct perceptual signature and controlled rhythm. Lexicon fits the sensibility of a poetic, observant ghostwriter; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates subtly with pressure without confusion. Elision patterns are taught early and sustained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with high information density and clean syntax; images often do double duty. Occasional lushness risks repetition (“prismatic quiet,” sequined rain) but stays legible. No significant scaffolding or loops, and the closure beat is clear. Minor purple pressure prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The love-letter ghostwriter at a lotus temple with a twig-spiral conduit feels fresh and coherent. The ink-constellation payoff and thread motif synthesis are memorable. Risk-taking is aesthetic rather than structural; conflict remains gentle. Strong originality without a knockout reconfiguration.</comment>
