<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (reawaken beauty), and actions align, but interior contradiction is minimal and largely emblematic rather than psychologically particular. The closest pressure from another character is the bronze statue’s demand, which resolves quickly without testing his limits beyond a single defiant note. Embodied emotion leans mythic over specific, so cost reads conceptual more than felt. The final vow functions, but the personal price remains abstract.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies from soft bowing to orchard‑wide resonance to regime reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: statues become guardians, gears hum, world hue shifts. Cost is implied (risk of regime reprisal) but not dramatized at the end, which keeps the cadence from a higher tier. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence is strong.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and functional: the sky‑bridge, enchanted orchard, and living statues shape pressure and response. Environmental rules (mechanical regime vs. organic resonance) are learned through action, not exposition. Recurring objects (violin, locust shell) are integrated with place and charge the final image. Spatial and sensory choreography remain legible and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (beauty vs. regime control) is clear, and pressure tightens at the statue’s ultimatum and the shell’s activation. Escalation is largely one decisive intensification rather than a layered trade‑off; opposition softens quickly once the note spreads. The price is more symbolic than visceral, muting consequence. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives the turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of nonviolent transformation, courage, and reclamation through art emerge organically through image, not moralizing. The locust shell’s arc and “resonantly soft” refrain reweight earlier moments at the end. Ambiguity is purposeful (invitation vs. rebellion), though the piece leans idealistic with limited counterpressure. The final empty shell as beacon delivers a clean conceptual resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A consistent lyric third‑person with controlled distance; diction and rhythm suit the fable‑like mode. No head‑hopping or stance drift; compression supports momentum. The voice modulates with pressure (from quiet setup to swelling transformation). Slight uniformity in elevated register limits the highest band.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is lush and image‑dense with strong cadence; most sentences carry multiple jobs. Some repetition (“resonantly soft,” heart‑beat echoes) edges toward pattern fatigue but remains purposeful. No significant scaffold or logic muddle; a touch of purple softens impact in peak beats. Overall clarity and propulsion are sound.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: heart‑rhythm music, a locust shell as conduit, living statues reconfigured by resonance, and rusted modernity bathed in amber. Turns feel earned by established mechanisms rather than late rule drops. The vision reads singular and confident without gimmickry. Slightly idealized conflict tempers the sense of risk.</comment>
