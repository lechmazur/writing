<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—repaying a lifetimes‑long debt—and culminates in a costly choice (the self‑erasing sigh). Interiority is lyrical rather than granular, but contradictory impulses (“lovingly venomous”) register and guide action. Micro‑choices (placing the bead, whispering to vines, the final release) align with motive. Limited friction beyond renunciation keeps complexity just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern of pass-through awakenings tightens toward the decisive final act where love is transmuted to venom; cost is on‑page in her fading and the bead’s residuum. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the piece holds its taught cadence to a charged final image. Minor diffuseness of external stakes prevents a 9+.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse/orchard is vividly realized and functionally integral: frost, glass panes, alchemical vines, and endless night all shape what’s possible. The carved bead as micro‑setting/object charges the ending. Details are sensory and purposeful, with atmosphere cohering to theme. A touch of emblematic phrasing edges toward overt symbolism but mostly serves the moment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure accumulates via successive awakenings to a clear tightening: the final payment that requires self‑cost. Stakes (repaying debt through transformation) remain coherent, and the escalation from coaxing leaves to sacrificing self is legible. Lack of a reversal or counterforce limits intensity, but the sacrifice reweights options decisively. The price (erasure) lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Redemption through resonance, debt as love/venom, and memory transmuting matter are woven through concrete images rather than thesis. The final image (orchard lit, bead pulsing, bride gone) reprices the opening’s night and promise. Ambiguity lingers without confusion—both mourning and elation coexist credibly. No moralizing intrudes.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with consistent distance and a distinct sonic texture. Patterned elision (“ephemeral cameo appearances”) is taught early and maintained. Diction fits the mythic register without breaking POV logic. Slight lushness occasionally flirts with sameness in cadence but never confuses.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphor; lines often do double duty (world & theme). Minor redundancy (e.g., repeated “mournful elation,” “resonant awakenings”) and an occasional stacked modifier signal slight overwriting. Rhythm varies enough to keep momentum, and the closure image is crisp. Mechanics are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemical greenhouse, bead forged from a heart, debt repaid via venomized love—feels fresh and internally coherent. The cameo‑drift method and resonance motif reconfigure familiar ghost‑bride tropes. The final reweighting (love as poison/seed) is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Risky lyricism largely pays off.</comment>
