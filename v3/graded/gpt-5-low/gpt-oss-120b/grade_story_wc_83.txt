<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (grief transformed into a hunt for “unused potential”) and actions track it (visor calibration, approach, palm thrust). Embodied details like rust/ozone breath and skin‑tingle ground emotion. However, internal contradiction is limited—he declares “not revenge” early, reducing tension between impulses. The change to “clarity” lands but at a relatively low cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of signals builds (visor lattice → glow → fissure → merge) to a Conceptual Repricing (“unused potential was not a place but a state”). Orientation is clean from the opening. Closure lands on the page with a felt shift and a charged final image (shards like “tiny suns”). The cost is subtle but present as a relinquishing of grief’s primacy.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The floating observatory and geode are vividly rendered and used functionally (the deck hum, rotors, fissure, magnetic cradle). The environment charges and constrains choices by revealing the seam and amplifying resonance. Sensory range is strong beyond visual (hum, taste of ozone). The final image is environment‑charged (shards hovering; alarms cease).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes are dominantly internal—will he risk merging with the pool—and escalate through a clear tightening: discovery → amplification → commitment. The decisive act (palm toward fissure) is protagonist‑driven. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, which mutes intensity slightly. Still, pressure remains coherent to the closing reweighting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres: grief reconfigured into a disciplined openness to latent possibility. Recurring objects (geode, fissure, lattice) evolve in meaning and culminate in shards as “tiny suns.” One line states the thesis directly (“not a place but a state of being”), which trims subtlety. Nonetheless, resonance lingers via the constellation‑like coda.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (physics‑tinged noticing and acoustic metaphors). Psychic distance is stable; no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated abstractions risk airlessness but generally fit the consciousness on the page. Rhythm modulates effectively toward the closing cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with purposeful imagery and sound, but there is some purple density and phrase repetition (“intangibly tangible,” “unfiltered awakening”). Most sentences carry multiple jobs and momentum is maintained. No major loops or scaffold, yet a touch of figurative saturation softens peak crispness.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—perturbation theory, probability lattice, geode resonance, drone‑strike survivor—is fresh and coherent. The final conceptual turn feels earned by prior particulars rather than gimmickry. Risks in diction and concept mostly pay off. Minor familiarity in some abstractions keeps it just short of exceptional.</comment>
