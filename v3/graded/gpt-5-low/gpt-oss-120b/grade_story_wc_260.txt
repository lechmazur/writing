<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—repair trust while balancing self‑respect and compassion—is clear and embodied through concrete ritual choices. Interiority is specific (the “candle in wind” wobble) and actions align with value testing. However, resistance is soft: the chameleon’s quick “approving light” eases pressure, making the earn of change feel a touch tidy. The cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration via a charged final image (tail restored, breath-hued colors, vigilance accepted). Orientation is crisp early (misty workshop, post‑con). Causal threads are light but coherent—ritual density builds to a cadence shift as she reattaches the tail. Cost is implied (scars, vigilance) more than enacted, keeping this below the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mist, warm stone, crystal vial, and star‑lit workshop are vivid and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility. Details integrate with action—the mist “absorbing each fragment” and the warm stone for the vial—enhancing tone and final image. The environment rarely constrains options in a decisive way, which keeps it shy of 9‑band. Still, specificity sustains atmosphere without feeling like a catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconstructing trust via restoring the chameleon—remains steady, but pressure deepening is modest. The “shedding layers” ritual marks the primary tightening, yet there’s no true narrowing of options or on‑page price that alters tactics. The quick assent of the animal and the seamless reintegration soften consequence. Tension exists but doesn’t escalate decisively.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of trust, repair, and the balance of compassion/self‑respect emerge organically through object work and ritual. The final image elegantly reframes balance as tidal, yet the explicit moral line (“balance is not a static point…”) tips into authorial statement. Subtext otherwise works in image—the tail’s glow, the mist’s absorption—giving the piece a lingering aftertaste. The overt closing statement trims resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lyric third‑person closely held to Mara is stable and sure‑handed, with controlled rhythm and sensory bias. Diction matches the contemplative, ritual mode; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Occasional lushness risks uniform timbre, but the voice remains coherent and intentional. The modulation at closure feels earned.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence music is strong and images are often striking, but density verges on purple at times (“shimmering stillness” motif repeats; mist and glow recur). Minor paraphrase echoes and stacked modifiers slightly slow momentum. Clarity holds and lines often do double duty, yet trimming would heighten propulsion. Craft is solid with a light overwriting penalty.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ritual of reconstructing trust via a chameleon’s tail in a mist‑charged workshop is fresh and memorable. The method—shedding layers of deceit and judgment—coheres with character and setting. While the balance motif is familiar, the object choreography and tactile imagery provide distinctiveness. Risks are tasteful rather than bold, yielding strong originality without a revelatory turn.</comment>
