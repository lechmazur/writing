<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied—pine needle on cheek, thumb on the photo’s ridge, breath as metronome—showing a credible struggle between panic and chosen calm. Micro‑choices (taking out the photo, pressing it flat, whispering a promise) align with a drive to endure. The label “quietly talented” is ornamental, and “anchor optimism in realism” edges toward abstract self‑explanation. Still, the final stance feels earned by prior sensory tactics rather than unearned epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring somatic cues and the photograph build to a charged poise where she forecloses inertia and chooses a forward path. Orientation is clear early (arboretum on a cliff; survivor context) and never drifts. Closure lands on the page with felt cost when she “freezes the grief for a heartbeat” and commits to a purpose. The tightening is modest but sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arboretum’s salt wind, pines, sea lavender, wind chimes, and cliff height are vivid and POV‑filtered, with tactile use that mirrors her internal regulation. The environment charges the final image (beacon on a cliff; resiliency of saplings) rather than functioning as mere postcard. While it doesn’t strictly constrain options, it meaningfully frames and amplifies the choice. Detail selection is economical and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is internal: can she hold stillness long enough to convert grief into forward motion. Pressure deepens when the photograph returns and she permits a deliberate freeze of grief, then formalizes a vow at the sapling—an escalation in commitment. The price (ongoing pain accepted, path foreclosed against paralysis) is legible. No antagonist, but the accumulative deepening reads coherent and sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of endurance, memory, and disciplined hope emerge through particular images (photo, sapling, wind chimes) rather than thesis alone. The “pearl of stillness” motif reweights at the end, offering a non‑literal answer: quiet resolve as a beacon. One line (“Her purpose, she realized, was to anchor optimism in realism”) drifts toward direct statement, but the ending resists a tidy moral. Subtext—survival as embodied practice, not transcendence—lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent single‑POV lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (somatic registers, coastal idiom). Rhythm modulates cleanly; brief quoted vow is spare and on‑character. Minor therapy‑lexicon (“somatic markers”) is integrated via tactile instances, not explanatory drift. Control and stance remain stable without head‑hopping.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs—setting, interiority, and action—without scaffold or loops; figurative language is coherent and grounded in bodily cues. A few abstractions recur (“anchor optimism in realism”), but do not stall momentum. Diction is clean and varied; no mechanical cadence runs or filter‑verb stacks. The final image is crisp and unblurred by purple.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of trauma recovery via embodied regulation and coastal botany; “pearl of stillness” feels specific and earned. The drone‑strike wedding survivor premise avoids melodrama by focusing on present tactics and sensory proofs. The lighthouse/arboretum/beacon triangulation gives a non‑obvious closure image. Risks are measured and coherent, elevating without obscuring clarity.</comment>
