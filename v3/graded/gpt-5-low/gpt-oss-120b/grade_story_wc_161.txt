<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lila’s motive—reinvention through mapping and pigeons—is clear and expressed through concrete choices (charting dust, slicing the meteorite, sending birds). Interiority is lyrical yet legible, though contradiction is gentle rather than pressurized. The earned shift—accepting layering rather than erasure—reads credible but low-cost. Absence of on‑page relational pressure limits crucible intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of maps, glow of the chip, and the city’s hum feedback tighten toward a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the chip’s light fades as the map glows, memory’s wilt accepted. Orientation is clean and single‑POV consistent. Stakes remain interior but coherently advanced through patterned escalation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The attic, skylight, and dust motes function as active constraints—the mapping method depends on that column of light. The vintage bookshop textures are specific and filtered through Lila’s tactile work with maps, birds, and stone. Recurring objects (skylight, chip, parchment) charge the final image without museum‑tour excess. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pressure accrues through pattern deepening (denser trails, expanding chorus, chip brightening) and a meaningful commitment (attaching chip slivers to living birds). The price is felt conceptually (risk to relic, acceptance of wither) rather than dramatized harm, keeping tension quiet. One clear tightening suffices under the chosen lens. Stakes are coherent but never razor‑edged.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of renewal layered over loss emerges organically via dust/paper/flight motifs and the communal hum returning from the streets. The final image reweights prior material: fading chip, glowing map—memory and reinvention coexisting. A single explicit line (“reinvention does not erase…”) edges toward stating theme, but surrounding images earn it. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person closely aligned to Lila’s sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and distinct. Patterned phrasing (bloom/withering, hum/trail) feels intentional and supports the accumulative design. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong, with high information density and purposeful images doing double duty (maps as cartography and memory). Some metaphor saturation and near‑repetitions risk over‑ornament (“bloom with withering grace,” “echo of lost songs”), but momentum holds. Syntax varies and closes on a clean, recharged image. Minimal scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—pigeon post, dust‑trail cartography under a skylight, and a humming Mars chip—feels fresh and cohesive. Risks in tone and method pay off in a singular aesthetic without gimmickry. Turns grow from established patterns rather than late rule drops. Emotional truth lands quietly yet distinctly.</comment>
