<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive is clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (recording, interpreting, returning to leave a page) align with her reticence turning to resolve. Interiority is textured through sensory attention rather than labels. Internal conflict is present but gentle—less a rift than a drift—so the cost of the shift reads modest. The final offering credibly forecloses a path (print‑bound certainties) but at a soft price.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → pattern recognition → offering, with a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph, and the crystal returns to shape the ending image. The cost is conceptual—relinquishing the sufficiency of dictionaries—and lands on the page via her chosen offering. Escalation is subtle but coherent; one meaningful deepening occurs when the glints resolve into the library’s memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The library and chandelier crystal saturate the atmosphere with purposeful, multi‑sensory detail, and the object charges the final image. POV‑filtered specifics (must of paper, cracked stained glass, tonal responses) feel lived‑in and thematically aligned. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond enabling the discovery, preventing a 9+ despite vividness. Still, setting integration is exemplary for this length.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decoding growth’s pattern) is established early and deepens when light resolves into memory. Pressure accrues texturally; there’s no adversarial force, but the realization reweights options and prompts the offering. Costs remain mostly conceptual/emotional, with limited narrowing of choices on the page. The single tightening beat suffices but is not strenuous.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—language as living growth versus bound lexicon—emerges from particulars (glints as rings, crystal’s chorus) and culminates in the offering. A few near‑thesis lines (“not merely lexical but a living pulse of humanity”) edge toward tell, slightly flattening subtext. The final bridge/promise image resonates without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on memory, stewardship, and surrender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is steady, lyrical, and character‑tuned, with sensory bias that reflects a scholar’s quiet precision. Diction and rhythm modulate appropriately as the chorus swells, then settles. No head‑hopping or stance drift; psychic distance remains controlled. Occasional phrase recurrence (“weathered innocence,” “suspended hush”) is intentional but risks faint echo.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with strong acoustic and visual textures. Minor purple tendencies and light repetition appear but do not obscure clarity or momentum. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean; figurative logic holds. No significant scaffold loops or filter stacks.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The chandelier crystal as sonic memory‑engine for language’s growth is a fresh synthesis. The “last dictionary” frame reframes stakes without gimmickry. Risks are taken in committing to a quiet, accumulative arc, and they cohere. The ingenuity is more conceptual than dramatic, but it feels singular.</comment>
