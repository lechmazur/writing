<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (preventable deaths, breaking control) and a competent, tactile method ground Mara. The mentor memory hints at a values conflict (data vs. fear systems), but the scene seldom pressures her into a costly contradiction. Turning the valve is motivated and aligned with her traits, though the price paid is minimal. Interiority is specific and embodied, if occasionally abstracted by label-phrases (“fortified vulnerability”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lens: Hybrid leaning Causal. Because/therefore progression (seepage mapping → humidity/lantern correlation → symbols → pipe → valve turn) lands a Decisive Change on the page. Closure is clean and resonant, but the cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt in-scene, softening impact. Orientation is strong and the single-scene architecture holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel and lantern are vivid, multisensory, and filtered through professional priorities; the lantern’s flicker constrains choices and charges the final image. Symbols etched into stone evolve the environment into a functional map. The setting shapes tactics rather than serving as backdrop. Minor over-insistence on metaphor doesn’t blunt the lived-in specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and deepens via the empirical discovery chain. Pressure escalates once (the humidity/flicker pattern pointing to hidden infrastructure), but resistance is low and solutions arrive without credible friction or trade-off. The final act is protagonist-driven, yet the absence of a tangible price or narrowing option set keeps tension moderate.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Past–present entanglement, resistance, and institutional neglect cohere through the lantern, symbols, and the redirection of water. Subtext in objects and environment mostly carries the theme, though terms like “controlling influence” and “fortified vulnerability” verge on thesis-stating. The final image reweights prior motifs, offering a quiet, resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity is present but not deeply contested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first-person voice with a professional perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are largely controlled. The voice modulates with pressure (from observational calm to charged poise) while staying consistent. Occasional abstract labels poke through the texture but do not fracture POV or stance. No dialogue issues.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lines are mostly clean, with purposeful imagery and functional propulsion; information density is solid. However, metaphor stacking and phrase repetition (“reverberate,” “controlling influence,” “fortified vulnerability”) create purple overtones and minor redundancy. The prose remains legible at closure, but the lushness sometimes blunts pressure. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of a preventable-death investigator with an Underground Railroad lantern linking ethical lineage to present infrastructure risk feels fresh. The empirical–mythic interplay (data vs. memory-etched symbols) is non-obvious and cohesive. Resolution by valve-turn is straightforward, limiting surprise, but the conceptual bridge is memorable and specific. Risk-taking is steady rather than bold.</comment>
