<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (profit with mercy, “cautious exuberance”) are clear and her choices propel the action, but internal contradiction is lightly sketched rather than dramatized in scene. The lighthouse keeper registers as a gentle foil rather than real pressure. The Compassion Register choice shows a value hierarchy, yet it costs her little on the page. Emotional texture leans stated over embodied in pivotal beats.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal links (misdelivered envelope → visit → balcony gesture → communal reading). Orientation is clean and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of community attention, though the cost is conceptual more than felt. The beats cohere, but tension stays low and obstacles are minimal. Ending image returns seeded objects effectively but without a hard turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and sensorial (brine, old paper, breezy library, lighthouse balcony) and meaningfully reprises at the end. The balcony and library frame the charged images (locket placed, communal reading). While not tightly constraining tactics, place continually colors perception and stakes. Details feel purposeful and filtered through a coastal, bookish sensibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stakes remain gentle and largely unopposed; the misdelivery facilitates rather than pressures. The primary tightening is discovery of the mother’s death and the choice to ritualize return, but no option is meaningfully foreclosed. Coincidence initiates and also smooths the path; little adaptation is required under stress. Earned warmth arrives, yet the narrative avoids any difficult trade-off.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Themes of community care and honoring the “silent contributors” are coherent and recur through concrete actions (register, ceremony, fishermen’s gifts). However, the piece occasionally spells out its thesis (“cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo”), tipping into sentimentality. Subtext is present in the locket’s journey and the keeper’s vocation, but the moral arrives stated as well as shown. The final image resonates more for tenderness than for complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with tactile images and a measured cadence suited to a nocturne. Distance is stable; there’s no head-hopping and inference aligns with what’s knowable. Lack of dialogue reduces dynamism but preserves tone. Occasional diction lapses into slogan-like phrasing modestly blunt the texture.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lines are largely clean and musical, with strong noun-verb choices and sensory density. Some repetition (“cycles of compassion,” “cautious exuberance”) and abstract assertions edge toward purple or didactic. Momentum holds despite reflective passages. Final images are clear and un-muddled by figurative overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of a cargo broker, starry library, and a lighthouse keeper who “catalogues the sighs of ships” offers fresh inflections. The misdelivered-envelope premise is familiar and is treated gently rather than subversively. Closure is sweet but risk-averse, with low-cost choices. Distinctive images lift it, yet the arc follows a well-trodden path.</comment>
