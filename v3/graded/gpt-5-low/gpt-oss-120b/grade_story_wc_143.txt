<question>1</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (archive the last grain) and embodied procedure give the inspector specificity; grief and duty braid credibly at the click. Internal contradiction is mild—he’s steady rather than torn—so the emotional cost lands quietly rather than combustively. Micro-choices (calibrating, waiting, packing) reflect character values under time pressure. A slightly declarative line (“a proof that purposefully curious eyes…”) edges toward telling.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: preparation → countdown → shutter → elegiac descent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—the act of capturing and packing the canister forecloses further questing and carries a felt cost (“tremor of grief”). Orientation is crisp from the outset and the chemical trigger cleanly anchors the decisive beat. The stakes never fracture, and no causality gaps appear.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lunar summit, basalt rim, and low sunrise are vivid and filtered through a professional gaze. Environment and tools (tripod sinking, horizon timing, old lens) constrain tactics and charge the final image. Details stay purposeful and evolve with action (wind, vapor, sun’s rim). Strong sensory economy supports tone without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear—capture a vanishing last thing under a ticking dawn. Escalation arrives via the calibrated chemical countdown aligning with the sun’s rim, creating a single, meaningful tightening. Cost is emotional (loss of the mineral to colonies, elegiac acceptance), though external resistance is minimal. The quietness works, but a sharper on‑page tradeoff could have deepened pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus inevitability accrues through concrete acts (timed exposure, sealing the canister) and returns in the final “soft click.” Subtext of archiving hush/time avoids sermonizing, with the final gaze toward Earth reweighting meaning. One or two lines verge on explicit thesis, but the closing image earns the reflection. The lighthouse/grain metaphor effectively reframes the mission as elegy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—technical yet tender—remains steady. Rhythm modulates well around the countdown and click. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; diction fits a disciplined, curious professional. Elevated phrasing is mostly earned by tone and setting.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished with precise verbs and layered sentences; the chemical mechanic is lucid. Minor repetition (“dawning hush”) and occasional purple edging slightly flatten momentum. Still, information density is high and images do multiple jobs. The final cadence is clean and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: lunar elegy + archival mission + analog chemical timing yields fresh texture. The old lens, vapor cue, and “last grain” concept feel singular rather than templated. Risk is quiet but confident; the piece commits to its premise without retreat. A touch more friction could have pushed the ingenuity into truly rare air.</comment>
