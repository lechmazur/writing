<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eli’s motive—unspooling the echo‑grid and translating the oak’s witness—is clear and consistent, and his tactile choices with the sextant align with it. Interiority is specific (pulse through brass, groaning floorboards) but largely harmonious; we rarely see contradictory impulses under pressure. Competence dominates struggle, so change arrives with limited felt cost. The final easing reads earned, but the internal conflict stays gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure thickens via patterned work (mapping dreams → grid dimming) to a cadence shift as the tower “inhales.” Orientation is crisp from the opening: who, where, when are legible within the first lines. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the maze’s sorrow becomes measurable peace and Eli’s promise forecloses future echo—though the price is more glancing than bracing. The beats link coherently without outliney “and then” sequencing.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stormlight, cracked shutters, and the rooted oak are vivid and POV‑filtered, with the moonlight’s properties materially constraining tactics (healing the sextant, enabling mapping). The sextant functions as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image and guiding action. Sensory detail favors the moment’s urgencies without devolving into a catalog. World rules (echo‑grid, quantified sorrow) stay consistent and are learned through use.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: dismantle the sorrow‑grid without harm, translate witness into peace. Escalation is a gentle deepening (moon rising, mapping connecting yearnings), but resistance is minimal and near-frictionless; no option is foreclosed beyond time and attention. Agency is present in the steady, methodical unspooling, yet the felt cost remains soft. The cadence shift lands, but tension never bites hard.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of stewardship, translation of grief, and the sacred ordinary cohere through recurring images (moonlight, sextant, oak). The closing reweights “quantified sorrow” into “measurable peace,” offering a non‑literal answer to the central question of what caretaking can transform. Occasional explicitness (“a fact he would share,” “mundane miracles”) edges toward told takeaway. Still, resonance lingers in the final breath of the world’s “quiet relief.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close-third, lyric yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in tactile work and gentle awe. Diction stays cohesive; no head‑hopping or stance slips. Rhythm modulates well from storm to hush. Purposeful elision (legend, folklore) supports mood without obscuring action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line work is polished and musical, with purposeful images pulling double duty (the sextant as tool and salve). Minor purple drift (“quantified sorrow” repeated; “mundane miracles” named) slightly blunts edge and invites a touch of redundancy. Syntax varies and propulsion holds; no mechanical errors or choreography clutter. The final images are clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—maintenance labor meets metaphysical cartography—feels fresh and particular (echo‑grid, dream‑mapping sextant, oak as witness). The quiet reconfiguration avoids tropey catharsis in favor of measured grace. While conflict is gentle, the conceptual frame is distinctive and coherently followed through. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, and they pay off.</comment>
