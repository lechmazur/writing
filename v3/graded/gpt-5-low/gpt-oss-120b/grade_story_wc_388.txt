<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her competence reads credibly in the letter‑reassembly scene. However, internal contradiction and embodied pressure are thin; she encounters little resistance and pays little visible cost. The “responsibility” note at the end gestures toward consequence without dramatizing it. Strong function, limited depth.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: rumors → letters → map → diamond → redefinition of “stillpoint,” with on‑page closure (storms cease; stance shifts). The drive reads primarily causal with a light conceptual repricing at the end. The resolution feels easy—no significant obstacle once the puzzle is solved—and cost is mostly conceptual. Still, the ending lands coherently within this scope.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard, radioactive dust, and phosphorescent fruit are vivid and consistently filtered through Mira’s task. Environment shapes action (night storms, lantern work) and charges the final image when the storms cease. Specificity is purposeful, not touristic. Strong, lived‑in atmosphere supporting the story’s turn.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth vs. corporate lie; locating the stillpoint) is clear, but pressure escalates minimally. The puzzle aligns, then the diamond resolves the weather; there’s no credible reversal or foreclosed option beyond patience. Agency drives the turn, yet the price is light and opposition absent. Tension remains steady rather than tightening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres (stillness vs. comforting lies; perception over myth) and the orchard’s transformation supports it. The inscription states the thesis outright, reducing subtext at the climax. The final stewardship note hints at complexity but avoids a thornier moral calculus. Resonant but somewhat didactic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is steady and controlled; diction suits a meticulous, skeptical mind. Rhythm is clean, with a measured, observant texture that fits the investigative mode. The voice lacks a highly distinctive idiolect but remains coherent and confident. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear, economical, and largely free of scaffolding; images like “facets scarred like a wounded star” are effective. Occasional abstractions and mild redundancy (comforting lies/truth assertions) soften impact. No figurative muddle or grammatical slips; cadence varies enough to carry momentum. Solid line work without showy risk.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard plus “stillpoint as mental state” is a fresh synthesis, and the letter‑puzzle method avoids cliché resolution. Corporate smokescreen and cursed gem are familiar, but they’re recombined thoughtfully. The solution’s neatness blunts ingenuity at the peak. Overall, inventive within genre boundaries.</comment>
