<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—preserving forgotten names—reads clear and coherent, and her tactile choices with rope and cylinder align with her craft-trained precision. However, internal contradiction is minimal; once she “forgives herself,” pressure softens and struggle feels frictionless. Embodied emotion (“snowmelt ardor”) lands, but the arc skirts cost. The traveler’s late arrival adds little challenge to her stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ritual actions build to a resonant reconfiguration where the sanctum becomes a “living library.” Orientation is solid early (Mara, sanctum, organ), and the rope/cylinder mechanics read clean. Closure lands as RR, though the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than a felt sacrifice. The traveler’s coda extends the pattern without disrupting coherence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, copper cylinder, and reindeer‑sinew rope are vivid, tactile, and purposeful; the environment constrains the method (reconfiguring braids) and charges the final image. Details evolve with action (frost melting into veins of light) rather than sitting as backdrop. Professional noticing (“lost wax caster”) filters selection credibly. Slight lyric overabundance doesn’t blur spatial logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (preserve names), and density increases as tones spill into a choir; however, opposition is minimal and success feels assured. The meaningful tightening is the rope’s reconfiguration catalyzing the release of names, but the piece lacks a hard trade‑off or foreclosed option on the page. The traveler’s late beat deepens scope, not pressure. Cost remains mostly symbolic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory as living conduit, thaw/redemption, and communal continuity emerge through concrete images (rope singing back, parchment transcription). A few telling lines (“not merely archival”) flatten subtext, but the final image reweights the premise convincingly. The sanctum’s transformation into a “living library” resonates without feeling didactic. Complexity is modest but coherent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature tied to craft and cold/heat imagery. Rhythm modulates toward crescendo as the rope illuminates and names cascade. Diction sometimes leans purple but remains controlled and character‑filtered. No head‑hopping; the late traveler is observed strictly through Mara.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush and largely effective, with strong nouns and purposeful verbs anchored in material action. Some metaphor stacking (“technically gentle,” “snowmelt ardor,” “living library”) pushes toward excess and risks redundancy. Momentum holds, but a few sentences paraphrase the same emotional state. Clarity remains intact through the ending image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of organ punched cards, sinew‑resin rope, and an aurora‑lit ice sanctum is striking and specific. The ritualized “transcribed memory” conceit feels fresh and cohesive. Risk lies in prioritizing texture over conflict; still, the reconfiguration method and final expansion with Eira provide a memorable angle. The piece stops short of a truly surprising cost or turn.</comment>
