<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—she aims to stitch hope into a ruined labyrinth—but internal contradiction and on‑page struggle are minimal. The “courage to break the old laws” is asserted rather than dramatized, so cost reads soft. Interiority is lyric and sensorial but rarely pressured by real resistance. The final endurance feels earned texturally, not psychologically contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: recurring acts (sleepwalking, sewing light) build toward a reconfigured labyrinth and a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing (rule-breaking reweighted into communal reverence). However, tangible cost or constraint at the end is implied more than felt on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean early and maintained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon labyrinth and stone corridors are vivid, sensorial, and integrated; the “storybook illustration plate” functions as a charged micro‑setting tool. The environment and object recur to shape the final image (“tapestry of stone and light,” plate reflecting sunrise). While constraint is more thematic than tactical, the setting consistently guides the action and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming ruin to reverence) is clear, but escalation is gentle; the pressure seldom tightens or forces a trade‑off. The guildmasters’ opposition is referenced but occurs offstage, sidestepping a concrete price. The sleepwalking method accrues beauty rather than narrowing options. Resolution arrives smoothly with little felt loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of renewal vs. rule and reverent attention to place emerge organically through recurring images (orchids, tide, sewn light). The ending reweights silence as song, offering a credible, nonliteral answer. A line like “the true art lay not in rule but in renewal” edges into thesis‑speak, softening subtext. Still, the motif work lingers with quiet resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is stable, image‑rich, and confident; patterned diction (tide, orchid, loom) is taught early and sustained. Rhythm modulates pleasantly across day/night cycles without head‑hopping. A touch of purple persists, but the perceptual signature remains coherent and purposeful. No dialogue needed; narration carries action and mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are polished with high image density and varied rhythm, yet the figurative load occasionally doubles back (“after the tide pools empty… still empty”) and leans toward redundancy. Some metaphor clusters (orchid/tide/loom) risk saturation without added pressure. Clarity holds, but a trimmer pass would increase propulsion. Final images are clean and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—sleepwalking loom-work that stitches light into stone, guided by a glowing illustration plate—feels distinctive. The “broken precedents” turned to communal reverence offers a fresh conceptual turn. Stakes remain decorous, limiting the impact of the ingenuity. Still, the vision is cohesive and memorable.</comment>
