<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s desire to restore the altar is clear and consistent, and her “warmly curious” stance colors her perception. However, there’s little internal contradiction or on‑page struggle; she rarely meets resistance that forces a value trade. Micro‑choices (placing, turning, aligning) show care but low pressure. The resolution feels earned but largely untested emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single continuous exploration culminating in the altar’s completion and a voice of thanks—an on‑page reconfiguration from fractured to mended. Orientation is crisp from the first lines. Cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt; the scene doesn’t dramatize a sacrifice beyond patience and responsibility.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific—roots “snake between bones,” recoil at the turning base, and glow to guide her hands. The sundial object and the environment charge the final image and shape action without info‑dumping. Sensory selection fits the hush and pressure of ritual. It slightly favors atmosphere over constraint, but the place is memorably operative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stakes are legible (restore faith/bridge living and dead), yet opposition is mostly atmospheric and never truly narrows options. Escalation reads as tonal deepening rather than a tightening that exacts a price. The chime and thank‑you resolve without a test that risks failure or loss. Beautiful, but low friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of diaspora, continuity, and mending fractured faith surface through recurring images (roots, bones, sundial) and the “interrupted journeys” motif. The final image of a communal return and sunrise resonates without overt moralizing. Some lines state purpose plainly (“to restore lost faith”), softening subtext. Still, the symbolism accrues coherently.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is steady, sensuous, and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature. Diction matches the enchanted, ritual frame and remains controlled. No head‑hopping or stance leaks; psychic distance stays apt. Minor repetition (“purposeful wandering”) is stylistically consistent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lush and musical with strong image economy; most lines do double duty for mood and world‑building. Occasional purple edging and phrase reiterations slightly slow momentum. Syntax varies well enough to avoid drumbeat. Clarity remains intact at the climax and closing image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The “catacomb orchard” and sundial‑as‑altar give the ritual a fresh angle, and the diaspora frame adds human specificity. The piece commits to a quiet, accumulative enchantment rather than twist‑driven novelty. While the rebuild premise is familiar, execution feels authentic and particular. Bolder friction or an unexpected trade‑off could have elevated distinctiveness further.</comment>
