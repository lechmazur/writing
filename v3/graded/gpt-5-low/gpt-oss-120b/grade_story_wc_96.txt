<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s choices (accepting the tin, sharing the page, planting seeds, organizing the rebuild) reveal motive and agency, and Rook’s quiet counter‑pressure frames a functional partnership. The monthly molting adds texture but little on‑page cost or contradiction. Emotional nuance is conveyed mostly through image, not interior friction. The arc from solitary poet to communal catalyst is credible but lightly earned under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: tin → manifesto → seeds → shelves rebuilt → glow spreading, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation is clear early (prison library at night; who/where/when). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change; the felt cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized. The chain is coherent, if low on hard turns.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: rust, broken panes, stone cracks, moonlight as “veins of light.” The library and its material limits shape tactics (planting in cracks, shelves as altar) and charge the final image. Details remain filtered through the story’s lyric bias without becoming a tourist catalog. Strong environmental integration, just shy of constraint-driven 9‑band rigor.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes center on building beauty from anarchy, but pressure rarely tightens; opposition is ambient rather than embodied. The “guard’s tin” promises danger yet yields no on‑page risk, and the plan proceeds without a true test. Escalation is a density increase, not a narrowing of options. The result is moving but low‑tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding as resistance coheres through recurring objects (tin, seeds, shelves) and images (luminous fracture). Subtext in arranging books “by theme rather than code” quietly reframes power and order. Occasional declaratives (“promised to rebuild the shattered world”) approach moralizing but are outweighed by image‑led resonance. The ending reweights prior images without spelling a thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled. Sparse dialogue carries subtext (“What rebellion hides in a cup?”) and advances plot. POV distance is stable and plausible for a close third in a fable‑adjacent mode. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are lush yet mostly disciplined; images (“whispered applause,” “veins of light”) are vivid and coherent. Some motif repetition (“luminous fracture,” moon’s passage) edges toward overinsistence but doesn’t muddle sense or stall momentum. Syntax varies and carries the lyric cadence without template drumbeats. Clean mechanics and high information density for the mode.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blend of prison library, a false‑bottom tin, monthly identity molting, and seeds as insurgency feels fresh and specific. The method of resistance (rebuilding shelves, thematic reordering) reimagines rebellion with organic logic. Risk‑taking in tone and concept lands without obscuring clarity. Minor deductions for low antagonistic pressure keep it out of the very top band.</comment>
