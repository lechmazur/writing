<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—he aims to “translate texture into sound” before a language dies—and his actions align. Interiority is mostly externalized through ritualized choices rather than conflicted impulses; struggle feels smooth. The acceptance that the language will be locked in the tunnel gives a modest cost at the end. A sharper internal contradiction under pressure would raise the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of pattern (birds → diamond → chimes → sealing silence) coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost: the language is preserved yet sealed from living tongues. Orientation is clean from the start; single scene, one dominant stake. The escalation is elegant but relatively low-friction, which trims peak intensity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful worldbuilding—bone towers, dusk sky, canyon acoustics—filters through the narrator’s aim and shapes tactics (using echoes and bird patterns). Objects-as-setting (the flawed diamond) and environment co‑charge the final image of sealed silence. Sensory specificity remains consistent and rule‑set is learned through action. Strong integration without bloat.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes are clear and single: bind the echo tunnel and preserve a language’s texture. Pressure tightens via the flock’s pattern and the diamond’s activation, with the decisive sealing as the cost. However, there’s little resistance or reversal; progress is largely linear and ritual-competent. The conceptual price is strong but the on‑page struggle feels low-risk.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus loss emerges organically through action and images (sighs of the dead into living song; preservation that requires sealing). The final silence reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“even a single note could ripple across time”), slightly reducing mystery. Overall resonance is substantial.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the mythic register. POV is stable and modest in claims, avoiding head‑hopping or explanatory scaffolding. Variations in cadence track the ritual’s intensification. A few high-register phrases cluster, but they remain voice‑motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images earn their keep, syntax varies, and momentum holds. Occasional density of figurative language risks purple but stays coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. The final cadence is crisp and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Conceptual synthesis feels fresh—the copper‑veined teller, cursed diamond translating texture via birds’ patterns, and an echo‑tunnel that seals language. Risks are taken in world logic and lyric mode without losing clarity. The ending’s “audible sculpture” is memorable. Novelty is organic rather than gimmicky.</comment>
