<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—Lira’s ordered devotion to decoding leaves drives every act. Interiority is vivid but largely unconflicted; she meets little resistance, so contradictory impulses don’t surface. The transformation reads earned but low-cost, skewing toward wonder over struggle. Specific micro-choices (prodding moss, erecting monuments) reveal her values through action.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the density of ritual and signs intensifies toward the charged final act of placing a leaf and sealing a pact. Orientation is clean early (Lira, arbor, hush), and setups (moonstone dust, monuments) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: human care binds with forest memory, though the cost is conceptual and gentle. The causal thread is soft but coherent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor, leaf-script, and moonstone dust are specific, sensorial, and integrated into action. The environment and tools enable tactics (decoding leaves, locating the spring, igniting monuments) and charge the final image. Rules feel consistent and are learned through use, not exposition dumps. It’s enabling more than constraining, which limits a push into the highest band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating the forest’s message to earn belonging/pact—is clear, with one meaningful deepening (leaf ignition → hidden spring → sealing monument). Pressure grows by accumulation rather than opposition; no live option is forcefully foreclosed. The cost remains light; success arrives without real threat or trade-off on the page. Still, agency drives each step, keeping tension present if subdued.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Memory, stewardship, and renewal accrue through concrete rituals rather than explicit moralizing, culminating in a pact that reweights human/forest relations. Recurring images (seeds as letters, monuments, moonstone dust) gather meaning and return at the end. The resonance is genuine but tidy, with little complicating ambiguity or counterpressure. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t risk a harder ethical edge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical, controlled cadence; diction matches the world’s mythic register. Rhythm modulates with discoveries; no head-hopping or stance wobble. No dialogue, but the narrative voice functions as action. Minor hyphenation and density blips don’t disrupt control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid and economical enough, with purposeful imagery and select recursion. Occasional purple density and redundancy (reiterating the moonstone’s glow and transformation) slightly slow momentum. A minor typo (“prod‑ed”) and a few stacked modifiers appear but don’t obscure sense. The final image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Decoding leaf veins as script, moonstone dust as catalyst, and the librarian-like monuments feel fresh and coherent. The lyric-mythic synthesis is specific to this world and voice. The arc is gentle, limiting shock-value novelty, but the conceptual weave stands out. Risk is measured but confident, landing a distinctive ambiance and closure.</comment>
