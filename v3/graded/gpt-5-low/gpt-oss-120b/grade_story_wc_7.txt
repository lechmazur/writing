<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation is clear and consistent, expressed through tactile choices (the broth, the whispering, the planting). Interiority arrives via sensory specificity (“tasting memories”) rather than abstract labels. However, internal contradiction and visible cost are minimal; she meets little resistance and rarely doubts. The arc reads as competent enactment more than pressured change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through sensory density and celestial timing toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is firm within ~120 words (chef, greenhouse, alignment). Closure lands with the greenhouse transformed into a beacon and the vines’ neural foliage singing, though the cost is conceptual (pruning old ideologies) more than felt. The sequence of actions remains coherent without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse, cracked dome, and solar‑panel fire are vivid and consistently filtered through Mara’s culinary sensibility. Environment actively charges the final image (rust turned to ruby veins; the greenhouse glows as beacon). It modestly constrains tactics (salvage, dome light, ribs catching comet light) but rarely forces hard choices. Sensory integration is rich across smell, sight, and sound.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—coaxing the knowledge seed to sprout during the alignment—is clear and escalates with the sky’s “zenith” and the seed’s burst. The tightening reads as a cadence shift rather than a narrowing of options; risk and consequence remain low. The pruning metaphor provides a thematic trade‑off, but few on‑page obstacles test commitment. Resolution feels earned but lightly taxed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of renewal via “gentle rebellion” arises organically from pruning, memory, and culinary ritual. Recurring images (broth as conduit; vines shedding; comet light) reweight meaning at the end. A couple of lines state the thesis a touch directly (“not a war of fire”), but they don’t collapse into sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is quiet, lingering, and credible.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close voice is assured, lyrical, and stable; diction suits the fable‑science register. Rhythm modulates well from hushed prep to luminous climax without head‑hopping or stance slips. Sensory attention reads as a chef’s perceptual signature. Brief quoted lines serve action and subtext rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; figurative language is vivid yet largely coherent to the world’s logic. Occasional intensifiers verge on purple but don’t blur causality. Sentence rhythm varies and maintains momentum through the climax. No significant loops or mechanical artifacts dull the final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Chef who tastes memories + synaptic plasticity in plants + knowledge fruit is an original, well‑synthesized conceit. The celestial alignment amplifies rather than substitutes for agency, and the pruning philosophy reframes rebellion freshly. The closure image (amber neural foliage humming lullabies) feels distinctive and earned. Minor safety comes from low on‑page cost, keeping it just shy of the top band.</comment>
