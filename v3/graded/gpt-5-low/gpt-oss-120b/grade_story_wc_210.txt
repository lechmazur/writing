<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear motivation (revive the town without “false comfort”) and a consistent ethic of refusal guide his choices, but interior conflict is mostly thematic rather than embodied. The temptation to “easy restoration” is named, not dramatized through struggle. Micro‑choices (opening the bottle with a question; turning the sigh into a blueprint) show values in action. Emotional texture stays coolly conceptual, limiting felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: images and motifs compound toward the town’s patient bloom and his oath to tend it. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—the town revives through remembered intention—and the bottle ends emptied, signaling price and completion. Orientation is clean from the first line. Cost is present but modest, residing in renunciation and labor rather than a sharp turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Atmosphere is vivid and coherent—paper‑lantern cove, ghost town, amber bottle—and details recur to charge the final image. The lanterns and bottle function as micro‑setting/objects that frame choice and closure, even if they don’t strictly constrain movement. Sensory selection aligns with a ritualized, quiet urgency. World rules feel consistent within a lyrical, quasi‑magical frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival without false magic) is clear and escalates via refusal → interrogation of the bottle → blueprinting → bloom. Pressure accrues as density rather than opposition, with one meaningful tightening when he rejects “soothing lies” and opens the sealed bottle by memory. The price reads as patience and renunciation, not a contested loss. Tension is steady but soft, lacking a hard test under pressure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memory as ethical method versus comfort is woven through objects and action, culminating in the lantern‑oath. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis (“the past could be a tool, not a chain”) rather than letting image and action carry it. The final image resonates and reweights prior motifs. Subtext exists but shares space with overt commentary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in distance; the perceptual signature (alchemy filtered through memory‑work) is distinct. Rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum without flattening. No dialogue; narration handles implication and pressure cleanly. Minor abstraction creeps in but doesn’t erode control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: precise images (“cork dissolved into mist”) and efficient recurrence. Some conceptual restatement and thesis‑like lines reduce density and risk mild redundancy. Syntax varies; no major artifacts or muddled metaphors. Momentum is maintained through purposeful compression.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: alchemy fused with “working memory” as method, the bottle opened by a question, lanterns as population lights. The revival as patient bloom rather than a burst feels fresh and thematically coherent. Risks are taken in concept and texture without obscuring clarity. A touch more embodied friction could elevate it further.</comment>
