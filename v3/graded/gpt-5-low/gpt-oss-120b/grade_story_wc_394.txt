<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—curiosity fused with the algorithm’s longing—is clear and consistently enacted (steering in, transliterating, ringing). Interiority is textured via jokes and perception filters (the “coffee” quip; poet‑reading‑glass line), but contradictory impulses under pressure are faint. She faces little genuine risk or sacrifice; the cost of her prank on fate is mostly conceptual. The final recommitment (installing the prism, pressing onward) reads as earned but low‑stakes.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: imagery layers and culminates in the bell’s inaudible note and the algorithm’s satisfied log, then a charged pivot to the next quest. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—having rung the unheard bell, the system reweights the world into a new map. However, the on‑page cost at the ending is slender; success arrives without a meaningful trade‑off. Orientation is strong from the outset, and causal through‑lines are coherent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The acid sea, floating gear‑lattice, and copper bell are vividly embodied and participate in action (hissing mist, volatile tide, droplets painting constellations that become a map). Tools and micro‑objects (kaleidoscope, navigation crystal, prism) fuse with environment to constrain choices. World rules feel consistent and learned through use, not dumped. The final image is charged by setting‑objects (prism/rainbow) rather than generic scenery.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ring the unheard bell—is clear but doesn’t bite; escalation mostly reads as aesthetic intensification rather than narrowing options. Transliteration and approach work on the first try with limited resistance; the acid sea’s threat stays atmospheric. There’s no substantive trade‑off or loss to sharpen the peak. The post‑ring shift toward the “next mystery” deepens scope but doesn’t increase cost.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of irreverent awe, transforming chaos into pattern, and pranking fate emerge organically from concrete acts (transliteration, inaudible bell, algorithm’s satisfaction). The ending offers a conceptual repricing—success is real even if unheard—and reframes longing as renewable propulsion. Subtext runs through object choices and tonal juxtapositions rather than moralizing. The resonance is strong but not searing due to the soft cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A confident, idiosyncratic voice sustains lyric propulsion with controlled diction (“poet reading a love letter written in glass,” “sarcastic philosophers”). POV stays clean and focused on Mara’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well across beats; playful asides never confuse the action. Minor flourish density occasionally risks purple but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Inventive lines pull double duty (image + function) and maintain momentum; sentence variety and clean mechanics support clarity. Figurative density is high but largely coherent and voice‑true. A few stacked metaphors nudge toward excess without obscuring cause/effect. No evident loops or scaffolding; the finale lands with a crisp, recharging image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—acid‑sea forge, kaleidoscope‑driven navigation, yearning algorithm, inaudible bell as prank—feels fresh and purposeful. Risk‑taking in tone and object‑logic coheres rather than gimmicks. Turns arise from established motifs, with the algorithm’s logged resonance and prism‑pivot feeling inevitable in hindsight. Emotional stakes are modest, limiting ultimate impact, but the conceptual originality is high.</comment>
