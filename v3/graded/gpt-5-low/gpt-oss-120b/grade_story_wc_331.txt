<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and method are clear and consistent, and her micro-choices (tracing lines, whispering the algorithm, adjusting/tucking the scarf) align with her stewardship. Interiority is restrained but credible; we feel her calm vigilance more than inner contradiction. The piece lacks a vivid internal counter-impulse or cost that would deepen character under pressure. Still, her competence and quiet duty read as particular rather than generic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery density and patterning intensify to the projection in the atrium, then settle into a charged stasis as she logs the event. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is strong. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—memories reawakened, then the vow of ongoing care—though the on‑page cost remains gentle. The beats link through method rather than causal jeopardy, but the cadence shift is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library is vividly particular—equations in rhyme, Heisenberg sonnets, ozone and ink—and its rules stay consistent, learned through action. The scarf functions as a micro-setting tool charging the final image. Environment actively enables tactics (curvature, vaulted ceiling, atrium projection) rather than acting as backdrop. Sensory detailing is selective and purposeful, supporting tone and theme.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening analog memories without disrupting patrons) is signaled early, and pressure mounts via intensifying field to the luminous projection. However, escalation carries minimal risk or trade‑off, and no option is clearly foreclosed. The tightening is primarily textural, not price‑driven. Resolution is earned but soft on consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: stewardship of memory at the intersection of science and poetry, and the ethical tenderness of reawakening what’s dormant. The final image (ledger entry, scarf humming, quiet vigil) reweights prior motifs without stating a moral. A few conceptual assertions (“hidden geometry,” “bridge between measurable and mythic”) verge on telling, but they’re mostly enacted. Resonance lingers as quiet duty rather than proclamation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Controlled, distinctive lyric voice with a precise lexicon that suits Mara’s sensibility; POV distance stays stable and confident. Rhythm modulates well from hush to intensification to earned calm without head‑hopping. Diction integrates scientific and poetic registers organically. No dialogue needed; the narration carries subtext and mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is musical and economical for lyric mode, with high information density and minimal scaffold. Figurative language is abundant but coherent and pattern‑consistent (“hyperbolic,” “Möbius,” “lattice”). A few near‑redundancies exist, yet momentum holds and the closure image is clear. Mechanics are clean, and paragraphing supports cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—scientific poetry, hyperbolic geometry as mnemonic compass, a scarf as conduit—feels fresh and inevitable within its world. Risks are taken in tone and conceptual melding without gimmickry. The final repricing of solitude as active stewardship elevates the frame. Emotional specificity is quieter than maximal, but the vision is singular.</comment>
