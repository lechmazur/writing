<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained—Lira seeks the withheld truth and then chooses to free the crew. The interiority is distinctive but skews declarative and assured, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. Her competence faces minimal friction, which softens felt cost. Still, choices align with motive and reveal character-specific perception.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: shard aligns maps → slit opens → alternate bay → hidden log → decision to merge realities. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change: awakening the crew and losing the shard. Cost is present but modest (sacrifice of the shard and implied world-ripple). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The repair bay is vivid and purpose-driven: rusted hulls, flickering lights, the conduit’s hidden log, and the shard’s physical behavior all integrate with action. The shard functions as a tool-object that constrains choices and charges the final image. Sensory specificity matches Lira’s vocation. World rules feel consistent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and deepens with the discovery of the sealed log. However, escalation lacks resistance; each step succeeds without meaningful obstacle or tradeoff until the shard’s final shattering. The decision to stitch realities is a real tightening but reads low-pressure. Consequence lands, but pressure could be sharper.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of withheld truth versus shared knowledge and the ethics of survival are coherent and arise from action. Recurring images (maps, lattice, breathing bay) support a conceptual repricing at the end. Some lines verge on explicit statement (“weaving between worlds was not a task but a promise”), trimming subtext. Resonance lingers but avoids profound ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a strong perceptual signature suits a sensory cartographer. POV remains stable and confident, with diction consistent to the character’s vocation. Occasional density flirts with purple but stays legible. Rhythm modulates well across turns.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are musical and image-rich, with good momentum through most beats. Figurative stacking and near-repetitions (“lattice,” “weaving,” “whisper”) risk redundancy but don’t obscure causality. Some abstractions could be pared for greater force at peak beats. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The vocation (sensory map maker) plus a shard that reorients perception across universes is fresh and well-synthesized. The travel mechanics and moral pivot feel earned. Risk-taking in concept pays off without losing clarity, though the conflict path is smooth. Final image (shard as stars) memorably reweights prior motifs.</comment>
