<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and character‑specific, but pressure reveals little contradiction or cost; Lira remains serenely competent throughout. The interiority is vivid (language through skin, sensing tree sorrow) yet largely unopposed. The culminating realization risks neatness (“required more than sight... a compass forged from empathy”) rather than an earned, conflicted turn. A small renunciation or misstep under pressure would deepen credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound density builds to the pure tone, then the step through the veil lands closure via a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is solid early, single POV, single scene. The on‑page cost is soft; the “dissolve into one chord” reads as uplift more than sacrifice. Still, the stillpoint entry/exit provides a legible before/after cadence.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and the meteor‑iron ring are sensorially and functionally integrated; non‑visual perception grounds the space. Environmental rules (hums, magnetic whispers) stay consistent and act on choices, culminating in the knot of bark/pure tone. Strong tactile and auditory specificity charge the final image. Slightly ornamental flourishes keep it just shy of 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach the stillpoint to chart inner seas) is signaled early and escalates through melody → crescendo → pure tone. The turn is clear at the bark and step through, but costs and foreclosed options remain gentle. Agency drives the outcome, yet pressure never truly threatens failure or trade‑off. The result satisfies quietly rather than tests conviction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres—mapping interiority via non‑visual senses and empathy—and the final image reweights prior motifs. However, the explicit thesising (“She understood that navigating uncharted emotional depths required…”) blunts subtext. The resonance of languages dissolving into one chord works, but a touch more implication and less stating would elevate. Emotional complexity skews serene over ambivalent.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled lyric third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (sound and touch) suits a blind cartographer. Rhythm modulates effectively toward the stillpoint, and diction stays coherent. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Occasional elevated abstractions nudge toward statement but don’t break voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are polished with purposeful imagery; auditory and tactile metaphors carry weight. Minor repetition and abstraction (“quiet blaze,” “emotional depths,” “resonant sigh”) sap a bit of momentum in the final third. Overall clarity and cadence remain strong, with few scaffold sentences. A sharper cut on summary‑like aphorisms would heighten impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—ultrasonic forest, language‑absorbing skin, meteor‑iron compass, and an emotional stillpoint—is fresh and coherent. The tactical use of non‑visual mapping feels specific rather than generic. Risk is taken in committing to a lyric, interior quest with minimal external antagonism, and it lands. Slight conventionality in the spelled‑out takeaway is the main limiter.</comment>
