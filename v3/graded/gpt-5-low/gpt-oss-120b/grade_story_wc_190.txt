<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—teaching silence—is clear and her tactics (whispers, speed adjustments, opening the vial) align. A flicker of inner conflict appears (“she must first dissolve the agitation within herself”) but isn’t stress-tested against real opposition. Emotional embodiment is mostly textural rather than pressured. Competence dominates over contradiction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a steady density build (amber bloom → tiny storm → cascade) culminates in docking and the vial’s emptiness. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: mission fulfilled at the cost of the vial’s spent purpose and her internal expenditure. Orientation is clean and single-scene. Cost is felt, if gentle.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific: misty river, prism terrace, brass ear, storm glass; sensory integration is strong. The environment and objects (terrace shimmer, hull hum, storm glass) meaningfully charge the final image. While constraints are soft, the micro-setting governs tactics (monitoring, whispering, cadence). World rules are consistent through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are modest (communal calm), but pressure coheres and deepens via pattern: noise → counter-tones → storm glass escalation → cascade → docking. Agency remains active and continuous, yet no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond the vial’s depletion. Tension is mostly tonal; one decisive intensification suffices for this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence as a taught comfort accrues through recurring images and culminates in the shared breath and the empty vial. A few explicit statements (“Lira’s motivation was clear…”) slightly blunt subtext, but the ending image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. The train-echo frame and “in transit” deepen the thematic afterglow.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Lira’s sensibility; rhythmic shifts match the calm, accumulative pressure. Diction and syntax are confident with a distinct perceptual signature (sound, shimmer, hush). No head-hopping and stance remains steady. Patterned elisions are taught and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is graceful and mostly tight, with purposeful repetition and clean rhythms. Minor purple or tautological spots (“fluid was a fluidly logical mixture”) and occasional reiterations slightly soften sharpness. Overall, sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum to the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prism terrace gondola, brass ear, and storm-glass ritual feel freshly synthesized and memorable. The closure (silver cascade, emptied vial, communal hush) reads inevitable under the piece’s logic. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and they pay off. Emotional truth skews gentle but specific.</comment>
