<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, particular motivation (to map and give voice) with tactile practice and micro‑choices (placing the leaf, releasing the final droplet). Interiority is present but largely serene; contradictory impulses and visible cost are minimal. The closing realization feels earned by the ritual, though it skirts neatness. Lack of friction or error under pressure keeps it from higher bands.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual actions compound into the amber‑lit closure where the map completes and meaning reconfigures. Orientation is crisp early (coastal caves, solitary map maker, commission) and the pattern remains coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR with the leaf’s oracle status and her reframed role. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, limiting peak impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functionally woven: the cave’s breath affects droplets, mineral filaments align with the leaf’s veins, and gulls echo the cave’s new rhythm. The object‑as‑setting (leaf/amber/water) charges the final image. Rules are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. While atmosphere shapes behavior, the environment rarely constrains a hard choice, capping at this tier.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (becoming the voice/completing the map) is signaled and deepens through the ritual to a luminous cadence shift. Escalation is mostly density and image rather than narrowing options or visible price. The final droplet is an agency beat, but no path is truly foreclosed. Pressure remains coherent yet gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Themes of translation, stewardship, and listening accrue through recurring images (veins/filaments, echoes, lantern‑droplets) and culminate in a resonant final tableau. However, the explicit thesis—“to become the voice of the unknown was not to speak for others…”—states the moral in the final movement, dulling subtext. Emotional aftereffect is elegiac and sincere. Greater reliance on implication would elevate.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature—sensorial mapping lexicon, ritual syntax—stays consistent and confident. Rhythm modulates appropriately, and elision patterns are taught and legible. No head‑hopping or stance slips. A few flourishes flirt with purple but remain controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High image density with purposeful verbs and concrete actions (basin, vapor lanterns, pulse/glow) maintains momentum. Minor repetition and lushness approach excess but rarely blur sense. Sentences vary in length and cadence, delivering a smooth read. No obvious scaffolding or logic stumbles at the line level.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sensory cartography via “heat‑mapped” echoes, an amber elm as transitional oracle, and a post‑human hibernation frame feel fresh and integrated. The ritualized science‑mystic hybrid has strong conceptual integrity. Risks are taken without obscuring clarity. Limited cost and soft conflict keep it just shy of the very top.</comment>
