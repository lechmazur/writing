<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive and contradiction (probability discipline vs. gambling impulse) are clear and drive concrete choices—placing the coin, choosing to descend, and lifting the lantern. Grief from her mother’s heart attack shades her actions but isn’t deeply embodied beyond a few lines. Her final act—writing a theorem that fuses certainty with chance—reads earned, though the personal cost is understated. The interiority is specific enough to feel character‑particular without lapsing into labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: coin → panel → descent → scrawls → lantern/mica activation → map → traversal → emergent theorem. Orientation is established early and maintained; the scene respects single‑POV scope. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the “lucid contradiction” enacted in her new theorem and lantern left for the next wanderer—though the on‑page cost is more implied than felt. The drive reads Hybrid with a causal spine and an accumulative final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and the lantern with the mica pane are vivid, sensorial, and purpose‑driven; the lantern’s unique properties actively unlock the tunnel and charge the final image. The tunnels’ phosphorescent symbols and old signage are filtered through a probability‑trained mind, sharpening specificity. Weather and interior atmosphere cohere with tone without becoming postcard detail. Spatial logic holds across the descent and return.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around a single stake—reconciling rigor with chance via the map quest—and tightens at the lantern/mica activation beat. Escalation is steady but low‑risk; few options are foreclosed, and consequences remain largely conceptual. Agency drives each step, avoiding coincidence‑driven resolution. The cost is gentle, so the peak lacks bite even as it resolves cleanly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of paradox embraced responsibly arise from concrete acts (the sum, ratios, and the lantern ritual) rather than pure assertion, culminating in the theorem and lantern bequeathal. However, explicit statements (“to widen perspectives responsibly,” “true lucid contradiction”) edge toward telling. The final image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, if softly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a measured, lucid lyricism suited to a probability‑minded protagonist. Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate with discovery; no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience. The prose avoids over‑explaining tactics while staying legible. A few echoed phrases appear, but cadence remains varied.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Lines are polished with good information density; images often do double duty (mica pane as tool and prism). Occasional purple touches and concept reiterations slightly slow momentum but do not obscure causality. Syntax and paragraphing breathe well; few scaffolds or hedges. The final sentence lands cleanly on a charged object without clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of a gambler‑scholar decoding a hidden subway via probabilistic cues, using a candle lantern with mica, feels fresh and coherent. “Lucid contradictions” as operative principle creates a distinctive frame rather than a gimmick. Risks are taken in marrying lyric tone to a puzzle‑quest and mostly pay off. Slight safety in consequence keeps it shy of top tier.</comment>
