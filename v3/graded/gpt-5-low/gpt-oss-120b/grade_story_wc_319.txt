<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (homesick guardian yearning to “make friends with uncertainty”) and embodied responses (cautious approach to the pendant) carry the piece. Internal contradiction (feral protector vs. curator-in-waiting) is present but the cost of the turn remains soft. Micro-choices—approach, reverence instead of aggression, choosing to wait—align with character. The shift to “curator” is credible but edges toward declarative rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pendant encounter concentrates pattern, and the ending reconfigures stance into an earned stasis/charged poise. Causality is coherent: pendant → contemplation/ritual → elective waiting → wing opening. Cost is implied (risk of awakening breach; self-binding to patience) though not vividly tested. Orientation is clean from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The frozen, misted garden and the pendant’s glow charge the final image and govern perception. Sensory choices are purposeful and voice-filtered, with the environment entwined with the guardian’s tactics. World rules (veil, light boundaries) stay consistent and learned through action. Occasional overt symbolism flirts with abstraction but doesn’t break credibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—engage the pendant and its risks vs. preserve the archive—tightens once the cultist door risk is introduced. The guardian’s agency drives the deepening (ritual approach, refusal to rush, then opening a wing). The price of waiting is stated rather than pressured in-scene; no hard loss tests the stance. Still, the cadence shift around the pendant’s adoption reads as a meaningful turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of uncertainty as companion, guardianship vs. curation, and patience as purpose emerge through image and action. The final wing of mist‑woven verses offers a resonant answer without a tidy moral. A few explicit thematic phrases (“make friends with uncertainty”) skim the edge of telling. Subtext largely works via charged objects and atmosphere.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent lyric POV with a distinct perceptual signature that modulates with pressure. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and apt for a mythic-lyric stance. No head‑hopping or unearned certainty leaks. Minor moments verge on grandiosity but remain within the established voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lush lines mostly carry multiple jobs, but repetition (“veil,” “boundaries of light,” “uncertainty,” “wait”) edges toward redundancy. Some figurative stackings risk purple density, though clarity holds. Momentum is steady with few scaffold sentences. Final images land cleanly despite occasional synonym loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Feral library guardian” plus “interiorizing exteriors” in a frozen, mist‑archive is an original synthesis executed coherently. The pendant-as-key reweights prior motifs without gimmickry. Risks in diction and structure mostly pay off. The conflict’s cost could cut deeper to reach the highest tier.</comment>
