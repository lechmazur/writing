<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motives (skeptical explorer seeking to “weigh” a swallowed truth) are clear and consistent, and the final renunciation (leaving the wheel) reads as an earned endurance with cost. The interiority is distinctive—treating psychic calls as “data points”—and shows an appealing contradiction between skepticism and openness to pattern. Embodiment is present (breath, ribs, chill), though the struggle stays largely conceptual rather than physically pressured. A slightly deeper friction at the decision point would heighten the felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: soundscapes, radio fragments, and the wheel’s oscillation gather into a pattern culminating in an Earned Stasis choice. Orientation is clean early (tunnel, Mara, target object), and the numeric-pattern beat acts as the tightening. Cost is legible in the refusal to act and the pressure “settling into his ribs.” The causality is lyric but coherent; a touch more consequence beyond internal pressure could raise impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tunnel and mill are vividly rendered through sound and rust, and the beaded valve wheel functions as a charged micro‑setting that shapes the climactic choice. Sensory detail (low hum, crackle, chill) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. The environment constrains options plausibly (a hushed, haunted industrial belly where listening is the tactic). A minor push toward physical constraint (access, hazards) would move this toward the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to extract or leave a truth‑weighted relic—tightens through pattern recognition to a single figure, then resolves in a renunciation. Escalation is primarily tonal and cognitive; the pressure coheres, but danger remains mostly atmospheric. The refusal forecloses a path with conceptual cost, aligning with the chosen lens. One added external stressor or irreversible consequence would sharpen the price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: skepticism versus haunting, the ethics of unearthing versus leaving, and the quantification of guilt. The final image (“a quiet prayer he never intended to utter”) reprices the premise without moralizing. Recurring motifs (hum, beads, hush) shift meaning at closure. A slight tendency to state concepts directly (“weight measured…in emotional tonnage”) keeps it just shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a distinctive perceptual signature (sound‑as‑data, industrial mysticism filtered through skepticism). Distance and stance remain stable; no head‑hopping or unearned certainty. Occasional purple density threatens clarity but never breaks it. Cadence modulates enough to carry the accumulative pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prose is musical and image‑rich, with good information density and momentum for a lyric mode. Some metaphoric redundancy appears (“drowsy alertness” recurs; hum/whisper/fog motifs stack), edging toward overwriting. Syntax varies and reads clearly; no major scaffold loops or filter stacks. Slight trimming of repeated figuratives would sharpen force.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis is fresh: a beaded valve wheel calibrated to secrecy’s mass, decoded via late‑night psychic calls treated as signal processing. The ghost‑shift conceit feels original and integrated rather than ornamental. The quiet refusal ending is earned and non‑obvious. Minor conventional notes (haunted factory ambiance) are transformed by the appraisal method.</comment>
