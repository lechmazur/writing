<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular: he seeks chalk to etch and preserve what he is losing, driven by “precognitively forgetful” visions. Interiority is tactile and embodied through sound images (cracked vinyl, tape hiss) and object work (driftwood, cassette). Micro-choices—marking the path, choosing to record, then to inscribe—align with his longing. The internal conflict is gentle rather than combative, so the cost reads more as acceptance than wrenching sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and pattern (echoes, tide, chalk) build to a conceptual repricing—capturing aging becomes letting it ripple. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/quest). Closure lands on the page with the act of recording and the final inscription, and a felt cost in accepting forgetting’s inevitability. The cost is more hushed than sharp, but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden is vivid, sensorial, and functionally engaged: fog density guides the search, vapor statues shape movement, and the monolith catalyzes the key beat. Recurring objects (chalk, driftwood, cassette) integrate with place rather than sit as postcards. The setting charges the final image (slab warming, resonance like a ghost ship’s horn). World rules (vapor/light sculptures responding to touch/sound) are consistent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve a vanishing self/echo—tightens as he enters the center, touches chalk to fog, hears the aging hum, and chooses to record and later inscribe. Escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than reversals, appropriate to the chosen lens. The visible price is an acceptance that he cannot trap time, only trace it. Pressure is coherent but remains elegiac, not acute, which keeps the heat just below peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: echoes, aging as sound, memory as fog, and the shift from trapping to releasing. The closing insight (“not to trap it, but to let it ripple outward”) edges toward explicitness but is earned by preceding actions (recording, chalk line, slab inscription). Subtext operates in the way objects are treated as memory vessels. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, consistent lyric voice with a sonic bias (hiss, creak, hum) matches the protagonist’s aim. Psychic distance is stable; no head‑hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates well from exploratory to hush at the end. Elision is purposeful and legible under the accumulative design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is lush but largely controlled; metaphors are coherent within a sound/sea/fog palette. Minor density risk (a few stacked images per sentence) but momentum holds and key actions remain clear. Repetition (echo/tide) reads patterned rather than looped scaffold. Final lines are clean and image‑driven.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a “junkyard prophet” in a fog sculpture garden seeking chalk to etch aging’s sound onto vapor, then cassette, then slab. Objects and methods are surprising yet integrated. The final reweighting is non‑obvious but inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, surreal logic) heighten rather than obscure.</comment>
