<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vira’s motivation—to quell “inner static” while protecting the farm—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (turning to the box, initiating a controlled burn). Interiority is particular to an android sensibility (“sensors tasting ozone”), though contradiction under pressure remains mild and the path to success feels relatively smooth. The final renunciation of perpetual vigilance lands but carries limited on‑page cost. Strong specificity, slightly low friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is crisp from the outset (dome, desert rose farm, android caretaker; magnetic shift inciting). Causal chain is coherent: shielding flickers → risk of burn escape → Vira miniaturizes chaos → controlled burn succeeds → reconfiguration of meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (fear repurposed; vigilance softened). The price is present but more thematic than materially felt, keeping it out of the top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dome, magnetic shielding, and desert environment are vivid and consequential (fire calibration tied to shifting magnetic field; glass panels glowing under flame). Details are filtered through Vira’s professional focus and sensory palette. The recurring box-object charges the final image in tandem with place. Slight restraint on 9+ as the environment constrains but doesn’t corner a perilous trade‑off on the page.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (prevent uncontrolled burn/contain chaos; resolve static). Escalation tightens once via the shift and sensor warning, and Vira’s tactic (miniaturization) narrows options before initiating the burn. The resolution is earned and coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, though risk feels largely managed and the tangible price minimal. Tension hums more than bites.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of transforming fear into a stabilizing, organic/machine harmony is enacted through the box’s reweighting from repository to seed. Recurring images (breathing wood, molten sky, compass‑petaled blooms) accrue and reprice meaning in the final placement under the vine. The piece avoids moralizing, opting for a non‑literal answer via image. Slight neatness keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The lyric voice is controlled, textured, and consistent with an android caretaker’s sensory logic. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. No dialogue, but the narrative stance remains precise and confidently focalized. A few lush lines flirt with purple but retain clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and largely efficient; images often do double duty (technical calibration and lyric shimmer). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. Occasional intensifiers and stacked metaphors lightly crowd peak beats, but momentum holds. Closing cadence is well‑tuned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Android horticulture under a magnetically sensitive dome, an organic “breathing” fear‑box, and chaos‑miniaturization synthesize into a fresh, integrated vision. The conceptual turn (fear → seed of calm) feels earned by prior particulars. Risks in imagery and premise heighten resonance without gimmickry. Slightly conservative stakes temper absolute standout novelty.</comment>
