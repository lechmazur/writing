<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is explicit and coherent (“to discover meaning in the margins”), and actions align with it through the ritual. However, there’s little contradictory impulse or visible cost pushing Mara under pressure. Interiority remains generalized rather than character‑particular beyond vocation. The final choice reads as continuation of intention versus a pressured renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ritual details build toward the activation and launch, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise when the letter departs encoded and identity is mailed as concept, though cost is light. The because/therefore chain is soft but coherent within the lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The golden arcade, chalked pavement, ebony clipboard, and drone are vividly integrated and recur with increasing charge. Environment subtly supports tactics (chalk on pavement, clipboard translating, drone from recycled arcade circuitry). Sensory specificity and tone are strong without museum‑tour detours. Constraint is present but not decisive, keeping it below the 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes remain largely conceptual; pressure is gentle with minimal narrowing of options. The principal tightening is the hidden address reveal leading to the sealing and launch, with little felt price or credible loss. No antagonist or counterforce tests her commitment beyond execution. Tension is sustained texturally rather than escalated.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of margin/meaning, analog/digital, and identity as post are coherent and resonate with the closing image. However, the line “revealed a truth: the margins held the most luminous stories” veers into stated thesis, dulling subtext. The ending reweights prior images but skirts sentimentality. Insight feels earned by pattern more than by struggle.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV lyric voice is steady, with controlled diction and rhythmic modulation that suits the ritual. No dialogue to stress‑test, but focalization remains consistent and plausible. Figurative language is largely apt and pattern‑taught. Confidence and stance match the character’s sensory priorities.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is lucid and musical with good information density; images often do double duty. Occasional purple edges and declarative theme lines slightly blunt the edge. Minimal scaffolding and repetition; cadence breathes with the scene. The closure image is clear and not muddled by figurative overload.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pseudonym creator + chalk‑as‑code + surface mail as ceremonial conduit is a fresh synthesis. The drone woven from arcade circuitry and identity mailed as concept feel distinctive rather than quirky for its own sake. Risks are coherent and carried through the ending. Emotional complexity is moderate, keeping it shy of the top band.</comment>
