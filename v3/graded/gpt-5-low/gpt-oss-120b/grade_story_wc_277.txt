<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motive (to unearth hidden truths) is clear and coherently expressed through her lineage and habits, and her micro-choices (slotting the nib, forming a hypothesis) align with that drive. However, internal contradiction is thin; she encounters little friction to test or complicate her values. Embodied emotion appears (weight of the nib, grin of “solemn playfulness”) but under minimal pressure. The closing handoff to the journalist implies conviction rather than a costly change.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. The because/therefore chain is clean (call → observatory → nib → hypothesis → deciphering → siren), and closure lands with a decisive shift (ledger revealed; archives opening). The cost is light and convenience intrudes (the console recognizes the nib and swiftly solves the problem). Orientation is strong early; structure is single-scene coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The observatory above clouds and the brushed-steel dome are vividly rendered and filtered through Mira’s journalist sensibility; the object-as-setting (rosewood nib) meaningfully charges the final image. Environmental logic is consistent and integrated with action (console, holographic chart). While pressure from the setting is modest, the space and tools shape tactics and outcome. Strong economy with purposeful specificity across senses.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (expose the ledger’s truth), but escalation is minimal; once at the console, resistance collapses and the discovery arrives without a tightening turn or visible price. The “proof by contradiction” move could have narrowed options, yet it yields immediate success. The siren and journalist’s arrival resolve rather than complicate. Pressure reads elegant but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Truth versus official narrative is woven through objects and method (pen nib lineage, contradiction as ethic), and “orbits of regret” offers a resonant conceptual frame. Some lines verge on thesis (“any writer… must first prove the false premise cannot hold”), slightly flattening subtext. The final image reweights the motif without heavy moralizing. Thematic coherence is strong, if a touch declarative.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature (newsroom metaphors, celestial-newsprint crossfade). Diction and rhythm are controlled and apt; brief dialogue reads natural with tonal echo. No head-hopping or stance drift. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Line craft is polished with vivid metaphors and efficient syntax; information density is high. Some figurative stacking (“orbits of regret,” “floating thought,” “ink like rain”) edges toward ornament in low-pressure beats, mildly softening propulsion. Clarity remains intact and there are few redundancies. Final beats land cleanly without muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of investigative journalism with astronomical instrumentation and formal logic (proof by contradiction) feels fresh. The rosewood nib as a legacy key is an elegant, specific device. Resolution’s ease trims the sense of ingenuity under pressure, but the conceptual synthesis stands out. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off.</comment>
