<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—protecting “vulnerable voices” drives every move—and embodied through tactile choices (tuning the scanner, entering the alcove). Internal contradiction is limited; the protagonist rarely hesitates, so pressure doesn’t expose competing impulses. Still, the acceptance of “weight” at the end reads as a credible, modest cost. The voice-specific occupational lens (“contact tracer for hearts”) adds texture to action rather than remaining a label.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pulses → photograph → alcove → choral resonance → restored image forms a coherent intensification. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: a vow crystallized by the image’s restoration and the narrator’s acceptance of ongoing burden. Orientation is clean from the first lines; causality holds within the fable-logic. Minor convenience (easy discovery/entry to the alcove) doesn’t undercut the on‑page cadence shift and cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The atrium’s mist, marble, and twilight aren’t postcard garnish; they shape route and charge the final image. The hearing aid functions as micro‑setting/tool, constraining tactics by dictating how the protagonist navigates. World rules (electromagnetic “beats,” ivy‑sealed alcove) remain consistent in their dream‑logic. The restored photograph as environmental object reweights the space at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stakes are singular—save a fragile voice—and escalate via a clear tightening (signal intensifies, leads to hidden source, demands synchronization). The price is more conceptual than visceral: taking on the “weight of incidental heroism” rather than risking body or reputation. Agency drives the turn at the alcove and the decision to vow stewardship. A touch more friction or sacrifice on the page would deepen the cost signal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of remembrance and stewardship emerges through objects and action rather than moralizing, though the phrase “incidental heroism” is stated overtly. Subtext lives in the choir’s fading hymn, the restored colors, and the act of pocketing the photo as a beacon. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: duty is a chosen listening. Complexity skews gentle; ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, coherent lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction, rhythm, and imagery feel unified to the narrator’s sensibility. The “contact tracer” metaphor is sustained without leakage or head‑hopping. Elevated language suits the fable‑noir register and modulates with pressure at the alcove. There’s confidence without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Strong, musical lines with high information density, generally propulsive for a lyric mode. Occasional purple edging and small repetition (e.g., “reeling hush,” stacked solemn images) slightly slow momentum. Figurative logic remains coherent; sentences do multiple jobs. Minimal scaffold; punctuation and syntax are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The “contact tracer for hearts” tracking EM echoes in a hearing aid is a fresh synthesis; the noir‑lyric investigation into grief feels singular. Turns and images (choir resonance restoring a photo) are unexpected yet earned by the internal rules. Risk‑taking in premise and diction heightens coherence rather than obscuring it. The final vow reframes the vocation memorably.</comment>
