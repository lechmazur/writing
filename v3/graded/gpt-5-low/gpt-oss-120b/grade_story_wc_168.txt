<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren’s motive—transforming pain into a shared language—is clear and consistent, and her choices (placing and later opening the box) align with it. Interiority is vivid but skews declarative and serene, with little contradictory impulse under pressure. The “hard softness” paradox surfaces a credible trait, yet we rarely see it tested against resistance. The change at the end feels earned but low-friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images of moon, ash, and fracture accrue toward the village-opening and conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean, and closure lands via the box’s transformation and the reframed meaning of the bargain. Cost is present but mostly conceptual—she relinquishes her private bargain to the collective—so the final beat resonates more than it wounds. The single-scene arc is coherent and contained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, ash valley, and stone altar are tactile and charged through action, not exposition. The cracked box functions as a micro-setting/object anchoring the final image. While the environment rarely constrains tactics, it consistently mirrors and intensifies mood with purposeful specificity. Sensory detail balances sight with heat/ash evocation.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear—whether she will expose the bargain to enlighten others—and escalate modestly from solitary reflection to public act. The meaningful tightening is her decision to open the box before the villagers. Pressure remains mostly internal and lyrical; material resistance is minimal, keeping the cost soft. The resolution is protagonist-driven and coherent under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres around translating pain and gifting innocence back via reflection, with strong imagistic threads (cracks, light, ash). However, explicit moralizing (“She realized that the true bargain had never been about buying innocence…”) dulls subtext in the final movement. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but tends toward stated wisdom over earned implication. The best moments let the images do the work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third-person closely held to Maren’s perceptions; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. Repetition patterns (“hard softness,” “slow waltz,” “light”) feel intentional and teach the piece’s cadence. No head-hopping or stance leakage; elision is minimal and legible. At peak beats, the register stays coherent with her sensibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with strong verbs and image density that mostly propels rather than clogs. Occasional redundancy and stacked metaphor threads (light, innocence, moon, cracks) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure sense. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and sentences carry multiple jobs efficiently. Minor paraphrase echoes in the final third keep it out of the top band.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of “bargained innocence” with a cracked porcelain reliquary and communal enlightenment feels fresh and purposeful. The firefighter context and ash valley give it texture beyond abstract fable. Risks are taken in committing to a high-lyric mode without conventional conflict, largely paying off. Some imagery leans familiar, but the central object’s use is distinctive.</comment>
