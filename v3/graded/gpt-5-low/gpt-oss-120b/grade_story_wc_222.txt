<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lysander’s motives are clear and particular—amend a betrayal through a ritual that suits a “chivalrous thief.” Interiority is vivid (“cautious abandon,” breath coaxing gears) and actions align with ethos. However, internal contradiction is faint; he rarely hesitates or missteps, so pressure reveals little new about him. The vow to be a “bridge” feels earned but carries limited on‑page cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the patterned swaps, sundial chimes, and rising auroral wrongness build to a decisive melt and release of knowledge. Closure lands with a clear before/after—the curse breaks; he descends and recontextualizes the object in the village. Cost is mostly conceptual (taking on stewardship and public sharing) rather than felt peril, keeping it shy of top tier. Orientation is clean from the outset and the two‑shard structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire, violet sky, and tactile tools (sundial lid, carved pieces) saturate the scene and shape tactics (timing with “wrong” sky; melt‑water map evaporating at sunrise). Environment charges the final image as the spire warms and becomes a cascade. Details are filtered through Lysander’s craft and training, avoiding tourist catalog. World rules feel consistent and learned via action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are legible—lift the curse and access ancient knowledge—but opposition is soft and largely atmospheric. The ritual proceeds without reversal or concrete obstruction; each swap advances without friction beyond cold and time. There is a meaningful tightening at the final queen/king exchange, but little visible price paid. The ending’s warm release reads earned but low‑tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Resonance emerges through the reweighted sundial and the idea of “amending” as playful responsibility; motifs return with new meaning in the village scene. Some lines state theme too directly (“not merely theft…a bridge”; “wonder never sleeps”), which blunts subtext. The afterimage is gentle and credible rather than revelatory. Ambiguity is present but safe.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person closely tracks Lysander’s perceptions with consistent diction and rhythmic control. Patterned phrases (violet sky, humming lid) thread the piece without confusing stance. Compression feels purposeful; no head‑hopping or stance drift. A touch of purple remains, but clarity holds under pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines carry strong image density and momentum, with selective, concrete nouns (midnight velvet, rose‑gold queens). Occasional overrichness and repetition (“cautious abandon,” overt thematic statements) soften edge tension. Syntax varies and sequencing stays clear; no significant scaffold or loop artifacts. The prose’s musicality is a strength even if sometimes ornamental.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The method—chess pieces housing whispers, a sundial lid that sings when breathed upon—and the “sky is wrong” window feel fresh and integrated. The thief‑as‑restorer twist is handled with specificity rather than trope. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, yet they cohere. The turn to communal sharing via the object is a neat, non‑obvious reweighting.</comment>
