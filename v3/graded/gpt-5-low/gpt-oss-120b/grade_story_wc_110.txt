<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—illuminating truth rather than judging—is coherent and consistently enacted through concrete choices (following the doodles, using the lens, staging the projection). Interiority is lyric but thin on contradictory impulses; she rarely wavers or pays an on‑page personal price. The closing renunciation (“not to judge but to illuminate”) reads as earned but low‑friction. Strong presence, modest internal conflict.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions accrue from tickets → lens → backstage → public projection → dawn repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of the city’s discourse, with Mara’s role reframed. Cost is mostly conceptual (foregoing accusation‑based adjudication), not strongly dramatized. Orientation is clear and the pattern is taught early and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: rain, puddles, streetlamp, theater, and especially the forecourt and lens shape both method and final image. The environment supplies resources (phosphorescent ink, reflective puddles) that enable the truth‑projection tactic. Recurring objects (lens, tickets) charge the closing tableau. Sensory texture is balanced and POV‑filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (thawing mistrust), but pressure is gentle; obstacles scarcely resist. The meaningful tightening is the move from private decoding to public projection, yet it involves little trade‑off beyond implied exposure. Escalation is more tonal density than conflict. Earned, but soft.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of transparency vs. rumor coheres through concrete motifs (light/shadow, lens, reflections) and culminates in a communal, wordless confession. Some lines tip toward thesis statement (“honesty had freed them”) rather than letting subtext carry it. Still, the final image reweights prior material without didacticism dominating. Resonance lingers in the image of truth projected onto stone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent single‑POV lyric voice with controlled rhythm and vivid diction (“eavesdrop through ink,” “resonant hush”). No head‑hopping; psychic distance is steady and apt. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but remains coherent and character‑plausible for a registrar‑observer. Cadence modulates effectively toward the final hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is polished and image‑dense, with varied syntax and purposeful repetition. A few abstractions recur (“ambiguously clear”) and risk mild redundancy, but they are pattern‑taught and thematically aligned. No significant scaffold or confusion; momentum is maintained despite the lyric mode. Figurative logic remains consistent.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The conceit—using a salvaged lens to amplify the honesty of walls and puddles—is fresh and integrated. The doodle‑map → phosphorescent reading → projection chain feels original and inevitable within this world. Risk‑taking in tone and imagery pays off without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth is quieter than sharp, but distinctive.</comment>
