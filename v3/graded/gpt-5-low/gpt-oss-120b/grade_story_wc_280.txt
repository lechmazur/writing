<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent—the ghost seeks one final, meaningful encore—expressed through concrete actions (finding the coin, singing, amplifying echoes). Interiority is lyric but largely one-note longing; contradictory impulses or risk are minimal. The shopkeeper’s brief presence adds a human counterpoint but not substantial relational pressure. The final renunciation (letting the final echo drift) is gentle but earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the coin’s rule, the orchard’s response, and the echoes intensify toward a charged reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (theater → coin → orchard after hours), and causality reads as because/therefore within the fable logic. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration—the coin shifts to sunrise, the wish weaves the timeline, and the ghost’s peace has conceptual cost. The cost is soft but legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and multisensory (neon city, hedge maze, lantern-like apples, cinnamon air) and integrated with action (apples sing back; projected stage under the canopy). The orchard and coin charge the final image (apples falling like soft applause). Constraints are atmospheric rather than tactical; the maze and after-hours access lightly pressure choice. Specificity and tone remain consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mending the fractured timeline via performance—is clear and tightens through the act of singing and amplifying echoes. Escalation is primarily intensification; the key turn is the shopkeeper’s entrance and wish, which reweights the moment. Agency stems from the ghost’s performance choices, but visible price and opposition are light. Resolution feels earned within the fable logic, though conflict remains low-friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of art’s afterlife, renewal, and communal hope emerge organically through objects and echoes rather than direct exposition. The sunrise coin and apples-as-applause reweight prior images with tenderness. A faint moralizing chord (“every closed business could bloom anew”) trims complexity in the final paragraph. Overall resonance lingers, driven by image more than statement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent, controlled lyric third-person keeps a stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (synesthetic diction). Rhythm modulates well from hush to crescendo; no head-hopping or stance slips. No dialogue, but the voice carries subtext via image interplay. The lyric register is cohesive without drifting into self-consciously ornate abstraction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines are musical and dense without collapsing clarity; images often do double duty (apples as light and sound, applause as fruit). Some figurative stacking edges toward lush excess but largely stays legible and purposeful. Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum is maintained through syntactic variety. Final images are clean and sonically satisfying.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—stage ghost, tarot coin, hedge-maze orchard, synesthetic echoes mending time—feels fresh and internally coherent. Turns arise from established rules (coin activated by echoes; shopkeeper’s after-hours entry) rather than late conveniences. Emotional truth favors tenderness over twist. Not revolutionary, but confidently singular.</comment>
