<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Silas’s desire “to wavelength align with purpose” is clear, consistent, and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (decoding, turning the last coin). His interiority mixes doubt and conviction in a character‑specific way without therapy‑speak. The internal contradiction is present but mild; stakes remain largely conceptual. The shift at the end reads earned, though the felt cost is subtle rather than biting.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, taught by iterative static‑decoding and coin pops culminating in a cadence break (the final instruction and hum). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: purpose reframed as frequency with a charged final image (micro‑fracture, shared breath). Orientation is clean early; the single scene coheres. Cost is implied (risk/chaos warning, crack) rather than strongly dramatized, but sufficient for this mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ambered observatory, low gravity, and violet mist create a vivid, integrated environment filtered through Silas’s purpose. Recurring objects (coins, ambered glass) charge the final image (hairline crack, humming coins). While the setting rarely constrains tactics, it meaningfully colors perception and the closure image. Specificity stays purposeful without tour‑guide excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (achieve alignment) is signaled early and escalates through accumulating decoded pops to the instruction and decisive act. The tightening is primarily textural: density increases until it resolves into a single tone syncing with his heartbeat. The “double‑edged sword” warning and the glass crack hint at cost but don’t force a hard trade‑off. Tension remains internally coherent and grows, if gently, under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of purpose under entropy and listening backward emerge from particulars (coins, static memory, reversed prophecy) rather than thesis. The ending reweights the premise—purpose as frequency—without sermonizing, and the echoing universe offers a resonant answer. Subtext (risk of chaos, doubt as signal) deepens the aftertaste. Minor abstraction creep appears but is anchored by concrete beats.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A steady, lyrical third‑person close voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction is controlled and apt. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; psychic distance stays consistent. Some density risks purple, but rhythm and image selection remain legible. Elision patterns are taught by midpoint and pay off cleanly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry momentum with multi‑tasking images (pops/exhales, coins humming) and minimal scaffolding. There’s occasional figurative stacking and conceptual repetition (“doubt,” “alignment,” “ambered”) but they do not obscure causality or closure. Syntax varies and the final image lands crisply. A touch more restraint would heighten impact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—backwards prophecy via foreign coins decoded from static in a collapsing universe—feels fresh and coherently pursued. The pop‑to‑tone progression and purpose‑as‑frequency reframe elevate beyond trope. Risks (lyric density, high abstraction) mostly pay off. The piece reads as a singular vision rather than stitched convention.</comment>
