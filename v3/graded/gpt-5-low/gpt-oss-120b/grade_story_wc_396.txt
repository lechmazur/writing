<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (answering the shard’s call, “map empathy onto action”), and micro‑choices (seeking the van, using mirrors, aligning shards) align with her calmly intuitive nature. However, internal contradiction is minimal and she encounters little resistance, so change costs feel soft. The character reads specific and embodied, but her competence smooths over struggle. The final acceptance of listening as power lands but without a visible renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and actions accrete toward the reconstitution and steadier beam. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s breath syncing and the lighthouse’s rhythm steadying reweight the premise. Orientation is clean early (lighthouse orchard above ice, shard under pine, van of mirrors). Cost is implied more than felt, which trims the ceiling.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and mirrors shape imagery and the final charge (beam steadier, orchard greening). The environment and objects guide tactics (retrieving mirrors from the van, aligning under the lighthouse glow). Consistency in world rules is maintained through observation rather than exposition. Slightly more constraint from weather/ice on action could have elevated it further.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the shard/beam to guide the lost—is clear, and pressure coheres as she commits to the mirror method. Escalation is a gentle deepening (reflections/advice to alignment) rather than a true narrowing under risk. Little is foreclosed and opposition is absent; the price paid is mainly attention and resolve. The steadying of the beam reads earned but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Themes of empathy translated into action and shared breath emerge coherently from the process and final image. However, lines like “the true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen” verge on moral statement, reducing subtext. The mirrored futures and ice‑spirit council provide rich, suggestive subtext. Emotional aftereffect lingers more from image than from a hard moral calculus.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a lyrical cadence; diction and rhythm feel controlled and character‑specific (calm, intuitive noticing). No head‑hopping or stance slippage; inference reads as inference. Modulation at the end achieves a quiet, luminous cadence without overreach. Lack of dialogue is appropriate to the piece’s contemplative mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lush and largely precise, with purposeful imagery (“lantern casting a wavering glow,” “mirrors sighed”). Occasional abstraction/repetition (“map empathy onto action,” thematic restatements) softens momentum and edges toward purple in places. Syntax varies and carries the scene; information density is good without scaffolding bloat. Peak beats remain legible and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fusion of “lighthouse orchard,” vintage‑mirror reconstitution, and a shard’s breath syncing with a beacon is striking and memorable. The method (mirrors as stitchers of history) feels fresh and integrated, not ornamental. Emotional truth is gentler than risky, but the conceptual synthesis is original. A slightly greater cost or sharper turn would push it higher.</comment>
