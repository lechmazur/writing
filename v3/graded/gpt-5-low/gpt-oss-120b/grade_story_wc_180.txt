<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—bridging guild tradition with the orchard’s living memory—drives concrete choices (mending ribbon, then lenses). Interiority is grounded in tactile action rather than labels, though internal contradiction is mild; she rarely wrestles with doubt. The mother–daughter dynamic adds warmth and purpose but applies gentle, not pressuring, counterforce. The earned shift is credible but low-cost, leaning toward serenity over struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Ribbon snag → improvisational care → ritual mend provides a clean because/therefore chain within a lyric cadence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the breach reframed as purpose, with on‑page reconfiguration (the chime, sharpened world) though the cost is largely prior and soft. Orientation is crisp early; scope holds to a single scene with one tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The orchard‑cathedral is vivid and integral: filtered light and the orchard’s “pulse” explicitly shape the repair method and charge the finale. Specific objects (quartz lenses, stained glass, pine bench) are handled and repositioned to affect outcomes. Sensory selection is persuasive and POV‑filtered through a craftsperson’s eye. The final image of light through glass reweights setting into meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair lenses/bridge wisdom) is clear, with a modest tightening when the ribbon snag births the repair tactic. Pressure remains gentle; there’s minimal resistance or trade‑off beyond patience and care. Resolution depends on agency but without a palpable price or loss on the page. The escalation reads as deepening pattern rather than a hard narrowing.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Renewal and intergenerational transmission emerge organically via vows, repair craft, and teaching moments with Mira. The “deciduous vows” motif evolves from ambient whisper to operational ethic during the mend, then returns to seal the pact. A few lines verge on explicit moralizing, but most resonance rides image and action. The final repricing avoids sermonizing enough to linger.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent close third with lyric texture suits the piece; diction and rhythm are controlled and character‑specific. Brief dialogue feels natural and functional, letting subtext (instruction, reassurance) carry. The voice modulates with pressure without head‑hopping or register slips. Elision is minimal and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is rich and mostly disciplined; images do double duty in world and theme. Occasional density flirts with purple (“choir onto the cracked quartz”), but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Minimal scaffolding or loops; verbs and objects carry weight. The final cadence lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The quartz‑eye mender within a rooftop orchard‑cathedral feels fresh, and the repair ritual via forgotten tools is an inventive synthesis. The pivot from breach to vow‑bound purpose is non‑obvious yet grounded. Risk lies in a softened conflict profile, but the imaginative integration and charged objects offset that. The vision reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
