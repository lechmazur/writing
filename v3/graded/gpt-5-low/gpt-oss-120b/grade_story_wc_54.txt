<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Her motivation—resurrecting the terminal and reweighting it toward “hope”—is clear and consistent, and her engineering choices track. However, she meets minimal resistance; competence outweighs struggle, limiting interior contradiction. Interiority is often abstract (“ethical currents,” “maze of intentions”) rather than embodied under stress. The final stance shift reads earned but low-cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with accumulative/textural dominance: the pattern of redirected flows → schematic revelation → equations → beacon forms a coherent tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/incipient causal change: the terminal lights, windows open, and a beacon signals outward. The cost is conceptual rather than felt—no trade‑off or sacrifice—softening impact. Orientation is solid early; single scene holds cleanly.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is tactile and purposive: conduits, control panels, life-support bays, and boarding gates function as lived infrastructure she manipulates. The sextant as micro‑setting/tool charges the ending image and constrains tactics (angle, alignment, voltage). Sensory focus is selective and filtered through an engineer’s gaze. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival) is signaled early, and escalation occurs via system reactivation, but pressure remains gentle; success arrives without a visible price or serious narrowing of options. The schematic “maze” hints at ethical stakes yet doesn’t force a trade‑off on the page. The beacon activation is a satisfying beat but not contested. Tension is more contemplative cadence shift than conflict.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—engineering as ethical re‑navigation of abandoned systems—emerges through concrete acts (redirected flows) and charged objects (sextant) and culminates in the beacon. Some lines verge on direct statement (“to resurrect hope she must puzzle out new equations”), diluting subtext. Still, the spiral/curve at the end reweights prior motifs without moralizing. The transformation of carnival’s ephemera into infrastructure resonates.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective engineer’s sensibility; focalization stays steady. Diction occasionally lifts into abstraction but remains legible and patterned. No dialogue appears, and the narrative certainty fits what she can observe. Rhythm supports the accumulative design, with a composed cadence into closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines carry momentum with generally strong verbs and purposeful detail; information density is good. There’s some purple tint and motif repetition (“maze of intentions,” “redirected flows”) that edges toward redundancy. A few abstractions stack without fresh image, but clarity survives. Final images (windows opening, beacon, spiral) land cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—carnival aftermath, spaceport carcass, a nautical sextant repurposed for electrical flow ethics—is fresh and coherent. The method (hydro principles applied to crowd/power systems) feels inventive. Risk lies in a high‑concept, low‑friction arc; it mostly pays off through image rather than conflict. Memorable final reweighting avoids genre cliché.</comment>
