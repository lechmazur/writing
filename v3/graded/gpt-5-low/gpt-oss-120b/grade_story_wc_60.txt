<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (liberate memories) is clear and consistent, and micro‑choices (tracing symbols, whispering names, the patient twist) align with her luminous skepticism. The interior contradiction—skepticism softened by belief—registers but remains gentle. Pressure rarely forces a painful trade‑off; the box resists, but she succeeds without visible sacrifice. Still, her embodied attention and ritual actions reveal character credibly at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumb symbols, geese‑pause, and the box’s resistance build to the opening and the city’s exhale. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (memories freed; fountains reawaken) and a conceptual repricing of belief. Cost is light—patience and doubt yield without a concrete loss—which keeps it short of the highest band. Orientation is clean early, and the single‑scene structure is coherent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The city is vividly realized (moss‑draped alleys, petrichor, fountain stones etched with symbols) and directly constrains tactics (the trail exists only on the fountains; the pedestal). The geese constellation and reawakened fountains charge the final image. Detail selection stays purposeful and POV‑filtered rather than touristic. Rich atmosphere supports the theme without static description.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free the memories—tightens through the symbol‑trail and the hinge “sticking,” culminating in the careful unstick. Escalation is present but soft; failure consequences remain abstract, and the resistance never credibly threatens to stop her. Agency drives the turn, but the felt price is modest. The cadence shift at the opening beat works, if without a hard foreclosure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Belief tempered by patient defiance emerges organically through ritual action and the geese‑pause as temporal key. The final image of liberated lights forming constellations reweights earlier motifs with hope. A line like “even a skeptic can become a keeper of light” edges toward thematic articulation rather than leaving it fully in image. Overall resonance is strong, if slightly declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person close is stable, with controlled diction and imagistic cadence that fits Mara’s sensibility. No dialogue intrudes; narrative certainty matches what she perceives. Occasional elevated phrasing risks purple but remains legible and voice‑motivated. Rhythm modulates well at the climax.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is lush and largely precise, with vivid images doing multiple jobs. Some repetition (“defiant hush,” “sidereal patience,” “unstick”) and stacked modifiers nudge toward over‑ornament. Momentum holds, and syntax varies, but a mild purple sheen softens pressure in peak beats. Clarity remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The geese‑pause as a temporal key, stained‑glass memory box, and breadcrumb symbols create a distinctive synthesis. The final geese‑constellation reprise feels earned and memorable. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, but the vision holds together with integrity. Emotional truth is quieter than the imagery yet present.</comment>
