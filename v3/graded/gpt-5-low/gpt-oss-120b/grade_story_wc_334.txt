<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear drive (recover the village’s memories) and embodied perception anchor her, but internal contradiction is minimal and she meets little resistance. Competence dominates—she reads wreck‑constellations, finds the sextant, aligns the ring—without a meaningful cost to complicate her choices. The curiosity trait motivates action credibly. A stronger felt trade‑off at the peak would deepen character.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning causal: tracing broken constellations → sextant confirmation → arranging caps → water recedes/memories return. Closure is on‑page and legible, but the price paid is soft; the solution arrives without a tested sacrifice or foreclosed option. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene arc holds. A sharper cost or constraint at the climax would elevate.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integral: the shipwreck ring and greenhouse directly shape method and outcome (constellation mapping, sextant, fairy ring alignment). Sensory texture is strong across brine, amber light, kelp, rust, and damp soil. The environment charges the final image (water receding, saplings revealed). World rules feel consistent within the fable logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (restore collective memory), but pressure rises gently; solutions meet little pushback. The meaningful deepening (sextant shards reflect the mushroom constellation) shifts options yet doesn’t close off an alternative. Resolution is protagonist‑driven but consequence costs remain abstract. One concrete loss or risk would strengthen escalation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Recurring images (broken constellations, fairy ring, sea that takes/returns) braid an argument about memory and ritual. However, the line “When habits break…” reads as thesis‑forward and appears twice, edging into overt moralizing. The final “crisp nostalgia” image lands emotionally. More subtext, fewer stated insights, would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct, consistent lyric POV—precise sensory bias and mythic lexicon—without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well; certainty stays within what she perceives. No dialogue to test, but narrative stance is confident and apt. Occasional aphoristic lines slightly flatten the otherwise rich voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Image density is high yet mostly purposeful; lines often carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, action, theme). Minor repetition (“When habits break…”) and a few lush clusters flirt with purple but do not obscure causality. Syntax varies and momentum holds through discovery to act. Final image is clear and un-muddled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: shipwreck‑constellation cartography + fairy‑ring memory vault + greenhouse orchard is striking and coherent. Turns feel earned by prior particulars (sextant/mushroom reflection). The ease of victory slightly tempers ingenuity’s impact on tension, but the imaginative integration stands out. Conceptual risk pays off without gimmickry.</comment>
