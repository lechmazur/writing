<question>1</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Clear motive (“to learn the rhythm of repair”) and several micro-choices (following the glow, uncapping the box, whispering the prophecy, placing the gear) track cleanly. Interiority is textured but largely tonal; contradictory impulses and real internal friction are minimal. Embodied feeling appears (“breath as heavy as fog,” “heart heavy with driftwood nostalgia”) but the emotional cost remains soft. The ending suggests endurance/mission more than a conflicted renunciation.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: discovery → guidance by prophecy → unlocking → assembly → insertion → sunrise. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (time resumes, inner rhythm steadies). Causality is fable-logic but consistent, with no teleports or dropped setups. Cost is modest yet legible through sustained burden and mission-continuance rather than sacrifice.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen library, singing crystal volumes, and the hall of mirrors are vivid and purposeful, shaping options and charging the final image. Objects-as-setting (silver box, filament key, pedestal, gear) meaningfully constrain action. Sensory detail is lush but generally controlled and POV-filtered by a craftsman’s priorities. World rules feel stable within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pressure rises via density and cadence: the glow, the mirrored chamber, the unlocking, the ripple into a temporal corridor. Stakes (repairing time/learning its rhythm) stay coherent but the opposition is gentle; risk and trade-off remain abstract. The key tightening is the unlocking/engagement that triggers the hall’s transformation. The price reads as ongoing duty and solitude more than acute loss.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Repair, reflection, and time’s pulse braid cleanly; the hall’s mirrors literalize self/era multiplicity, then reweight as he assembles and restores. The sunrise and steadying heartbeat offer an earned, non-propositional answer about mending and continuance. Minimal moralizing; resonance arises from image and action. Ambiguity persists productively in the cost of becoming a perpetual mender.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (craft-focused noticing, elemental metaphors) remains steady. Rhythm modulates well at key beats (the box sigh opening; the ripple and chime). No head-hopping or stance drift; elisions feel purposeful. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mythic register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; images work in concert (frost, mirrors, heartbeat, glow). Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains coherent and clear. Repetitions (“hauntingly bright”) are purposeful echoes rather than loops. Syntax varies and supports momentum through the unlocking-to-chime sequence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lunar‑eclipse locksmith, filament key from moon-shadow, and hall-of-mirrors mechanics feel freshly synthesized. Turns arise from the established logic rather than late rule changes. The final reconfiguration (restored clock/sunrise/inner pulse) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
