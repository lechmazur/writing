<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (to seal starlight and render heartbeats as maps) and embodied practice (slow, glacier-like placements) ground her actions. Internal contradiction is light; the piece favors serenity over friction, so pressure on her values is minimal. The covenant to keep tending the seal provides an earned endurance/cost. A stronger on-page competing impulse would raise the score.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual detail builds to the flare, binding, and a covenant that reweights the scene. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she binds herself to seasonal tending, with the felt price of ongoing devotion. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the linkage of beats is coherent. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subarctic crater orchard is vivid and sensorially specific, integrated into action (frost-kissed roots, ash mound, bark creaking). The plate and debris act as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. The environment influences tone and covenant more than it constrains tactics moment-to-moment, limiting 9+ eligibility. Still, atmosphere is richly sustained without static postcarding.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will she successfully seal and commit to its upkeep) is present and coherently deepens through the ritual to the vow. Escalation is subtle under the accumulative lens: the flare and cascade of light intensify the commitment rather than narrow options sharply. The cost—ongoing tending—lands, but there’s little on-page resistance or loss beyond endurance. One decisive tightening rather than a turn keeps this just under the high band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of patience, care-as-covenant, and mapping love/loss emerge through process and image (light veining the debris as routes). The final covenant realization coheres with prior particulars, but a line like “not a task but a covenant” edges toward stated thesis. Emotional aftereffect is tender and reflective without mawkishness. Greater reliance on implication over explicit naming would heighten resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrical single-POV voice with strong rhythmic control and tactile noticing; no head-hopping or stance drift. Repetition patterns (heartbeat, breath, moving stillness) feel intentional and are taught early. A touch of sameness in cadence and diction slightly blunts peak modulation. Overall, confident and apt for the piece’s aims.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished and image-rich, but there’s mild overwriting and motif redundancy (“moving stillness,” “heartbeat,” “patience”) that create small loops. Most sentences carry multiple jobs, yet several adjacent lines restate outcomes in similar registers. Rhythm is pleasing but can become uniform. Clipping a few repeated phrases would improve propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—flash-paper alchemy, safekept starlight, an orchard in a crater—feels distinctive and cohesive. The ritual-mapping of heartbeats into luminous cartography is a fresh conceptual turn. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural and mostly pay off. Slight comfort-zone safety in conflict keeps it from the very top.</comment>
