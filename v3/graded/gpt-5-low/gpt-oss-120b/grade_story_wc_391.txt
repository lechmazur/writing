<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara’s motive—to “sculpt patience from impatience”—is clear and consistently embodied in choices (waiting, tracking, aligning the compass). Interiority is specific and textured through sensory data rather than labels. Contradictory impulses (restrained wildness vs. calm purpose) are present but lightly dramatized. The change at the end reads earned, though the cost remains subtle and interior rather than sharply tested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating at the moon’s apex and the viaduct’s surge. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she “unyokes the rush,” with the crack of release as on‑page cost. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres. The because/therefore chain is minimal, but the cadence shift and final reweighting are firm.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and viaduct are vividly specific and integrated with action (moonlight through arches, vibrations through ice). Environment directly charges the final image (edge of ice/water, the crack) and constrains options (cold, timing, surface). Details feel filtered through Elara’s vocation and aim. Sensory balance leans visual/aural with tactile pulses, achieving strong atmosphere without tourist listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can she earn patience through methodical attention) tightens toward the moon’s apex. The low hum and compass alignment provide the decisive intensification; the “crack of release” marks cost and shift. Pressure is coherent but remains mostly interior and gentle, limiting the felt risk. Still, the escalation reads purposeful and culminates in a stance change.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme coheres—waiting as revolution—and recurs through objects and images (moon paths, viaduct pulse). However, occasional thesis-forward lines (“the patient revolution was not a battle…”) verge on telling. The final mantra is evocative but slightly didactic. Subtext still blooms in the closing image of ice releasing and breath untying.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture aligned with Elara’s observational bias. Rhythm modulates with the apex surge and softens at closure. No head-hopping or unjustified certainty beyond her perception. Elevated diction feels consistent with the piece’s lyric mode.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentences are musical and dense with imagery, generally precise. There is mild purpleing and repetition (“patient”/“restless” motifs) that risk redundancy without serious opacity. Momentum holds, and most lines carry multiple jobs (world, mood, theme). Minor tightening could heighten propulsion at the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct, moon-path method, and “patient revolution” synthesize into a distinctive vision. The worldbuilding feels singular rather than templated, with fresh image-systems (magnetic tide, charged arches). The closing release recontextualizes prior motifs without gimmickry. Risk is quiet but confident and lands cleanly.</comment>
