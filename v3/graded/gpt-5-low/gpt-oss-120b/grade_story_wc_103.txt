<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to design a maze that dissolves memory and moment—is clear and sustained, and her occupational lens grounds her perceptions. However, interior conflict is minimal; being “retrocognitively trapped” colors worldview but doesn’t force a hard trade-off on the page. Most turns occur around her rather than because of a pressured choice she makes. The felt cost to her is soft, mainly an awakening rather than a sacrifice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece layers images (halo fragment, hyperbolic corridors, fading photographs) until the dusk closure reweights meaning. The ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the maze completes, photographs vanish, and time’s “texture” is felt. Cost is present but conceptual—loss of photographs as they dissolve—which keeps the closure effective but gentle. Orientation is steady early: who/where/what is legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden and hyperbolic hedges are vividly specific, tactile, and integrated with action (vines sensing weight, light refracting to bend paths). Environment charges the final image (the garden glowing, fragment humming) and repeatedly mediates events. Rules feel consistent and are learned through observation and use rather than exposition. Minor cap only avoided because setting actively shapes beats, not just mood.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear—realizing a maze that dissolves static perception—and escalation is a density increase: mist, photographs, refracting light, the child’s pause, then completion at dusk. The child-triggered new arch provides the main pressure uptick, but the price and foreclosed alternatives remain light. Agency is partially externalized to the garden; Mara’s decisions drive design but not a decisive, costly turn. Tension stays lyrical rather than tightening around a hard choice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Time’s texture, loss/renewal, and perception’s mutability emerge through recurring particulars (fading photographs dissolving into threads; Möbius-like loops; the final glow). A few explicit statements (“the maze’s purpose was not a puzzle…”) slightly over-articulate the thesis. The last image reweights prior material without a moral, leaving a resonant aftertaste. Subtext hums in the exchange between loss (vanishing photos) and creation (new arch).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person close with a disciplined, luminous diction suits the subject and stays stable. The perceptual signature is distinct—technical yet organic (hyperbolic geometry, living sine waves)—and modulation toward dusk is controlled. No dialogue, but the voice carries action through image and cadence. Elevated lexicon fits the character’s vocation and the story’s design.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are lush and purposeful, with high image density supporting the accumulative mode. However, occasional overwriting and a noticeable error (“only by disintegrate the static walls”) nick polish, and a few near-synonymous intensifiers could be tightened. Rhythm mostly propels, especially around the child and the dusk closure. Clarity holds despite lyricism.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—living bridge, halo fragment encoding geometry, hyperbolic maze that responds to heartbeat and memory—feels fresh and coherent. The Möbius/hyperbolic turn that loops past and future into a seamless arch is an elegant, non-obvious culmination. Emotional cost is modest, preventing a higher tier, but the conceptual ingenuity is strong. Risks in style and world logic pay off without obscuring sense.</comment>
