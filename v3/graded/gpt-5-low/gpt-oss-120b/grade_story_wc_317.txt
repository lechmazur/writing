<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (to build a living puzzle and “safeguard space for innovation”) is clear and consistent, and her micro‑choices (placing the seed, designing vents, tying riddles to airflow) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; she moves from curiosity to execution without resistance or contradictory impulses. The awe at the bloom lands, but the character cost remains thin.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orientation and sequence are clean: envelope → seed → design → participants solve → airflow → bloom. Closure occurs on‑page with the bloom and a conceptual reweighting of her design ethos, but the cost at the ending is soft (no concrete sacrifice, only a stated understanding). The piece reads Hybrid with a causal spine and an accumulative atmospheric lift; lens holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rainy town, brook, amber shed, and vented panels create a textured, coherent space. Crucially, the setting’s mechanics (hidden vents, rotating panels) shape action and enable the bloom, charging the final image. Sensory integration across sight, scent, and sound is excellent without museum‑tour listing.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (will the seed bloom via designed riddles/airflow) is clear, and escalation occurs as ciphers click toward the gust. Yet pressure is low and largely procedural, with little narrowing trade‑off or visible price; success arrives smoothly once puzzles are solved. The lack of a concrete cost keeps tension modest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thematic throughlines—innovation needing permeability, stories as water, orthogonal paths—are coherent and reprise in the final reflection. However, the explicit moralizing (“She understood that safeguarding space…”) blunts subtext and trades resonance for statement. The final image is lovely but lightly earned in terms of thematic cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person voice sustains mood and maintains a steady psychic distance suitable for a fable‑like piece. Diction and rhythm are consistent and confident without head‑hopping or stance slippage. Elevated phrasing fits the tone and avoids register shocks.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and mostly precise, with strong image economy (“windows breathing light,” “orthogonal approaches”). Some purple drift and echoing constructions (“storm‑born silence,” abstractions like “soft thrum of potential”) slightly dilute momentum. Clarity holds at the climax and closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>An escape room engineered as a breathing garden for a corpse flower is an ingenious synthesis; the orthogonal airflow mechanic is fresh. The mail‑mystery seed and story‑watering legend feel original yet coherent. Emotional risk is gentler than the conceptual risk, limiting the ceiling.</comment>
