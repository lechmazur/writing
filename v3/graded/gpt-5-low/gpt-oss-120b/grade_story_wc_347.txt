<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (a reluctant caretaker honoring a bargain to guide travelers) and embodied emotion (“bitter sweetness that settles like ash”) give specificity. The internal contradiction—reluctance versus duty—threads choices from assembling clues to placing the nut. Micro‑choices under pressure are present (timing against frost, methodical reed work, the final placement, and retreat). Slight distance from deeper personal cost (beyond duty and ash) keeps it shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands on the page with cost: the act completes, light blooms, travelers escape, and the orchard remains cursed—an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise that reweights the premise. The clock (before frost) and birds’ vigilance tighten cadence into the stump placement. The final renunciation (retreat; role done yet demanded again) makes the before/after legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, frost, altar of roots, and mechanical birds aren’t ornamental; they constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory and procedural details (reed in the wind, amber eyes, frost’s retreat) are purposeful and filtered through the caretaker’s task. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action. The setting decisively shapes the outcome and tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide travelers before frost locks the nut) is clear and escalates via time pressure and the birds’ circling. The meaningful tightening is the approach to the stump under a ticking clock, culminating in placement. Cost is present but primarily conceptual and ongoing (the orchard remains cursed; role cycles). A sharper on‑page risk to the protagonist in the peak moment could have heightened pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Redemption as wound, usefulness without cure, and the ethics of duty under curse emerge organically from acts and images. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing: beauty that is “graceless,” a light that helps others while the orchard remains blighted. Motifs (nut/blueprint/reed/birds/frost) accrue meaning rather than being declared. Slightly more friction between saving travelers and sustaining the curse might have deepened the ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent single‑POV distance; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (humming birds, frost clock, breath at the stump). Patterned elision is taught early and paid off in the blueprint reveal. No dialogue needed; narrative certainty stays within what the focalizer can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do multiple jobs. Lyricism rarely tips into purple, and repetition supports pattern rather than padding. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax varies and serves momentum toward the altar beat. A few abstract labels (“graceless beauty”) recur, but cadence and specificity keep clarity intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Mechanical birds, a blueprint hidden in a nut, and reed‑drawn wind impressions synthesize into an original, coherent vision. The final reweighting (saving travelers without lifting the curse) feels inevitable and distinct. Risks in premise and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids genre default moves and reads singular.</comment>
