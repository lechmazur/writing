<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motivation is clear and consistent—decode the shell’s language to save a stalled city—and her choices (decoding, following the passage, initiating contact) align with that drive. Interiority is present through tactile ritual (the whistle) and professional lens (spirals/patterns), but contradiction and felt cost are muted. She solves problems with relative ease, limiting struggle. The final renunciation/shift is credible but emotionally smooth rather than hard-won.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: pattern study → mosaic crack → noon passage → light‑answer → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the expedition is the pattern; Mira vows to carry it forward). Orientation is clean, and setups pay off (whistle, noon light, watchers). Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The setting is vivid and integrated: city-on-turtles, rusted gate, noon‑triggered passage, and the whistle’s acoustics shape action. Environmental rules emerge via use, not exposition, and the world’s logic is consistent. Objects (whistle, mosaic) function as micro‑settings that constrain options. Rich sensory specificity supports tone without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avoid fossilization by contacting watchers) is legible and tightens once through the mosaic/hidden passage. Escalation is primarily deepening of pattern density rather than hard external resistance; the “price” remains abstract. Mira’s agency drives each turn, but no live option feels meaningfully foreclosed beyond a worldview shift. Tension reads steady, not acute.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of listening versus calcification emerges organically through pattern languages, the rusted gate, and the watchers’ light. The ending reframes the expedition and the city’s flaw without sermonizing; the final vow resonates. Slight tidiness—sunwashed dread dissolving into resolve—reduces ambiguity’s sting. Subtext hums in the ritual whistle and the charged act of closing the mosaic.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A controlled, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (spirals, ridges, fractals) stays consistent. Diction and rhythm fit the character’s cartographic mind and modulate under pressure without head‑hopping. Purposeful elision works with the accumulative design. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and momentum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, strong verbs, and purposeful images (“language of fracture,” “sunwashed dread”). A few purple flourishes verge on saturation, but coherence holds and propulsion remains. No scaffold loops or cadence templates drag momentum. The final image is clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—turtle‑city cartography, pattern languages, mosaic crack as code, watchers speaking in light—is fresh and coherent. Turns feel earned by prior particulars; nothing reads like a late rule patch. Risk‑taking is evident in the conceptual closure instead of a literal confrontation. The only limiting factor is the low‑friction path to understanding, which tempers awe with comfort.</comment>
