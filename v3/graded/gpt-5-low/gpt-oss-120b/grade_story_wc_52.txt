<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—“to harvest lessons from loss”—is clear and embodied through the carving and sealing of sap. Her actions align with an internal endurance arc and culminate in an earned acceptance. Interior contradiction is subtle (reverence vs. utility) rather than deeply dramatized, keeping the pressure gentle. Still, micro‑choices (glass pressed, lantern placed, leaving the loft) reveal values credibly under quiet strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The process of carving, alchemical sealing, and the kettle’s clock builds toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she reconfigures grief into a lantern and carries it out. Orientation is clean early; cause→effect is lyrical but coherent. Cost is conceptual—renouncing the roar for a quieter tool—felt in the final acts of placement and departure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rain‑beaded skylight, kettle steam, ash grain, and iron stove are vivid and POV‑filtered. The environment charges the ending image and subtly guides tactics (steam heat, pane of glass, hearth placement). Sensory economy stays purposeful, with recurring glass/amber motifs reweighted at closure. A touch more constraint from the loft itself could have pushed it higher.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stake: transform grief into a usable form. Pressure tightens through the on‑page making: discovering sap, choosing to press glass, and creating the lantern, with a cadence shift as she leaves. The cost is acceptance over spectacle—“loss can be a tool”—and foreclosing the roar’s performative past. Escalation is quiet but clear for the accumulative mode.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—utility coexisting with reverence; grief as here‑and‑gone—emerges through image systems (steam, glass, amber). The final images resonate, but the explicit aphorism “loss can be a tool, not a trap” edges into moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. Otherwise, insight feels earned by the concrete making. The lantern as reweighted object effectively answers the story’s question without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person closely tracks Mara’s perceptions with consistent diction and cadence. Recurring motifs give the voice a coherent texture; no head‑hopping or stance drift. A few intensifiers repeat (rust‑hued, glow) but do not blur control. Rhythm modulates well from making to release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line craft is polished, with images doing multiple jobs (steam as time, glass as containment, amber as memory). Occasional purple lean and reiterations (“rust‑hued peace,” “glow”) slightly thicken the texture without derailing clarity. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the process beats. No significant loops or muddled metaphors at the peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The circus‑world widow transmuting grief via sap crystallization and kettle steam feels fresh and integrated. The alchemical‑practical blend (“hauntingly practical”) is distinctive without gimmickry. The ending synthesis—lantern as quieted roar—lands as specific and memorable. Risk is purposeful and coherent.</comment>
