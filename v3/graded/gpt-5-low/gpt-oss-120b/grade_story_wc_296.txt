<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (guard and unseal the confession) and consistent with “warlike serenity,” and her micro-choices (stepping into the vortex, modulating the seed’s hunger, sealing it in the amulet) align. Internal contradiction is present but lightly dramatized; she rarely struggles on the page. Competence slightly smooths pressure, limiting felt cost. Still, actions reveal character under a coherent value hierarchy.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: ritual rings, shards, and the seed’s hunger build to a resonant reconfiguration as the lake’s reflection changes and the truth is sealed. Causality is legible (chant → melting → shards → seed reweighted → amulet seal), and closure lands on the page. Cost is mostly conceptual—accepting guardianship and redirecting a dangerous tool—rather than sharply felt. Orientation is clear early; single‑scene integrity holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cursed lake/orchard vortex is vivid and functionally integrated: it dictates the method (rune-lit concentric rings) and charges the final reflective image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the druid’s priorities. The environment constrains and enables her tactics, not just decorates them. The final mirror reweights the setting with thematic consequence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (recover and safeguard a dangerous truth), and escalation arrives through the ritual’s intensification and the seed’s hungry pulse. However, jeopardy is modest and there’s no strong reversal; the seed’s threat is contained swiftly. The tightening is sufficient but not bracing. Resolution is earned by her choices rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mirrors/hidden truth and warlike serenity recur and evolve, culminating in a lake that “reflects … the truths beneath.” One line states theme overtly (“mirrors never show…”), but most resonance arises from action and image. The final binding of confession to a “living heart” reframes truth as something guarded, not displayed. Thematic aftertaste is coherent and avoids didactic closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction fits the mythic register and stays stable. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure during the chant and the cadence softens at closure. No head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Occasional lushness skirts purple but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are vivid with strong verbs and concrete images; momentum generally holds. Figurative density is high (“cape collapses like a wounded bird,” “silver birds,” “calm blade”) but coherent, with minor repetition (“warlike serenity,” mirrors). Minimal scaffold or loops, and sequence clarity stays intact. The lushness occasionally blurs edge tension, slightly dulling urgency.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: a memory‑eating seed redirected to feed on truth, an orchard vortex, and a frozen confession melted by rune‑rings. The final reweighting of reflection is non‑obvious yet earned. Risks in imagery and concept mostly pay off without gimmickry. Emotional stakes could cut deeper, but the vision is distinctive.</comment>
