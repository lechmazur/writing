<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Nara’s pacifist motivation is clear and governs tactics (stitching with compassion, refusal of force), and her micro-choices (aligning intention, leveraging joy to float, placing the crystal) arise organically. The embodied tension between carrying universal sorrow (“cold pressure on her back”) and forcing a smile to work is specific and felt. Internal contradiction is modest—she rarely falters—so struggle reads muted. The final renunciation/step-through is earned but light on visible personal loss beyond leaving the ship’s ghosts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: stitching passes intensify until the seam “cracked like a sunrise,” a decisive on‑page change. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the pattern taught (lyric ritual escalating) pays off with a concrete gate opening. Cost is legible in the burden of sorrows and the ship left empty; the final placement of the crystal seals a before/after. Minor softness in tactical jeopardy prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The recycled star‑drifter is vivid and purposeful—the humming patched hull, rusted corridors, and sighing metal filter through Nara’s task and mood. Environment and object-as-setting (the crystal) constrain action: she must float in low‑gravity joy to reach and stitch the seam within the ship’s confines. The final shift to the garden recharges earlier images and stakes without disorientation. Sensory detail is selective and thematic rather than touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes (unlock a realm of healing through compassion) are clear and escalate via density and cadence rather than reversals: intention aligns, shimmer intensifies, seam trembles, vow catalyzes the crack. Agency drives resolution—no force, only stitching and the vow—but opposition is largely atmospheric (sorrow pressure) and rarely bites back. The cost is felt but gentle; options don’t narrow sharply beyond the ritual working. Still, the single meaningful tightening lands.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Compassion versus force, grief transformed into beginnings, and the ethics of pacifist action are integrated through repeated concrete acts (stitching as shadow work, joy altering gravity). The final image (crystal placed, door no longer required) offers a resonant answer without sermonizing. A few lines approach statement (“no force, only compassion”) but are dramatized enough to avoid moralizing drag. Thematic complexity lingers through the cost of leaving ghosts for a new garden.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The third‑person close, lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and character‑filtered; imagery choices fit Nara’s gentle resolve. Rhythm modulates well at the climax, with brighter cadence as the seam opens and a quieting at the garden. No head‑hopping or register glitches. The diction feels earned and specific to this contemplative, ritualized scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with purposeful metaphors (“cracked like a sunrise,” “mournful fireflies”) and clean sequencing. A high density of figurative language skirts purple in places but does not blur sense or momentum. Minimal redundancy and healthy sentence variety sustain flow. The final image is clear and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—pacifist stitching reality with Kwan Yin’s tear, joy as literal buoyancy, a derelict ship yielding to a newborn garden—feels fresh and coherent. Turns arise from established ritual rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth (working with grief, not erasing it) grounds the high concept. Risk is confident and legible without gimmickry.</comment>
