<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clear, competence‑forward motivation and tactically grounded actions (mapping, measuring, heading for the tower) read true. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely errs or wrestles with competing impulses. The “weight of responsibility” lands late without a visible cost earlier to earn it. Strong object reactions (patch, anemometer) reveal method more than psychological pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single‑scene accumulative build from measurement to release is coherent, with orientation locked early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the vortex sighs and the city’s hum returns; the patch’s reprise helps seal it. Cost is soft—resolution comes smoothly once the vector is identified—so the ending feels more graceful than hard‑won. Still, the because/therefore of the accumulative pattern holds.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The port’s container labyrinth is tactile and functional: canyons channel wind, altering readings and tactics. Tools (anemometer, tarp) and the compass patch work as micro‑settings charging the final image. Sensory texture aligns with Mara’s professional filter without tourist cataloging. World rules (wind behavior) are learned through action, not expository dumps.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—neutralize lingering storm energy—stays coherent, but pressure rarely tightens. The curve pointing to the tower is a meaningful deepening; after that, resistance is minimal and the release happens almost at a whisper. Options don’t visibly narrow, and no trade‑off or loss alters tactics. The result is lovely but low‑friction.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Foresight, guidance, and human‑machine/nature alignment emerge through particulars (patch/compass, airflow mapping) rather than sermonizing. The final image reweights the motif—measured breath, guided currents—without a neat moral. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection on stewardship. Slight recurrence literalness (“singular convergence”) keeps it from a higher band.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Consistent close third with a controlled, airy lyricism that suits the material. Diction is steady; metaphors (ghosts, hum, sigh) are coherent and not overmixed. No head‑hopping or stance wobble; inference stays within what Mara can plausibly know. Minor risk of monotone haze avoided by clean, concrete tool use.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines are clear, rhythmic, and mostly economical; images often do double duty. A few intensifiers and repeated constructs (“hazy precision,” “singular convergence”) flirt with redundancy but don’t stall momentum. Figurative language remains consistent with airflow and machinery; no mixed‑vehicle muddle. Syntax varies enough to keep propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Wind‑forensics in a container maze with a talismanic flight patch feels fresh and integrated. The quiet, accumulative release resists familiar crisis beats without gimmickry. Emotional risk is modest—competence and calm prevail—limiting the sense of discovery at the peak. Still, the synthesis of method, setting, and motif is distinctive.</comment>
