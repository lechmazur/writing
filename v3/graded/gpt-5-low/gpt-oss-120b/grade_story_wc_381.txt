<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained—she comes to hush a coded prophecy—but interior contradiction is minimal and stress scarcely degrades perception. Micro‑choices (aligning the wing with the brook, breath control) reveal focus but not conflict. Emotional texture is mostly awe and purpose, with little visible cost. The endurance at the end feels earned but risk‑light.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single continuous scene with clear causality under an accumulative/textural lens: ritual steps build to sealing the prophecy. Closure lands on the page as the brook slows and the code is contained; the celestial‑terrestrial binding completes. Cost is implied (secrecy/endurance), not sharply dramatized. Orientation is strong from the start; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly realized across senses; the brook, lantern, fireflies, and stone are integrated into action (alignment, reflection, “river of stars”). The environment subtly shapes choices (placing the wing, using water’s edge) and charges the final image. World rules feel consistent through observed effects rather than exposition. Slight bias toward beauty over constraint keeps it just below top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and the pressure coheres, but escalation is gentle: thrumming → glyphs → lattice → sealing. There’s one clear deepening (the wing emitting glyphs and forming a lattice), with the brook’s slowed flow as confirmation. Opposition or trade‑off is minimal, so cost remains soft. Agency drives resolution, but risk feels managed.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of enforced quiet, secrecy versus revelation, and binding earth to sky accrue through concrete motifs (origami wing, mapping silence, river of stars). The ending reweights earlier images without sermonizing: hush as earned stasis and living flame. Ambiguity lingers about the moral cost of keeping knowledge sealed, which enriches resonance. Slight neatness keeps it shy of higher tiers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent, confident lyric POV with controlled diction and a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well from invocation to sealing, though it flirts with purple in stacked luminous descriptors. No head‑hopping or stance drift. Compression is purposeful and legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lines are musical and image‑dense, often doing double duty, with clean syntax and momentum. There is mild repetition (“hush,” “quiet,” “glow,” “luminous”) and occasional near‑redundancy that could be pared. Figurative language remains coherent; no mixed metaphors muddle sense. Final images land crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>“Mapping silence” via an origami crane wing as a terrestrially cosmic conduit feels fresh and specific. The ritual fantasy frame is familiar, but the synthesis of hush as cartography and the river‑of‑stars payoff elevates it. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; clarity holds. A sharper price would push it higher.</comment>
