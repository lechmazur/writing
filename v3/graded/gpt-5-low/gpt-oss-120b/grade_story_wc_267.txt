<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bellhop’s choices (remaining at the staircase, selecting and placing the bolt) are concrete and motivated, and the guests’ desire “to understand the cost of safety” is clear. However, interiority is largely generalized; we rarely inhabit a single mind under pressure. Contradictory impulses are implied (safety vs. fracture/hope) but not dramatized in embodied, character‑specific terms. The earned renunciation at the end reads more collective than personal, blunting micro‑choice complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: the bolt’s offering triggers the staircase’s color shift, reweighting “safety = silence” with a felt price, and later the guests emerge changed. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard transition (“Later…”) pays off the pressure set earlier. Cost is legible in the acceptance of silence as the condition for safety, charged by the final monument‑like image of the bolt.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow, the frost, the dusty spiral stair, and the bolt are vividly and economically rendered. The environment subtly constrains options (cold, ice walls, and the fortress’s “signal” via discoloration) and charges the closing image. Sensory specificity balances mood without devolving into a tourist catalog. The world’s rules are learned through observation/action rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—what safety costs—is established early and deepens as the bolt prompts the fortress’s response. The tightening is quiet but real: the offering yields the copper shift, aligning the guests’ internal process with the fortress’s rhythm and foreclosing quick escape in favor of bearing silence. Agency is modest (ritualistic endurance over decisive reversal), but the price is legible and informs the final stance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres around safety’s price, silence, and hope; the bolt and discoloration accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end. Subtext largely works through image and ritual, though a few lines state the thesis too plainly (“safety demanded a price,” “willingness to bear silence”). The final image avoids moralizing by returning to snow/bolt signals, sustaining resonance. Complexity persists in the tension between endurance and the dream of a thaw.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lyric omniscient voice is controlled, textural, and consistent; no dialogue is needed for the effect. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate without overreaching into grandiosity, and focal certainty stays within what the narrative frame permits. Psychic distance holds steady and modulates appropriately at the turn and close.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is lush but generally precise; images like “cobalt fortress,” “seraphically mundane,” and the bolt’s charged echo land cleanly. Minor repetition and occasional explicitness flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum or blur sense. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm support the accumulative pressure, and copy is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of a cobalt ice‑fortress, a silent bellhop, and a piano bench bolt as ritual offering is fresh and memorable. The accumulative ritual turn (color shift) feels inevitable in hindsight and reweights the thematic premise without gimmickry. Risks in diction and concept mostly pay off, yielding a distinctive vision.</comment>
