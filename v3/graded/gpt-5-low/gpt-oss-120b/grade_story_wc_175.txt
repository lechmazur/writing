<question>1</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—to honor overlooked histories—is clear and enacted through concrete choices (collecting the moth wing, knotting reeds, staying as guardian). Interiority is embodied in tactile detail and sensory response, but internal contradiction is minimal, giving her arc a single-register purity. The final renunciation—accepting ephemerality while committing to memory—lands, though the cost is quiet. A slightly broader tension (doubt, risk, or competing pull) would deepen the character crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is consistent: the piece intensifies through repeated knotting, the “last monarch” as clock, and the glow’s ebb at sunrise. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—when the wing is tied and the structures begin to fade, fixing a before/after with the cost of transience. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never slips. The cost is felt but modest, keeping this just shy of the highest band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The grotto above the clouds is rendered with vivid, selective detail (bioluminescent moss, amber veil, scented mist), and setting motifs recur to charge the end image. The environment shapes meaning and visibility (signals rising toward heavens; clouds bowing) though it rarely constrains choice tactically. Objects-as-setting (moth wing, knots) contribute to the final image’s charge. The sensory palette is cohesive and purposeful without excess cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes center on whether ephemeral homage can endure, tightened by the migration’s end and the approaching sunrise that will dissolve the structures. Escalation is quiet but present: collecting the wing → building signals → last monarch passes → final knot and dawn’s dimming. The price (accepting impermanence, relinquishing tangible monument) is legible. A sharper on-page stressor or trade-off would raise pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—ephemeral memorials versus stone permanence; honoring the unnoticed—emerges through actions and recurring images (knots, wing, glow) rather than exposition. The ending reweights prior material: dissolution becomes testament, not failure. One sentence leans toward overt statement (“Thus the overlooked histories found a voice”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall the resonance lingers without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice sustains consistent distance and perception; diction and rhythm fit the contemplative mode with controlled modulation at peaks (last monarch, sunrise). No head‑hopping or stance drift. The patterned phrasing (blushing stillness, interrupted cadence) is intentional and coherent, if a touch insistent. Clarity remains intact through compression.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and clean syntax; images often do double duty for mood and meaning. A few phrases recur and edge toward purple (“blushing stillness,” “interrupted cadence”), but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t stall. Minimal paraphrase or scaffold; punctuation and sequence are clean. Rhythm breathes with the scene’s needs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of esoteric realism, cloud‑suspended grotto, bioluminescent knots as signals, and a moth wing memorial feels fresh and personal. The conceptual risk—choosing a ceremonial, low‑conflict frame—pays off through specificity and image logic. Closure’s reconfiguration is non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Minor familiar diction patches keep it just shy of extraordinary.</comment>
