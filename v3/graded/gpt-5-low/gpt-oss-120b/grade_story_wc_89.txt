<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—reforge the bond with Arion—and her reluctance adds live tension to each step. Interiority is embodied through scent, touch, and a steady gait rather than abstract labels. Micro‑choices (gathering, mixing, extending her hand) align with motive and reveal cost. The cost lands on the page (bark patterns), though a sharper internal contradiction at the touch would heighten it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: preparation → invocation → contact → metamorphosis. Orientation is immediate and stable; no lens ambiguity. Closure is a Decisive Change with a felt price and an earned final cadence of nightly tribute. Pressure is gentle and linear, but causality remains clean and sufficient for this length.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The orchard and permanent moonlight are not just décor; they supply resources (hidden jars, moon‑blossom) and condition the ritual’s success, charging the ending’s nightly offerings. Sensory specificity (violet glow, filamented air, spice perfume) is high and filtered through Liora’s vocation. Rules are legible through action, not exposition. A subtle constraint from the moon’s permanence further grounds the world.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection beyond death) is clear early and tightens at the hand‑to‑antler touch. The escalation is primarily internal; the decisive acceptance of a bodily cost provides a single meaningful deepening. Stakes stay intimate rather than perilous, which keeps tension lower but coherent. A sharper hesitation or near‑refusal beat could have intensified the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of rebirth, stewardship, and the cost of intimacy emerge organically from action and image. The final Earned Stasis—nightly offerings as a pact—reweights the premise without moralizing. Phoenix, moon, and spice motifs accrue rather than announce. Complexity persists: union requires partial self‑erasure (bark skin), resisting sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person close holds steady with a distinct sensory lexicon and measured cadence that matches Liora’s “paradoxically steady” trait. Diction is controlled and consistent; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates at key beats (mixing, touch) to good effect. Occasionally lush phrasing risks saturation but remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines often do double duty, weaving atmosphere with action, and the syntax varies enough to keep momentum. A few near‑repetitions and dense metaphor clusters edge toward purple but don’t obscure causality. Word choice is largely precise; modifiers are purposeful. Slight trims could heighten propulsion at the metamorphosis peak.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Familiar mythic elements (phoenix, stag, moonlight) are recombined with the spice‑ritual and “cosmic intimacy” frame into a fresh synthesis. The tactile method and nightly tribute feel distinctive. Not a radical departure, but the execution shows conviction and coherence. A bolder complication or non‑obvious tradeoff could push ingenuity further.</comment>
