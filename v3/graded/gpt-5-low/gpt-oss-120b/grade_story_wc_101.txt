<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—feed the community under sanctions without alerting patrols—is clear and consistent, and her actions (organizing runs, ringing the bell, announcing results) align. However, interior conflict is minimal; she carries “responsibility” but faces no on‑page contradictory impulse or compromised choice. Embodiment lands in a few tactile images (the bell’s tone, the lanterns), but micro‑choices under pressure are largely summarized. The endurance arc reads credible but safe.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the bell’s recurring act and the quiet cadence build to a Charged Poise closure where hope is reweighted against risk. Orientation is solid: who/where/when and the dominant stake are clear early. Closure lands in the final image (bell in moonlight; renewed runs) with a felt cost implied by secrecy and sanctions, though no single decisive turn tightens options on the page. The structure holds as a continuous shard without causality breaks, if a touch static.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ridge, terra‑cotta arbor, hollow, and bell are vivid and purposive; the arbor functions as micro‑setting that shapes tactics (drop site, gathering place) and the bell charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through purpose (lanterns “like fireflies,” dull silver that still resonates). World rules (sanctions, patrols, traders) are consistent without exposition dumps. The environment subtly constrains choices (quiet, nocturnal operations) and supports tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—feeding the community without detection—is clear; pressure coheres via secrecy and risk. Escalation is gentle: a month’s success, then a renewed commitment; no concrete complication forces a trade‑off on the page. Agency exists (Mara’s bell and organization), but the price paid remains conceptual rather than dramatized as a narrowed option or loss. The ending steadies rather than tightens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Solidarity, mutual aid, and intergenerational continuity emerge from particulars (anonymous sacks, children learning knots, promise to pass the bell). The bell’s recurrence gathers thematic charge and the final image reweights quiet as communal lifeline rather than void. Some lines verge on thesis (“the purpose… was to build intergenerational support”), slightly thinning subtext at peak. Still, the emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in third‑person close with a distinct auditory motif. Diction and rhythm support the “amplified quiet” without head‑hopping or register slips. Recurrent phrasing is mostly purposeful, though “amplified quiet that seemed to amplify” is a minor stumble. Modulation toward the charged final image is clean.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong images and economical beats; the bell, arbor, and lanterns do multi‑work. There is mild redundancy and occasional adjective stacking; a few near‑loops and tautological constructs slightly slow momentum. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean. The final line lands by image rather than explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The exile community under sanctions with a nocturnal bell‑signal network feels specific and alive; the anonymous straw‑tagged packages and terra‑cotta arbor add freshness. The piece risks a quiet, accumulative approach and mostly earns it. While not radical in premise, the integration of tone, object, and communal ritual makes it memorable. A sharper on‑page price or complication could have elevated distinctiveness further.</comment>
