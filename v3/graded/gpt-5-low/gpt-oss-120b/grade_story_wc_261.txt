<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—the “closure seeker” who reads scars drives every choice. Interiority is sensorially embodied (chlorinated air, cool stone, humming roots), though internal contradiction is minimal. The character adapts tactics (coffee rings → hourglass alignment) under pressure. The closing acceptance feels earned but pays a relatively modest emotional cost on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: image density builds toward a ritual that reweights meaning. Orientation is clean early (I, tower at dawn, tunnel) and the hourglass ritual provides clear linkage between beats. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the miracle is released and the narrator’s reading of wounds/time is repriced. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized, slightly softening impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is richly tactile and filtered through the POV’s sensibility (moss breath, root humming, narrow slit of sunrise). The tunnel, root, and hourglass placement actively shape the ritual, charging the final image. Sensory selection supports tone without devolving into a tourist catalog. A touch more constraint from the architecture could have pushed it into the 9-band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learn to read scars/seek closure) is clear and deepens via the coffee-ring method and the hourglass release. Escalation is quiet but coherent: investigation → ritual alignment → release. The price paid feels inward and contemplative, with limited visible foreclosed options. No major reversal; the pressure tightens once effectively but remains gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of time as wound, scars as language, and hope within injury cohere through concrete motifs (coffee rings, meteor hush, hourglass). The final sunrise/clearing glass reweights prior images persuasively. A few lines verge on explicit moralizing (“wounds can hold hope,” “time itself was a wound we could read”), which trims subtlety. Still, resonance lingers and feels earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Consistent first-person lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and apt. The patterned metaphor field (“meteor hush,” moss whisper) is taught early and maintained. No head-hopping or stance wobble. Occasionally the elevated register risks purple but remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished with varied syntax and strong image economy; many sentences do double duty. A high metaphor density edges toward overwriting in places but seldom muddies sense. Minimal scaffold or loops; momentum holds through the ritual. The closing cadence is clean and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Inventive fusion: coffee rings as scar cartography, moss telepathy, a “displaced miracle” bottled in a frosted hourglass. The ritual’s logic feels specific rather than generic mystical gesture. The emotional truth is understated yet distinctive. Minor risks of familiar “time/ wound” abstraction are outweighed by fresh, charged particulars.</comment>
