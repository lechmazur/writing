<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirela’s goal is precise and particular—measuring the “swallowed truth”—and her choices (smudging the illustration, tweaking the barometer) align with that drive. Interiority is sensorial and character-specific rather than generic. However, internal contradiction under pressure is subtle and the emotional cost of the final stance reads a touch tidy. The renunciation—carrying the weight “outward rather than inward”—lands but could register more struggle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece tightens through the pattern of smudges → barometer adjustment → stabilized reading, culminating in a reweighted final image. Orientation is immediate (oracle, mountain station, dawn, post-fever) and single-scene coherence holds. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—truth given a measurable number—and the cost is felt if quiet. The price is largely emotional and conceptual, not materially constraining, which tempers impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The mountain weather station, heater hiss, antennae, and barometer are integrated tools, not wallpaper, and they shape tactics and the final image. The environment mirrors and pressures the method (humidity, pressure, needle tremor) and charges the ending with aurora and wind. World rules remain consistent and are learned via action. Not quite 9-band because the environment constrains softly rather than forcing a hard trade-off.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear—quantify the internal lie—and the meaningful tightening arrives when she adjusts the barometer “by a fraction” and waits through trembling to a decisive number. Tension grows through density and cadence rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens. Still, the price and foreclosure read gentle: no option is truly lost beyond an interior stance, and the risk feels low. The result is satisfying but not pressurized to the highest tier.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: truth as measurable only when “smudging the lines” between seen and felt, and “occupying margins” as both method and ethic. Recurring images (swaying certainties, aurora, margins) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer (carry the weight outward) that retrofits prior motifs. Slight overemphasis in repeated phrases keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, distinctive lyric third-person close voice carries through with controlled diction and imagery. The perceptual signature—scientific tools filtered through oracular sensibility—is memorable and coherent. No head-hopping or stance wobble; purposeful compression reads clean. Minor recurrence of set phrases slightly narrows rhythmic variety.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with high information density and purposeful imagery tied to action (smudges revealing humidity/pressure, needle tremors as notes of truth). Prose avoids scaffolding and keeps momentum in a quiet register. Occasional motif reiteration (“auroral sorrow,” “swaying certainties”) flirts with overwriting but doesn’t obscure clarity. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—an oracle using a botanical illustration as a responsive data sheet, truth measured via barometric behavior—is fresh and coherent. The “occupying margins” method is an inventive, character-specific tactic rather than a mere trope. Risks are taken in the lyric-scientific fusion and they pay off without confusion. A few familiar lyric turns keep it just shy of exceptional.</comment>
