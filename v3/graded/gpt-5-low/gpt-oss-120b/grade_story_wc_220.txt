<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rook’s motive—to become a “keeper of connections”—is clear and consistent, and his micro‑choices (arranging the prism, following the riddle, resealing the leaf) align with it. Interiority is sensory and character‑specific for a dog (ears “pruning the hush,” scent‑anchored memory), though contradiction is light; he rarely wrestles with competing impulses. The renewal at the end is credible but low‑friction. A slightly deeper cost or hesitation under pressure would lift this.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Structure is clean: cylinder → prism‑reading → riddle → market square chest → leaf → renewed vow. The inferred lens is Hybrid with an accumulative dominance; causal links are present without needing heavy reversal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts a new burden to carry the voices. Cost is implied rather than pressed—no material obstacle or trade‑off tests him on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The scrapyard wasteland, rusted towers, and the moon/prism apparatus are vividly tactile and filtered through Rook’s sensoria. Objects function as setting constraints: waning moonlight and the prism’s colors gate access to the “texts,” and the chest’s placement under a collapsed kiosk grounds the search. The leaf charges the final image, making the place feel reconfigured from wasteland to tapestry. A hair more environmental pressure (e.g., hazard, scarcity) could justify a 9‑band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes are intimate and legible but escalate softly; the riddle produces forward motion without credible resistance. The dominant pressure (can he find and bear the leaf’s burden?) never tangibly threatens failure; the chest yields easily. The cost is mostly conceptual—shouldering voices—rather than contested on the page. One concrete loss, risk, or trade‑off would markedly increase tension.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Themes of memory, war residue, and connection are embodied through images (tinted grooves, waxed leaf, rust/sky seam) rather than stated morals. “Translate distance into closeness” reappears as an earned act, not a slogan, culminating in a reweighted final tableau. The piece resists binaries and lets mythic tech operate as emotional grammar. Slight risk of mantra repetition, but it holds because the final act recontextualizes it.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The voice is lyrically controlled, consistent with a mythic, close third centered on a dog’s sensorium. Rhythm and diction are confident; no head‑hopping or stance drift. A few phrases flirt with purple (“ears pruning the hush”), but they serve tone and remain legible. The modulation from hush to choir to hush is smooth and intentional.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is dense yet generally efficient; images often do multiple jobs (world‑building, theme, action). Minor repetition (“translate distance into closeness”) skirts redundancy but contributes to motif. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; no significant loops or cadence templates blunt momentum. A touch more concision around stacked modifiers would sharpen peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A retired cadaver dog decoding a phonograph with moonlight through a prism to find a waxed leaf that binds souls is a striking, specific synthesis. The mythic/tech fusion feels fresh and authentic to the setting. Turns arise from seeded elements rather than late rule drops. Boldness is evident without obscuring clarity.</comment>
