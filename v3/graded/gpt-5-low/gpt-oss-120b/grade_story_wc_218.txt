<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation and competence are clear and coherent—Mara’s “brazen calm” against the six‑month clock and her meticulous ritual work align tightly. However, internal contradiction and felt struggle are minimal; she rarely faces friction that exposes competing impulses. The council’s reversal arrives without Mara confronting a sharp, character‑testing moment. The serenity reads admirable but flattens complexity under peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece reads as a predominantly accumulative/causal hybrid: patterned ritual → public response → council decision. Orientation is clean, and closure lands with the decree lifted (a tangible social Decisive Change). Cost is present conceptually (time pressure, continuous labor) but under-dramatized on the page, with few on‑scene obstacles or turns. The single escalation track is legible but smooth.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated—living stone pillars, mica veins, chlorophyll “clouds,” and copper tendons all inform tactics and the final image. The environment clearly charges choices (wiring trees to stone veins) and the ending tableau hums with place‑bound consequence. A touch less tour‑poetry during mid‑beats might have sharpened pressure, but specificity stays purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stakes are clear (time limit and the bid to create interspecies dialogue), and the ritual action leads to a public inflection point. Yet the pressure curve is gentle; resistance is largely absent, so escalation feels like steady accretion rather than a tightening that forces a trade‑off. The council’s shift reads earned by accumulation, not by a testing turn with visible price. The felt cost at the peak remains muted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Images consistently braid a theme of reciprocity and binding (wire to wood, root to rock), culminating in social repricing of time limits. However, the line “the secret of the pillars… was the willingness of all beings to bind together” states the thesis a bit on‑the‑nose, dimming subtext. The resonance survives via the charged final tableau, but subtlety would raise the score.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyrical third‑person voice is steady and confident, with a clean perceptual signature rooted in ritual and observation. Diction and rhythm suit the meditative pressure profile; no head‑hopping. Occasional pseudo‑scientific claims (“bio‑energies”) flirt with register drift but remain consistent with the fable‑science texture. Modulation under peak moments could tighten slightly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line craft is polished: strong verbs, vivid images, and varied cadence keep momentum. Figurative density is high but mostly controlled; a few stacked metaphors (“bruised amber,” “chlorophyll clouds,” “conductive tendons”) edge purple without obscuring sense. Minimal scaffolding or loops; information density is good. The prose carries the ending image cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of living stone architecture, copper‑tree interfaces, and a ritualized ecological symposium feels fresh and memorable. The social pivot away from time‑bounded life adds an original conceptual repricing. Risk is real but tempered by a sentimental smoothness at the end; a sharper complication would elevate. Still, the vision coheres as its own stance.</comment>
