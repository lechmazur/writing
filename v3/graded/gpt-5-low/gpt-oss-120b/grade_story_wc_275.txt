<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira’s motive (to weave continuity, refuse violence) is clear and consistent, and her choices (whispering to roses, guiding the boy, organizing sandbags) align. However, her internal conflict is minimal; pacifism reads as settled identity rather than contested under pressure. Embodied emotion is mostly lyricized rather than felt in contradictory impulses. The resolution costs her little on the page beyond endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and acts (sandbags, roses, vows) build toward a dawn‑scene Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clear early (glass dome, tower fallen, Lira in the greenhouse). The ending reconfigures the community’s stance with a conceptual cost (choosing quiet labor over force), though the on‑page price remains soft. The night‑to‑dawn shift provides a meaningful cadence turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass‑domed desert rose farm is vividly realized and functionally engaged: roses “respond,” the dome is reinforced with sandbag scraps, and the environment shapes tactics. Recurring objects (sandbag scrap, roses) charge the final image and are handled with tactile specificity. Sensory texture is coherent and purpose‑driven. Occasional overt symbolism edges toward the explicit but doesn’t undercut place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stakes (can a pacifist knit continuity after collapse) are legible but pressure escalates gently. The primary tightening is communal action (gathering scraps, the vow); no option is sharply foreclosed, and cost is mostly conceptual. Lack of a hard test or reversal keeps tension low even for a quiet piece. The closure is earned, but lightly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (“engraved quiet,” “burden as bridge,” “tranquil blaze”) cohere and reweight the final dawn image. Some lines state theme outright (“silence can hold strength,” “burden can become a bridge”), shading toward didactic. Subtext exists in acts of care, ritualizing salvage into meaning. Resonance lingers, if somewhat pre‑articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third‑person voice is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Lira’s pacifist sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent across the scene. Minimal dialogue avoids contamination; focalization stays clean. Repetitions are patterned rather than sloppy, though a few phrases recur a beat too directly.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lines are generally clean, musical, and image‑dense with good cadence control. There’s mild purple redundancy (“tranquil blaze,” “engraved quiet”) and some conceptual restatement that could be cut for tautness. Syntax varies and momentum holds, but a touch of ornamentation blurs pressure. No major grammar or sequencing issues.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The fusion of post‑collapse agronomy, ritualized salvage, and “inculcating plants with values” feels fresh. The airship sandbag scrap as anchor/story totem is a memorable, specific touch. The arc favors lyric ritual over surprise, but the synthesis reads authentic rather than templated. Risk is taken in quiet, accumulative design and mostly pays off.</comment>
