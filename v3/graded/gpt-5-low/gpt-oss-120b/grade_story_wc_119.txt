<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation is clear—he wants to encode human pulse and truth into fortunes—but interiority remains largely declarative rather than dramatized under pressure. Contradictory impulses (covert carrier vs. accidental prophecy) are noted but not embodied in a testing moment. Micro‑choices exist (aligning lenses, using oil flow) yet emotional cost is muted. The result is purposeful but low‑friction characterization.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece builds through patterned images (beam, spiral, mist) to a reweighted dawn image. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise—the world subtly rewired by released “open secrets.” Causality is soft but coherent: specs → method → first cookie → cache → broadcast. The cost at closure is mostly conceptual, not felt, limiting impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse, beam, telegraph, mist, and rocky sea atmosphere are vivid and purposeful, culminating in the gull’s final image. The environment is used tactically (aligning lantern with coils; spiral echo of the beam) and tonally charges the end. Sensory detail is selective and cohesive to the protagonist’s craft. It stops short of overtly constraining a hard choice, hence just below the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes are mostly conceptual (truth dissemination, legacy of encoded lives), with little real-time resistance. The “tightening” is the first visitor cracking the cookie and the cache reveal—an intensification rather than a pressured turn. There’s no visible price or foreclosed option on the page. Tension is gentle and consistent but rarely sharpens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Themes of “open secrets,” stewardship of truth, and transposing life into code emerge clearly through recurring images. Some lines verge on thesis (“quiet revolution,” “rewire destinies”), reducing subtext in key spots. The final gull image usefully reframes the pattern without overt moralizing. Resonance lingers but could deepen with a more tangible cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Consistent lyrical third-person with confident diction and controlled metaphor set. No head‑hopping; the perceptual signature (mechanical/optical imagery) fits the character’s craft. The rhythm modulates well, though occasionally drifts toward purple. Voice supports the accumulative lens and lands the closing cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are largely clear and propulsive for a lyric mode, with good image economy (beam/spiral/ink/mist). Some overwriting and synonymic intensifiers recur, and a few sentences summarize rather than dramatize peak beats. Figurative density stays coherent, but costs and actions sometimes default to abstraction. Minimal scaffolding remains, yet momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—fortune cookies as covert carriers via microdot technique in a storm‑lit lighthouse—is fresh and memorable. The telegraph/lantern/ink‑flow mechanics add distinctive texture. The risk is primarily stylistic and tonal, not structural, but it pays off. Greater on‑page consequence would elevate the ingenuity’s emotional bite.</comment>
