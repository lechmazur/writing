<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—pivoting from supernovas to subtle, testable changes—is clear and embodied in concrete actions (collecting the dust, running observations). Interiority is particular (“strip needless drama”) and coheres with her choices. Internal contradiction is present but mild; she laughs with relief, not triumph, signaling renunciation rather than contested desire. The cost—accepting smallness over spectacle—is felt but remains conceptually framed rather than sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: small observations build into a reweighted final stance. Orientation is immediate (storm‑damaged greenhouse, after the flood), and the piece compresses time legibly. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—she leaves with a new credo about tiny disturbances—with a quiet cost of renouncing grand drama. The causal line is soft but coherent within the accumulative design; no beats contradict the lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and functional: cracked panes, humidity, widened fissures that admit air, decay releasing nutrients—all integral to the process observed. Sensory detail serves purpose and is filtered through her scientific eye. Environment shapes options and charges the final image of a “breathing sanctuary.” The setting’s evolution tracks causally with the observations, not mere postcard texture.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet (prove/embody a hypothesis; find calm through precision), and escalation is accumulative via humidity shifts, cracks widening, and a greenhouse reclassification from tomb to sanctuary. Agency is attention and disciplined restraint; she chooses method over spectacle. The price—foregoing dramatic proofs for slow data—is present but subtle. Pressure never sharply tightens, yet it coherently deepens under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Themes of humility, process over spectacle, and reframing decay as data emerge organically through image. However, lines like “The universe preprocesses reality…” and “We are all dust, rearranged…” verge on explicit thesis, slightly dulling subtext. The final image still resonates by reweighting the world through small causes. The piece invites reflection without forced binaries.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is steady, lyric‑close third, with diction consistent for a scientist tempered by fieldwork. Rhythm varies and modulates with pressure; certainty stays within Mara’s plausible inference. No head‑hopping or withholding artifacts. The elevated register aligns with her contemplative stance.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean, image‑rich, and mostly pulls double duty (setting and theme). A few abstractions risk purple but remain controlled; repetition is purposeful rather than looped scaffolding. Syntax variety and strong verbs keep momentum in a quiet mode. Final lines land with clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a neutron‑star researcher rigorously attending to butterfly dust in a ruined greenhouse to test reality “preprocessing” via micro‑patterns. The turn from cosmic to micro is non‑obvious yet thematically inevitable. Risks a metaphysical premise but grounds it in tactile observation, avoiding gimmickry. The closure image feels earned.</comment>
