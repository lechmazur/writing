<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archivist’s motive—renewing a covenant by preserving “the weight of small moments”—is consistent and enacted through concrete micro‑choices (placing the locket, writing in walnut ink). Interiority is sensorial and specific, with a credible mix of dread and reverence. However, internal contradiction is minimal and pressure on his values is gentle; no sharp trade‑off tests him. The final stance feels earned but low‑cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens through recurring motifs (tide shift, sky’s color change, sea’s chant) toward a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clear early (archivist at the jetty at twilight), and the closure image—the covenant’s glow reflected in the locket like a tiny moon—lands with conceptual cost (endurance, cyclical duty). The causal chain is lyric rather than plot‑driven but coherent and purposeful. Cost remains subtle, preventing a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is richly embodied across senses (violet/amber light, jasmine, cold tide, “jetty sang”), and it charges the final image. Environmental shifts—dusk to starlight, tide lapping at boots—shape timing and the ritual’s cadence. Objects-as-setting (locket, parchment, quill) are integrated and reweighted at closure. A slight excess of descriptive lushness keeps it just under 9.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are clear (renew the covenant to guide the harbor) and escalate texturally via encroaching tide and rising chant. The meaningful tightening is the tide’s turn and the need to “renew through proximate causes” before context shifts. Still, pressure never forces a painful trade‑off; the cost is reverential rather than biting. The resolution is earned but not hard‑won.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Themes of memory as covenant, small lights steering darkness, and renewal through subtle links emerge organically through image chains (locket → lighthouse → tide). Subtext coheres: ritual as a form of ethical attention. A few direct statements (“His purpose…to preserve the weight of small moments”) edge toward telling, trimming the afterglow. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The voice is a controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature (ink/sea/tide lexicon) that stays stable through the piece. Rhythms modulate with the scene’s swell, culminating in the chant’s crescendo. Some diction repetition (“haunted euphoria”) risks sameness but remains intentional as motif. No head‑hopping or stance leakage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lines are musical and image-dense, often doing double duty. However, figuration is heavy across consecutive sentences, and repeated phrases (“haunted euphoria,” “steep”) create mild redundancy and purple edging. Momentum dips slightly in middle patches where imagery accrues without new pressure. Syntax and clarity remain intact, with no mechanical errors.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The walnut‑ink archivist renewing a tidal covenant that gates a lighthouse’s beam is a fresh synthesis with memorable objects and logic. The “proximate causes” method is an intriguing, character-specific engine. While the conflict is gentle, the conceptual frame and final image feel distinctive rather than template. Its risk lies more in density than design, and it largely pays off.</comment>
