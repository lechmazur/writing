<question>1</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Aria’s motive—to memorialize and “prove empty spaces remember”—is clear and consistently enacted through her categorizing, inscribing, and vigil. Interiority is specific to her craft and tools, but internal contradiction is minimal; she rarely faces a fraught, value‑testing decision. The grief is embodied in tactile acts (engraving the brass, steadying in the swaying gondola) rather than therapy‑speak. The final acceptance—lowering the telescope and departing—reads as a quiet endurance with modest felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds density from categorizing clouds to comet-sighting, culminating in a charged poise/CR that reweights absence as memory. Orientation is strong early, and the recurring objects (brass telescope, broken strings) bind the scene. Closure lands in the final cadence as she records the comet and leaves; cost is subtle but legible in the vigil’s solitude and renunciation. A slightly soft price keeps it out of the very top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The sky gondola, broken strings, aurora dust, and brass telescope create a distinct, lived micro‑setting filtered through a meteorologist’s eye. The setting isolates and sways, physically influencing pacing and attention, and it charges the final image (“strings humming a lullaby” at dawn). Sensory specificity is high without devolving into cataloging. The object‑as‑setting (telescope) meaningfully frames choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stakes are internal (memorializing, proving remembrance) and signaled early; escalation occurs via a density shift when the comet appears and the inscriptions accrue. The pressure is coherent but remains largely contemplative; few options are foreclosed beyond the vigil’s endurance. The final move (recording then leaving) is earned but not hard‑won. Emotional cost is present but gentle.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Resonance arises from particulars—the broken strings, engraved telescope, cloud‑emotions—and culminates in a quiet revaluation of absence as record. However, the thesis is stated outright multiple times (“to prove that empty spaces remember,” “a quiet testament...”), which blunts subtext. The comet’s “quietly explosive” echo is a strong image‑answer that could have carried more of the thematic load without exposition. Still, the motif web coheres effectively.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person close with a distinct perceptual signature (“dust‑laden starlight,” aeronautical/weather inflections) is maintained. Rhythm modulates well between hush and intensification, and filter‑verb clutter is minimal. Occasional repetition risks preciousness, but control persists through closure. Voice remains plausibly within the focalizer’s lexicon for a poetic scientist.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line work is polished, musical, and image‑dense; most sentences do more than one job. There is some purple creep and repetition (“quietly explosive,” “spooled wholeness”), but coherence is retained and momentum doesn’t stall. Modifiers are occasionally stacked, yet crucial beats (inscriptions, comet sighting, departure) stay crystal-clear. Minor trims could heighten propulsion and avoid echo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fusion of meteorology, elegy, and a relic gondola creates a fresh, memorable frame; the method of cloud‑by‑emotion taxonomy feels original. The comet as silent detonation deftly refracts the story’s thesis. Risks are taken in committing to a lyric, accumulative structure with minimal external plot, and they largely pay off. A touch more tactical consequence would push it closer to singular.</comment>
