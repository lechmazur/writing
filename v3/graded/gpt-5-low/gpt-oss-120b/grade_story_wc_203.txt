<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s competence and tactile choices (lanterning the mainspring, climbing the creaking ladder, engaging the circuit) are clear and rooted in her observant, ghost‑tuned mindset. Interiority lands through embodied perceptions (“weightless burden,” collar tug), but there’s little contradictory impulse or visible cost resisting her aim. The final shift to “quiet purpose” feels earned by action more than by deep internal struggle. Strong, specific, but emotionally low‑friction.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal—each step (fissures → lantern → dust routes → hatch → hidden clock/barrel → circuit map → alcove → ledger) follows a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: acknowledgement of the ghosts and the ledger’s recovery reweight Mara’s burden into purpose. Cost is modest (risk and effort, no true sacrifice), keeping it shy of the top band. Orientation is clean early, and the final image ties back to the ticking heart without contradiction.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atmosphere is lush and purposeful: rain‑slick entry, flapping marquee, cracked mirrors, calliope, popcorn scent—all filtered by a technician’s eye. Tools and structure constrain choices (darkness forces the mainspring lantern; the ticket office architecture hides the alcove; the attic lattice governs movement). Recurring objects charge the final image (stars matching the ticking heart). A hair shy of 9+ only because the environment’s price on choices remains gentle.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stakes—reveal what the ceiling hides and honor the ghosts—are legible from the start and compress through the attic hatch and hidden mechanism. The meaningful tightening arrives when the mainspring drives the circuit to map the hidden architecture, translating atmosphere into actionable constraint. Resolution is earned by her choices, though the price paid is light and the opposition never truly bites back. Tension is steady rather than knotted.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of seeing through façades and granting the forgotten their due emerge organically via dust routes, mirrors, and the ledger. The line “cracks…were not flaws but frames” lands a touch on‑the‑nose, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. The final cadence (stars pulsing with the ticking heart) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about purpose and attention. Subtext remains mostly in image rather than dictum, to good effect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A consistent, lyric third‑person close with a tactile, horological lexicon suits the premise and stays within what Mara can infer. Rhythm and sentence variety are controlled; the voice modulates from tense hush to earned calm. No head‑hopping or stance leakage; purposeful elision around ghost rules reads coherent. Elevated diction matches the gothic‑mechanical mood without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: images multitask, verbs are strong, and sensory density pushes momentum rather than clogging it. A few borderline purple moments and repeated labels (“skillfully observant”) flirt with excess but don’t blur sense. Syntax varies and avoids scaffolding loops. The final image efficiently recharges prior motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Elevator‑tech plus horology as ghost interface is a fresh synthesis, and dust‑pattern diagnostics feel inventive. The hidden circus ledger and calliope echoes avoid genre boilerplate and cohere with the mechanical‑spiritual logic. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural; the conflict remains gentle. Overall, a distinct and memorable angle well carried through.</comment>
