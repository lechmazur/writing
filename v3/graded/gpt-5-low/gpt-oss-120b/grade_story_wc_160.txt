<question>1</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira’s goal and competence are clear, and her embodied relationship to tools and stone is specific and convincing. However, there’s little friction inside her—no contradictory impulses under pressure or visible cost to her choice—so the arc feels comparatively untested. Her emotional register trends consistently confident rather than strained. The elder’s arrival offers validation rather than a crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the adhesive-to-binary-to-chain-to-valve sequence coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: the city will draw water “by conversation.” Orientation is clean early; continuity of scene and single POV hold. The closure lands, though cost is mostly conceptual and lightly felt on the page. No major causal gaps, but the path contains minimal resistance.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dormant-volcano amphitheater is vivid and tactile, with the “breath” and tremble of stone integrated into action. Tools and environment (chain, valve, basalt floor) meaningfully charge choices and the final image. Sensory selection reflects Mira’s expertise and focus. World rules stay consistent within the story’s quasi-mystical logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stakes are signaled—harmonize preservation and progress—but pressure is gentle, with few obstacles or trade-offs. The single tightening is the decoding and turning of the valve; the world exhales and alignment follows without visible price. Under the accumulative lens, density increases, but a credible loss or foreclosed option is missing. Resolution reads earned but easy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Themes of empathy-as-architecture and technology as conduit for human unity emerge organically from particulars (chain pulses governing water). Some lines veer into thesis (“operated on a principle of shared empathy, a living algorithm”) which blunts subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs, but edges toward sentimentality. Still, the encrypted-compassion conceit is fresh and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close stays stable and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature tied to craft and geology. Diction is controlled and patterned without head‑hopping; small dialogue beats are minimal but coherent. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but remains legible. Rhythm supports the scene’s gentle build.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lines carry strong images and purposeful verbs, and syntax varies enough to keep momentum. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and anchored; a few abstractions (“living algorithm,” “encrypted compassion” repetition) risk overstatement. No significant scaffold or paraphrase loops. The final sentence lands cleanly on a charged image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—cryptographic empathy encoded in a surveyor’s chain regulating volcanic water in a breathing amphitheater—is striking and memorable. Beats arise from those specifics rather than stock moves. Risk-taking is evident without obscuring clarity, though the conflict resolves too smoothly to reach the very top. The conceit feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
