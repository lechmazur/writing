<question>1</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Lira’s motive—rekindle a dying realm—is clear and her agency (singing, raising arms, pledging lifelong guardianship) is consistent, but interior contradiction is minimal and largely asserted rather than dramatized. Emotions are filtered through sweeping imagery more than embodied specifics, so cost reads conceptual. The final renunciation (to guard forever) registers, yet its sacrifice isn’t felt through tangible loss or resisted impulse. Overall credible but not deeply conflicted.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: songs → window refracts → orchard responds → spirits gather → dawn swells → vow. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a credible before/after image (endless night to gentle sunrise) and a modest cost (eternal guardianship). Orientation is clear early (greenhouse, mica window, Lira’s role), and patterning remains coherent. Lack of on‑page resistance limits the sense of earned difficulty but does not break closure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated—the greenhouse, mica window, metallic‑rooted trees, and endless night all interact with the action (song touching glass, orchard humming, feedback loop). Sensory detail feels selective and world rules consistent within the lyric mode. The window functions as a charged object that shapes effects and the final image. Constraint is atmospheric rather than tactical, keeping this just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stakes (revive a night‑bound realm) are high but pressure is soft; escalation is a steady swell without reversal or narrowing trade‑offs. The spirits’ arrival amplifies scope rather than testing resolve. The vow adds a price, but it arrives after largely unopposed progress. Strong accumulation, limited contest.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Recurring images (woven dawns, window, orchard) coherently argue for communal renewal as alchemy. However, the line “the true alchemy was not in transmuting metal, but in weaving together the hearts” tips into explicit moralizing, reducing subtext. The ending image resonates, yet ambiguity and counter‑pressure are minimal. The theme feels sincere but slightly declared.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person closely tracks Lira’s perception; stance and diction are controlled. Voice modulates with the swelling cadence of the scene and teaches its pattern early. No head‑hopping or unjustified elision. At times the register edges toward purple, but rhythm remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lines are musical and image‑dense, with good cadence; repetition (light/dawn/weaving) creates motif but occasionally verges on redundancy. Metaphor stacks remain coherent and rarely collide, though saturation risks blur. Momentum holds, aided by syntactic variety. Some tightening could heighten propulsion and sharpen cost in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>“Woven dawns,” “mica window as loom of sunrises,” and an alchemical orchard create a fresh synthesis. The communal memory‑to‑seed motif is inventive and coherent. Risk is aesthetic rather than structural, and it pays off in a memorable tableau. Greater antagonistic complication could have elevated the ingenuity by deepening consequence.</comment>
