<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to test and understand why the oasis resists change—is clear and drives tactile choices (setting the lantern, tracing sun patterns, offering light to hives). Her interiority feels particular (potter’s patience, attention to rhythm), but contradictory impulses are minimal, keeping pressure soft. The renunciation of control (leaving the lantern as beacon) provides a modest, earned cost. A deeper internal wobble under pressure would have heightened the crucible.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: thrum intensifies, lantern reweighted by kindness, and the bees’ reawakening crystallizes a quiet closure. The final act—offering light to dormant hives—creates a before/after with an on‑page shift (hives awaken, lantern steadies). Cost is present but light (endurance, letting the oasis “resist” and leaving the lantern behind). Orientation and rule learning are clean and timely.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is vividly integrated: cracked salt crust, dead hives, cactus, and heat all inform her methods (following sun patterns, altar placement). The micro‑object “lantern glass” functions as setting through constraint and charges the final image. Sensory texture is specific and filtered through a potter’s patient attention. Rules (phototropism to kindness; fractured timelines) stay consistent and embodied.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressure grows via density and cadence: the hum syncing with breath, the lantern warming, and the emerging silhouettes. The dominant stake (coaxing life without violating the oasis’s resistance) tightens once when she decides to offer the lantern to the hives. The price is gentle but legible—accepting partial change and giving up the lantern. A sharper trade‑off or threatened failure beat would raise stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme coheres (kindness as force that bends timelines without erasure; memory as lattice), with recurring images reweighted at the end (lantern becomes “its own sun”). Some lines tip into overt moralizing (“kindness… can bend even the hardest timeline”), softening subtext. The closing image still resonates as a conceptual repricing of change vs. constancy. More implication and less declaration would heighten aftereffect.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lyric voice is consistent, textural, and controlled; the perceptual signature (sun, clay, thrum, careful movement) feels character‑borne. Psychic distance and tense are steady, with purposeful cadence shifts as pressure builds. Elision is modest and taught; no head‑hopping. Occasional elevated diction fits the meditative stance without register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: varied rhythm, concrete images, and purposeful repetition (thrum, light, sun patterns) maintain propulsion. A few phrases verge on purple, but coherence holds and metaphors stay aligned with the world’s logic. Minimal scaffold or loops; density remains high. The final paragraph lands cleanly by image rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—phototropic‑to‑kindness lantern, fractured timelines, beekeeping oasis—feels original and inevitable within the piece’s logic. Risks in concept and tone pay off without obscuring clarity. Turns arise from seeded particulars (hum, sun‑guided placement, benediction). Only the low‑stakes gentleness keeps it from the rarest tier.</comment>
