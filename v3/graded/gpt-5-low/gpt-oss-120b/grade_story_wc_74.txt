<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—quietly proving kindness endures—is clear and embodied by repeated micro‑choices (layering paint, leaving notes). Interiority is sensorial and character‑specific rather than labeled. The piece lacks palpable internal contradiction or a pressured decision; she never wavers, which flattens heat a touch. Jiro’s presence reflects her impact but does not force a new choice under strain.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: night work → moon‑sparked reveries → note left → Jiro’s response → recommitment. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Jiro’s remembering reweights Mara’s practice; the sunrise clock and her endurance supply modest cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The causal chain is delicate but coherent, with no dropped setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog, and moon‑filtered glass are vivid and functionally tied to action: the glass catches moonlight that “sparks daydreams,” the rain collector services the brush, the smog contrasts the sanctuary. The moon‑tipped brush as micro‑setting charges the closing image when “its crescent edge” sharpens the tip. Sensory texture is rich without tourist cataloging. Environment subtly constrains process and cadence.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible (will her work rouse strangers) and tightens once: the sunrise threatens the spell, then Jiro arrives to test it. The pressure is gentle—no hard trade‑off, and the price (fatigue, anonymity) stays mostly tonal. Still, the Jiro beat deepens the stake rather than resetting it. A slightly clearer felt cost at peak would raise urgency.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Themes of remembrance, gratitude, and the reclamation of “lost languages” emerge organically through image and action rather than thesis statements. The final bridge—Jiro’s rekindled memory—reweights the motif without moralizing, even though the notes urging smiles skate close. The moon/brush language evolves from craft to communal lexicon. Resonance lingers, if a touch tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person close maintains stable distance and a distinctive perceptual signature (silvered sap, saffron quiet). Rhythm modulates with the night’s tide and never lapses into explanatory scaffolding. No head‑hopping or register drift. The voice feels earned and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished, with strong verbs and multi‑tasking sentences; motifs recur with intention. There is mild density creep (moon/saffron repetitions) that edges toward purple but remains coherent. Momentum holds, and the final lines resolve by image rather than explanation. No loops or syntax templates dull the closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—calligraphic moon‑brush translating lost scripts into kindness—feels fresh and particular. The greenhouse as lantern over smog is a memorable angle that avoids generic urban lyricism. The turn via Jiro is simple but elegantly earned. Risk lies in the unapologetically lyric premise, which the piece sustains without gimmick.</comment>
