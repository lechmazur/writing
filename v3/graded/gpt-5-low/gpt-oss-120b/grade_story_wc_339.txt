<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mort’s motive (recover the last transmission; understand “the physics of letting go”) is clear and his actions align (untangling, listening, sealing, leaving a note). Interiority is textured and embodied through tactile tasks (filaments, wax, the globe) rather than label‑speak. The internal shift to release is earned, though contradictory impulses under pressure are muted, with little on‑page friction beyond elegiac contemplation. The cost is modest but present in the shattering globe and the renunciatory departure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: object recurrence and density build toward a charged closure image (the shattering globe/last note). Orientation is clean (who/where/mission set early), and beats proceed coherently from untangling to listening to sealing. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: letting go reframed as energy release with an elegiac cost. Slight softness in concrete consequence and external pressure keeps it short of elite.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The sunken ship library, corroded console, wax cylinder, and the snow globe create a vivid, tactile milieu integrated with action. Setting details are purposeful and filtered through task‑focused perception (wires, brass, algae, cold). The snow globe as micro‑setting charges the final image and shapes handling, though the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond mood and object availability. Atmosphere and specificity are strong without feeling museum‑tour.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear but pressure is mostly internal; escalation comes through the intensifying motif work (untangling → playback → personal note → shatter). Agency is steady and reflective, with one meaningful deepening when the transmission plays and Mort reciprocates. The felt price is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than a narrowed option set, keeping the tension quiet. Effective for a lyric mode, if not gripping in consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Thematic through‑line is coherent and largely image‑driven (wires, light pulses, glitter drift), but several explicit statements undercut subtext—especially “tension minus attachment equals the luminous path of release.” The piece often explains what the images already do, tipping toward sermonizing in the final third. When it trusts the particulars (wax sealing, globe shatter), it resonates cleanly. Strong idea, slightly over‑articulated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; tactile diction (coil, filament, wax) grounds the abstractions. Rhythm modulates well, with longer cadences for reflection and sharper beats for actions. Elevated register suits the elegiac frame, though at times it leans ornamental. No dialogue, no head‑hopping; stance is steady and credible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Lines are clean and mostly purposeful, with strong sensory anchoring and recurring image economy. However, figurative density and thematic reiteration occasionally bloat momentum and drift toward purple (“a gentle equation,” “sophisticated melancholy”). Minor paraphrase loops appear around “physics of letting go.” Despite this, sequencing is clear and the final image lands crisply.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hybrid of submarine archive, radio archaeology, and a snow globe as physics‑metaphor feels fresh and unified. The Amelia Earhart echo adds a surprising, if lightly integrated, inflection. The final reweighting via the globe’s shatter is elegant and specific. Slightly safer stakes and a few familiar lyric moves keep it just shy of exceptional originality.</comment>
