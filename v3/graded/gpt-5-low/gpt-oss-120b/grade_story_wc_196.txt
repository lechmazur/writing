<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Amelia’s motive—to witness and magnify small kindnesses—drives concrete actions (using the button method, filing under “Acts of Compassion,” presenting to the supervisor). Interiority is consistent and embodied through tactile engagement with dust and paper rather than label-speak. The internal contradiction (broken-hearted yet hopeful) is present but softly rendered; pressure tests it only modestly. The cost is felt as ongoing grief accepted rather than solved.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the button-light-dust method accrues meaning and culminates in a charged poise ending. Orientation is clean early (file room, archivist, object), and the two-shard structure (night/next morning) is coherent. Closure lands via resonance—she commits to the work with a visible cost (remaining broken-hearted) and a reweighted rule-set (the room as an archive that can be read). Causality within the magical logic stays consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The file room, dust, sunlight, and the button create a lived micro-ecology that actively enables and constrains choices. The environment/tool literally “writes” the stories via silhouettes, directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through an archivist’s eye. World rules are consistent within the soft-magical frame.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but clear: can forgotten lives be made legible and seen. Escalation deepens texturally—from discovery to institutional acknowledgment (supervisor’s agreement) to recommitment with a new file. The price is subtle (enduring grief; choosing attention as labor), which limits intensity but suits the lens. One meaningful tightening occurs at the supervisor scene, then consolidates in the final recommitment beat.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—dust as unvoiced history, a button as a conduit, bureaucracy softened by human attention. The ending reweights the premise: the archive is readable if tended, with hope costing endurance. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“as a reminder that even forgotten lives could be seen”) yet the images carry most of the resonance. Thematic aftertaste is strong and invites reflection without didacticism.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and character-specific, with controlled cadence shifts at key beats. Diction is cohesive and avoids register drift; the supervisor’s brief presence doesn’t disrupt focalization. Patterned phrasing (“unfurl”) is purposeful and part of the piece’s taught lexicon. No head-hopping or withholding artifacts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished, with strong images and efficient rhythm; repetition is motif-driven rather than padding. A few echoes (“unfurl,” “patterns”) risk slight saturation but don’t blur sense. Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum. The final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The dust-and-button projection of hidden case histories is a fresh, coherent synthesis of object magic and institutional memory. The foster care archive context adds specificity beyond generic “forgotten records.” Risks are taken in committing to a quiet, accumulative design with soft-magical logic, and they pay off. The turn to institutional display is small yet non-obvious, granting a measured originality.</comment>
