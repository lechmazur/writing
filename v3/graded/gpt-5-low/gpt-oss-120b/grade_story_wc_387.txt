<question>1</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (to perceive and honor hidden effort), and he makes small, coherent choices (whistling, tracing the whisk, following moon paths). Interiority is image‑driven but light on genuine contradiction or cost; we don’t see impulses in tension. The “resolve to mend a torn strand of his own memory” hints at change but remains abstract. Emotional embodiment skews ritualistic rather than pressured.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density builds through recurring fireflies/whistle/whisk motifs with a two‑shard night‑to‑night structure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the second night answers the first with a luminous chorus, but the cost is soft and largely conceptual. Orientation is clean and the pattern holds. A firmer price or foreclosed option at the end would lift impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and integrated: the whispering, rain‑slick parapet, moonlit puddles, and fireflies color action and tone. The slick stones and “listening” walls lightly constrain movement and ritual, and the whisk functions as a micro‑setting/object. Sensory specificity is strong across sight, sound, scent (bamboo steam). While atmospheric, the environment seldom forces a choice, keeping it shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (appreciate hidden effort) remains largely internal and aesthetic; pressure escalates via density rather than narrowed options. The primary tightening is the decision to ritualize (mend memory with the whisk) and the return the next night, but no trade‑off is truly tested. The whistle eliciting a response reads as confirmation, not a costly turn. Stakes stay gentle and unthreatened.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres—labor unseen, attention as reverence—and the final image reaffirms rather than reweights. Some explicit statements (“He understood then…”) border on telling, trimming subtlety. The recurring objects do carry subtext, but the piece leans into a thesis more than an emergent argument. Resonance lingers, yet without a counter‑pressure or price the insight feels cushioned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single, steady lyrical POV with controlled cadence and a distinct perceptual signature. Diction is occasionally ornate (“scintillatingly somber”) but consistent with the meditative stance. Rhythm modulates enough to avoid monotony, and no head‑hopping occurs. Minor purple swells slightly dilute pressure but not legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is musical and image‑dense, yet it verges on overwriting and repetition (firefly/path/whisper motifs sometimes restate without new pressure). Occasional paraphrase loops and stacked modifiers slow momentum. Clarity holds, but density often does single duty. Trimming redundancies would quicken propulsion and sharpen turns.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—net‑mending as metaphysics, a bamboo whisk as loom for memory, fireflies answering a whistle—is fresh and coherent. Risks are aesthetic rather than structural, landing a distinctive mood. The originality is more in imagery than in narrative turn, which remains modest. A bolder cost or inversion at closure would elevate ingenuity.</comment>
