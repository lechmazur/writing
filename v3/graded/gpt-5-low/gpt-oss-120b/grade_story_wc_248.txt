<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motive (rescuing the mentor’s promise) and a felt flaw-to-grace arc give cohesion, with embodied reactions (“volcanic tenderness,” tactile tracing of the tapestry) grounding emotion. However, internal conflict is largely declared rather than dramatized under pressure; the redemption feels relatively frictionless. The most vivid crucible is mirror-judgment via the vandalized self‑portrait and glyphs, but the piece skims the cost. Still, actions align with motives and the final renunciation reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: controlled blaze → self‑portrait map → art‑trail → tapestry key → box → vow → murals. Closure lands on the page through a decisive change and earned stasis (he renounces burning to become guardian), with a conceptual cost tied to his past. Orientation is prompt and steady. The path solves too smoothly, reducing felt jeopardy, but the chain is coherent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The desert canyon archive and basalt dome are vivid, sensorial, and filtered through the fire‑mind’s bias; dust “like ash,” amber glow, and murals embedded in cracks are memorable. Setting constrains/affords choice (tapestry as key, hidden niche, vault trail) and charges the final image (glowing mural inviting strangers). Detail remains selective, not touristic. A minor tendency toward overt symbolism keeps it just shy of the top band.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early and deepens once the vandalized self‑portrait reframes the hunt as self‑reckoning. The art‑trail provides a single meaningful tightening, and the ending forecloses the path of destruction. Pressure remains coherent but soft; obstacles are minimal and no beat forces a hard trade beyond the internal renunciation. Cost is felt but mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fire as destruction/illumination, memory as heat, and the phoenix motif interweave to answer the central question through image rather than mere assertion. The scroll’s promise and the final mural reweight earlier material with resonance. Occasional direct statements (“he understood that his flames… could now be turned”) edge toward moralizing but don’t overwhelm the imagery. The afterimage is sincere and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Consistent, lyrically controlled single POV with a distinct perceptual signature (reading “equations of color and pattern”). Rhythm and diction fit the character’s fire‑logic. A few reiterated coinages (“volcanic tenderness”) risk monotone, but modulation to the amber‑glow coda works. No head‑hopping or stance drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and largely efficient, with strong verbs and layered images that carry narrative work. Some metaphor stacking and repeated lava/volcano imagery flirt with excess but stay legible, and loops are minimal. Syntax varies with good momentum and clear sequencing. The final image is crisp and uncluttered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>“Lending library arsonist” seeking redemption in a lost archive via art‑puzzles is an inventive synthesis; the phoenix turn feels earned and specific. The self‑portrait-as-map and smoke‑as‑mental‑signal are fresh. Familiar tropes (phoenix, vow) are enlivened by tactile particulars and the tonal throughline. Not radical, but admirably integrated and memorable.</comment>
