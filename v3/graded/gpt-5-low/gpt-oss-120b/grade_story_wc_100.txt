<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marlow’s motive—guiding the dead to rest—drives tangible actions (reassembling the lens, placing the last shard), and his inadvertent stubbornness colors tactics. Interiority stays lyric but specific enough (“carrier of silence,” “weight of centuries”) to avoid stock abstraction. However, micro-choices under pressure are mostly aesthetic rather than contested, limiting felt contradiction and cost on the page. The final renunciation (vanishing) reads earned but not deeply argued in-scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pulses of light build toward a reweighted world where the library becomes sanctuary. Orientation is clear early (underwater library, dock, package, lens) and the closure lands with a visible price (Marlow merges with the light). Causal links (assemble lens → pulses → spirits settle) are legible without mechanical plotting. The piece avoids outline-y “and then” and keeps one coherent stake through to a resonant cadence shift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The underwater library and the broken lens are tactile and constraint-bearing: water pressure, glass walls, flooded aisles, and bioluminescent fish all shape how the beacon works. Details are purposeful and filtered through vocation; “marble tablets” and “vaulted dome” charge the final image. The environment materially constrains choice (reassembly, placement in an “impossibly thin slice of air”). World rules stay consistent and feed the ending’s charge.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—granting the dead rest—tightens as each pulse elicits response, culminating in the last shard placed in an impossible location. The escalation is a clear density increase rather than adversarial conflict, appropriate to the chosen lens. Cost is present in the closing surrender of self, though intermediate trade-offs are lightly sketched. Pressure coheres from task to sanctuary without coincidence resolving it.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distress signals as a metaphor for grief and rest integrate through action (beacon pulses) rather than lecture, and the ending reweights “permanent address” with the library itself. The story resists moralizing and lets image carry meaning; “chased stillness” crystallizes into sanctuary. A few direct theme articulations (“to give rest a permanent address”) brush the edge of stating the thesis but remain supported by scene. The final merge reframes duty versus peace with lingering ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in focalization, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Marlow’s vocation. Rhythm modulates well, with longer cadences for awe and tighter lines at turns (“He placed the last shard…”). No head-hopping or unjustified register shifts occur. A slight tendency toward ornate diction occasionally risks saturation but does not break legibility.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line work is rich yet largely precise; images often do two jobs (world + theme). Minor redundancies (“permanent address,” “chased stillness”) recur but function as motif rather than dead weight. Figurative density runs high, flirting with purple, yet syntax remains clear and momentum steady. No loops or mechanical scaffolding slow the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Undertaker-as-lighthouse keeper in an underwater library is a striking synthesis, and the “distress signal” conceit becomes tactic, not ornament. The final image (merging with the beacon) feels inevitable from seeded motifs. Risks in setting and diction pay off without obscuring clarity. The piece reads singular rather than templated.</comment>
