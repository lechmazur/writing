<question>1</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—she maps loss and builds an engine from salvaged parts—but internal contradiction is minimal, with little on‑page friction beyond fatigue and sorrow absorption. Embodied details (thin air, warm censer foot, soldering) ground emotion. Micro‑choices (answering midnight calls, integrating the censer foot, recording coordinates) reveal values. The final acceptance reads earned, though the psychic price could be sharpened.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: calls → engine → hum → ships, with the censer foot as a persistent constraint and conductor. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes a sanctuary and reverse migration begins, with cost in the sorrow etched into coils and the navigator’s endurance. Orientation is clear from the outset (station at night, failing hydraulics). The causal weave is lyrical rather than plot‑tight, but the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The signal station and censer foot function as charged micro‑settings that shape tactics (outdated transmitter, air thin, censer as component and ritual tool). Sensory specificity (incense, rust, flicker, hum) is purposeful and sustained. Environmental rules remain consistent and evolve with action (moon‑phased pulse). The final image is inseparable from place, reweighting the setting into “sanctuary.”</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one stake—turning loss into navigable current—and tightens as the engine is assembled and stabilized under moon‑phased constraints. The price (absorbing sorrow, fatigue, foreclosing outward messaging to become an inward beacon) is felt if understated. Escalation reads as density/cadence: whispers to roar to steady hum to ships. A single, sharper on‑page sacrifice would elevate stakes further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Themes of grief cartography and homeward return arise from particulars (midnight calls, reverse migration etched into coils) rather than thesis alone. One line overstates the theme (“reverse migration was not a folly of longing...”), slightly blunting subtext. The censer foot’s evolving meaning (tool, conduit, reliquary) provides an earned non‑literal answer. The ending’s sanctuary image lingers with quiet, credible hope.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A consistent, lyrical third‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“eyes sewn together from half‑remembered maps”) sustains mood and control. Rhythm modulates well from hush to roar to hum. No head‑hopping or stance drift; inference stays within what the POV can sense and surmise. Occasional elevated diction suits the fable‑like register.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is lush yet mostly efficient; images do double duty for mood and function. Minor repetitive diction (e.g., “raw solace”) and stacked metaphors skirt purple but remain coherent and purposeful. Sentence variety supports momentum, and crucial beats are shown rather than summarized. Line‑level clarity is strong through the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels singular: a censer foot as compass, moon‑phased engine translating loss into navigable signal, and a beacon for reverse migration. Risks in premise and diction cohere without gimmickry. The final reconfiguration—outbound station turned inward sanctuary—reads both inevitable and surprising. Emotional truth underlies the speculative fabric.</comment>
