<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara’s motivation (“to discover why some paths disappear”) is clear and consistent, and her embodied memory of bleaching lends texture. However, interior contradiction and on‑page micro‑choices are thin; much of her arc is contemplative rather than pressured. The partnership with Eli never tests their relationship, so character pressure stays low. The realization at the end reads earned but low‑cost emotionally.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern (tapping/atlas/data assembly) that accumulates to a cadence shift at the watermark discovery and the console’s coordinate—closure as Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early; causality is soft but coherent within the lyric mode. The final image reweights their practice without breaking the established rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sea level station, steel table, instruments, and torn atlas page are integrated and filtered through the characters’ professional priorities. The environment shapes tactics (assembling data, tapping on steel, instruments flashing) and charges the last image. Sensory detail skews conceptual over tactile, but specificity remains purposeful. World rules (ban, monitoring practices) hold plausibly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering missing paths/meaning) is present from the start, with one substantive tightening: the watermark/canyon match and deliberate tapping that yields the coordinate. Pressure remains conceptual; costs are implied (reef loss, directionlessness) rather than dramatized on the page. Escalation is calm and steady, fitting the lens but never truly constricting options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Recurring motifs (tapping, torn atlas, “drifting moored,” “periodically eternal”) deepen into a humane thesis about listening, memory, and ecological guidance without overt sermonizing. One paragraph edges into tell (“When coral bleaches, they lose the chemical gradients…”) but ties back to present stakes. The final charged poise—lights flicker with taps—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity holds without tidy moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, gently lyrical, and consistent; POV is a steady close‑third/omniscient drift centered on Mara without head‑hopping. Diction matches the contemplative, technical‑poetic register. Some repeated signature phrases verge on mannerism but maintain intention. No dialogue, but absence suits the ritualized tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic, with high information density and few errors. There’s mild redundancy (“drifting moored,” “periodically eternal,” “delayed revelation”) and occasional explanatory tilt that slightly slows momentum. Metaphoric consistency holds; line rhythm supports the accumulative cadence. Final image lands crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fusion of oceanography with ritual tapping and a watermark‑revealed conduit feels fresh and coherent. The atlas page as a living instrument and the metronomic table are inventive without gimmick. Risks are taken in committing to a quiet, process‑driven climax; they pay off, if softly. Emotional specificity could cut deeper to reach the top band.</comment>
