<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and textured—she borrows Maris’s manner to bridge courage, then admits using ambiguity as a shield. Micro‑choices (choosing Caslon, calibrating ink with the fragment, “listening as them”) reveal values under pressure. The contradiction between precision (mathematics of emotion) and fear is dramatized, not told. Visible cost arrives when she renounces reliance on Maris’s courage and repositions her ambiguity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via repeated printing acts, halo feedback, and astronomers’ “Between vanishing stars” until the confession and final image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes ambiguity’s purpose and externalizes it by placing the fragment on the windowsill to “drink” vanished light. The cost is legible—letting go of protective ventriloquism and accepting ethical accountability for editing grief. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, and the pattern taught by the voice pays off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The workshop, press, and observatory are tactile and integrated—oil, citrus, topaz grit, and the turning dome all serve the mind at work. The halo fragment functions as micro‑setting and tool that constrains choices and charges the ending. Environmental logic stays consistent and culminates in the windowsill image against a missing star. Detail is economical yet richly selective, filtered through a printer’s priorities.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ethical use of “transposed empathy” and the courage to own it—is clear and tightens through the couple’s commission and the proof’s effects. The key deepening is the self‑indicting confession that forecloses the path of hiding behind Maris. Costs remain mostly conceptual rather than materially punishing, but they’re felt. Escalation coheres under the chosen lens without needing reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—the act of printing, the halo’s conduction, the star ledger—rather than thesis statements. The line “Transposed empathy is not charity…a trading of coordinates” refracts throughout and is repriced by the final appeal to the sky. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about shared grief and accountability without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers as earned complexity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization; diction and rhythm feel inseparable from the character’s craft and aims. Patterned elisions are taught early and remain legible; no head‑hopping or register drift. The voice modulates at pressure peaks (confession and final question) without losing clarity. Perceptual signature—printer’s math, astronomer adjacency—never wavers.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet largely precise; images (“click of metal logic becoming breath,” “absence washes my hands”) carry multiple jobs. Occasional saturation risk in figurative stacking is kept coherent by motif discipline. Momentum holds with little scaffolding or loops, and sentences vary well in rhythm. Minor lushness prevents a higher score but doesn’t blur causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—letterpress mechanics, a humming halo fragment, and “mathematics of emotion”—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, conceptual frame) heighten stakes and cohere at the charged final image. Turns arise from established tools and traits rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth lands without safety hedging or template comfort.</comment>
