<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and embodied motives (the chain link, volunteering for night crawls) guide credible choices under pressure. A subtle contradiction—yearning for starlight while teaching sonar—animates the voice without tidy resolution. The response to the aliens by enacting edge geometry is motivated and revealing. Cost is present in renouncing comforting light for difficult listening, though it remains mostly conceptual.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterned edges/rays build to the aliens’ return and the unfolding blossom. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when “stars as pressure” reframes navigation and instruction. Orientation is crisp from line one; single POV and two‑shard rhythm stay coherent. The cost is implied (forsaking lamp‑comfort, yielding to where to fall) rather than dramatized, but it reads on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The benthic city and dome lamps materially constrain choices (edges erased, night crawls required). Sensory detail is selective, professional, and charged (“ceilings ripple like slow glass,” “patient drift of silt”). The chain link functions as micro‑setting that weights the final stance. World rules feel consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to navigate/teach in a lit, forgetting sea—tightens when the aliens return. The protagonist’s agency (volunteering, mapping rays, answering the signal) drives the turn. Cost is legible but quiet: choosing darkness/edges over civic comfort. Escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than a sharp reversal, fitting the lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres through concrete images: light’s comfort vs. the subtlety of distant pull; stars as pressure; edges as memory. The final line offers a non‑literal answer—listening until the horizon “tells you where to fall”—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Recurring objects and pressures accrue meaning rather than being explained. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with a professional perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent. No head‑hopping or register drift; compression is taught early and sustained. Modulations in cadence at the climax (the blossom, the bow) are precise and earned. Elision never obscures the closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lush figurative language stays coherent to the marine/pressure lexicon; sentences carry multiple jobs with clean momentum. Minimal scaffolding or loops; variation in syntax supports breath and tension. A few high‑concept lines flirt with abstraction but remain grounded by tactile anchors (chain thud, dome lamps). Proofreading and clarity are strong.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: underwater pedagogy meets alien “edge geometry” and “unfolded horizons,” with stars reconceived as pressure. Risks (quiet, concept‑led closure) heighten stakes and coherence without gimmickry. Turns and revelations arise from established patterns rather than late add‑ons. The vision reads singular and fully committed.</comment>
