<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular, with a live contradiction (thrill of risk vs. stewardship) driving concrete choices: she follows the scrawls, lifts the lantern, takes the theorem, and reframes her teaching. The gambler/professor lineage feels earned rather than labeled, especially at “Practice risk as stewardship, not as theater.” Emotional cost is present—she accepts responsibility against inherited impulse—though it’s quiet rather than searing. Relationship pressure with the father is off‑page but active enough to sharpen her motive and the final stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early; the rainwashed library frame holds while motifs (lantern, priors, martingale) accrue toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she commits to teaching and living risk as stewardship. The corridor/lantern note is a decisive tightening; the ending’s “odds change, mercifully and slowly” marks the before/after with felt cost in duty and grief. Causality is lyrical but coherent; no teleports or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The library, rain, and the candle lantern are sensorially rich and purpose‑driven; midsummer emptiness grants latitude, rain modulates cadence, and the object’s mica lens literally refigures perception. The lantern functions as micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image and constrains choices via the “Check your priors” note. Detail selection is biased by the narrator’s profession and past, keeping specificity economical. Spatial and atmospheric continuity never wavers.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to “widen perspectives responsibly”—is active from the start and tightens at the Martingale corridor and the lantern’s theorem. The reversal is a deepening of risk’s meaning rather than an external clash, but it narrows options: thrill alone is foreclosed; stewardship is embraced. Cost is mostly internal; it lands through the father tie and teaching choices. Pressure remains coherent and builds through pattern notches rather than overt obstacles.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and action—the lantern, martingale, priors, and “stewardship not theater”—without sermonizing. “Lucid contradictions” is embodied in the final bridge to the father (“Only if you do not either”), a resonant, non‑literal answer that reweights the premise. The city’s “public secrets” offers a humane, layered counterpoint to private ledger and risk. The last lines re‑cast the world as a patient teacher, avoiding tidy moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice fuses math, gambling, and weather into a coherent perceptual signature. POV distance is steady; reflective compression feels plausible in the quiet library frame. Diction stays within the character’s plausible lexicon (professor with gambler lineage), with rhythmic modulation at turns (“Check your priors,” “odds change”). No head‑hopping or artificial dialogue intrusions.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet purposeful; metaphors are aligned (rain/coins, gutters/martingale) and seldom mix. Momentum holds; sentences carry multiple jobs without scaffold or loops, and the final image lands clean. A few lush phrasings flirt with excess, but clarity and propulsion are maintained. Syntax varies and punctuation supports cadence shifts at pressure points.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—probability pedagogy, gambler parent, archival lantern with mica, subway marginalia as map—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns grow from established motifs rather than late rule changes. Emotional specificity avoids template arcs and feels singular.</comment>
