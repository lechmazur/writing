<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Singular, specific interiority (“machines are only honest when they are allowed to care”) and a live contradiction (market vs. ash) drive choices. The machinist’s micro‑decisions—refusing to name names, tuning to the catenary, pledging songs—align with motive and reveal values under pressure. Embodied beats (the tremble, ear to rock) keep emotion concrete. Slight ease—competence rarely falters—keeps it just shy of the most searing arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clear causal flow: arrival → detection of imbalance → encrypted proof → hidden sluice → catenary solution → public stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a pact, a new protocol (“logged in song”), and tuned gates that alter the city’s future. Cost is present in the choice to protect lovers and accept accountability. Orientation is immediate and the drive lens (accumulative with causal spine) holds to the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The volcano amphitheater and its breathing tangibly constrain tactics (listening for pressure, accessing the slit, the catenary line shaped by span). Details are selective and profession‑filtered; tools and stone act on the outcome. The final image is charged by setting (“lullaby of patient power,” night pooling in ribs). World rules stay consistent and integrated into action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is crisp (harmonize water vs. rock); escalation arrives via discovery of sabotage and the concealed sluice. The decisive tuning and ethical refusal tighten options and reweight outcomes. The cost remains mostly conceptual/social, with smooth acceptance by both factions, slightly muting peak tension. Still, agency drives the turn and resolves without coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—compassion as code, fairness as engineering—emerges from particulars (adhesive analysis, song‑logging) and recurs without heavy sermonizing. The ending reweights the premise: mercy must be encrypted, then made legible to the willing. A few explicit lines (“So let compassion move as code…”) flirt with stating the thesis but feel voice‑true. Subtext around forbidden love and civic risk deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical first‑person with a machinist’s sensorium and musical metaphors holds steady. Rhythm varies with pressure; repeated “as the building breathes” is a taught pattern, not a tic. No head‑hopping or stance slips; compression serves cadence. Slight density of figurative language is controlled and purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (chain applause, sugar bitterness) and little scaffolding. Figurative texture is lush but coherent; sentences propel rather than stall. Minimal repetition works as motif, not loop. A hair of purple potential is kept in check by clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a floodgate machinist decoding compassion via envelope adhesive and solving hydraulics with a surveyor’s catenary. Risks in diction and premise feel organic and necessary, not ornamental. Turns arise from established tools and ethics, not late rule changes. The final reconfiguration reads inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
