<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—“to negotiate with my own ghost”—and every choice (climb, bait with stories, pay in verbs, stay) aligns under rising pressure. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular, with embodied contradictions (a scavenger who must stop scavenging the future). The renunciation at the end (“I stay…”) forecloses a path with felt cost. Minor reservation: emotional states skew lyric over visceral at times, but not enough to blunt credibility.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and actions accrete to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure where the contract becomes “restarted habits.” Cost lands on‑page: relinquishing plundered futures, staying despite groaning ladders and calling bones. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and set‑ups (camera wheel, story‑rope) pay off in the final cadence. The final image reconfigures options without flattening ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, wind ladders, turbines, and carousel bones are vivid and purposeful; environment shapes tactics (ascent via rumor‑rungs; time kept by turbine sighs). Recurring objects (camera wheel, hinges) charge the ending. World rules are consistent within the lyric logic (“windmills turn the water into memory”). Setting functions as engine, not backdrop, and constrains choice at closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—securing an authentic truce with the self‑ghost—is pressured coherently: the ghost rejects rehearsed bargains, demands verbs, and the narrator must pay in regret and endurance. The tightening arrives with the demand set (“admit, forgive, rebuild, stay”), which narrows options and imposes cost. Resolution is earned by agency, not chance. Slight softness in external jeopardy, but internal stakes carry the weight.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of regret, authenticity, and sustainable rebuilding emerge from particulars (penny city dissolving; ambitions composted into garden sand) rather than assertion. Subtext operates through images (bridge of murmurs, bone‑arithmetic clicks), and the final stance reframes ambition as habit. One near‑didactic line (“the only contract worth signing…”) is justified by the ghost’s role and does not cheapen resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature (“bones learning arithmetic,” “book’s quiet vertebra”). POV remains stable and confident; elisions are pattern‑taught and paid off. Rhythm modulates to match pressure (syncopation of clicks with lagoon). No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; most lines do double duty in image and action. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern‑consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors at peak beats. Momentum rarely stalls; a couple of lush sentences flirt with excess, yet clarity and propulsion hold through the closing cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis—post‑carousel, cloud‑lagoon mechanics, story‑rope tactics, camera wheel arbitration—feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold risks (lyric machinery, nonliteral world rules) heighten stakes without obscuring closure. Emotional truth anchors invention; the final repricing of ambition as practice is both original and human.</comment>
