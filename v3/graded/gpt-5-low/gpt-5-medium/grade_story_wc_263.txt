<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and sustained (the burden of hearing unspoken words), and micro-choices under pressure read specific (aligning, copying, resting, returning). The gift/curse contradiction is active on the page and informs tactics. Some feeling states are summarized lyrically rather than dramatized at peak beats, slightly softening the felt cost. Overall, interiority and action cohere with credible endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: circuits, meteor/door, sculptor’s pages, failures/rest, and a final widening (“the city remembers”) deliver a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clear from the outset (aurora-lit archway, river, instrument). The cost—ongoing burden, fatigue, patience earned through failure—lands without over-explaining. Closure is quiet yet legible: vocation affirmed with a price and broadened stakes.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The archway, aurora, river, and instrument are not backdrop; they function as hinge, chorus, and key, constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is specific and filtered through vocation (“brass chilled,” “vellum that smells like rain”). World rules are learned in action (door opens “without brick”) and remain consistent. The setting actively shapes turns (meteor-comb, door, room of pages).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free trapped creativity to relieve internal pressure) is clear, and pressure coheres via ritual circuits to a tangible opening and one artist’s release. A meaningful tightening arrives with the meteor/door and the choice to enter and sleep-listen; failures/rest show price and adaptation. Stakes deepen from individual to city-scale without diffusing focus. Conflict remains mostly internal/liminal but earns consequence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of vocation-as-burden, liberation through listening, and communal creativity emerge organically from concrete acts (tracing meteors, etched light sentences, windows opening). The final reweighting—building a bridge with others and the night learning to speak—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One declarative line (“Creativity is not a single prisoner”) edges toward statement but is earned by scene. The ambiguity feels purposeful, not evasive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with a consistent perceptual signature; diction and images remain character-bound (“broken music of comets,” “brass crescents”). Psychic distance modulates smoothly under pressure. No head-hopping or register slips; elision patterns are taught and paid off. Rhythm supports the accumulative build without flattening.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high information density, varied cadence, and purposeful metaphors that rarely muddle. A few lush images cluster, but they clarify rather than obscure (“meteor combs the aurora,” “door opens without brick”). Minimal redundancy and clean syntax keep momentum. The prose sustains musicality without slipping into purple excess.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—an astronomer-listener freeing artists by tracing falling stars at an aurora-lit arch—feels singular and consequential. Risks in form (lyric accumulation, vocational mysticism) heighten stakes and cohere. Turns arise from taught rules, not late conveniences. Emotional truth (relief through patience, cost of vocation) grounds the novelty.</comment>
