<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—inscribing a resistant memory on skin—is clear, particular, and enacted through precise micro‑choices (observing gaps, dotting, charging negative space). Embodied emotion shows via “obsidian grace” and tide‑trained gesture rather than labels. The cartographer’s presence applies gentle, relevant pressure without stealing focus. Internal contradiction is muted (confidence outweighs risk), which trims peak complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the verse accrues through dots and gaps until a charged poise ending (“exile tilt into vocation”). Closure lands with cost: illegality, ongoing risk, and a chosen identity that forecloses a safer path (“If patrols asked… I would say gardener”). Orientation is clean from the opening and pattern is taught early (negative space method). The ending’s reconfiguration is felt and legible without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The twilight garden and basin are not postcard dressing: they enable secrecy (“petals hear vows without reporting them”) and ritualize the act; the moonstone tool palpably shapes action and the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑true (currents as chords; leaves like black water). World rules are learned in use—memory as contraband, garden as covert archive. The recurring basin/moon tableau charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around making an unseizable memory under a ban, and deepens via the method (gaps → constellation → oath). The decisive tightening is the shift from fugitive to vocation (“exile tilt into vocation”), accepting continued exposure as the price. Stakes remain intimate but clear; there’s no reversal beyond cadence intensification, which fits the chosen lens. A slightly sharper on‑page threat could have heightened felt jeopardy.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (memory as resistance; negative space as meaning) arises from action, not thesis, with the “between” motif reinterpreted in the shoulder‑sky and final vocation claim. The law’s urge to erase is answered by intimate, unarchivable art—conceptual repricing rather than moralizing. The cartographer’s line (“Your departures, my returns…”) crystallizes distance‑as‑language. No late symbolic convenience; the images earn their resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with marine‑lunar idiom sustains across the scene; psychic distance modulates cleanly at peaks. Brief dialogue is natural, subtext‑bearing, and precise. Patterned elision (gaps, adjacency) is taught early and paid off without head‑hopping or register slips. Rhythm varies with intent, keeping pressure legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lines carry multi‑tasking images with strong verbing and minimal scaffold; repetition patterns (gaps, dots) are purposeful, not loops. A high figurative density risks purple but stays coherent within a disciplined lexicon (sea/moon/stone). No significant clarity drops or cadence templates; momentum holds through the inscribing. A hair more sentence austerity in the middle could sharpen contrast.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of tide choreography, anti‑nostalgia law, negative‑space poetics, and a moonstone “nib” feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric method as craft, quiet stakes) heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. The closure image reframes exile as vocation with fresh authority. Emotional truth avoids template rebellions and facile uplift.</comment>
