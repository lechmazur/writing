<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority with a principled restraint (“I have learned…you must let people see themselves”) that guides tactics under pressure. The narrator’s vocation and empathy drive concrete micro‑choices (decoding taps, diving, inviting witnesses). A live contradiction—urge to shout vs. chosen gentleness—yields earned endurance at the end. Minor distance from visceral fear in the dive keeps it just shy of peak intensity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: dreams → mapped taps → Sofia → dive → snow globe/password → communal witness → foreman’s tacit admission → earned quiet. Closure lands with cost in the final charged image (husband cranks until it sticks), reconfiguring the stake from exposure to rest. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; no teleports or rule breaks. The restraint tactic persists as a constraint shaping every turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The ice‑carved shrine, porthole “windows,” and salt‑jeweled music box are tactile, rule‑consistent, and drive choices (warming the globe, convening witnesses in the ice). The environment charges the final image and constrains tactics (quiet, candlelight, communal listening rather than confrontation). Sensory selection is precise and voice‑filtered; no postcard excess. The recurring object/setting duet (windows/snow globe) anchors atmosphere and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose the true cause to release the dead) is signaled early and tightens via the discovery and strategic handling of proof. The decisive deepening arrives with the music box “password,” followed by a public test against logs. Cost reads in the chosen method—foregoing accusation for ritualized proof—culminating in a quiet, un‑cheering outcome. A single on‑page reversal (company stepping out, foreman lowering eyes) is understated but effective.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: truth as careful stewardship, communal witness as justice, memory as tide. The snow globe and “borrowed starlight” reweight at the end, resisting moralizing while offering a resonant answer: exposure as a gentle blade that permits healing. Subtext (the ethics of revealing, the dead’s insistence) operates in image rather than assertion. Complexity holds without false balance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first‑person with a professional perceptual signature (silt, steel, taps) remains consistent and confident. Patterned diction is taught early and modulates at turns without opacity. No head‑hopping or register drift; controlled metaphoric reach suits the milieu. Purposeful elisions compress time while preserving causal clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level is tight, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences often do double duty (atmosphere and plot). Figurative language stays coherent to the maritime/ice lexicon, avoiding mixed metaphors. Momentum never stalls despite lyricism; no loops or scaffold. Closural cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Wreck‑diver as psychopomp, dream‑tapped Morse, and an ice‑shrine “courtroom” synthesize into a singular, memorable frame. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight, with bold but grounded risks (evidence encoded in a child’s toy, public hymn‑exposure) that heighten stakes. Emotional truth matches novelty; no gimmickry. The final image both surprises and satisfies within the taught pattern.</comment>
