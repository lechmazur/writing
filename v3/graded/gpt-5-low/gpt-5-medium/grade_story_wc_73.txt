<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular (“grim optimist… balancedly daring”), with concrete micro‑choices under pressure: rolling biased dice, chalking lemmas, refusing the rupture. The contradictory impulses (to preserve and to progress) act simultaneously at the crack. The renunciation—choosing not to step through—reads as an earned endurance with felt cost. Reactions to key objects (the chipped die, chalk, apertures) reveal a coherent, flawed, self‑aware stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: proofs, dice, steps. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when the narrator declines the rupture and shifts aim to “shaping the corridor into a remembering instrument,” a choice with cost. The dice lying flat (5 and 2) and taking seven charged steps seal the before/after. Orientation is clean throughout (single POV on an infinite staircase); no causality breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase, chalked risers, apertures, and the silver crack are tactile and constrain choice; the world’s rules (no landings, courteous slots) stay consistent. Objects-as-setting (dice, chalk, rail grain) continually inflect action and the final image. Atmosphere of “boundless confinement” is inseparable from place. The environment charges the ending (keeping the seam, steps as kept silences).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the missed opportunity’s texture—tightens when the rupture opens and tempts a shortcut. The refusal to step through forecloses a live option and asserts a costed stance. Agency drives escalation via biased rolls, lemma‑placing, and the final renunciation. Pressure coheres without soft resets, culminating in a conceptual but legible price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Regret as engine, bias as truth, and motion honoring stillness weave through concrete images (chipped die, mirror‑breath, chalk proofs). The final reconfiguration offers a resonant answer: accept skew and labor to remember precisely rather than exit. A slight tilt toward declarative thematics (“The proof says…”) trims the mystique without collapsing into sermon. Subtext remains strong in how fairness is “achieved by confession.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with consistent focalization and purposeful cadence. Diction (“lemma,” “corollary,” “Earned Stasis” implied) fits the mind on the page; rhythmic variation supports turns (crack sequence, final seven steps). The brief apostrophe to the opportunity-slot deepens subtext without breaking POV. Patterned phrasing is intentional and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet clean; most sentences carry multiple jobs (image, theme, action). Recurring motifs reprise with precision (dice, breath, chalk) and avoid muddled vehicles. Minor risk of overt statement in the “The proof says…” triad, but cadence control and specificity sustain propulsion. No loops or template cadence mar the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—math proofs as memory‑machine on an infinite staircase powered by regret—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The chipped die’s ethical bias, courteous apertures, and “fairness by confession” transform familiar regret tropes. Risky structural and tonal choices heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image reweights the premise with originality and cost.</comment>
