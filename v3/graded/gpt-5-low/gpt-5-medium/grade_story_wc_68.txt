<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and consistent: the narrator preserves methods over myths and acts accordingly under time pressure. The internal pull—“the reflex to agonize over the least harmful lie”—gives way to disciplined choice, revealing a credible hierarchy of values. Embodied, character‑particular perception (chalk marks, silt “like sleeping whales”) grounds emotion without therapy‑speak. Micro‑choices (keep the cog; lead them now; wedge and wind) align to the stated ethos with a felt social cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: demand for the cog + noon sluice jam → the lead through the drowned library → the cog as ratchet fix. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act; the water drops and the wheel “catches,” reconfiguring meaning from emblem to method. Cost is tangible (time pressure, risk of flooding, social narratives dampened) and the lens holds. Orientation is strong from the first lines, and no causal seams show.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The drowned library, chalked floodlines, and silted sluice constrain tactics and directly shape the ending. Details are selective and POV‑filtered (salt “writes its own index”), and the environment actively limits options until the cog solution. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. The final image is charged by place and tool together.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avert immediate flood) is clear and tightens with a live clock. The arrival of the three claimants concentrates pressure, and the water’s rise on the narrator’s chalk literalizes escalation. The solution is protagonist‑driven and forecloses a path (lying, symbolic co‑optation) with a visible price in social capital. A single decisive tightening suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action: method vs myth, rebellion as repair, respect for the dead via practice not worship. The cog’s repricing from “emblem” to “tool” delivers the thematic answer without moralizing. A few aphoristic lines risk overstatement (“the healthiest disease is certainty”) but are earned by concrete stakes and the closing enactment. The ending resonates conceptually and emotionally.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled voice—abrasive calm with precise metaphoric texture—holds under pressure. Focalization stays tight; certainty stems from tracked practice, not omniscience. Rhythm varies effectively, compressing at the turn and breathing at the release. Dialogue is minimal but functional via reported speech and status is legible through diction.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is muscular and economical despite lyric density; images are fresh and coherent (“gold tooth in a cracked jaw,” “pressure kissed our shins”). Minimal scaffolding and no visible loops; sentences multitask. A rich figurative palate skirts, but does not cross, into excess, maintaining clarity at the climax. Syntax modulates to match tempo.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post‑plague drowned city, method‑as‑ethic, and a cog as salvaged time is striking and inevitable in hindsight. The narrative rejects trendy apocalypse tropes for a fresh stance—rebellion as maintenance—with specific tactics (chalk measures, repurposed gear). The final act transforms an object’s meaning without gimmickry. Bold but legible risk‑taking elevates the piece.</comment>
