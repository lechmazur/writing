<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is precise—he seeks coherence rather than reunion—and his actions (arranging fruit, speaking names, threading the rope through the eyes) reveal a character who solves grief through craft. Contradictory impulses are present: secrecy versus the desire to “understand the mathematics of emotion.” The final stance—carrying an unsolved theorem—reads as earned endurance with cost. Interiority remains concrete and character‑particular without therapy‑speak.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene accrues objects and patterns until the theorem and tethered eyes reweight his loss. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who, where, when). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he accepts uncertainty, leaves the eyes, and pockets the rope’s end—cost is the renunciation of reunion for coherent carrying. No causality breaks; the stalactite, ticking drips, and mosaic all pay off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vivid and functional: dripping stalactites tick time, the fissure admits moonlight, the stalactite anchors the pendulum, and mineral fruit becomes a tool for spiral arrangement. Objects-as-setting (glass eyes, mosaic stone) charge the final image. Sensory details stay purposeful and POV‑filtered. Environment constrains and enables his choices, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens through pattern‑matching to action: turning the eyes to the ceiling → arranging fruit → knotting the rope → leaving the eyes as pendulums. The decisive deepening is the theorem’s emergence and his tethering choice, which forecloses the fantasy of reunion for a lived practice. Cost is felt in leaving the eyes “to keep watch.” Tension remains internal yet active and coherent.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: ambiguous loss, math as ritual craft, and attention/time/uncertainty/return as a lived equation. The “cracked theorem” risks explicitness but is earned by the mosaic method and not presented as moral. The final image recasts grief as carried practice—conceptual repricing that lingers. Subtext moves in images (rope of light, pendulums) rather than assertion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyric perceptual signature sustains control without slipping register. The narrator’s noticing (buttons and sunlight, cooled tears, ledger of vision) feels character‑borne, not generic. Psychic distance is steady, and elisions are taught by pattern and paid off at closure. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with varied rhythm; figurative language is lush yet coherent to the motif set (math, craft, mineral orchard). Minimal scaffolding and no evident loops; lines typically do more than one job. A few metaphor stacks edge toward saturation but do not obscure sense, especially at the end. Final cadence is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—conjuring, cave‑orchard, taxidermy eyes, and mathematical grief—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric density, stated “theorem”) pay off through grounded actions and a fresh moral calculus. The closure image (tethered pendulums, pocketed rope) is memorable and reweights the piece. No reliance on template tropes or borrowed moves.</comment>
