<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (recover Anya’s work without “wounding” silence) guides concrete, pacifist tactics and small, revealing micro‑choices (refusal to pry, asking permission). The internal contradiction—eclectic pacifist and “reluctant performer of truth”—is dramatized through ritualized performance to the night and restraint with the clasp. Emotional cost surfaces in the inheritance beat (“My throat tightens”) and the double‑signature. Change is modest but earned: from preparer/collector to heir continuing the archive under a vowed ethic.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early (pre‑fireworks hush → ritual tools → resonance) and held through closure. The clasp’s opening and the double‑signed entry deliver on‑page closure via a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (accepting Anya’s charge). Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when; workshop, town hush), and the fireworks clock shapes the cadence. Setups (pacifist method, silence collection) pay off causally at the hinge click and the inheriting entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The workshop, window, and sky under imminent fireworks are vivid and functional; the environment constrains tactics (must capture the hush now; must open clasp gently with on‑hand instruments). Recurring objects (copper bowl, reed, mothwing mic, clasp) act as micro‑settings that charge the final image. Sensory specificity runs across modalities (smell of “antiseptic oranges,” dough silence), filtered through the narrator’s craft‑bias.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent: open the clasp and ethically continue the archive before the hush breaks. Pressure tightens via the ticking window and the self‑imposed constraint of non‑violence; the “click” is a decisive intensification. The cost is internal but legible (acceptance of a promise that will govern future work), though antagonistic pressure remains largely atmospheric rather than oppositional.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—empathy via disciplined listening, pacifism as technique—emerges from tactics and images rather than abstraction; the fireworks hush reweights the practice at the end. A single explicit statement (“That is pacifism as technique…”) edges toward didactic but fits the established theatrical sincerity. The final act (co‑signing, anointing the hush) offers a non‑literal answer that revalues attention over conquest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with a performer’s cadence remains consistent and modulates under pressure (from playful ritual to charged quiet). Diction is specific to the character’s sensibility (mothwing microphone; “science performed on tiptoe”). No head‑hopping or stance slippage; elision patterns are taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors that carry action; rhythm varies and supports momentum. Figurative texture is rich but coherent to the POV; minimal redundancy, no scaffold loops. A few stacked images risk lushness, but clarity and propulsion hold, including at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Opening a generational diary clasp by resonance to catalog silences is an original synthesis; the pacifist‑as‑technician angle feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects and the fireworks hush create an inventive frame without gimmickry. The risk of high‑lyric diction pays off in coherence and thematic depth.</comment>
