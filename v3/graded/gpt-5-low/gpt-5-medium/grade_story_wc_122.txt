<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara’s goal (to thaw numbness) is clear and embodied through tactile perception and micro‑choices (bringing the reverse‑player, consenting to Oko’s method, stitching the filament). Her interiority feels specific (skin, bones, remembering of feet) rather than labeled. The internal contradiction—competent teacher fearing deadened feeling—registers but never truly strains her tactics, making the arc feel slightly tidy. The closing acceptance costs her comfort in forward motion, but the price is subtle rather than sharply dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to the reverse‑unspooling to the needle’s repair and the hush’s redefinition. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration: stitching the filament into the needle turns absence into compass and reweights the premise. Cost is implied and felt (frost rubbed from ribs; admitting she’d already stopped), not spelled out, but sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean within the first lines (who, where, when) and the single scene coheres.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The cavern’s velvet acoustics and object ecology (hides, smoke, old rain, the broken needle) are not ornamental; they shape method and meaning. Environment constrains tactics (subterranean hush enables backward listening; Oko’s workshop allows the “absurd surgery”). The final image is charged by place—she carries the cavern’s echo alongside tomorrow’s drum. Sensory selection is filtered through her deafness and vocation, maintaining specificity without touristic sprawl.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—overcoming numbness—tightens via the backward‑song experiment and culminates in the decisive act of threading the filament and reorienting the drum “forward.” Pressure escalates texturally (from seams of music to harbor of not‑sound to bright filament), and Mara’s agency drives the turn. The price is mainly internal (owning her prior stop, accepting a counterintuitive method) and could read slightly soft to readers craving a sharper foreclosed option. Still, the reconfiguring act clearly narrows her path toward a new teaching ethic.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The theme—listening backward to move forward; silence as conduit rather than void—emerges organically through action and object (needle, drum) rather than thesis. Recurring images (frost, tide, filament, hush) reprice themselves in the ending without moralizing. The final stance resists applause‑chasing, privileging tenderness and presence, a resonant answer to the opening fear. Ambiguity is purposeful, not confusing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A unified lyric voice with a tactile, sensory intelligence suits a deaf music teacher and stays consistent under pressure. Rhythm and syntax modulate with the deepening experiment; images recur with intent. No head‑hopping; focalization remains tightly with Mara while allowing Oko’s presence via gesture. A high figurative density is sustained without major register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and economical for its mode; many sentences do double duty in image and action. A few metaphors crowd (moons, fossils, tides, harbors) but they cohere within the sound/silence palette and rarely blur sense. Momentum holds with minimal scaffold or repetition. Minor risk of purple saturation prevents a higher mark but does not impede clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—deaf pedagogy, reverse playback, a cavern that “swallows sound,” and a filament of hush repurposing a broken needle—is striking and feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and diction pay off with a precise, fresh emotional truth. The closure image is memorable and specific enough that swapping any major element would collapse the logic. It’s bold without gimmickry.</comment>
