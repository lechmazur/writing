<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and embodied (a caretaker devoted to preserving forgotten names), with credible contradiction between “gently systematic” craft and a faltering heartbeat under pressure. The past failure (rain‑dial) and vow deepen stakes without speechifying. Micro‑choices (hum catalog numbers, stitch without piercing tone, test own name) reveal values. Slight limitation: high competence keeps risk perception modest on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the repaired chime is offered, the name threads down, and the final grace note licenses rest—after the vow not to fail again. Cost is emotional and vocational (the promise, the tremor of nearly‑lost sound), and the tightening is clear when the wind warns the sound is escaping “unless I hurry.” Orientation is clean from the outset; pattern holds through the cadence shift at the balcony and coda.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The setting is singular and fully operational: the opal library’s rules and tools (lantern, balcony, jars, moorings) guide tactics and charge the ending image. Recurring objects (chime, lantern, ropes) constrain choices and recur in the final act. Sensory specificity is high across modalities without tourist listing. World logic is consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (“unless I hurry”), and pressure coheres: wind’s warning → guided repair under vow → balcony test. The decisive tightening comes with the hairline crack answering the sung catalog, raising the cost of inattention. The price is mostly internal (risk of losing a name; self‑reproach measured against the vow), not a stark trade‑off, but it’s felt and carries through the close.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of stewardship vs. romantic reunion is earned through concrete acts: “our work is not romance but stewardship of breath.” The ending reweights prior motifs (names, jars of dust, moorings) into a philosophy of care with quiet, durable consequence. Subtext about memory’s economy and the ethics of witnessing accrues without moralizing. The final grace note and moon “coins” pay the thematic debt elegantly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent perceptual signature (catalog numbers as song; cloudskin balloons) sustains pressure without head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with beats (hush in the repair; widening on the balcony) and elision is taught and honored. Diction remains character‑plausible for a ritualized caretaker. No dialogue needed; voice carries subtext and action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (foxglove regret as tone and ethic). Figurative language is lush but coherent and purposeful; cadence varies to maintain propulsion. Minor risk of saturation, yet key beats stay clear and uncluttered. No notable loops or scaffolding; the final images land crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise and imagery feel genuinely fresh (glass‑orchid caretaker, cloudskin balloons, sewing sound with sap‑gold thread). Turns and rituals grow organically from established logic. The balcony rite and grace‑note test give an inevitable, non‑obvious close. Bold lyric risks heighten meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
