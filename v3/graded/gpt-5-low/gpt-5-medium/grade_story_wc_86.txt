<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority with concrete micro‑choices under pressure: the negotiator sets terms (“no horns...”), shows the drawer pull to the conscript, and reframes the snag with the brass’s “two stories.” Secondary figures (Raglen, Della) are sketched with efficient, telling actions. The arc lands as Earned Stasis—holding neutrality at cost—without neat moral smoothing. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is present but could bite harder at the snag.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Single, coherent scene with a clean situational drive: the exchange, a snag, a deliberate de‑escalation, then completion. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise): the drawer pull reframes conflict; mist thins; metal cools—cost is conceptual and social, on the page. Orientation is crisp early; the moon‑phase synchronization elegantly sets the clock. Slight subtlety in cost (more felt than explicit) prevents a higher score.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The parapet in mist actively shapes tactics: slick “teeth of stone,” narrowed sightlines, breath‑coins, and sound carry pressure and caution. The moon, wind, and wet stone integrate with action and timing, not postcard description. The drawer pull functions as micro‑setting at closure, charging the final image. World rules (neutral ground, no banners) are consistent and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safe, principled exchange—tightens credibly at the name‑snag; soldiers’ held breath sharpens the moment. The negotiator’s agency drives resolution through reframing and the charged object. Costs register in endurance, restraint, and the grain concession. A second, sharper test or trade‑off could have intensified pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring particulars: neutral ground, “recycling mistakes,” moon‑coin/desk‑coin imagery, and “harvest” of the past. The drawer pull’s “two stories” line reweights meaning at the peak and in the final cool metal image. A few lines approach thesis‑statement clarity (“We are here to untether...”), mildly blunting subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual bias; diction and rhythm suit the negotiator’s cautious intelligence. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and status‑aware (Raglen’s nod, Della’s urgency). Distance control is steady; no leakage or head‑hopping. Minor risk of over‑lyricism is managed by scene‑tethered detail.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density; images do multiple jobs (“furrowed hush,” “teeth of stone”). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern‑taught; cadence varies with pressure. Minimal redundancy; syntax supports momentum through the snag to resolution. A hair of motif density around mist/coin risks saturation but remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a neutral‑ground prisoner swap mediated by a family heirloom repurposed as moral instrument, timed by moon phases. Turns arise from character framing rather than contrivance; the “metal holds two stories” concept dignifies risk and cost. World texture (seed swaps after ration winters, waterlogged stores) adds non‑generic specificity. Bold restraint in a quiet climax reads confident, not evasive.</comment>
