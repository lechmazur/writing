<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Iria’s motive—reviving the city without wishes—is coherent and enacted through concrete micro-choices (lantern placement, charter-writing, bell-ringing). Her refusal of “false comfort” reads as character-specific resolve rather than a label, shaping tactics. Internal contradiction is light; she’s steady more than torn, so cost is more conceptual than felt personally. The sailor adds light relational pressure but not deep status shifts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from solitude to communal activation, closing on a charged repricing: from wishes to witnessed labor, sealed by the bottle’s “ticking.” Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and causality coheres: invitations → bell → gathering → declaration → sweeping. Closure costs are conceptual/social and land on the page (“authority would be labor shared and witnessed”). The single-scene window holds without stray shards.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and mission-shaped: shells for invitations, lanterns marking the market, skiff as drafting table, tide as courier. The amber bottle functions as micro-setting/object that charges the final image and anchors planning tactics. World rules (wishes spent, backward fountains) are learned through use, not dump. Texture and specificity feel lived-in and consequential.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (revival without miracles) is clear and tightens as Iria shifts from solitary prep to communal commitment. Pressure escalates via density—plans become enactment when the bell draws people and Iria publicly forecloses wishes. Opposition is soft (no antagonist), so the cost is renunciatory rather than confrontational. Still, the bell-ringing and declaration credibly narrow options and start irreversible work.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (labor, accountability, and community as the antidote to exhausted miracles) emerges through concrete acts and objects, crescendoing in the bottle-as-clock. A few lines edge toward didactic (“reimagine an entire civilization”), but they’re earned by the scene’s work. The final ticking reweights earlier images without stating a moral. Subtext breathes in choices like “no gods were named” and disputes danced before debated.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The lyric third-person voice is distinct and controlled, with patterned diction that the piece teaches early and sustains. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (“something that asks instead of answers”). Psychic distance stays stable; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates well from solitary meditation to communal cadence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with clean propulsion; figurative language is fresh and coherent (“prices must first exist,” “a clock waiting for hands”). No paraphrase loops or template cadences; images do multiple jobs without purple haze. Syntax varies to match beats, and punctuation is crisp. The final sentence lands clean and charged.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—post-wish civic rebuilding via an unopenable bottle that holds design—is striking and integrated. Tactics like shells-as-invitations and “working memory” as method feel inventive and necessary. Risks (lyric civic theory in a short scene) pay off in a specific, inevitable-feeling synthesis. The final repricing is fresh and memorable.</comment>
