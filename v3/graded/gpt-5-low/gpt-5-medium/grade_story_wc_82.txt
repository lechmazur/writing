<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—retrieve/relieve the loss of his shadow by crafting grief into cranes—and every choice (polishing, lens‑fitting, offering) aligns under pressure. Embodied emotion is expressed through tactile craft (“roughness scratches what should be cradled”), avoiding therapy‑speak. The final acceptance—ache loosens though the shadow doesn’t return—reads as earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor limitation: internal contradiction is muted; he rarely wavers in‑scene.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strong accumulative/textural build from ascent to nave offering; pattern density increases (steam, prisms, cranes) until the shadow’s “faint hand” delivers an on‑page RR with cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the rule‑set (lanterns sip dreams; stairs invert) is taught through action. Closure is paid: he does not get the shadow back; instead a reweighted stasis lands. One hairline: the abbess’s “stair turned” bell as a structural hinge is slightly arbitrary but not harmful.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The basilica/tea garden system isn’t mere backdrop; its physical logic (spiral stairs, irised panes, kettles, tethered island) shapes tactics and charges the final image of lanterns drifting. Tools (brass‑reed lanterns, lenses) and environment co‑produce visions and cranes. Sensory orchestration is rich and purposeful across senses (steam, hiss, bells, color). The world’s rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is explicit early and pressure coheres via ritual steps: craft → vision rupture → offering → shadow’s test. The key tightening is the nave release where his expectation is tested and he accepts a partial, costly outcome. Agency drives escalation; coincidence doesn’t resolve. Stakes stay intimate but consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Craft as mourning and transformation (“thicken light,” “sip dreams”) integrates theme without moralizing, culminating in a resonant answer: acceptance and redistribution of pain rather than restoration. Recurring images (ribbons, cranes, lenses) reweight at the end. Ambiguity is meaningful—loss remains—and the afterimage lingers. No overt thesis statements intrude.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a steady single POV; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (from meticulous craft to brightened nave). Purposeful elision (shadow detachment night) is grounded by present cues and pays off in the rupture/return beats. Dialogue is minimal but textured (abbess’s paradox). No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; lines advance action, world, and emotion simultaneously. Lushness avoids muddle—the metaphors cohere to glass/light/steam/craft. Minor risk of saturation is managed by concrete actions (“powder… felt… spit and sleeve”). No loops or cadence templates dull momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: glass basilica, dream‑sipping lanterns, steam‑folded cranes, and inverted stairs make a fresh grief ritual that feels inevitable in hindsight. Turns arise from established rules, not late conveniences. Bold yet coherent risk‑taking heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Only the tiniest familiarity in “lost shadow” myth keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>
