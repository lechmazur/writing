<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is precise (find/understand the father via “thresholds”), and the refusal to descend is an earned endurance with cost. Interiority is specific and embodied through grain, wind codes, and the terrace’s mechanics. The contradiction—longing vs. keeping distance—operates in-scene and culminates at the seam. Minor abstraction in a few thematic statements does not blunt the emotional throughline.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of codes→grain→seam→opening→choosing distance. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the narrator declines descent, reconfiguring “sacred thresholds,” with ache as cost. Orientation is taught early and feeds the ending’s logic. The chain of discoveries feels inevitable within the story’s rules.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is singular and operative: the prism terrace’s seam literally opens options and frames the final choice. Bench grain, lightning scars, and color facets aren’t decorative; they function as instruments of reading and revelation. The environment constrains and charges the last image. Sensory selection is purposeful and character-filtered.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through a deepening: deciphering the bench and codes tightens toward the seam and the orchard-center revelation. The decisive narrowing is the choice to maintain distance, sacrificing a reunion impulse for a principled stance. Stakes remain intimate but clear; the ache is palpable. Slightly low external opposition, but under the accumulative lens, escalation is sufficient.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme (“necessary distances,” sacred thresholds) emerges from concrete acts—reading weather codes in wood, the seam’s function, the refusal to descend. The line “It is not doors that are holy…” risks baldness but is earned by prior particulars and is reweighted by the closing image. The final stance answers the central question without moralizing. Resonance lingers with plausible ambiguity about the father and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, confident, and coherently lyric; diction and syntax match a precise perceptual signature. Metaphoric control stays consistent with the world’s rules, and the cadence modulates toward the closing widening. No head‑hopping and no gratuitous elision. The fold of the logbook at the end clicks tonally and narratively.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High-density prose with clean momentum; images do double duty (atmosphere and action). Figurative language is controlled and non-redundant; no scaffolding loops or mixed metaphors in the peak beats. Minor lushness never muddies causality. Sentences breathe and tighten in step with discovery.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a drifting prism terrace, meteorological code over wood grain, and “necessary distances” as ethic. The father/maze architect premise is reimagined through a unique interpretive method and setting, not a trope reskin. The refusal-to-descend closure feels both surprising and inevitable. Risk-taking heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>
