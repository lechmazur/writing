<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lio’s motive is clear and particular—an ache to understand why some voices persist—and choices under pressure (testing against longing, using the shell, singing the pot song) expose contradictions (rope-cutter vs knot-maker). Embodied details (ribs as “a small river of feeling,” the “three seconds” of stone refusing to breathe) avoid generic interiority. The culminating vow feels earned because it arises from evidence gathered and a personal cost reckoning (unsent letters, lightly left faces). Minor abstraction edges into thesis once or twice, but never derails the arc.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of call-and-world-shaped response intensifies from general echoes to direct questions to a personal test. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a conceptual repricing of “echo” as obligation/networks, with a visible emotional price in Lio’s self-implication. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when), and there’s no causality breach. The final promise tightens options and reweights prior beats with cost.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon nexus, reeds, currents, and shell are sensorially vivid and specific; world rules emerge through action (answers as environmental shapes). The setting constrains and enables tactics (singing into water, angling shell, kneeling in shallows) and charges the final image. The geography (“where the canyon angles like a question mark”) and micro-objects (shell) recur with purpose. Tone and environment are fused, shaping choice and meaning.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why some people echo—tightens as Lio shifts from observation to rigorous testing, then stakes personal identity by singing the mother’s song. Pressure deepens through the nonverbal answers (“silence full of teeth,” stone refusing to breathe), culminating in a vow that forecloses a prior self-image. The cost is internal and legible; no antagonist is needed under the chosen lens. A whisper more friction in the middle could raise the squeeze, but escalation reads clean.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme coheres: echo as debt/bond, speech as a hinge, forgiveness and obligation knitting names to mouths. The mother’s pot-song return reframes echo as communal and costly rather than mystical flair, and Lio’s vow resists platitude by tying kindness to clarity. One line edges toward didactic summary (“So that is why some people echo”), but the surrounding images keep resonance earned. Subtext operates in the environment’s replies, avoiding sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a stable single-POV distance; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure without slipping register. The perceptual signature (world answering in shapes) is consistent and paid off. Repetition (“through progressive disclosure”) functions as taught pattern, not filler. No head-hopping or explanatory overreach beyond what the focalizer can infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors that cohere to water/stone/rope motifs; sentence rhythms vary and propel. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; images rarely repeat without adding pressure or nuance. The climactic beats are crisp (“stone refuses to breathe for three seconds,” the doubled tone), and the final line lands clean. Lushness serves momentum rather than bogging it.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: echo as social debt/entanglement realized through environmental dialogue and a tool-object ritual. Risks in concept and diction pay off with a non-obvious, inevitable-feeling answer at the end. The shell, nexus, and pot-song braid originality with emotional truth. No reliance on template twists or generic mysticism.</comment>
