<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interiority and motive: to preserve ancient methods through rope reading and seed care. Micro‑choices under pressure (easing the splice, humming to let rhythm loosen time, choosing translation over unmaking) reveal values. Internal contradiction is quiet (patience vs non‑passivity) but credible and enacted rather than declared. The arc resolves as Earned Stasis with felt cost in time and restraint.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dock arrival to hidden splice to amphorae method to the test with fir seeds and dawn return. Orientation is clean from the first line; the rope/fulgurite pattern is taught and paid off. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—trust proven, braid intact—at a conceptual cost of vigilance and custodianship. The fisherman’s return seals consequence without breaking the quiet mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: golden snow‑veiled dock, fog, rope, glass, harbor all constrain action and perception. The rope and fulgurite operate as micro‑settings that shape choices (listening, not untying; placing glass lengthwise; working by fog‑softened light). Weather and materials affect tactics and the final image. Specific, lived textures avoid generic postcard cues.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—earning and preserving method and trust—tightens through the resisting splice and the obligation to prove the braid. The decisive deepening is the test with fir seeds, which could fail and would betray mandate or rope. Cost is quiet but legible: time, restraint, risk of damaging the working line, and responsibility taken in another’s absence. Escalation remains coherent under the textural lens, if softly contoured.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of attention as stewardship, memory embedded in matter, and intergenerational trust emerge from particulars (clove hitch drought, bowline tenderness, frayed mercy). The aphoristic line “You coax life with attention…” is earned by prior action and reweights the final care‑image. The ending reframes listening as communal (fisherman, weavers, harbor) without moralizing. Resonance lingers through image rather than thesis.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, confident lyric voice with controlled rhythm and precise lexicon; perception is filtered through vocation and ethos. POV distance stays stable, and pattern‑taught elision (the rope’s “grammar”) is legible. The modulation from vigil to dawn relief is smooth without register drift. No head‑hopping or unearned certainties.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative work tied to action; lines often do two jobs. Minimal redundancy; syntax varies to support cadence. Lushness never muddies sequence or cost, and the final image is sharp. A touch of ornate diction in places is balanced by clarity and momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Knots as tidal scripture and fulgurite as listening conduit are striking, integrated inventions. The synthesis of maritime craft and seed lore feels inevitable in hindsight and not gimmicky. Risks in lyric intensity and quiet stakes pay off with coherence and charge. The world’s rules are fresh, consistent, and character‑driven.</comment>
