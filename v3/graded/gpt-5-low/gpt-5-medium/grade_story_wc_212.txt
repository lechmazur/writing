<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (to keep and return “borrowed time”), embodied through naming, singing patterns, and planting. Interiority is specific and tactile (“furiously tranquil,” breath as “frost-laced bells”). The piece lacks pronounced contradictory impulses in scene; resistance or fear is muted, which trims complexity. Still, micro‑choices (naming Return, placing the cap, stepping through seasons) align with an earned acceptance of stewardship.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hatch → naming → alignment/singing → seasonal passage → planting builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and clean (who/where/when within the first lines). Closure lands: planting Return in the cap shifts the city toward spring with the cost of lifelong custodianship. Causal seams are lyrical but coherent; no teleports or unkept set‑ups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The icebound atrium, frost‑mapped panes, and object ecology (bottled ferns, citrus, the acorn cap) are vivid and purpose‑driven. Environment constrains action and charges the final image: cold pressure and glass respond to the vortex, and warmth returns only after the ritual. World rules are taught by observation (“decreasing entropy,” pattern‑unlocking) rather than dumped. The acorn cap functions as a micro‑setting tool that anchors closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keeping without clutching) tightens as the vortex demands naming, alignment, and pattern‑singing, culminating in the decision to plant it. The key deepening is the shift from storage to song; the cap placement forecloses possession in favor of stewardship. Cost is conceptual but legible: a vowed endurance (“as long as the pattern holds”) with relinquishment of ownership. Tension is quiet rather than perilous, but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: inheritance as pattern‑memory rather than property, keeping by “decreasing entropy” through song. Recurring images (cap, frost maps, breath, doors in pits) reweight at the end without moralizing. The grandmother’s line risks explicitness but lands as earned transmission, not thesis. The final act reframes time as something to be borrowed and returned, resonating beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyrical, and controlled; diction and rhythm feel native to the keeper’s sensibility. The perceptual signature (botanic lexicon, tactile ritual attention) holds under pressure and modulates gracefully. Purposeful elision teaches its pattern early and pays off in the seasonal passage. No head‑hopping or register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; most lines do double duty (image + action or rule). Figurative texture is rich but coherent; metaphors stay within the botanic/seasonal/mechanical palette. Minor risk of saturation is managed by decisive verbs and concrete beats (cap as hub, planting). No loops or syntactic drumbeats dulling the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>“Vortex inheritance” and “decreasing entropy” as ritual memory are strikingly original and integrated with stakes. The acorn cap as wheel‑hub and hearth, and doors in fruit pits, feel inevitable by the end. The piece takes formal risk (lyric, accumulative cadence) that heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth—stewardship over ownership—grounds the novelty.</comment>
