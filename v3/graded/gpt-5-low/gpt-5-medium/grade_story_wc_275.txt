<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motivation (tend mercy and continuity) drives concrete micro‑choices: asking visitors to sheathe knives, tying the scrap to a rose, redirecting blame into naming seedlings. The “bounty hunter’s pacifist daughter” paradox animates her restraint without sermonizing. Emotional texture is embodied through tools, heat, and sand rather than labels. A minor softness: she rarely falters; struggle is felt but largely managed.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure gathers as the trio arrives, ritual calms, and the father’s letter reframes the vow. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to tending until “blame learns to breathe,” with the cost of continued absence made legible. Orientation is clean by ~100 words (dome, aftermath, role) and the final image reweights prior motifs. Causality is lyrical but coherent; no unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dome, heat, and desert roses function as constraints and instruments, shaping tactics (sheathing, breath counting, irrigation storytelling). Recurring objects (ballast scrap, irrigation tubes, slate labels) charge the final vow and trellis image. Sensory specifics stay POV‑true and purposeful, with world rules consistent. Environment directly modulates behavior (derision “sounds like thirst,” heat “scorches their edges”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting blame into mercy—tightens when the trio demands the father and “the map to grief.” The protagonist’s agency (ritual, story, replanting blame into names) drives the turn; the laid‑down knife and nursery redirection foreclose confrontation. The price is endurance of ambiguity and the father’s continued absence. Escalation remains gentle but credible for the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of mercy versus debt, stewardship, and communal reorientation emerge through action (naming, sheathing, teaching roses) rather than thesis. The final pairing of letter and ballast scrap reframes cost and continuity with a resonant, non‑literal answer. Recurrent images (“engraved quiet,” “tranquil blaze,” shade over fire) shift meaning at closure. No moralizing; ambiguity around the father remains purposeful.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a stable close POV; metaphor and syntax reflect her sensibility and trade. Patterned elision is taught early and kept legible, with no head‑hopping. Diction stays coherent (sand/heat/rose lexicon) and modulates pressure without blur. Reported dialogue carries subtext and function without breaking tone.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density; most sentences do multiple jobs (world, character, pressure). Figurative language is frequent but disciplined within a unified field (sand, heat, flora, flight), avoiding mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies and momentum holds; minimal scaffold or repetition. A few elevated coinages (“engraved quiet”) repeat by design, not as clutter.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a pacifist gardener in a ruin teaching roses “values,” using a ballast scrap to transmute blame, and cultivating an “engraved quiet.” Risks in tone and worldbuilding cohere and heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns feel earned by established ritual logic. The final reconfiguration feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
