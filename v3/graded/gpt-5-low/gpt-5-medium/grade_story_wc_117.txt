<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rich, embodied interiority and micro‑choices (matching Ada’s tapping, asking to hold the locket, setting it on the guitar) reveal a distinct, competent but vulnerable narrator; Ada is spare yet deeply particular. The relationship functions as a crucible with palpable risk in opening and sharing the locket. The arc lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—Ada’s grief remains but is reconfigured, with a credible felt cost. Slight safety in uniformly sensitive responses keeps it shy of a 9+.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural build is clean: eclipse cadence structures the scene, stories deepen stakes, then the decisive linking of locket to guitar culminates in totality. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the grief is honored, not solved, and “wondering as love” reweights prior beats. Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality breaks. Tactics are consistently shaped by the eclipse’s timing and the therapist’s approach.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ridge, sage, amphitheater slope, and “roots like knuckles” are tactile and POV‑filtered, evolving with the light’s thinning and totality’s strange noon. Environment and objects constrain and charge the finale: eclipse triggers crickets and hush, the tree’s hush gathers them, the guitar body hosts the locket’s hum. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across senses. The setting actively participates in the outcome and final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Pressure coheres through a single tightening arc: as light narrows, the narrator risks a deeper intervention (asking for the locket; linking memory to sound) and Ada risks opening the locket and voice. Costs—exposure, re‑animation of grief—are legible, though the piece stays decorous rather than harrowing. The agency at the peak is clear and internal/external conflicts interweave. Quiet but earned escalation suits the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and motif repetition: ordinary magic as attention, grief re‑framed as wonder that keeps a question alive. The “wondering is a form of love” line edges toward statement but is earned by the linked images (wheat curl, question mark, iron moon of loss humming). Resonance lingers without a tidy fix. Minor aphoristic phrasing tempers the score slightly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first‑person with calibrated distance; diction and rhythms track the narrator’s sensibility and the scene’s tempo. Perceptual signature is consistent (music‑inflected noticing, breath and heartbeat cadence), with precise modulations at totality. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful. No leakage or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid and controlled; metaphors (“ravens wrote cursive,” “iron moon of loss”) are fresh and coherent to the world and voice. Density is high without sludge; no loops or scaffold. A couple of aphoristic lines risk prettiness but do not blunt clarity or pressure. Rhythm varies well, especially into and out of totality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—music therapy + eclipse + grief object humming through guitar—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risk sits in the quiet, ceremonial linking gesture rather than spectacle; it pays off. Familiar eclipse tropes are transformed by the locket’s question‑mark curl and the “hearing the hillside” move. Slight safety in uniformly gentle affect prevents pushing into the rarest band.</comment>
