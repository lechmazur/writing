<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A clear, particular interior guides credible micro-choices: tying the arrowhead to the cord, choosing stillness, tuning breath to birds, and finally casting the point. The central want (“learn to navigate without moving”) is dramatized rather than told, with embodied checkpoints (hum, flock patterns, tremor on the cord). Contradictory pulls—craft motion vs. chosen stillness; tool-use vs. renunciation—surface without overstatement. The closing choice to leave the stones and keep the cord empty reads as an earned renunciation with felt cost to identity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres through sound-patterns and avian grammar until the pulse “chooses a path” through the narrator. Closure lands on page via a resonant reconfiguration: the cast arrowhead striking the “exact rib,” then the renunciation of tools, which redraws options. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the method taught is paid off. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of implements and identity as a skimmer, exchanged for listening as travel.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The canyon’s bone towers and echo logic constrain and power every tactic (“bones were tuning forks,” “black mirror”). Objects-as-setting (cord, arrowhead) are integrated into navigation mechanics and charge the ending image. Sensory specificity is disciplined and POV-filtered (lichen scent on the echo, dust on feathers). The environment is not postcard; it’s the rule-set that makes the choice possible and costly.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear from the outset; escalation accrues through humming, flock patterns, and the stuttering pulse until the decisive intensification: the pulse routes through the narrator. The cast of the arrowhead and the leaving of stones represent narrowing options and a trade-off in practice and identity. Pressure remains coherent; no coincidences resolve it. The cost is understated but unmistakable in the yielded tools and the charged emptiness of the cord.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme arises organically—reverence, listening as locomotion, communion with ancestors—through concrete acts rather than commentary. The final reweighting (travel by agreement) is earned and lingers. The line “Hold still, the canyon says, and the world will carry you” edges toward thematic articulation, modestly flattening the implicitness. Even so, the last images (empty cord, birds settling, pulse less alone) deliver honest resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with controlled rhythm and precise diction; perception consistently filters through the skimmer’s craft-logic. Psychic distance modulation supports pressure without drift. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible to closure. No head-hopping or register slips; the prose’s cadence mirrors the accumulating method.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; sentences do multiple jobs and propel momentum despite lyricism. Figurative language is coherent with the world’s physics (echo as map, bones as forks) and avoids muddle. Minimal scaffolding or loops; visual rhythm supports beats. A slight profusion of metaphors in midsection approaches saturation but stays controlled.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—navigation via flock grammar in a bone-canyon echo system—feels fresh and inevitable once established. Risks (quiet accumulative arc, tool-as-prayer renunciation) heighten stakes without obscurity. The final reconfiguration (keeping the cord empty) is non-obvious and conceptually bold. Specificity and authenticity of vision distinguish it from template lyricism.</comment>
