<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and particular—transform scars into legible runes within a single held breath—and actions align with that goal. Interiority is embodied (lungs as gates, pulse unlatching, steam as page) and admits contradictions (shame versus ritual composure, superstition versus scholarly method). Micro‑choices under pressure (which scars to prioritize, when to drink) reveal values with cost. The change reads as an earned endurance: she reconfigures her relationship to pain through ritual rather than a tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a ritual sequence tightens under the breath‑clock as images and constraints accrue toward the final drink. Closure lands on the page with cost—“my breath thunders in its cage… With my last scrap of air, I drink”—a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis moment that reweights scars as story. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when and rules: platform, storms, held breath, tools). The breath constraint and storm metronome persist as a price shaping tactics and the ending image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The floating tea platform, basalt, storms, and tools are specific and functionally integrated: steam becomes page, tether runes under the rock mirror the on‑page rite, lightning provides tempo. Environment constrains choices (breath, weather pressure, platform stability) and charges the final image of drinking. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered (ink crystals reflecting stormlight). World rules are shown, not dumped, through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the rite within one breath—tightens credibly as lungs burn and the protagonist must choose which scars to render before time runs out. Pressure escalates via cadence and density (lightning as metronome, steam surface tightening, final sip) and the cost is felt. The resolution is earned by endurance and selection under constraint rather than luck. One clean deepening (third rune while breath strains) narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: transforming pain by revisiting superstition as a rigorous kindness; apology as weatherwork crystallizes the moral calculus without sermonizing. Recurring images (steam/page, crystals of fear, doors marked by childhood rules) reweight by the end as the tea is drunk and “letters settle in me as warmth.” The piece resists neat moralizing—fear’s doorways become passages without erasing their cost. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a tactile perceptual signature—ritual diction, weather metaphors, and technical tea/rune handling—sustained under pressure. Psychic distance modulation is intentional, tightening as breath runs out; no head‑hopping or register drift. Patterned elision is taught early and remains legible; figurative choices stay character‑bound. Lines like “as if lungs could be sandglasses and panic a bell” exemplify rhythmic control without obscuring action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; figurative language is rich but purposeful and generally coherent. Rhythm varies to match pressure, and key beats are shown rather than summarized. A few dense metaphor clusters brush the edge of purple, but clarity and momentum hold, especially in the closing sequence. No loops or cadence templates dull the climax.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis feels fresh: tea ceremony as rune‑making on a floating platform, steam as page, stress‑crystallizing ink, and superstition repurposed as method. Emotional truth grounds the invention—shame, apology, and embodied breath constraint. Risks (lyric density, quiet ritual closure) heighten stakes without muddle. The final reconfiguration—scars as letters ingested—feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
