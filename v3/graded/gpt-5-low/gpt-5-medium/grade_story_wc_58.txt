<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, specific motivation and vocation shape every move; the narrator’s empathy and “clerk of explained absences” stance feel earned and embodied. Internal contradiction is subtler—duty versus the bodily cost of crossing that “bridge of presence”—but not deeply contested on the page. The intimacy with the client at the fountain reveals character under pressure. The final act (looping the thread on the woman’s wrist) credibly forecloses a path of denial.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual (thread, knots, projection) deepens pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as the obituary reframes absence and the quince “approve,” and the woman’s weeping irrigates rather than breaks. Orientation is clean early (harbor, closed gate, garden) and the rules are taught through action. The final image reweights the premise without over-explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The garden, fountain, quince, and thread function as charged environment; the closed city gate funnels the meeting into this specific autumnal micro‑setting. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful (“leaves like small coins,” quince dropping in response to reading). The setting shapes options (shelter, quiet, ritual terrain) and decisively charges the ending. World rules remain consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—naming a living absence—tightens as the narrator moves from request to crossing to composition to transfer of the thread. The “because/therefore” is lyric but coherent: hiring → projection → encounter → document → reconfigured domestic path. Costs are felt (salt/brass in breath; the woman’s irrigating weep), though the pressure remains gentle rather than harrowing. The earned stasis—acceptance without return—forecloses a prior need (setting a second cup).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Absence/presence is explored through concrete acts (boots by the hearth; the humming thread; the space beside the teacup as “small inland sea”). The final repricing is precise and unsentimental: he has “died to the shape,” transforming grief’s frame without neat moral. Recurring images (harbor, thread, quince) accrue meaning and resolve in a resonant, non‑literal answer. No sermonizing; ambiguity feels purposeful and humane.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature; metaphors arise from the narrator’s trade and the maritime frame. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual (“latitude is crueler because it changes nothing around me”). POV remains stable, with taught elisions (the bridge walk) paid off by tactile return. Rhythm modulates appropriately at the peak beats.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is elegant and information‑dense; images often do double duty (“a faithful clock keeps the wrong weather”). Figurative texture is rich but largely coherent and disciplined, with minimal redundancy. A few stacked metaphors approach saturation, yet clarity and propulsion hold, particularly around the crossing and the reading. Final cadence is clean and memorable.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise (obituaries for the living) braided with a tactile ritual (palace weft thread) feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The “projected presence” method and map of pauses offer a non‑obvious, integrated system. Risks in diction and structure heighten meaning without obscuring it. Emotional specificity and world‑logic cohere into a singular vision.</comment>
