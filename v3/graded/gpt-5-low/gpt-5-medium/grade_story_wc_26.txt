<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mira’s motives (preserve hope vs. protect the library’s balance) drive concrete choices—agreeing to help, using the river stone, bargaining with the vines, and paying with her stored dreams. Interiority is embodied and specific (“trained by years of listening to colors fade”), not label‑speak. The cost lands on her—she loses the life she didn’t live—an earned renunciation. Minor note: Ilen is lightly sketched but functions as focused pressure rather than dilution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: image‑linked beats gather until one decisive sacrifice reweights the field. Causality is clean (vines tighten → trade offered → personal dreams sacrificed → shadow reunites), and the closure’s cost is on the page. Orientation is swift and legible from the opening. The ending functions as Resonant Reconfiguration: a paid price changes options and meaning.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The library is not backdrop but pressure system: vines constrict, shelves “sigh,” blossoms ink her name—environment dictates tactics and exacts price. The balcony and mist‑rooted orchards are used in action, not just described. The river stone as micro‑setting/tool charges the final image. Vivid sensory choices stay POV‑filtered and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (reuniting the shadow without breaking the library) and tightens when the library resists, forcing a trade. The sacrifice of her stored dreams is a visible price that alters the end state. Escalation is coherent under the chosen lens; no coincidental bailout. Slight softness: the vow to the leaves works quickly, but the paid cost preserves rigor.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: hope as an archival act with cost, belonging reclaimed through traded regret. The river stone and vines evolve from image to ethic, avoiding moralizing while delivering an answer in action. “Joy arrive carrying luminous regret” reframes victory with consequence. Ambiguity remains thoughtful, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice filtered through Mira’s sensibility sustains precision without drift. Psychic distance is steady; elision patterns are taught early and paid off. No head‑hopping; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (vines tightening → terse, consequential moves). Confidence matches what Mira can plausibly infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density: metaphors do multi‑work and rarely blur sense; images advance plot and theme. Cadence varies with momentum, and there’s no paraphrase scaffolding. Lushness skirts purple but stays disciplined by action (stone placement, bargaining, pouring dreams). Final lines strike clean and charged without over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “blooming library above clouds” with shareable dreams and an unbound shadow feels singular and integrated, not ornamental. The rescue via archival footage, a river stone, and a bargain with living stacks synthesizes premise and emotion with inevitability in hindsight. Risky lyric mode pays off with clarity and cost. Memorable images serve character stakes rather than surface novelty.</comment>
