<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and particular (seek the stillpoint to learn grief’s contours, not erase it), and micro-choices under pressure (following pitches, kneeling, dowsing, consenting to “axis”) align with that drive. Interiority is embodied and idiosyncratic (skin-language, ring temperature) rather than labeled. The internal contradiction—merchant of certainties vs. refusal of erasure—registers, though frictive ambivalence could sharpen earlier. The final endurance choice (carry grief as axis) reads earned with a felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic cues and tactile languages densify toward the clearing where the ring chills and the stillpoint manifests. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—accepting an axis rather than escape—paid with keeping sorrow alive in the body. Orientation is clear early (blind mapmaker in an ultrasonic forest at a cosmic pause), and the platinum ring functions as a persistent constraint/gauge shaping tactics. The end reweights prior beats (“map is inside me”) with a clear before/after.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest and platinum ring are deeply integrated as environment and tool; ultrasound dictates navigation and the ring’s thermal feedback constrains choices. Sensory detail is inventive and POV-tailored (touch-language, moth idioms, fern script). World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. The final image is charged by setting logic (constellations resume; the pause braided into pulse).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are singular (find the stillpoint to reorient grief), with a meaningful tightening at the clearing where silence “weapons” and the ring’s sudden cold forces a kneeling, dowsing choice. The price is explicit: refusal to erase sorrow, choosing axis over anesthesia. Pressure escalates texturally via sonic density and interval sharpening rather than reversals. A slightly sharper moment of jeopardy or potential misread might have intensified the cost signal further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme arises organically: cartography of feeling, acceptance as navigation, axis vs. escape. Recurring images (ring, notes, constellations, hearth) shift meaning at the end without moralizing; the line “not to guide them away from sorrow” edges toward statement yet remains grounded in action. The stillpoint reframes mapping as marrow, not ink—a conceptual repricing with emotional aftertaste. Ambiguity persists productively (cost endures) without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric first-person voice is controlled, singular, and sensorially biased to touch and sound, matching the character’s condition and method. Rhythm modulates with pressure (intervals sharpen, then hush), and diction stays coherent. No head-hopping; uncertainty is purposeful and paid off at closure. The mother’s rhythm memory threads in cleanly, enriching focalization without derailing the scene.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with minimal scaffold; metaphors are fresh and largely coherent (“axis…radius,” “harbor where my lover departed”). A few high-lyric clusters flirt with saturation, but cadence and clarity hold, especially at the peak beats. Syntax varies and propels; no notable loops or template stems. The final image is crisp and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis feels distinctive: ultrasonic forest, a humming platinum ring as affect-dowsing instrument, and skin-absorbed languages cohere into a fresh cartography of grief. The risk of dense lyric abstraction pays off through grounded tactile mechanics and a non-obvious ending stance. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the taught pattern. Specificity resists template lyricism.</comment>
