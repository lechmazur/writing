<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lida’s motive—evolve tradition with intent—is clear, rooted in lived history and embodied via her plant‑telepathy and insurgent past. The oath to wait versus her choice to act supplies credible internal tension without melodrama. Micro‑choices (following the reeds, confronting the council, unsealing alone) align with her values. The emotional cost is mostly social and implied rather than deeply felt on the page.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: kite message → council refusal → secret unsealing → embryo becomes learning tree. Orientation is early and solid; lens reads primarily Causal with a closing RR/DC that reconfigures communal options. Cost is present (defying the council, breaking an oath) but not heavily dramatized beyond the morning argument. Closure is on page and alters the world’s available choices.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The volcanic springs constrain tactics and become the enabling mechanism (“mirror of fire water”) for the unsealing, then charge the final image with steam and reconstruction noise. World rules are learned through action (vault under the hottest pool; reeds as informants). Details are purposeful and POV‑filtered. Environment decisively shapes the outcome, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (who steers tradition) is signaled early and tightens at the council’s refusal, prompting Lida’s transgressive act. The escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven, culminating in the embryo’s transformation. The felt price is relatively light—pushback arrives but softens fast once the tree manifests. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the conflict resolves smoothly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme (“intent vs implanted destiny”) emerges through concrete images—nails in seed, trellis, reeds as chorus—and culminates in a non‑literal answer: a listening seedling rather than a nailed fate. The kite’s clandestine rhymes and the final communal scaffold reweight tradition without sermonizing. One line nears thesis‑statement territory, but the imagery carries the resonance. The ending lingers as a conceptual repricing with communal cost/benefit.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A singular, lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and precise diction; focalization holds to Lida’s sensorium even as the “our” frame names her. Patterned elision (reeds whispering) is taught and consistent. No head‑hopping or register slips; dialogue is minimal but functional. The voice modulates at pressure points without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with clean propulsion; images do layered work (“amber rind opened like a wet book”). Figurative language is fresh and coherent; no loops or scaffold deadweight. Syntax varies to suit tempo, and the final cadence lands with precision. No artifacting or muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: insurgent horticulture, plant‑telepathy, kite‑code, and geothermal ritual refashion the destiny/tradition debate. Turns grow organically from these specifics, and the closure image feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking is bold but not gimmicky. The piece asserts a distinctive artistic stance.</comment>
