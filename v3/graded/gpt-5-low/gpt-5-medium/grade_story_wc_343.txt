<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct, embodied voice with concrete motives—diligent curiosity, humility, and professional focus—drives choices (brew, observe, decode, request trust, steer). Internal contradiction is subtle (quiet obedience vs. risky initiative), but present. Agency is consistent and earned; the apprentice’s pattern-reading under pressure reveals character. A slightly greater felt conflict or cost would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with accumulative texture and clean causal links: observation → pattern recognition (dog-ear + hopscotch) → enlist helmsman → figure-eight maneuver → release of light. Orientation is clear early (airship at dusk, night watch), and closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a resonant reaffirmation of purpose. Cost is felt (risk, static, the plea for trust), though it’s modest. The pattern teaching and payoff are coherent and satisfying.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere and specificity are superb: rigging halos, altimeter, kettle, envelope, compass, and dusk fields all filtered through a map apprentice’s priorities. Environment and objects constrain choices (airship maneuverability, figure‑eight, static, birds guiding the hull) and charge the final image (“phrasebook corner pinned to the stars”). World rules (snared light lanes) emerge through action, not exposition. Balanced sensory detail supports tone without drag.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free and map the stranded luminance—tightens plausibly as the glow intensifies, the static rises, and the apprentice commits to a childlike code under real navigational risk. The request for the helmsman’s trust and the controlled figure‑eight provide the decisive tightening. The price—danger of entanglement, social risk, and bodily charge—is felt but not deeply scarring. Escalation is clean, if gently scaled.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Language, motion, and light braid into a coherent theme: play and translation as methods of discovery. Recurring objects (dog‑ear, hopscotch, instruments) reweight meaning at the end. One line edges toward thesis declaration (“I will find it where language becomes motion...”), slightly reducing the necessity of inference. Still, the final charged watchfulness and “phrasebook corner pinned to the stars” resonate beyond the plot.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Singular, confident first‑person voice with rhythmic control and precise lexicon (“elastic bodies,” “gauze soaked in mint,” “lantern slats”). Psychic distance and focalization stay steady; any elision is purposeful and pattern‑taught. Minimal dialogue is apt and subtextual (“asked for a fingertip of trust”). Diction consistently fits character and moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; figurative language remains coherent and scene‑relevant. No scaffold loops or template cadence; momentum holds through sensory specificity and action. A few lush metaphors cluster in peak beats but do not blur causality. Overall polish is near‑publication quality.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: antique airship + stranded light lanes + hopscotch/phrasebook semiotics + murmuration as guide. The decoding method is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and style pay off without opacity. The piece feels singular rather than templated.</comment>
