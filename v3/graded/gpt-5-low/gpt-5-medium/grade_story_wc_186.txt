<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and motive: the custodian seeks both to save wanderers and to “prove that coincidences have meaning.” Micro‑choices under pressure (trading water for the map, trimming and seating the shard, aligning mirrors) reveal values. Internal tension—skepticism vs faith in coincidence—stays subtle but present, not contrived. Emotional embodiment lands in tactile beats (listening to the shard’s “mute cries” with wrists).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative end: patterning of hush/prism/star paths deepens into a cadence shift at rekindling and communal answer. Orientation is immediate and steady; causal logic of the fix is clean (missing constellation → hush as seam → insertion). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: light as belonging; the cost is felt but quiet (risk, surrender to meaning, the trimming/fit). Slight softness in explicit, low‑friction success keeps it just below top band.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pavilion, prism, ribs, and shard are not scenery; they constrain tactics and charge the final image. World rules are learned through action (tuning ribs, aligning mirrors, seam of silence), and sensory specificity is rich without unguided cataloging. The setting’s humming and retrocognitive “diary” directly alters choices and meaning. Exceptional atmosphere with functional specificity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to rethread people and meaning—is signaled early and tightens with the traveler’s arrival and the missing constellation. The decisive adaptation (using silence as a seam) narrows options and produces the turn. Cost is present but understated; failure risk and the shaving of the shard register more as lyric ache than bite. Still, pressure coheres and rises to a satisfying cadence shift.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of coincidence as stitch, memory as communal infrastructure, and belonging emerge through concrete acts (map exchange, shard insertion, beam’s hum). Final images reweight prior motifs without needing plot summary. A couple of lines verge on thesis‑voice (“This was not coincidence as shrug...,” “grammar of belonging”), slightly reducing the subtlety. Overall, resonance is strong and earned.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with coherent POV and clean stance; patterned diction is taught early and sustained. Compression is purposeful; no head‑hopping or unjustified certainty leaps. Minimal dialogue is natural and functional. Rhythm modulates effectively from solitary hush to communal hum.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lush without sludge: high information density and images that multitask. Occasional verge toward purple is kept legible; metaphor chain cohesion holds. No noticeable scaffold loops or cadence templates; the prose drives momentum even in reflection. Final lines land cleanly with image over explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: “shard of hush,” retrocognitive architecture, and silence as optical seam feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes and coherence. Turns grow from established particulars rather than late rule changes. Emotional truth underpins the novelty.</comment>
