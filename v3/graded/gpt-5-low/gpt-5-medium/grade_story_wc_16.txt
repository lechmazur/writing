<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motivation (“restore trust after silence”) drives concrete tactics (composing, staging, inviting a test). Contradictory impulses (“carefully reckless”) play on the page via the stele memory and the risk of inviting Lio back into dialogue. Micro‑choices—placing pages where the archive “listens,” offering the quill—reveal values with cost (vulnerability, ownership of past harm). Slight softness: Lio’s quick move from brittle to collaborative faces limited resistance, keeping pressure modest.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Hybrid lens with a causal spine: composing → summoning → testing → revising the coda; the closure lands as a collaborative reconfiguration with felt price. Orientation is clean by the first lines (who/where/when). The cost is legible in the new clauses (confess doubts, plan rescues) and the foreclosed path of mutual silence. The only hairline convenience is Lio’s shadow‑entrance, but it’s foreshadowed by the archive’s acoustics and the placed pages.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive is tactile and rule‑set coherent (shelves “sigh,” “every shelf has a throat”), and the protagonist uses those rules to act (placing pages where the room listens best). Objects (ink well, Breviary, lamp) are integrated into action and charge the finale (“lamplight seemed a promise kept”). The environment constrains tactics and enables summoning, satisfying the 9‑band gate. Specificity remains POV‑filtered through an arcane linguist’s sensibility.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and present: regain trust with Lio. Escalation deepens once through the live test of the movements and the shift to joint revision, with a visible price (naming fears, revising promises). Tension is more lyrical than combative, so the tightening is gentler than maximal; Lio’s resistance dissolves quickly. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is earned under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: truth needs accompaniment; trust as choreography rather than monument. Recurring musical and archival motifs reweight at the end without sermonizing; the “suite of promises” becomes shared authorship. A single explicit thesis line (“Trust... not a monument but a choreography”) risks being on‑the‑nose, but the surrounding scene earns it. The final image reconfigures the premise with resonance and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice consistent with an “arcane linguist” POV; diction and metaphors are voice‑motivated. Dialogue is spare but purposeful, with subtext and status shifts (brittle → aligned). Rhythm modulates well between reflective lines and action beats, maintaining clarity. No head‑hopping or stance wobble.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images often do double duty (ink as breath, shelves with throats). Lyrical figurations stay coherent, avoiding mixed‑metaphor muddle in peak beats. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but remain in control and character‑true. Sentence variety and momentum are strong through closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: musicalized promises as performative speech acts in a sentient archive of extinct tongues. The stele backstory recontextualizes risk and theme without feeling templated. The summoning via placed pages and overtone response is inventive yet inevitable in hindsight. Bold but coherent choices heighten stakes and meaning.</comment>
