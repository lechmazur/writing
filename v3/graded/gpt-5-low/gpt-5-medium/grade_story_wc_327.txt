<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is specific and sustained (to salvage a dying language) and choices under pressure reveal character: climbing to read birds, building listeners, apologizing to the canyon, and paying with a name. Fear of the curse conflicts with duty without neat rationalization. The final renunciation (giving the travel-name, then choosing to stay as caretaker) reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost. A hair more embodied stress at the moment of payment could push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: textures → sound via diamond and avian choreography, escalating to the curse’s price. Closure lands on-page with cost (“I offered my name... and the curse took it”), reconfiguring options into a living, moving record. Causal through-lines (each tool enabling the next tactic) cohere, and the ending’s ongoing caregiving seals the before/after. Orientation is clean from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The canyon and its tunnel constrain tactics and outcomes at every step; the flawed diamond and birds function as micro-setting tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the storyteller’s craft (“the wind stitched a grammar,” “rain score the rock”). World rules (echo as braille, curse as contract) remain consistent and are learned via action. The bone towers and echo-tunnel decisively shape the end’s living recording.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rescue a language before its textures erode) tightens as the tunnel demands payment, forcing a trade: a name for a choir. The meaningful turn arrives when the canyon refuses law/war and the birds scatter, prompting a tactical retreat and re-approach that culminates in the sacrifice. The price remains legible and reshapes tactics (staying as caretaker). A brief on-page beat of jeopardy right before the offering might have heightened the squeeze further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of extraction ethics, stewardship, and language as embodied texture develop through concrete images (curse as a “contract without punctuation,” vowels traded for grain). Subtext operates in refusals (canyon resisting law/war) and in the choice to feed the curse only dead names. The ending reweights the premise: a mobile, communal recording replaces print, with ethical protocols (“ask permission of the echoes”) embedded. No didactic moralizing; resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric POV with controlled diction and rhythmic variation; metaphoric register is consistent with the storyteller’s vocation. Purposeful elision teaches itself and pays off; no head-hopping or register slips. The voice modulates under pressure (from exploratory to bargaining to tending) without losing coherence. No dialogue needed; interior cadence carries action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is dense yet largely precise; images do multiple jobs and advance momentum. Minor risk of saturation is managed by varying sentence rhythm and embedding action in description; paraphrase loops are avoided. A couple of lush metaphors approach brink but remain coherent (“thirst like dry ink” is earned by context). Clean syntax and purposeful cuts to micro-actions keep propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: reading stone via a flawed diamond and flock choreography is fresh, and the curse-as-contract with supplied punctuation is an elegant twist. Risks (lyric density, conceptual apparatus) heighten stakes and remain legible, culminating in a living recording system. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established tools and rules. The piece resists genre templates while delivering emotional and conceptual truth.</comment>
