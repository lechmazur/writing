<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Iri’s motivation—preserving wonder against the Keepers’ fear-driven filing—is lucid and sustained, with embodied micro-choices (salting bells, angling the shard, refusing via demonstration). Seasonal muteness constrains tactics credibly and adds cost. Her trembling after the concerted refusal feels earned rather than declared. Secondary figures apply real pressure without stealing POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from pilgrims → Keepers’ demand → Iri reweights the field by sound, culminating in Earned Stasis (refusal via resonance). Orientation is clear early (bluff, bell tuner, post‑words world). Closure lands with cost: the Keepers leave empty-handed, and Iri recommits to guarding, marked by the ledger star and tremor. No stray setups or causal gaps under this lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bluff, wind, and kinetic array are not backdrop; they are the instrumentation that enables and limits action. The iceberg fragment, weather ledger, and powdered ice directly shape outcomes. Final images (“quiet punctuation,” ridge answering; foxes as commas) are charged by place. Specificity remains POV‑filtered, never a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: whether truth will be hardened into document or kept supple through resonance. Escalation tightens with the Keepers’ arrival and their claim on the shard, forcing Iri to choose demonstration over surrender. The resulting shift—Keepers relent—stems from her agency, and the lingering cost is the ongoing burden to “guard delight.” Quiet but unmistakable pressure throughout.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Thematic throughline—truth vs. wonder, language vs. resonance—emerges from action, not sermon. The music “answers with clarity no sentence could sustain,” and the ending reweights meaning (bow-as-punctuation; Iri’s charged endurance). Ambiguity is purposeful: both sides’ fears are legible, but the story stakes its stance in the chosen medium. No platitudes or overstatement.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A confident, controlled lyric voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“foxes…two commas”) remains consistent. POV anchoring to Iri is steady; assertions about others’ states are shown through image, not omniscient claim. Rhythm modulates under pressure without head‑hopping or register drift. Patterned elision is taught and maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is rich and purposeful; most images carry multiple jobs (world, theme, mood). Figurative density is high but coherent; very few lines feel ornamental. Minimal scaffolding and no paraphrase loops that sap momentum. Slight risk of purple density keeps it shy of 9‑band, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—seasonally mute bell tuner using kinetic sculptures and an iceberg fragment to answer in “symphonies of truth”—is striking and organic. Archive Keepers in paper garments provide a fresh counter‑pressure. The refusal via resonance rather than argument feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold choices heighten stakes without obscuring sense.</comment>
