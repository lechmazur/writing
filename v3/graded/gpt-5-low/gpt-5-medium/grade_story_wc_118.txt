<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The historian’s motive—collecting what walls have heard before silence erases it—is clear and drives tactile choices (probing the flue, stitching the fragment into his logbook, shelving along the new pull). Interiority is particular and embodied (“porous… like wind through an unlatched gate”). While contradiction is understated, the porousness versus solitude tension registers as an earned renunciation when he “volunteers” to absorb stranded stories. The visible cost is quiet but present in his acceptance of burden and reorientation of his space.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (tapestry, diaries, brass disk) accrue toward a conceptual repricing—dreams unseated, rooms woke, he becomes the listener of last resort. Orientation is strong from the opening and supports closure. The ending lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he returns the disk to the dark, whispers to the axis, and commits to “teach the walls to speak,” with the cost of ongoing porousness implied. The final near‑pulse in the silo reweights prior images without mechanical explanation.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: the reclined silo, ladder‑rung shelves, salt‑erased prairie, and displaced axis all constrain choices (he re‑shelves by the new pull, probes the flue where the diaries hid). Objects-as-setting (tapestry fragment, brass disk) charge the final image. Sensory selection fits the POV’s vocation and urgency (brick tone, breath of paper, mortar’s gossip). World rules (axis displaced, dreams finished) are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure deepens coherently under the accumulative lens: reading singed diaries, touching the tapestry, then finding the disk tightens stakes from curiosity to volunteered stewardship. The meaningful turn is his decision to align the library to the new axis and return the map to darkness—a foreclosing of passive observation. The cost is enduring porousness and responsibility in a world without dreams. Tension is quiet but persistent, avoiding static lyricism.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of displacement, listening as ethics, and custody of memory emerge through particulars (dragons circling a spindle; rooms waking in terror; maps belonging in the dark until asked). The final commitment reweights the premise: if dreams ended, testimony and inter‑wall speech must replace them. No moralizing; resonance arises from image and role acceptance. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection on who holds stories when sleepers are gone.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a strong perceptual signature sustains throughout; diction and rhythm serve the character’s attentiveness. Distance and stance are stable; elisions are purposeful and legible. No dialogue is needed; the narrative cadence modulates slightly as discoveries accrue and at the closing whisper. Confidence never exceeds plausible POV knowledge.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is polished: high information density, vivid verbs, and purposeful metaphor that coheres around axis, metal, and breath. Minor repetition (diaries in the fireplace) does not impede momentum. Syntax varies and supports propulsion without purple drift. The final lines compress action and image into a clean cadence that recharges earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—post‑dream world where an archivist listens to awakened rooms under a displaced axis—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in concept and lyric structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Recurring images (dragons, spindle, disk) are transformed rather than decorative. The piece commits to its premise and follows its implications to a charged, original ending.</comment>
