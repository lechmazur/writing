<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is concrete (“to discover the texture of time”) and compounds under grief and guilt from the burned library; pressing the shard, following the submerged bridge, and accepting the cost are credible micro‑choices. Contradictory impulses (“give grief exits” vs. being trapped by memory) act simultaneously on the page. Embodied, character‑particular perceptions (hedge designer’s angle/counting lexicon) keep emotion specific. The final acceptance reads earned rather than declared.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressing the shard intensifies geometry, pages of air flip, descent underwater, then the ring/path reweights stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with explicit cost—“accept that the present is a continual photograph fading”—and a reconfigured tool (shard to ring) that lays the final path. Orientation is clear enough from the first lines; pattern is taught and paid off. The price and before/after are legible in the last two beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is tactile and rule‑bound (bridges grow where footsteps wish; geometry splaying), constraining movement and enabling the underwater turn. Recurring objects (halo shard/ring) and the willow pavilion shape choices, not just mood. Multi‑sensory detail is purposeful (ants stitching sun to shade; iron/sap taste) and the environment charges the final image. World rules stay consistent through hyperbolic transformations.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the narrator can read/accept time’s texture—tightens as visions deepen into the submerged vault. The woman’s naming of the cost forces a stance; the narrator’s acceptance forecloses the fantasy of reclaiming the past (“I cannot snatch the past without tearing it”). Escalation is clear under the accumulative lens; the price is conceptual but felt. Slightly low external jeopardy keeps it just shy of the top band, but internal pressure is coherent and rising.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Grief, memory, forgiveness, and time’s abrasion emerge organically through bridges, photographs, and the ring’s transformation. Subtext works in the tension between maze design and “articulate hesitation,” and in the father’s angle/circle dictum returning in the vault. One explicit line (“Forgiveness is a labyrinth too…”) skews declarative, but it’s well‑earned by preceding images. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with a hedge‑designer’s perceptual signature (“Count the angles until you hear a circle breathe”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; diction stays consistent and character‑bound. Dialogue is sparse and charged, carrying subtext and pressure. No head‑hopping; elisions are pattern‑taught and legible at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is lush yet controlled; images do multiple jobs and momentum rarely stalls. Figurative density is high throughout, but the pattern is taught early and remains coherent, with minimal redundancy. Occasional intensifiers (“quaking reverie,” multiple rib/coral echoes) skirt saturation without blurring causality. Syntax variety and precise verbs keep propulsion strong through the final third.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—living root bridges, hyperbolic geometry, retrocognition via a halo shard—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The shard‑to‑ring turn is a fresh reweighting that binds theme and plot. Risks in diction and structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity (library fire soot “learned to speak in my breathing”) grounds the ambition.</comment>
