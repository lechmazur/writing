<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s “forgiving skeptic” contradiction is dramatized through micro‑choices: following Linnet, pocketing the tooth despite doubt, and choosing mercy while setting Ari’s shoulder. Embodied emotion runs through craft‑accurate bone‑setting and the ache of repairs at the end. Ari’s shame and endurance feel lived rather than summarized. The final renunciation—tell it plain, not witch/river tales—forecloses a path with social cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid drive, dominantly accumulative with clean causal beats: tooth → map → Ari’s emergence → shoulder set → shared decision. Orientation is quick and clear; the hedge‑maze garden holds the scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they redraw the map, leave the tooth, and commit to a new account with a real cost when the town “will clamor tomorrow.” The cost is legible on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hedge maze and secret garden aren’t postcard décor; they conceal Ari, shape access (forgotten door), and provide the fountain stone for the tooth’s release. Tools and objects (splints, magnifier, fountain, tooth) act as micro‑setting constraints and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (“mint and iron,” “fountain muttered”). The environment evolves with action and guides choices.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—navigating truth/mercy under communal pressure—tightens when Ari appears injured and confesses, forcing the narrator to choose action and stance. The physical conflict of the shoulder and the moral conflict interlock, with a visible price in social exposure and personal shame. Escalation is coherent under the hybrid lens; one meaningful deepening is enough. Slight softness: the town’s threat remains implied rather than on‑page tested.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Themes of mercy over myth, grief’s mineral residue, and “turning mistakes into constellations” emerge from objects and acts (tooth, map, bone‑setting) rather than sermon. The final “bright bones of the sky” reweights prior motifs without a stated moral. A single explicit sentence (“My motive was simple…”) edges toward telling, but the surrounding images earn it. Ambiguity around blame and myth stays productive.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled voice—lyric yet grounded in a clinician’s tactile lexicon—holds steady. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (calm patience during the setting; tensile hush around confession). No head‑hopping; inference stays within what this narrator could plausibly know. Signature metaphors (“aligning planets,” “bright bones of the sky”) feel native to the POV.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight, image‑dense, and purposeful; most sentences do multiple jobs. Metaphor density is high but coherent and voice‑motivated; no mixed vehicles dull clarity. Momentum rarely stalls and there’s no visible scaffold or synonym loops. A couple of explicit thesis‑like lines slightly blunt the otherwise pristine subtlety.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—bone‑setting as truth‑setting, a changeling tooth refigured as grief’s token, a maze‑as‑constellation map that’s redrawn toward mercy—feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in tone and lyric compression heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise transforms familiar folk motifs into an original moral calculus. Final reconfiguration is striking and memorable.</comment>
