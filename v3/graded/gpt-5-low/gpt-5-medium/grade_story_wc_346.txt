<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline—guard and delay doom—and micro‑choices under pressure (filing the bent tooth, adjusting counterweights, choosing to sing) flow from that charge. Contradictory impulses—fatigue and fear versus duty and reverence—coexist on the page (“If you must fail, fail singing”). Embodied interiority is specific (gloves so thin, breath of oil; “bruised awe” under the ribs). The Earned Stasis at the end (waiting with the flawed machine) feels paid for.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: mounting hush, trembling mechanism, needle lean, then vow and song. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the vow‑song reconfigures the function of the lighthouse’s beam and the narrator commits to waiting with visible cost. Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/when). The cost is legible in the relinquishment of warning for vow and the acceptance of potential failure.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse, pane of hush, and sea are integrated tools, not backdrop—they constrain tactics (sliding the hush pane, winding nested springs) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and professional (bevel gears, counterweights, oil breath) and evolves with pressure (pane thrumming with brittle fear). The setting directly shapes outcomes (the beam’s effect on riots, soldier, minister). The environment is inseparable from character choice and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (buying the world heartbeats) tightens as the needle leans and the mechanism stutters; the tangible bent tooth forces adaptation. The escalation peaks in the decision to transform warning into vow via song, risking failure to purchase poise. Internal and external pressures mesh (politics’ “thunder,” pane’s thrumming) without coincidence resolving anything. The price is endurance and the possibility that singing may not avert ruin.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of mercy, time, and flawed caretaking emerge from concrete acts (filing a tooth gentler; singing a lullaby that “named each storm and forgave it”). The puppet’s counsel reframes failure as a beginning, deepening the moral calculus without sermonizing. The final poise—salvation as time enough to choose; ruin accompanied by courtesy—reweights the premise with resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with a disciplined lexicon (mechanical and maritime) maintains stable POV. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at the pane’s thrumming and opening into the vow. No head‑hopping or register slips; the apostrophic address to the machine is coherent and earned. Diction stays within the believable consciousness of this caretaker.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and varied; images carry double duty (pane of hush as object and ethos). Figurative density is high but pattern‑true (time/sea/machinery) and never muddles action. No scaffold loops or synonym churn; sentences propel and breathe in step with escalation. The final line resolves by image and rhythm, not explanation.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The conceit—a secret lighthouse that adjusts a probabilistic doomsday through a “pane of hush”—is fresh and fully inhabited. Risks (mythic lyricism wedded to mechanical specificity; the puppet as witness) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight as motifs return reweighted (warning to vow; failure to singing). The synthesis reads singular and memorable.</comment>
