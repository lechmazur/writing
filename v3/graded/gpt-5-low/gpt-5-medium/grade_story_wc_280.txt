<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motives are clear and embodied through synesthetic perception and ritual caretaking; the cashier/conductor self‑image grounds choice when the ghost panics. Internal tension—preservation versus “finish letting go”—is present but understated. The decisive act (pressing the coin, speaking marquee letters) aligns with established traits. A slightly deeper on‑page cost to the narrator would push this higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten from coin‑song → echoes → visible fracture → anchoring the Star → door of leaves → charged stasis (“the timeline… learning our rhythm”). Closure is on‑page with cost: the duty continues, reweighted by the blue bell fading to a thread and the pact to “finish letting go together.” Orientation is crisp from the opening. The ritual scaffolds turns without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The hedge maze/orchard is not wallpaper: it rearranges under echoes, reveals the leaf‑door, and leans like curtains, actively shaping options. The coin functions as a tool bound to place logic, charging the final image. Sensory specificity is rich yet POV‑filtered by synesthesia. World rules (echoes, fruit, wind) stay consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes (prevent spill, stabilize memory/time) are signaled early and tighten when the fracture appears and the ghost pleads to anchor the Star. The narrator’s choice to bear the “heavy” blue bell and speak lost names narrows options toward endurance/letting go. Cost is felt as ongoing obligation and relinquishment of pure nostalgia. A single sharper consequence would intensify pressure further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Memory versus release accrues through concrete acts (echoes, marquee names, sweeping seats) rather than thesis. The final house‑light image reweights nostalgia as kind guidance, not indulgence, answering the piece’s question about what to keep and how to let go. Subtext in “cashier and conductor” and the ghost’s jealous gratitude adds complexity without moralizing. Resonance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is a distinct, controlled synesthetic lyric with consistent focalization and confident inference. Rhythm modulates well at turns (panic request → authoritative incantation). No head‑hopping or withheld knowledge gimmicks. Density is high but purposeful.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is vivid, economical for its mode, and avoids paraphrase loops; images carry multiple jobs (“apples bright as cues”). Figurative saturation skirts purple but remains coherent and scene‑advancing. Syntax varies and the final cadence lands cleanly. A few stacked metaphors could be pared for even sharper propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Stage ghost + hedge‑maze orchard + synesthetic ritual to stabilize a fractured timeline feels fresh and organically integrated. Turns grow from ritual logic and character duty rather than late rule drops. The coin/Star/house‑light synthesis reads inevitable in hindsight. Boldness is high without obscuring clarity.</comment>
