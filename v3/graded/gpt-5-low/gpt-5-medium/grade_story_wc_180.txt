<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The narrator’s vocation and flaw (“good with cracked timbers… bad with goodbyes”) drive choices, with the renunciation of opening the tin reading as a credible cost. Interiority is concrete and character‑particular (quartz eye, craft praxis) and actions align with motives. The relationship with Mira applies gentle, relevant pressure that modulates tactics (psalter reading, shove, shared work). The final endurance—waiting for the daughter—feels earned and forecloses an easier, self‑soothing path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from entry to ritual: mapping stress lines → improvising rite → bell/ribbon cutover → orchard shedding. Closure lands on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (cathedral “breathes on purpose,” narrator refuses the tin). Orientation is clear by ~100 words (cathedral/orchard, breach, mender POV), and all set‑ups (ribbon, bell, no choir) pay off. The decisive cadence shift arrives with the bell’s color‑taking and the falling “deciduous vows.”</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The abandoned‑cathedral orchard is tactile and constraint‑bearing: rafters creak, ribs to climb, bell rope to retether, fruit weighting choices. Tools and micro‑setting details (pruning hook nick, copper, spores) are integrated into action. The environment charges the final image (bell settling, readable rustle) and shapes tactics at each step. World rules (vows as sap/fruit) are taught through observation and consistent.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stakes (restart shedding/bridge generational wisdom) are signaled early, and escalation tightens via the choice to use the daughter’s ribbon to reactivate the bell. The ritual’s success visibly reweights the world (leaves fall, sap runs), while the internal cost—choosing patience over closure—lands. External opposition is soft, but the accumulative pressure and self‑imposed constraints maintain tension. The cadence shift around the bell provides the key turn.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: shedding vows as a model for grief, repair, and generational handoff. Subtext lives in images (misread psalter valued over perfect scripture; hair ribbon knot “like an answer”). The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer—persistence and patience—without moralizing, charging prior motifs. “Accidental wisdom” doubles as earned stance, not summary.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, confident lyric voice with a craftsman’s perceptual signature (stress lines, sap slur) holds steady. Dialogue is sparse but distinct and functional (Mira’s marble‑laugh, shove, questions). Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure at the bell and shedding beats. No head‑hopping or unjustified register slips.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Prose is precise, image‑dense, and varied in rhythm; metaphors are coherent to the orchard/cathedral/craft palette. Minimal scaffolding, strong propulsion, and high line‑level economy. A few lyric intensities cluster, but they serve cadence and do not muddle sense. Final images are crisp and unencumbered.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—arboreal vows, restoration craft, and familial renunciation in a cathedral orchard—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Tools, ritual mechanics, and institutional decay are transformed into a distinct myth‑mechanic. The bell taking the ribbon’s color is an original, fitting turn that reweights everything before it. Risks in tone and conceit pay off without obscuring clarity.</comment>
