<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong interiority with embodied, character‑specific perception (“let my muscles forget their covenant with the ground”). The contradiction—urge to defy gravity vs. the need to surrender—plays out in concrete micro‑choices (hovering a finger’s width, then lowering). Motivation is coherent (“retrace what I kept losing,” “labyrinth of self”) and culminates in an earned renunciation. Slight abstraction at times keeps some emotion at a remove, but the final choice reads credibly costly.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the rain‑seeded procedure teaches a pattern, escalates into the middle‑arch alignment, and resolves via Earned Stasis. Causality is coherent within the world‑rules (tablet warms → puddles rearrange → pathway → message → descent). Closure has on‑page cost (forgoing flight, erasing the tablet’s seed) and reconfigures the initial premise. Orientation is clear early (viaduct after rain; tablet), with one continuous scene.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The viaduct, rain, and tablet are not decorative; they constrain and enable tactics (puddles prescribe a path, arches decide the locus of change). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (“air smelled like cooled wires and wet stone”; “runes like coals under ash”). World rules are learned through action rather than explained. The setting decisively charges the final image of surrender and walking.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (surrender vs. continued defiance) tightens through the prescribed path to the middle arch. The key turn is the tablet’s message and the choice to lower, foreclosing the escape of hovering. The price—renouncing flight and erasing the seed—lands clearly. Pressure is internal but coherent and rising under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of relinquishment and re‑patterning emerge through image and action, not lecture. The “do not outrun what follows you” inscription risks directness but is earned by the procedural quest and is reweighted by the final renunciation. Recurring images (drop/ripple, darkening brightness) shift meaning at the end. The piece invites reflection without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and image‑driven cognition; perception feels plausibly the narrator’s. Diction and syntax vary with pressure while staying consistent. No head‑hopping or stance slippage; patterned elision is taught early and maintained. High‑density metaphors are managed without confusing perspective.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; lines often do multiple jobs. Lush imagery occasionally borders on saturation, but metaphoric logic remains coherent and supports momentum. Sentence rhythms modulate well into the closing cadence. No noticeable scaffolding or template loops dulling the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: rain‑seeded procedural generation on a glowing viaduct, a gravity defier negotiating fractured timelines, and surrender as victory. The closing act recontextualizes the premise with inevitability. Risks in diction and concept pay off without obscuring clarity. The object/path mechanics feel original and integral, not ornamental.</comment>
