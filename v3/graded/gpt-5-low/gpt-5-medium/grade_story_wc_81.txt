<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ossa’s motives and method—“a method of gentle suspicion”—are specific and drive all micro‑choices (waiting for the blackout, selecting documents, stamping evidence). Interiority is embodied (“pages dry like leaves,” “the way a promise leans”) rather than labeled. Internal contradiction is subtle (tender reverence for the archive vs. ruthless testing of myths), not dramatic. The final renunciation—hiding the stamp near the registrar’s journals—reads as Earned Stasis with a quiet cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: silence enables investigation → stamp tests → documents contradict doctrine → conceptual shift → protective concealment. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (“lowered, not lost”) paired with Charged Poise in the final image. Cost is conceptual and vocational—choosing evidence and secrecy over immediate revelation—made legible by the blackout’s end and the hum’s return. Orientation is clear early; pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is tactile and operative; the blackout’s stillness materially changes options and tactics. Environmental constraints (hum vs. hush, brine‑swollen drawers, sailcloth redactions) shape discoveries and the ending’s charged quiet. The stamp functions as micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered, not a tourist catalog.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth of origins versus rehearsed myth—is live and tightens through evidence reversals (minutes reveal imports, not weather). Escalation is cumulative rather than confrontational, appropriate to the lens, with one decisive deepening when the registrar’s margin reframes the city’s fate. Cost is mostly conceptual and vocational, not bodily or social on‑page, but it reweights options (secrecy, preservation). The final concealment forecloses the cathartic reveal path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of authorship, complicity, and the ethics of record‑keeping emerges organically from action (stamping, reading, revealing redactions), not commentary. “Lowered, not lost” converts the premise into indictment without sermonizing. Recurring images (hum vs. hush, violet oval, lacquered resolve) accrue and shift meaning at the end. Ambiguity remains meaningful—no tidy moral—but the stance is clear.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature; diction and rhythm fit a devoted indexer in extremis. The narrative distance is steady; inference reads as inference, not omniscience. The cadence modulates with pressure (search → discovery → hush/hum contrapuntal). No head‑hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs (atmosphere + action + character) with few redundancies; rhythm varies and propulsion holds. Figurative language is lush but coherent to the aquatic/archival world; no mixed metaphors that blur sense. A couple of highly ornate lines flirt with density, but clarity at closure remains intact. Proofreading and sequencing are clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Archivist‑detective in a drowned library with an ink stamp as truth‑engine feels fresh and inevitable once revealed. The “reclaimed stillness” mechanic is original and operational, not ornamental. Turns arise from grounded specifics (sailcloth redactions, plum‑smelling ink) and cohere. Risk‑taking in voice and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
