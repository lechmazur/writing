<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is vivid and consistent—turning the leaf into a bridge to her sister drives every act from barter to trek. Interiority is embodied and specific (“ears like folded flags,” “nose knew how grief fermented”). Contradictory impulses (longing vs. resignation to drought and delay) are present, with an Earned Stasis cost at the end (connection achieved, separation persists). Harbor’s small agency beat (dragging out the cylinder) adds relational texture without diluting the single POV.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: cylinders acquired → decoding via waxed leaf filter → instructions → dusk activation → contact → re‑priced understanding. Orientation is quick and firm (Sluice, post‑war, scrapyard economy), and the dusk constraint tightens the window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: they connect, but the world’s distance remains; the riddle re-reads with consequence. No teleports or unkept setups.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The Sluice’s salvage ecology, the cracked wasteland, and the scarecrow relay all shape tactics and the final image (barter, dusk travel, optical signal). Details are selective and POV‑true; copper, wax, dust, and wire feel lived‑in and functional. The environment constrains the plan (light angle, scarcity, terrain) and charges the climax’s amber hush. World rules are learned by use, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge distance to sister) tightens through a clear deepening at the riddle/decoding beat and a time‑bound dusk activation. The price is mostly emotional and situational rather than perilous, but it’s legible—hope risks re‑wounding; dusk is a single shot. Agency drives the turn: choosing to read, to walk, to hold the leaf steady as light fades. Pressure coheres under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens without coincidence resolving anything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motifs (scars/grooves, wheels/voices, distance as lens) accrue and reweight at the end; the riddle’s answer and the copper crow’s “voice” resonate. One line veers toward thematic explicitness (“distance is not a wall but a lens”), but the final understanding re‑grounds in image and action. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing elsewhere, with earned wisdom arising from scrap‑world particulars. Emotional aftereffect is quiet and honest.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A distinctive, coherent lyric voice with strong sensory bias fits the ledger‑keeper’s mind and world. Diction and metaphor are controlled, varied, and character‑plausible; compression and pattern are taught early and paid off. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful (vendor’s riddle; sister’s dusty arrival), carrying subtext. No head‑hopping or stance drift; psychic distance modulates cleanly toward the charged dusk moment.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; lines often do double duty (world‑build and advance plot). Figurative texture is rich yet coherent to scrap/metal/light motifs, with few to no mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies well and supports momentum; clarity holds in the decoding and relay beats. Slight risk of density overflow, but it doesn’t obscure cause/effect or the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a waxed autumn leaf as optical key for cylinder grooves, a scarecrow relay with a copper crow, and a retired cadaver dog as quiet partner. Familiar post‑apocalyptic salvage is made specific and strange in service of intimacy rather than spectacle. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (the riddle, the dusk filter) and avoid gimmickry. The piece commits to its premise with conceptual and emotional integrity.</comment>
