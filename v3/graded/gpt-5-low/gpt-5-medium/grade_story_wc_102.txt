<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, compelling motive (“to find where unused love is stored”) drives concrete, character-specific tactics. The internal contradiction between the mirror-maker who hoarded light and the present self seeking release plays on the page through breath and the camera’s shifting image. Emotions are embodied (heat surfacing with the tear; “storage closet unlatch behind my ribs”). Change is earned and forecloses a path of hoarding with a felt cost of decanting rather than drowning.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: breath-image interplay deepens until a resonant reconfiguration lands (“the glass itself becomes a door,” “I decant”). Orientation is taught early (twilight viaduct, camera obscura) and never slips. Closure carries cost—she releases hoarded love, changing her future options—and the final cadence (“feeling the viaduct breathe easier”) pays the pattern. The constraints and ritual (box, parapet, breath, tear) coherently chain beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and instrumentally woven: the viaduct, vines, arches, lamps, and river all participate in the ritual and charge the final image. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting and tool, constraining how the world can be “let in” and seen. Environmental details evolve with action (inhale/exhale reshaping arches and river). The ending’s tactile acts (packing the box) and ambient shift (bridge breathing easier) seal the place-character bond.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes are internal but legible: can she release unused love and undo a prior hoarding stance. Escalation arrives via the Kwan Yin tear, the breath-method gaining control, and the past-life figure turning toward the street. The man’s brief presence intensifies the communal resonance without solving the problem. Cost is felt as she relinquishes stored sweetness and accepts new permeability (decanting; room for the emptied jars).</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars—the camera obscura, breath, viaduct, tear—rather than thesis. The central question (“where unused love is stored”) is answered through image and action (“wherever we resist the exhale”), then reweighted by the closing decanting. Subtext hums in the bridge’s “former footsteps” and communal breath with the passerby. Any explicit lines serve the earned metaphor and avoid sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with rhythmic modulation matching pressure; lyric density remains legible. POV stays tight to a single consciousness; the brief dialogue line is apt and understated. Diction and image patterns (breath, box, river, arches) are disciplined and purposeful. The piece teaches its lyric rules early and pays them off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high information density with minimal scaffolding and strong verb-noun choices. Metaphor load is rich but coherent and tethered to the core conceit; few, if any, mixed vehicles. Rhythm varies well, and transitions carry momentum. A hair from overrich in spots, but clarity and propulsion are preserved through the peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original synthesis—camera obscura as interior weather, breath altering image, Kwan Yin’s tear as a listening catalyst—feels inevitable by the end. Risks in diction and structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The “unused love as withheld exhale” reframing is striking and specific. The final reconfiguration (decanting; communal tide) is memorable and non-derivative.</comment>
