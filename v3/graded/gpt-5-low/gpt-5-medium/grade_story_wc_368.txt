<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear motive (to understand story magnetism post–donor heart) drives specific micro‑choices: mapping light, tilting the wing, and brewing “indigo steam” to protect the widow. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (craft praxis filters emotion). The shift from attraction to disciplined stewardship constitutes an earned renunciation with a felt cost (restraint over capture). Secondary figures apply real pressure without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light‑tracking tactics deepen until the widow’s dangerous accretion forces an adaptive act, culminating in a charged poise ending. Orientation (who/where/when) is taught early and consistently. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—magnetism becomes posture with ethical cost—made legible by the intervention and the final vow. Causality is lyrical but coherent, with set‑ups (wing, light, donor heart) paying off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The floating tea house, rope bridge, paper windows, and sun trails are not decor; they constrain tactics (seat placement, timing, beam angle) and charge the final image. The blue morpho wing functions as tool‑as‑setting and recurs to shape choices and the last beat. Sensory specificity (steam as cloth, light as “river”) is POV‑true and purposeful. World rules stay stable within the lyrical logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ethical handling of stories) tightens when the widow accrues “borrowed tales” that may burn, compelling the protagonist’s protective brew—a real adaptation. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, and the cost is an embraced discipline that forecloses greedy capture. The subsequent week’s practice meaningfully deepens, not diffuses, tension. Quiet but decisive intensification rather than a set‑piece reversal.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme—attention as ethical posture—emerges through concrete craft and light, not lecture, and the final image reweights prior material. One line flirts with thesis (“magnetism was not greed but posture”), but it’s earned by prior beats and anchored to action. Subtext breathes in images (ash, sapphires, lighthouse) and in the donor heart’s “borrowed pulse.” Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a strong perceptual signature (craft metaphors, light‑lexicon) and stable single POV. Rhythm modulates effectively between stillness and surge without head‑hopping or register slips. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off; no dialogue needed. Diction remains character‑plausible within the fable‑like frame.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry multi‑function density and momentum; images rarely sprawl, and syntax varies. A rich metaphor load skirts purple but stays coherent and legible; no paraphrase loops or scaffold drag. Key beats are shown rather than summarized, with clean sequencing. Final image is crisp and recharged by earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High originality in premise and execution: a dye master using iridescence and sun‑tracking to steward stories in a floating tea house. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (widow pressure → protective indigo → lighthouse charge). Risks (lyric density, conceptual frame) heighten rather than obscure stakes. The synthesis feels singular and memorable.</comment>
