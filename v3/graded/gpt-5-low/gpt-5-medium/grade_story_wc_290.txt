<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Interiority is particular and embodied—the breath of a claustrophobe used as tactic, the “tightness behind my ribs,” and the chalk/compass micro‑choices under pressure. Contradiction (claustrophobic yet keeps walking) actively shapes decisions and risk tolerance. The retrieval and public threading of the key show earned endurance with a felt social cost (defying the Council). A minor limit: the emotional price is more atmospheric than cutting, keeping this shy of top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: organ + compass + alleys cohere and culminate in the Observatory repricing (“mutiny was…a hunger to be heard”). Causal links are clean—signal, chord, triangle transfixion, retrieval, exit, lock, telescope—no teleporting props or resets. Closure lands on the page via Conceptual Repricing with social risk implied (Council) and bodily constraint (claustrophobia) shaping tactics. Slight cap: the on‑page cost is felt but subtle, not sharply dramatized in the final beat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is a live adversary: alleys “shift like sleepers,” the nexus’s geometry resists, and tools (compass, organ) function as map‑enforcing devices. The church/organ and observatory/telescope charge the final image and shape choices. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action. Only the minimal cap from Q2 prevents a 9+ here.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve and use the key despite the city’s mutiny—tightens with the triangle transfixion and the polite‑guard exit; internal claustrophobia spikes twice to escalate pressure. Agency drives turns: choosing to prick geometry, to wear the key openly, and to confront the Council’s interdiction by going to the Observatory. The price is present (risk, breath, social defiance) but not sharply cashed on the page, tempering the peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of treaty vs conquest and listening as governance arise organically through tools, music, and geometry; the last line reweights the premise without moralizing. The “maps as promises” belief pays off in a gentle anti‑colonial ethic—cooperation with space. Resonance is strong and lingers; the lack of a sharper on‑page cost at the end holds this short of 9+.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct lyric POV with controlled metaphoric palette—stone’s “slow lungs,” doors as “elaborate shrugs”—consistent with the character’s perceptual bias. Psychic distance modulates with pressure (shorter, concrete action around the triangle beat) without head‑hopping. No register drift; uncertainty is purposeful and taught early. Minor density spikes remain legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; sentences carry multiple jobs (world rule, mood, action). Figurative language is frequent but pattern‑consistent and clear; no mixed metaphors that blur causality. Rhythm varies well with scene needs; no notable loops. A hair to the lush side, but momentum holds.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Original synthesis: negotiating a city’s spatial mutiny via organ reverberation and a drafting compass, culminating in a telescope that listens downward. The “treaty” frame and the final repricing feel non‑obvious yet inevitable in hindsight. Bold but coherent without gimmickry. Only the modest cost profile keeps this from cresting higher.</comment>
