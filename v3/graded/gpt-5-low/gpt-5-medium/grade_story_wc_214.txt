<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and idiosyncratic; the janitor’s empathy for machines leads to concrete micro-choices (matching breath to fans, kneeling to “align” ears). The internal contradiction—hiding after heartbreak yet choosing radical attention—culminates in a credible renunciation at the boundary. Embodied emotion (copper/tea floor, honeyed light) grounds the lyric reflections. The final stance (polish marks into guidance) is earned by prior behavior.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stillness → outage → lantern-lit communion → boundary revealed → charged poise at the open roof. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the choice to attend rather than pursue forecloses a path with felt cost. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/what). The power failure is a decisive intensification that coheres the piece’s pattern and pays off the early seeded motifs.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The station, roof, window, and lantern glass are tactile and repeatedly used; environment constrains tactics (power loss, opening roof) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“smelled like copper and old tea”). World rules stay consistent; age and budget shape options. The recurring objects (window, lantern) reweight meaning at the end.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to live with damage) tightens through the outage and the map of the “corridor of shadow.” The choice to open the roof and accept the old boundary is a visible renunciation with cost (not to chase). Pressure grows coherently without needing an antagonist. Internal and external threads interweave elegantly.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: maintenance as devotion, attention as action, damage as shape. The lantern/wiping/polishing motif reframes “erasing” into “guidance,” with the ending reweighting prior images (spared collision). One near-thesis line risks overtness, but it feels earned by scene work. Subtext with the dead engineers/ghosts deepens without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent—lyric but purposeful, with a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance modulates with pressure (outage tightens, closing image crystallizes). No head-hopping; elisions are pattern-taught and paid off. Diction matches the narrator’s sensibility and remains coherent under stress.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and images that carry multiple jobs. A few metaphors verge on saturation, but coherence holds and momentum doesn’t stall. No scaffold loops or cadence templates. The final image is clean and resonant.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a “cosmic janitor” empathizing with aging machines to find meaning is both surprising and inevitable in hindsight. The lantern glass as a small sun, the boundary respected by meteors, and the concept of “flourishing stillness” feel singular. Risks in lyric density and quiet conflict pay off. The piece commits to its premise without hedging.</comment>
