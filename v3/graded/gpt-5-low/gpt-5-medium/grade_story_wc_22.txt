<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is specific and embodied: he replaces conquest with listening and cultivation, and his micro‑choices (following birds’ “grammar,” cracking pods “with a coachman’s care,” training vines on bayonets) align. Interiority is indirect but vivid through tactile labor and old‑tongue “translation.” The arc is an Earned Stasis: he persists in costly, patient work against salt, wind, and history. A minor limit: little visible internal contradiction; his stance is steady rather than contested.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring acts (fertilizing cracks, reading birds, translating wind) densify toward the treaty image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: bayonets turned lattice, “treaty tightening,” and the final narrow crossing crystallize before/after in concept and image. Cost is legible in the reef’s death, the labor, and the renunciation of conquest. Orientation is clear quickly (harbor, jetty, mule cart at dusk), and the pattern is taught and paid off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is not postcard; salt, wind, and the jetty’s cracks constrain tactics, and the battlefield’s relics become tools. Environmental specifics evolve with action (lattice “tempers the wind” for seedlings). Sensory detail is rich yet purposeful, filtered through the coachman’s trained perception. The final image is charged by place (“narrow as mercy”) and would fail without this environment.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes—whether a living concord can replace a dead reef’s guard—are clear and deepen. The meaningful tightening arrives when he uproots bayonets and refashions them, foreclosing martial memory as tactic. Pressure is largely internal/ethical and accumulative rather than adversarial; the price is patience, labor, and choosing surrender as shelter. Slight softness in overt escalation keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Listening versus conquest, translation as care, and the ethics of repair emerge organically from acts and images. “Submerged concord” is not a thesis but a lived practice culminating in the lattice-as-surrender and the harbor’s “treaty tightening.” The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing; ambiguity lingers (ghosts are quieted, not erased). Resonance feels earned and specific.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The lyric third-person close carries a distinct perceptual signature (birds’ “grammar,” Phoenician “smells of rope and sail”). Diction and rhythm modulate with calm authority; no head‑hopping or stance drift. Elevated language matches the focalizer’s learned, ritualized practice and remains legible. Patterned elision is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with precise, original images; most lines do multiple jobs. Figurative texture is lush but disciplined, avoiding mixed metaphors; cadence varies. A slight risk of saturation in sustained lyric density prevents further lift, but clarity holds, especially through the ending. No loops or scaffold drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a coachman‑gardener translating dead languages and bird calls to reforge a harbor’s treaty is striking and coherent. Turning bayonets into a wind‑tempering lattice is an ingenious, earned reconfiguration. Risks in diction and conceit heighten rather than obscure meaning. The piece feels singular and memorable.</comment>
