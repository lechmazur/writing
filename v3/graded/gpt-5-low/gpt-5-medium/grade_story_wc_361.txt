<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The courier’s jittery impatience versus the mentor’s stillness method yields concrete, pressured micro-choices (asking the widow to breathe into cupped hands, holding the pitch, letting the corridor close). Interiority is vivid and embodied through sound and touch rather than labels. The widow applies present-tense pressure without becoming a prop. The ending’s acceptance costs the courier an extended miracle and sharpens the mentor-shaped endurance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ridge’s hum, breath, and pendant accrue into the corridor, then thin to a charged stasis with cost. Orientation is clear within the opening moves (courier, ridgeway, widow, parcel). Closure lands on-page: the corridor opens, then must close; the yew is seeded and the courier accepts the price of ending. The absent mentor’s rule set informs tactics and the final image without a mechanical “explain-everything” ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is not postcard; it hums, supplies the pitch, and the highest switchback choice matters. The pendant functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains action by dictating method and pitch. Environmental details evolve with pressure (green note, underside of color) and charge the final hush. World rules are taught through use, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake: enabling/containing a brief reunion under grief’s pressure. Escalation is a decisive intensification when the seeds germinate into a corridor; the courier must hold the pitch and then relinquish the miracle. The visible cost is letting it end and planting the yew (a foreclosing act). No coincidence resolves the conflict; it’s agency-driven under the taught method.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of coaxed wonder versus grief’s erosion emerges through particulars: bone tube/yew, breath/pitch, ridge hum. The final image reweights the premise into “planting continuance” with a conceptual cost and earned ambiguity (courier or gardener). No sermonizing; lines like “miracles should not be kept past their flavor” arise from scene truth. The mentor’s absence refracts meaning without tidy consolation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature—sound-led, tactile, green-hued—remains controlled under pressure. Elision patterns are taught early and remain legible at closure. Diction is consistent with this narrator’s trade and sensibility; no head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates as tension crests and releases.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is lush yet purposeful; images often do double duty (the pendant’s tremble as tool and emotion). A few high-density metaphors cluster, but clarity and momentum hold. No paraphrase loops or scaffolding slow the closure beat. The final line precisely reloads prior motifs without purple sprawl.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—a relic courier who extends encounters via sympathetic vibration on an aurora ridge—is fresh and fully integrated. The yew-as-corridor turn feels inevitable in hindsight given the bone tube and breath method. Emotional truth (choosing to end the miracle) grounds the novelty. Risks in diction and conceit heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
