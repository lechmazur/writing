<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (“translate silence into music”) drives concrete choices—building the system, aligning forks, conducting—and the refusal to elegize the sunk choir adds contradiction and cost. Embodied detail (“language of wrists,” weighting forks with leaves) keeps emotion particular rather than labeled. The endurance at the end (“permission to continue”) reads as Earned Stasis. Minor lack: the internal struggle in the present beat is understated, largely offloaded to prior attempts.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene layers system, audience, and gesture until a charged poise ending (“click I do not hear still satisfies,” “permission to continue”). Closure lands with cost tied to the hush and the capsized past, reweighted by the present translation. Orientation is strong early (who/where/condition of silence), and the backstory shard clearly feeds present tactics (algorithm rewrite). Slight softness: present-tense tension could tighten one more notch before release.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory, frost, mirrors, sensors, and forks are inseparable from the action; environment is the instrument, not wallpaper. Cold, sealed doors, and panes constrain choices and enable the visual score, charging the final image of carrying the case through a quiet city. Details stay POV-filtered and purposeful. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent (can meaning be made after the hush?) and pressure coheres when the doors seal and the performance begins. The key tightening is the memory of the failed first attempt and the on‑page correction via weighted forks and controlled flows; consequences register in the old woman’s warmed palms and the refusal of “cheap drama.” Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but still deepens cost. A single additional on‑page risk or near-misread in the current session could have heightened the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: translation over elegy; wonder as disciplined attention; community reknit through non-sonic music. The refrains (“unshaken marvels,” “rectify”) reweight objects and images without becoming mere labels. One line edges toward thesis (“rectify our posture toward wonder”), but surrounding specifics earn it. The final carry-home image conceptually reprices the world’s “hush.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a precise perceptual signature (engineering of light and frost through a survivor’s sensibility). Tense and distance stay stable; elision is patterned and legible. Diction is consistent with the narrator’s craft and history, and rhythm modulates gracefully. No head‑hopping and no gratuitous exposition.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with fresh images (“pocket of stars,” “library stores breath”) that do multiple jobs. Figurative texture is rich but largely coherent and purposeful; minimal scaffolding or loops. A few abstractions repeat (“rectify”) but are always grounded by new, concrete turns (leaves on forks, heat gradients). Momentum holds through the lyric mode to a crisp, resonant final image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: a post‑sonic world rendered through thermal music, tuning forks repurposed as waypoints, and a conservatory as lexicon. Risks in premise and diction pay off, with the visual/thermal score feeling inevitable in hindsight given the hush. Emotional truth (grief without elegy, communal witnessing) elevates the novelty. The ending’s lantern‑like case is an earned, memorable reconfiguration.</comment>
