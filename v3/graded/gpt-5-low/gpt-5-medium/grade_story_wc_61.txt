<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, coherent interior drive—“to share light without using fire”—animates specific choices (tuning the garden, triggering the petal‑rain, giving the gear to the child). Contradictory impulses surface credibly (“heirloom pretending to be alive” versus active stewardship). Emotional embodiment stays character‑particular through tools and textures rather than labels. Cost reads as ongoing vigilance and renunciation rather than a tidy epiphany.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds: travelers arrive with fire; the narrator refuses that logic and demonstrates an alternate transit, culminating in a charged endurance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they depart transformed by resonance, while the keeper remains counting—“infinity is only patience”—with a felt price. Setups (sonar, petals, gear, no‑flame rule) all pay off without amnesia. Causality within the lyric frame is consistent and legible.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The nebula garden and its mechanics (cool glow, sonar‑charged petals) constrain tactics—no flame—while enabling the alternative path. Sensory detail feels curated to POV and purpose, with recurring objects (gear, petals) charging the final image. World rules are learned through action (ships power down; rain ignites cool light), not exposition. The environment is inseparable from the stakes and ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clean: convert fire‑logic to resonance without harm. Pressure tightens when travelers “do not always listen,” forcing a pedagogical demonstration that requires them to cut burn and submit to the garden’s language. The cost is humility and relinquishment, with the narrator’s ongoing discipline. Escalation is quiet but decisive and consistent with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of non‑devouring light, inheritance, and chosen music emerge through action and motif rather than moralizing. The gear and counting reframe “infinity” from abstraction to practice, giving the final cadence a resonant repricing. One direct injunction (“Do not feed this place flame”) sits within scene pressure, not sermon. Ambiguity lingers in the narrator’s fear of being only an heirloom, enriching the aftertaste.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with precise metaphoric system (sound/light, echo/petal, gear/counting) remains stable. POV certainty matches experience; compression is taught and paid off. Minimal dialogue is purposeful and subtextual, with imperative lines acting as pressure. Rhythm modulates effectively from hush to insistent guidance and back.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; repetition (“approximate infinity,” “falling petals”) is patterned and functional. Figurative language is coherent and non‑conflicting; no syntactic monotony or filter‑verb stacks. Momentum holds through image‑action interweave, avoiding synonym churn. Final lines rethread motifs cleanly without overstatement.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—sonar‑lit nebula horticulture as pedagogy against generational fire—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Recurring objects and methods do real work, not ornament. The risk of ultra‑lyric diction pays off with clarity and a fresh conceptual engine. Closure’s restraint avoids genre cliché while delivering a charged new map.</comment>
