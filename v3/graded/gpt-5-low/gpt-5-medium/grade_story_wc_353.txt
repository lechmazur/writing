<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular motive (“to create music in a silent world”) drives tactile micro‑choices with embodied attention. The internal turn—renouncing “symphony” for “pulse”—is motivated and costs pride/cleverness credibly. Interiority is specific (bark, rings, pores) rather than label‑speak. The only limit is the low external pressure, which keeps flaws and struggle gentle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → assembling → sounding → repricing to pulse. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: tying the insulator as a promise and leaving the music behind marks a before/after with the cost of renounced virtuosity. Orientation is clean early (grove, sculptor, insulator, hedgehog), and all set‑ups pay off. The constraint (silence that wants pulse) shapes ending tactics.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: alder trunks “breathe,” roots and bark transmit sound, and the porcelain insulator as micro‑setting/tool charges the last image. Specific objects (broken telegraph line, grooves, stump) are used, not just seen. The environment constrains choices and provides resources (root fibers, grooves). The final promise depends on place’s properties (“stored inside living wood”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent: conjure living music without violating the grove’s hush. Escalation is a deepening shift—abandoning a symphonic aim for a heartbeat, narrowing options to endurance/attention with a felt price. The tension is quiet but persistent; the jay’s aborted call and the hedgehog’s behavior calibrate pressure. No antagonistic force, but the internal trade‑off is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through action and image: art as vessel, reciprocal listening, “empathy in motion” as practiced stance. The ending reweights the premise—music as pulse entrusted to wind and wood—without moralizing. Recurring images (insulator, cracks, roots, breath) accrue and then shift meaning at closure. Resonance lingers in the chosen renunciation and the communal “keeping faith.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature; syntax modulates to match pressure. Imagery is precise and character‑plausible for a “tree‑song sculptor.” Purposeful elision and metaphoric reach remain legible, with no head‑hopping or stance drift. The voice tightens around the pulse decision, then softens into the charged poise of the final lines.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density; lines frequently do double duty (world + motive, image + tactic). Figurative language is rich but coherent, avoiding mixed vehicles; repetition (“empathy in motion”) is purposeful. Minimal scaffold and no momentum‑dulling loops; cadence varies well. The only limiter is sustained lushness that risks saturation, but clarity holds through the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a telegraph porcelain insulator as larynx, trees that “breathe” sound, and a sculptor who plays a grove. The non‑obvious turn from symphony to pulse feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in concept and diction heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final promise image is memorable and singular.</comment>
