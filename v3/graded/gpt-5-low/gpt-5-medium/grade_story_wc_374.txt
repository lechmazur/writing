<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The narrator’s skepticism versus receptivity is dramatized in choices (trusting the ring’s tastes, agreeing to walk the final count, accepting to “carry your story”). Embodied interiority via gustatory cues (“citrus when we strayed near impatience”) reveals micro-choices under pressure. The relationship with Mirelle applies real pressure without melodrama. The closing renunciation of “alone” reads as earned cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: taste-patterns and forest-election ritual intensify toward a charged tally and a vow. Orientation is swift (bluff under aurora, ring’s function, goal stated), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (“I will let it carry me when the taste of alone returns”). Beats sequence coherently from arrival to quorum to tally. No causality breaks; pressure deepens by patterned images instead of plot machinery.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is sensorially rich and functional: the aurora, lavender bluff, and spore “ballots” shape mood and ritual constraints, while the ring as micro-setting constrains choices (the fork resolved by “honey” toward companionship). Environmental rules (forests’ elections) stay consistent and charge the final image. Sensory selection is POV-driven with taste foregrounded. The world’s specifics feel lived-in rather than decorative.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether belief can be grounded—tightens through Mirelle’s arrival, the walk toward quorum, and the tally where restraint wins. Agency is quiet but decisive: the narrator chooses proximity, trust in the emergent compass, and a new obligation. The cost is the surrender of solitary certainty for communal duty. Escalation is subtle yet clear under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme coheres: stewardship over spectacle, democracy of the non-human, and belief made tactile through taste. Images reprice the premise at the end (“north” becoming “us,” sky belonging to ground). Dialogue carries subtext instead of moralizing, and the final vow provides a non-literal answer to the opening question. Ambiguity remains meaningful without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular voice blends scientific precision with lyric sensibility; diction is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is spare, charged, and advances pressure (“We walk, and the sky recognizes quorum”). The patterned elision is taught early and sustained without opacity. Rhythm modulates to match beats, especially around the count.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is taut despite lush imagery; metaphors remain coherent to the sensorium motif. High information density—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, motive, pressure). Minor risk of over-radiant phrasing never blurs action or closure. Cadence varies and the final image cleanly recharges motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Conceptual synthesis feels fresh: taste-based navigation, forest elections, and weather-bearers converge into an original ethic. The piece takes stylistic risks that heighten stakes without sacrificing clarity. Turns arise organically from established logic (the ring’s palate guiding a choice, convergence as counting not conquest). Emotional truth grounds the novelty.</comment>
