<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline and consistent—“to uncover truth in tension, not relief”—and every action aligns with that drive. Interiority is embodied through tactile acts (arranging debris, feeding punches) and the felt cost of the scorching reverie. Contradictory impulses (fear vs. refusal to look away) operate on the page. Minor abstraction in some lines lightly distances us from bodily specifics at peak pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning (debris → lagoon response → punches → dissemination) coheres into a closure where testimony reconfigures the city’s options. Closure lands with cost: “half‑retrocognitively trapped” and the zeppelin tilting toward the courthouse form a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend. Orientation is clean early (archivist on the zeppelin above the coast) and sustained through the beach/lagoon to library to inland arc. The causal chain of actions (signal → clerk → punches → publication) is legible and earned.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: the lagoon’s rules constrain tactics (pages refuse ink until the shore is faced; it “drinks the starlight”), and debris/shoreline logistics shape choices. The floating library supplies resources and charges the final image as a mobile civic engine. Sensory detail is selective and voice‑filtered (salt‑stiff crate, smoke‑damp room) with consistent world rules. The closing reflection of the lagoon and zeppelin/courthouse vector reweights prior images.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—public, legible record—tightens as the reverie sears, parley forces disclosure, and the clerk’s punches raise the cost and possibility of proof. The protagonist’s choices drive turns (mapping, calling for parley, accepting the punches, publishing). Cost is felt (scalding, entrapment, no relief), and the endurance/renunciation is credible. Escalation is clear without needing multiple reversals.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory, accountability, and the ethics of record emerge through concrete acts, not thesis—“a testimony is a bridge that cannot be unbuilt.” Recurring images (lagoon, debris, punches) accrue meaning and reprice the city’s past at the end. The piece resists moral neatness by insisting on cost over comfort. The final image invites expansive reflection without sermonizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with legal/archival diction braided to maritime imagery; stance stays within plausible POV knowledge. Patterned elision is taught early and sustained; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure, tightening at parley and publication. Indirection in the “parley” beats serves subtext and intent.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffold; images do multiple jobs (e.g., “misfiled statute” as character and theme). Figurative language is abundant but consistent in domain (civic/legal + oceanic) and does not muddle causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; propulsion remains strong. A hair’s breadth from overrich in places, but clarity holds at the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—archival praxis as ritual with a sentient lagoon, stenograph punches as erased civic speech—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (lyric legalese, nonliteral parley) heighten stakes and coherence rather than obscure them. Turns grow from seeded rules and choices; no late gimmicks. The final reconfiguration feels singular and memorable.</comment>
