<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara’s motive (find meaning/find the Lark/father) is clear and embodied in tactile choices (ear to deckplates, closing the circuit with skin). Her internal tension—risk versus need—is present if understated, surfacing in “permission” after the siren chirps. Actions align with her non‑fighter stance while still showing agency. The endurance/change at the end (from echo‑hunter to orientation‑bearer) feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal chain is clean: hum→circle→contact→query→map→public projection, with the risk of “waking whoever silenced them” as the cost. Single scene, single POV, dominant stake maintained. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (systems awaken; route broadcast), though the cost remains conceptual rather than paid. Orientation is strong from the opening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The repair bay and stone circle are tactile, rule‑bearing features that constrain and enable choices (she must align, touch, and route through installed projectors/hangar mouth). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her vocation (stargazer reading rust as prophecy). The environment evolves with events (dark bay to lit star map to public banner). Objects (opera glasses, stones) charge the final image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres and deepens: patient vibration→ritual touch→heat→system wake→public reveal. The dominant stake narrows options (risking exposure to revive silenced circuits), and she chooses to act. Cost is present but felt more as risk than consequence on the page, keeping escalation persuasive but not punishing. The final act reweights the rebellion’s options from rage to orientation.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motifs (margin of daylight, echoes, map vs bearings) organically point to meaning as navigation rather than fury. However, the last line states the thesis explicitly (“Meaning…is simply the courage to ask…”) which blunts subtext and earns a penalty for thematic echo. Prior images already carried the insight through action (projected coordinates as communal compass). Resonance is strong but slightly over‑explained.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>A confident, lyrical third‑person closely held to Mara sustains a distinct perceptual signature (rust as constellations, grief’s hum). Rhythm modulates with pressure without head‑hopping or register drift. Brief quoted address to the stones supports voice rather than diluting it. Patterned diction is taught early and remains legible through closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is precise and musical; figurative language is rich but controlled and seldom muddles sense. Minimal scaffold and no significant loops; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few heightened metaphors cluster early but they support atmosphere rather than stall momentum. The closing images are clear and propulsive.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The fusion of industrial sci‑fi with an ancestral stone circle as calibration altar feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Opera glasses as anachronistic interface, and rebellion reframed as orientation, elevate beyond trope. Turns arise from established particulars rather than late rule changes. Bold but coherent risk‑taking without obscuring clarity.</comment>
