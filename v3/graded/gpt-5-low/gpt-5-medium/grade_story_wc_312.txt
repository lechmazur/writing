<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Efan’s motive—steady belief in “plausible impossibility”—is enacted through micro‑choices (counting drips, threading seaweed, timing syllables) under a sunrise clock. His “brittle devotion” threatens to snap and shapes gentle tactics, a credible flaw. Interiority is concrete and embodied (aching knees, salt‑sung back). The fisherman’s brief presence provides a soft relational crucible without stealing focus.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → pattern → ritual yields a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost: he must finish before sunrise, cradles brittle devotion, and accepts restoring only an “echo.” The final image (fractional sea adjustment, silver ripple) reweights stakes without over‑explaining. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and causality is coherent within the lyric frame.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting and objects constrain choice: the viaduct’s joints and salt scars determine tactics; dawn imposes a temporal pressure; the cracked bell becomes a tool/bridge. Sensory details are vivid and purpose‑driven (“breathing through damp cloth,” gull cadence). The environment charges the ending (harbor doors, silver ripple) and feels integral rather than ornamental. World rules are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (re‑timing the world enough to bring back fish/life) is signaled early and tightens via the sunrise clock and the hum aligning with syllables. Escalation is a density increase, not a reversal, appropriate to the accumulative lens. The on‑page price is attention/endurance and acceptance of partial repair (“echo, not the original”). The fisherman’s gentle challenge sharpens the moral calculus at the end.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: humility over grandiosity, listening as power, and mercy within limits. The bell/prayer motif shifts meaning at the end, with the fisherman’s question reframing survival as learning hunger differently. Insight is earned by the concrete ritual and modest payoff; no moralizing. The final image reweights the premise with quiet, durable resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive lyric voice with controlled rhythm, consistent POV distance, and apt diction for the world. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual, and advances pressure (“late… history”; “hinge that moves them”). The prose modulates with the scene’s cadence without slipping registers. No head‑hopping or elision debts.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut and musical; images carry multiple jobs (“promise failing midword” charges object and theme). Figurative density is high yet coherent; no mixed metaphors or scaffold loops. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the climax. Minor lushness never obscures causality or closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a “lukewarm mage” timing drips to retune a cracked cosmos via a broken bell. Risks a quiet, procedure‑as‑ritual climax and earns it with specificity and cost. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight under the taught pattern. The vision reads singular, not templated.</comment>
