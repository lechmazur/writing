<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, specific interiority and motive (“candor in small moments”) drive concrete choices: refusing to gild a lie, investigating the map, and halting leaf‑post. The embodied trait (“I wilt near dishonesty”) meaningfully constrains action with cost. Relationship pressure with the postmaster is legible and alters tactics. A touch more contradictory impulse at the brink of the public stand could deepen complexity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: discovery of the fragment → map alignment → hatch access → confrontation → collective reopening. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with cost (post suspended, city dimmed) and a new equilibrium (“Pluviary of Spoken Things”). Orientation is crisp from the opening sentence; no teleports or unkept set‑ups. The escalation reads cleanly without outliney “and‑then” seams.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky aren’t backdrop; they constrain communication (leaf‑post), shape tools (zinc plate), and charge the final image (condensed truths feeding lettuce). Sensory texture across touch, smell, sound, and condensation is filtered through a calligrapher’s priorities. World rules are consistent and learned via action. The environment directly enables the decisive hatch opening and the truth‑rain payoff.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—truth circulation vs controlled suppression—is signaled early and tightened by a concrete refusal (no more leaf‑post) that exacts social and practical cost. The mid‑story turn (secret archive) reframes pressure and sharpens the ethical calculus (“mercy…thirsty for consent”). The public gathering forces the postmaster’s stance change without coincidence solving it. The price is felt in the city’s dimming and the risk of defying infrastructure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme coheres through recurrent, reweighted particulars: leaves that drink candor, jars of unsent truths, “mercy” without consent. The ending offers a resonant answer—truth as shared water—without moralizing, revaluing the archive from control to communal sustenance. Subtext in the postmaster’s trembling and the narrator’s bodily wilt keeps the argument lived, not stated. One aphoristic line skirts neatness but remains grounded by scene cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice—tactile, vegetal, metallic—remains stable and character‑bound. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, carrying subtext (the postmaster’s deflection; the councilwoman’s plea). Psychic distance tightens under pressure without leakage or omniscience. Patterned diction is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (condensate as punctuation; zinc gutters as repositories). Figurative language is lush yet coherent; rhythms vary and propel. Minimal scaffold or loops; syntax supports pressure shifts. A few resonant abstractions appear but do not blur sense or slow momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The premise—archiving condensed unsent truths in a greenhouse city—is striking and integrated across plot, world, and theme. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (postal fragment → vault) and arise from character choice, not gimmick. The “truth as water” synthesis is fresh without sermonizing, and the risk of a communal opening under scarcity reads bold and earned. Conceptual integrity holds through the final vow.</comment>
