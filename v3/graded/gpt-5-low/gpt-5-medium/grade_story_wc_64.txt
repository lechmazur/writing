<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation (“discover the shape of intentions”) and distinctive traits (“tenderly organized,” blithe yet shadowed) drive concrete micro‑choices: waiting out the clock, tapping the case, decoding knots, apologizing to asters. Internal tension is present but gentle; discoveries arrive a bit smoothly without much resistance. Still, the embodied actions under pressure reveal character credibly. The final stance shift (from blitheness to respect) feels earned by what he learns.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lens: Hybrid with causal dominance—each step (clock → border → missing grave → sacks → letters → marking truth) links cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes absence, marks it, and will plant poppies—time reset signals a before/after. Cost is understated but legible (exposing a lie; accepting custodial responsibility for a painful truth). Orientation is strong from the opening; no teleporting props or rule breaks.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting and objects are richly specific and functional: the cobalt silo’s “listening metal” channels echoes, the tapestry is a working map, the cemetery’s asters and poplar stage tactile discovery. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the gardener’s priorities. The environment charges the final image (quieted echoes; case as marker) and guides tactics. Vivid without museum‑tour excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent and tight: find the truth the widow hid. Escalation arrives through deepening knowledge (border grammar → missing grave → sacks → confession), with the gardener’s choices steering each turn. Visible costs are soft-focus (moral and custodial rather than peril), which keeps tension elegant but modest. The end forecloses the option of comfortable ignorance by publicly marking the truth.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes from particulars: mercy versus truth, intention’s “shape,” and the grammar of borders. Recurring images (clock flags, echoes, thread, case) reweight at the end into a stance of mercy that still names absence. No sermonizing; the widow’s duality and the gardener’s response hold complexity. The final cadence repositions gossip into mercy with a felt human cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Unified, confident lyric voice with controlled rhythm and tactile diction; no head‑hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct (tools arranged in a crescent, knots as punctuation, echoes as birds). Compression and elision are purposeful and legible. The modulation from playful blitheness to solemn care is smooth and voice‑true.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images often do double duty. Figurative texture is lush but coherent, with few mixed metaphors; cadence varies to sustain momentum. A slight risk of ornamentation in clusters (“velvet unwinding,” “monarchic sigh,” “velveteen gloom”) but clarity and propulsion hold. Final lines land cleanly without purple drag.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a cemetery gardener decoding a tapestry’s border by clock and echo, sovereign case as conduit and marker, and mercy as cartography. Turns feel earned from early seeds; no gimmickry. The world logic is fresh and internally consistent, with an original emotional calculus. Bold yet humane, with risk in the lyric apparatus that pays off.</comment>
