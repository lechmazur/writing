<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and sustained: the narrator’s compulsion to trace deletions drives every choice. Contradictory impulses crystallize in the legal-vs-voice fork, with a real cost. Interiority is image-rich yet character-specific (flashlight in the drawer, sensed absence). A minor hedge: the narrator’s emotional degradation under stress stays lyrical and composed, never quite fraying.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore links are clean—pattern → lie to bot → vault → Driftwood path → Sink challenge → discovery → post with cost. Closure lands on-page via the decisive act of posting despite risk, with the “profiles lighting up” serving as a resonant payoff. No orientation debt; the before/after is legible and paid.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The archive and the Sink aren’t backdrop: the ritual sign-in and policy hush actively constrain options and force tactics. Sensory specificity (“smelled like old servers,” “silence shaped like a missing person”) fuses mood and function. The environment charges the final image as the network reanimates with profiles lighting up. Strong economy with professional detail filtered through POV.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—restore a missing voice versus keep policy silence—is signaled early and tightened by the illicit access and the diary’s revelations. The lie to the bot and solving the lyric gate escalate pressure credibly and compress options. The legal/ethical trade-off at the end carries a visible risk. Stakes remain personal rather than cosmic, which fits the length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of memory, institutional erasure, and grief are integrated through concrete acts (data paths, patches, playlists). Recurring images (numbers, “echo of forgotten songs,” the patch) reweight meaning at the end without sermonizing. One line edges toward thesis (“the largest lie was the one embedded in policy”), but it’s earned by prior discovery. The final surge of profiles reframes “absence” without tidy moral closure.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical first-person with corporate-archivist texture and a steady distance. Rhythm modulates from contemplative to decisive at the posting choice, maintaining legibility. Elision is purposeful; no head-hopping or register drift. The diction remains character-plausible even when metaphorical.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density and purposeful imagery; few wasted sentences. Metaphor frequency is high but coherent within the seaside/memory lexicon, avoiding muddle. No noticeable scaffold loops or cadence templates; syntax varies with momentum. Minor risk of purple flourish, but clarity holds, including at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate archiving, metadata numerology, and grief communities feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The Sink’s lyric challenge and the telemetry/patch overlay are inventive and plot-functional. The risk calculus is intimate yet stakes are socially charged. Bold but not gimmicky.</comment>
