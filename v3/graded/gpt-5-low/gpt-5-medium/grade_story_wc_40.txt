<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scholar’s motive—decode growth and assemble a testimony—is clear and coherent with his reticence. Embodied details (paper‑nicked hand, “where pages fought back”) ground interiority. A live contradiction (“He hates to speak, but he loves to hear”) culminates in a choice to “testify by playing,” an earned renunciation of conventional speech. The cost is subtle but felt rather than theatrically dramatized.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural drive is taught and kept: cards (Sprout, Scar, Orchard) deepen toward recognizing the hush as “the staff,” then committing to testify by sound. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: language’s growth shifts from lexicography to tending and listening, with the noon delivery pledged. Cost is the self’s turn from speaking to hearing as speech, legible in his reticence and oath. Orientation is clean from the first lines; pattern coherence never wobbles.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The shadowed library, dawn light, dust “constellations,” and the crystal function as environment‑objects that constrain tactic (listening, intervals, tilt angles). The hush and shelves actively shape method and final image (“the hush is the staff”). Sensory economy is high and POV‑filtered, with non‑visual detail (clicks, river under ice) integrated to purpose. The setting charges the ending rather than decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stakes consolidate around whether meaning can grow without new dictionaries and how he’ll testify. Escalation is a density increase: each card pulls older currents, culminating in a procedural decision to “play” the crystal for the printers. The tightening is modest but clear, foreclosing conventional speech. Prices are quiet—exposure, vulnerability, and the commitment to a nonverbal testimony—but present.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme coheres: growth as refusal made porous, tending as grammar, forgiveness through time, and language migrating beyond print. The final image reweights the premise without preaching; the crystal’s music as testimony is an embodied answer. A single explicit line (“Words do not end…”) risks thesis‑speak but is counterbalanced by scene‑rooted images. Resonance lingers with conceptual and emotional charge.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent distance and selective noticing; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure (from careful arrangement to charged recognition of “the staff”). Elevated diction fits the scholar’s sensibility and the piece’s conceit. No dialogue needed; the interior music carries action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density and clean momentum; figurative language remains coherent and purposeful. Repetition patterns are intentional (hush, crystal, intervals) and do work; no paraphrase loops or scaffolding drag. Syntax varies; images like “river reversing under ice” and “roots negotiate the dark” are apt and un-muddled. Minor risk of ornateness never clouds clarity, including at closure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The conceit—post‑dictionary world, sonically reflective chandelier crystal, testimony by listening—is fresh and integrated. Risks in structure and diction heighten stakes without obscuring legibility. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight (cards → hush as staff → nonverbal testimony). The vision reads singular rather than stitched from templates.</comment>
