<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Clear, character‑particular interior conflict—“isolate, calculate, fortify” vs “listen, braid, release”—drives credible micro‑choices. The inspector’s perceptions (turning off sensors, palm brightening inward) embody emotion without therapy‑speak. The renunciation of “safety for solitude” lands as earned. Minor idealization (competence without much mess) trims the edge of flaw.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → confessions → directive in the “heartbeat of a hesitation” → crowning act → world reconfiguration. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page cost (defying protocol, vow of silence) and a decisive act. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/why). The pattern escalates coherently without causal gaps.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The crystal cave is not just backdrop; its quartz spire constrains the decisive act and its veins conduct the radiance that reshapes the world. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (hush, bending light, “patient lace of ghost rivers”). Environment charges the final image and tactically matters. World rules feel consistent within the lyrical logic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (approve isolation vs enable communion) is signaled early and tightens at the “heartbeat” window. The crowning forecloses a professional path and reweights the mission with visible cost (“logged…unfit for isolation,” vow). Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly. Slightly soft external consequence keeps it just shy of peak.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme of connection vs survivalist isolation arises organically through actions and images (shell confessions, radiance threading). The final cadence reframes survival as communal permeability without stating a moral. The “door made of faces” offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. No sermonizing despite abstractable material.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a stable single POV; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (“Light did not burst; it inhaled”). Elision is purposeful and taught early by the hush motif. No head‑hopping or register slips. The voice remains character‑bound and convincing.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>High information density with fresh, coherent imagery; sentences do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Minimal redundancy; metaphors align with the established physical/spiritual logic. Rhythm varies effectively, especially at the hinge (“heartbeat of a hesitation”). No artifacts or loops dull the closure beat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a bureaucratic auditor in a numinous cave using a seashell of confessions to seed communal radiance via a pearl. The crowning act feels inevitable in hindsight once the directive appears. Risks a high‑lyric register and makes it work in a tight frame. Emotional truth grounds the conceit.</comment>
