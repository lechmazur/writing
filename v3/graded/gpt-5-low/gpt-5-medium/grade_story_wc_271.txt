<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Rafi’s motives and contradictions are vivid: a trauma-tempered gardener seeking “doors, not denial,” who freezes at rotor noise yet moves through Leda’s tasking. His embodied responses (“named sensations… waited until they shrank”) and the steadying of his hands at the end feel earned. Therapy-lexicon risks are offset by concrete action and sensory anchoring. The change is an endurance stance with cost: he keeps choosing care under a persistent wound.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens around the helicopter/gull beat and resolves in a charged final image (photo folded with steadier hands, work ready). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he reweights his past without erasing it. The mosaic time-spread is coherent and pays off thematically, though it stretches the “single-window” scope. Cost is legible on the page: he accepts ongoing exposure to triggers and responsibility rather than retreat.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The arboretum-on-cliff, glass roofs, wind, and the unmanned lighthouse infuse action and meaning; storms dictate tasks, the cliff path enables the gull rescue, and the lighthouse logbooks frame the exhibit. Sensory detail is precise across senses (salt, sap, diesel, kelp) and POV-filtered by a gardener. The environment charges the closing cadence (the blink, the ocean settling), tying world and interior. World rules stay consistent and lived-in.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can Rafi practice care without denial?—is signaled early and deepened by the helicopter-triggered freeze. The tightening arrives when Leda’s numbered tasks bridge him back into agency, with a felt price (re-exposure to trauma) that informs later choices. The later exhibit and conversation are secondary deepening rather than new peaks, keeping the escalation quiet but coherent. Resolution is an earned stance rather than a neat cure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of human care versus automation, optimism grounded in maintenance, and making rooms storms can enter emerge through particulars (grafts as stitches, logbooks paired with plants). Subtext carries via images and action; the gull rescue recalibrates “stillness” into a working compass. One explicit line (“optimism meant doors, not denial”) flirts with thesis-stating but is supported by scene work. The final image resonates without sentimentality.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct lyrical voice with gardener’s perception guides selection and rhythm; diction and cadence modulate under pressure (from tidal patience to clipped tasking). POV remains stable, and compressions are taught and legible. Minimal dialogue still operates as action (Leda’s task-list voice). The prose’s certainty stays within what Rafi can plausibly infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; figurative language is fresh and controlled (“pencil that left the least arrogant mark,” “pearl of stillness”). No looped scaffolding or template cadence; images stack coherently. A few high-lyric lines risk density, but they don’t obscure causality or the closure image. Mechanics are clean, and rhythm supports the scene’s quiet intensifications.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Combining an automated lighthouse, a war survivor gardener, and somatic practice inside a living museum feels singular and human. Turns arise from character and place rather than cleverness, and the “pearl of stillness” concept earns tactical weight. Risks (lyric mosaic, occupational texture) heighten coherence rather than distract. The final synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
