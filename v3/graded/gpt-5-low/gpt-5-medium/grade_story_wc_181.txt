<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear (pursue forbidden knowledge; honor the vanished aunt) and acts under pressure against fear of being “rewritten.” Embodied beats—shaking hands, the cameo burning—ground interiority. The key choice (pressing the cameo, then eating the dull fruit) earns the closing stance shift. A touch more contradiction at the moment of biting could heighten felt cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: bathroom vision → forbidden grove → lineage rule → cameo activation → ingestion → repricing of role. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost (“the orchard would claim them in return,” cameo impression left behind). Setups (rules, aunt, bathroom) pay off precisely. The causal seams remain legible despite lyric compression.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard and silver pods are vivid and purpose‑driven; rules learned through touch and inquiry steer tactics. The tree’s lineage demand concretely constrains action, and the final image of the silver pod recharges the setting. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑tuned; no static postcard. A minor increase in spatial choreography at the grove could further sharpen pressure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (knowledge vs self‑rewriting) coheres and tightens through the lineage rule and the act of eating. The cameo burning and leaving an impression gives a visible price and narrows future options. Escalation is protagonist‑driven under the chosen lens. Stakes could register one notch more viscerally at the bite to reach top band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: inquiry as lineage, agency vs complicity, and “nonlinear inheritance” reframed as choosing what answers when the world asks you to speak. Recurring images (cameo, pages, bathrooms) accrue meaning and reweight the final stance (“curate the between”). No moralizing; the aunt’s unfinished eyes carry charged ambiguity. The resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with consistent psychic distance; metaphors feel character‑born (“book written by weather”). Compression is taught early and paid off; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure (calmer observation to tight, burning cameo beat). Slight risk of density crowding peak beats, but clarity holds.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images do more than one job. Figurative language is abundant yet coherent and pattern‑consistent; no mixed metaphors dull closure. Sentences vary in length and propulsion aligns with scene needs. One or two metaphor stacks verge on lushness, but momentum remains intact.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: an archivist of astral fruit, lineage as inquiry, bathrooms as think‑pods—fresh without gimmick. Turns arise from established rules and objects; the cameo’s reweighting feels inevitable in hindsight. Bold but legible risk‑taking, and the final conceptual pivot is both surprising and earned. The piece reads singular and memorable.</comment>
