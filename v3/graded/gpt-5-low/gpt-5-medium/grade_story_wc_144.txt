<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, competent protagonist with tactile, sense-led tactics and a steady ethic of care; the “not panic but precision” pivot under fog pressure reveals character. Limited contradiction—calm rarely frays—keeps the interior arc modest, but micro-choices (more bowls, code tweak, pointing) are grounded and motivated. Relationship with Mirel is functional and supportive, adding gentle pressure without deflection. The cost is mostly cognitive and temporal rather than moral, but it reads earned at this length.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Hybrid with a causal spine: repair → calibration → first alignment → fog setback → adaptation (basin + code patch) → clean coupling and departure. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, single scene, single stake, and the closure lands on-page. Cost is felt as risk of failure within a live clock and persistent constraints (fog, blindness) shaping tactics. The final image reconfigures the charged pattern into quiet relief without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Atmosphere and setting are exquisitely integrated: mist, bells, rails, bowls, and mirrors directly constrain and enable choices. The depot-as-body and bowls-as-compass recur and charge the ending. Weather actively pressures tactics; the basin under the eave is an elegant environmental solve. Specificity remains focused through the artisan’s sensory priorities rather than cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide the coupling before the ship departs) is clear and tested by a meaningful tightening when fog thickens and the ritual “goes silent.” The protagonist adapts at cost—time compression, recalibration, live code patch—rather than luck resolving the crisis. Tension builds sentence to sentence around tones, taps, and alignment, culminating in a concrete, earned result. Stakes are local but keenly felt; no false grandiosity.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Repair as vow, translation as love, and craft-guided trust thread through particulars (copper braid, bowls, Morse on the wrist). The piece resists moralizing; subtext—intimacy between human, tool, and place—emerges through action. The final “depot smiles” reprises the theme of communion and oversight reframed as mutual regard. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant, not vague.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Controlled, lyrical third-person with a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit a tactile, sound-first mind under pressure. Patterned imagery is taught early and sustained; no head-hopping or stance slippage. Dialogue is minimal but functional and subtextual. The voice compresses at peaks without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density lines do multiple jobs; metaphor is rich yet largely coherent and scene-forward. Occasional lavish phrasing skirts purple but remains legible and rhythmically purposeful. No scaffold loops or cadence templates dull momentum; transitions are clean. The closing image is crisp and earned by prior texture.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—blind artisan decoding light via water to guide a drone through fog at a rail-harbor seam—is fresh and memorable. Risk-taking in method and sensory logic feels organic, not gimmicky. Turns grow from established constraints and tools; no late rule cheats. The hummingbird, bowls, and depot personification create a singular imaginative stance.</comment>
