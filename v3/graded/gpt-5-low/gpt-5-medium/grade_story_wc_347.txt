<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The caretaker’s motive (bound duty born of grief) is vivid and consistent, and micro‑choices under pressure (teaching heel‑to‑hollow, coaxing doors) reveal specificity and resolve. Internal contradiction—reluctant yet exacting, obeying while yearning to leave—undergirds the Earned Stasis. Secondary characters are sketched but effective foils that sharpen the caretaker’s role. The felt cost lands when they choose return over escape and accept only a “little” loosening.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the clock, patrol arcs, and living geometry intensify toward a charged exit and the caretaker’s return. Closure is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: “Before the night frost forms…I will find them; afterward, the orchard will find me,” with on‑page cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and all set‑ups (roots trick, nut, blueprint, frost) pay off in sequence. No causality breaks; the horn/patrol change is a clean tightening.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The orchard, cliff, birds, frost, and living stone actively constrain choices and tactics (no‑touch walking, timing with patrols, blueprint corridors). World rules are learned through action (apples invert, seeds as keys), and specificity is POV‑filtered. The environment charges the final image and the ongoing bargain. Spatial choreography is coherent despite lyric compression.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (get them out before frost/patrol) is clear and tightens via early frost scent and patrol change. The seed‑lock moment is a satisfying tactical turn earned by prior beats. Cost is the protagonist’s renunciation of leaving, with the orchard’s “little” loosening as bittersweet payment. Slightly more friction inside the corridor could have heightened the price further.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of duty, memory as architecture, and bargains with living systems emerge through particulars (roots teaching gait; seeds remembering doors). “Graceless beauty” reframes the prayer/drowning image and anchors the final cadence. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: endurance as grace under a binding covenant with cost. No moralizing; complexity lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A distinct, coherent first‑person voice—precise, world‑literate, and slightly fatalistic—modulates under pressure without leakage. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and carries subtext (teaching, comforting, commanding). Patterned elision is taught early and stays legible through closure. Diction/rhythm feel character‑true (“numbers lived in my throat”) and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs (apples inverting as fear sensor, lichen map as memory). Lyricism is lush but controlled; metaphors align with established logic (blueprints, breath, roots, locks). Minimal scaffolding or loops; momentum carries through to the charged final line. A handful of doubled descriptors (“shadow and smoke”) flirt with ornament but don’t slow clarity.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mechanical birds, a memory‑rewriting orchard, and blueprint‑as‑body synthesize into a singular conceit. The seed as breathing key is a fresh, grounded turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risks in diction and world‑rules pay off cleanly and heighten meaning. The piece avoids templates through specific, integrated inventions tied to choice and cost.</comment>
