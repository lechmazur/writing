<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Clear motive (choose the right alias and delivery) with credible tension between urgency and the ethic of slowness. Embodied interiority in tactile acts (kneeling, grit on knees, pen as metronome) avoids abstraction. The internal contradiction—send vs wait; concealment vs truthful naming—culminates in an earned refusal to mail yet. The patient hold shows cost-bearing endurance rather than pat resolution.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chalk clues, arches, busker’s vibration, and past mark accrete to a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean from the first line; pattern is taught and paid off by the final wait at the slot. Closure carries cost via the deliberate delay and the burden of naming, reweighted by the discovery of the narrator’s own earlier mark. The options are reconfigured without a soft reset.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The arcade, arches, chalked paving, and dawn light are lived-in and guide action (bench cache, counting arches, waiting under the arch). Micro-objects (clipboard, mail slot) and soundscape (busker) constrain and charge choices, culminating in the final poised moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful across sight, touch, and sound. The setting meaningfully charges the last image.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding and addressing the right name, at the right time—is consistent and tightens through decoding to the “Auricle” selection. The late self-mark reveal deepens pressure, reframing risk and responsibility. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but the renunciatory choice to wait reads as a real foreclosing of immediate action. Escalation is subtle yet coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Identity, time, and the ethics of medium emerge organically through tactile acts and recurring images (margins, ear, surface mail). The ending offers a resonant answer: choose listening and patience over speed, reweighting past and present without moralizing. The “Auricle”/ear seal crystallizes the listener theme. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and safety without confusion.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with precise diction and rhythmic modulation; imagery remains character-filtered rather than generic. POV is steady and plausible; inferences feel earned. Patterned phrases (“futuristic nostalgia,” “margins”) recur with intent, not as scaffolding. The voice flexes under pressure (pen as metronome, breath-counted wait) without drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with minimal redundancy; figures are vivid yet coherent and in service of action. A lush line now and then brushes the edge of adornment, but clarity and momentum hold. Syntax varies and supports cadence shifts toward the charged final pause. No mechanical errors or filter stacks impede the close.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—a professional pseudonym maker decoding chalk codes to route a physical letter—is fresh and integrated, not quirky garnish. Postal pigeons, the ebony clipboard’s vibration, and “Auricle” synthesize world, theme, and choice with inevitability. The risk of a quiet, accumulative structure pays off in a striking final poise. Specificity resists template beats and feels singular.</comment>
