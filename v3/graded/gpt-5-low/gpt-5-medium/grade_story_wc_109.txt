<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Two distinct, legible motives drive the scene: the oracle’s compulsion to “write quiet” and the courier’s conflict between orders and doubt. The courier’s on‑page turn (from scoffing to carrying the booklet) is earned through the listening ritual. Interiority is embedded in sensory action rather than labels, though the oracle’s interior contradictions remain largely idealized, not thorny. The visible cost (her bleeding fingers, her staying) grounds the endurance choice.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of listening-as-mapping and tightens around the one-star clock; closure lands as a charged handoff (he goes with the booklet; she stays to finish and carves the stones). Cost is on the page in bodily sacrifice and separation, and the storm/star constraints persist through the end. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and no causal breaks undermine the cadence turn.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The storm‑tossed ridge fort, wet stones, single star, and wind actively shape tactics (“hold the lantern away from the wind’s ear,” carving into soaked stone). The setting’s textures are precise and filtered through purpose. Environment charges the final image (fort “grows taller by not falling,” star as compass). World rules remain consistent and tactile.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve and transmit the night’s “map” versus destruction—tightens when the courier reveals his order to burn records. The pressure escalates through a density shift in listening and the decision: he keeps the booklet and she commits to stay and to stone‑carving as redundancy against failure. Costs are legible (blood, flaking gold, separation, time pressure of the single star). The escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (“night speaks in lacunae”; mapping absence as solace/compass) arises from concrete acts (timing surf gaps, carving coordinates) rather than mere assertion. Final images reweight prior motifs (star as compass, text vs. stone, instrument not scripture), offering a resonant answer without moralizing. A few thesis‑ish lines (“reasons are sensations in costumes”) skate near declaration but are earned by scene pressure. The emotional aftertaste is gently profound rather than tidy.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A controlled, distinctive lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature; syntax and diction match the oracle’s vocation. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext; the courier’s tone shifts believably. Rhythm modulates with pressure (listening pauses versus storm surges) without losing clarity. No POV slippage or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; little scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is lush yet largely coherent and tethered to action; occasional flourish risks purple but doesn’t obscure sense. Cadence varies and supports momentum. Line edits would be minimal and cosmetic.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mapping silence as navigational instrument under a one‑star clock is a fresh synthesis, integrated through method and stakes. The gold‑leaf booklet’s material decay, the fort’s “ambered hush,” and the ethical pivot from burning to bearing feel singular rather than templated. The final charged poise (handoff and staying) is inevitable in hindsight. Bold lyric risk pays off without losing legibility.</comment>
