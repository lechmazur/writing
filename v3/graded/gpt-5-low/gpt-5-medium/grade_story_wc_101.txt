<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The choral “we” is vivid and embodied through concrete micro‑choices, with Mara’s motives legible in action (one ring, night book, pairing teens with elders). The patrol scene reveals her values under pressure, protecting anonymity with cost. Contradictory impulses surface credibly (youths’ fear/pride; elders’ fear of raids). Interior specificity is conveyed through sensory and task detail rather than labels.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Pressure coheres from secrecy and scarcity to the patrol’s stop under the arbor, then deepens into tightened tactics and the charged final reprise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the bell’s function shifts from alert to gratitude while the cost (risk, vigilance) has been paid on the page. Orientation is clean early and consistent.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The terra‑cotta arbor, frost, patrol drum, and the bell are integrated as lived constraints shaping tactics (drops, timing, visibility). The object‑as‑setting (bell) both governs behavior (one ring) and charges the end image. World rules (sanctions, brittle borders) are shown through action rather than told. Atmosphere and specificity remain purposeful and pressure‑aware.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—safeguard donors’ anonymity while feeding the community with dignity—is clear and tested in the patrol confrontation. The tightening is meaningful: Mara’s stance forecloses betrayal and risks reprisal. Tactics adapt (constellation pairs, timing by infants’ clocks), evidencing cost and commitment. The final cadence reflects an earned endurance rather than an easy solve.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of dignity, mutual aid, and anonymity accrue through particulars (one ring; “names of need, not gossip”; teens bearing bread and stories). Subtext flows in silences and procedures rather than pronouncements, with a slight but effective credo moment to anchor ethic. The bell’s reweighted meaning at the end provides a resonant, non‑literal answer. Sentiment is avoided by grounding in risk and labor.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The first‑person plural voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, modulating from hush to taut during the patrol. Dialogue is sparse but carries status and subtext (“They do not exist as persons”) without breaking tone. Diction and rhythm feel character‑true and situationally precise. No head‑hopping or stance slippage.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is strong: images are fresh (“rust‑red rib cage,” “night book,” “winter lung”) and purposeful. Rhythm varies and propels; little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Figurative density is high yet coherent, rarely crowding clarity. The closing image is clean and earned.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bell‑led clandestine aid network under sanctions with a communal “we” POV feels fresh and inevitable in retrospect. The intergenerational pairings and constellated record book add ingenuity beyond trope. The patrol beat reframes generosity as illicit with moral clarity without sermonizing. Risks in structure and tone heighten stakes without obscuring meaning.</comment>
