<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s “shielded openness” and oath to “interpret silence with empathy” motivate concrete choices (asking for keys, insisting on the village’s presence, framing the map with the tear visible). Interiority is specific and embodied through occupational perception. The cost is quiet but real—a renunciation of spectacle for communal stewardship. Slightly limited internal contradiction under peak pressure keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Clean causal chain from torn map → archival footage → seam → communal opening → reframed map. Closure lands via Decisive Change (reopening) and Resonant Reconfiguration (keeping the tear visible as seam/wound). Cost is legible in the refusal to sensationalize and the choice to preserve hush. Structure holds as two shards cohering to one closure unit.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: rain-scoured limestone, fresco vault, and the architectural “slit” directly produce the whisper and dictate tactics. Environmental detail is POV-filtered through a map framer’s eye and charges the final images (vault breathing, henge in vigil). The world rules (physics of breath, damp, stone) are consistent and integral. The setting constrains and explains the outcome rather than decorating it.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes are quiet but coherent: uncover the chapel without violating its hush or the community’s trust. Escalation tightens through discovery and the ethical decision to wait for the village before opening. The price—choosing restraint, public stewardship, and preserving the wound—registers, though danger never spikes. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: listening as craft, wounds as seams, physics over superstition, communal memory. The final choice (tear visible; hush preserved) offers a resonant non-literal answer about what we owe to the past’s quiet. Subtext hums in the architecture-as-whisper and the verger’s attempted refusal. No moralizing; insights are earned by scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct, disciplined first-person voice with a craftsman’s lexicon (“bevel,” “mat,” “pale bevel that echoed the horizon”). Rhythm modulates with pressure without losing clarity. Elision is purposeful; no head-hopping or register drift. The perceptual signature remains singular and controlled.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is precise, metaphorically coherent, and economical; images do double duty (map tear as thematic seam and plot clue). No paraphrase loops or purple overload; cadence varies well. Occasional lyric flourish stays in service of action and stakes. Final lines recharge earlier motifs cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a map framer’s ethos applied to communal memory, a “whispered chapel” grounded in physics, and archival silence as investigative method. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight and not gimmicky. Risks (lyric quietude, understated stakes) heighten coherence rather than blur it. The piece avoids template solutions and lands with distinctive vision.</comment>
