<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and motive (“find the beginning in every ending”) drive concrete micro‑choices: discarding assumptions, pressing the hush to the wound, re‑aiming dishes, threading the star fragment. Embodied reactions (“prickled my gums,” steadied hands) and a credible shift from fear to use of the hush show growth under pressure. The renunciation at the end (leaving the hush and star fragment) reads as a costed stance, not a tidy fix. Minor: internal contradiction is present but could bite harder in one peak moment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern tightens: refusal → attunement → lunar pull → stylus/gorge record → backward prologue to “first hello.” Closure lands on page with RR/CR: the city “learned to keep time with what it let go,” enabled by the protagonist’s specific acts. Cost is legible as relinquishment and accepting a non‑resurrection solution; a persistent constraint (perigee, physical mast/gorge) shapes tactics. Orientation is crisp early, and no causal stitching gaps undercut the ending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The environment is not wallpaper; it dictates choices (climbing the mast, winching dishes, threading fragment into a lightning scar) and charges the final image (gorge as record, moon as needle). Details are POV‑filtered through a technical‑mystic lexicon that feels lived‑in (“calipers and stories with solder”). World rules remain consistent as metaphor becomes mechanism. Spatial logic remains coherent across turns.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (placing endings without erasing them) sharpens through one meaningful tightening: the city’s refusal breaks only when assumptions are discarded and the hush is applied. The lunar perigee acts as a live pressure that reweights options, culminating in the stylus recording act. Cost is more conceptual than visceral but present in the refusal to resurrect and in leaving key objects embedded. Slightly softer edge on overt jeopardy keeps it from higher.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as tuning, beginnings inside endings, keeping time with what’s released. Recurring images (hush, star fragment, lightning scar, moon‑needle) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final stance honors loss without repair, avoiding sentimentality. The single line “Begin last, end first” echoes as praxis, not slogan.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled voice marries technical diction with numinous image—“fantasy practicality”—and sustains that stance under stress. POV distance stays stable; when the city “speaks,” it is consistently mediated through instruments. Dialogue snippets (director, matriarch, grandmother) carry subtext and propel stakes without breaking voice. Rhythm modulates cleanly through escalation and release.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphor; most lines do at least two jobs (world and pressure/theme). Cadence varies, and there’s little scaffold or paraphrase looping despite lyric reach. A few richly stacked images flirt with excess, but coherence and momentum hold, particularly in the stylus/record sequence. Mechanics are clean, and the final line recharges motifs without bloat.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—radio city as instrument, hush as tool, moon as needle—feels freshly inevitable once revealed. Risks in conceit and diction heighten stakes and coherence rather than obscuring them. Turns arise from earlier particulars (discarding assumptions, tuning, threading the fragment), not late rule drops. Emotional truth grounds the spectacle in a humane calculus of placement over resurrection.</comment>
