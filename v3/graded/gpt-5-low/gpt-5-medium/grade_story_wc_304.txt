<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is crystalline (to “capture one last spark”) and actions align: tuning, placing the chip, anointing, sealing. Interiority is embodied and particular to her craft, balancing control and grief. Contradictory impulses (belief vs guild’s skepticism, duty vs letting go) are present without overstatement. The final endurance—keeping shimmer, not resurrection—reads as an earned renunciation with cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through auroral intensification, chip warming/dimming, and the radio’s emergence. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when) and the ritual’s steps causally progress. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she secures a shard and accepts loss. Cost is legible in the refusal to resurrect and the archival seed—keeping shimmer over life.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are not postcard décor; the aurora’s “song” is the enabling medium, constraining method and timing. Tools (chip, radio, balm) are tactically used and charged in the final image. Sensory selection is precise and character-biased; the environment mirrors and pressures the rite. World rules (consent persists, echoes in static) are learned through action, not dump.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is coherent and tight: retrieve a last echo before oblivion. Escalation is a density intensification—aurora brightens, rhythm emerges, voice briefly arrives, chip dims—culminating in the archival sealing. The price is the acceptance of non-resurrection and letting go; tension is quiet but real. A single deepening turn (her mentor’s words captured) meaningfully reweights the path.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of grief as care, consent after breath, and kindness as the residue of a life arise from particulars (chip’s ethics, balm receiving words). Subtext carries in images (threshold of stillness, seed for archive) without sermonizing. The mentor’s line risks a thesis echo but functions as earned craft-transmission that charges the ending’s acceptance. The final cadence reweights the premise—keeping shimmer, not revival—with clean resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is singular, lyric, and craft-inflected; diction and rhythm match a mortician-artist under pressure. POV is stable and knowledge stays character-bound; elisions are purposeful. The brief “dialogue” via radio carries subtext and action. Modulation under peak beats is controlled, never opaque.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-level craft is taut for a lyric mode: images work double duty and momentum persists. Figurative language is fresh and coherent (“cloths folded like prayers,” “consent persists… like a lamp flame”). No notable loops or scaffolding; cadence varies. Density increases at the right moments without veering into purple or muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Original conceit—beautician mortician harvesting auroral echoes via an emerald chip—is striking and integrated. The guild/consent ethic, “patterns in static” method, and archive seed synthesize into a non-obvious yet inevitable arc. Risks in tone and worldbuilding pay off without confusion. The emotional truth of skilled farewell elevates beyond concept novelty.</comment>
