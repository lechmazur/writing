<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Clear, embodied motivation—“seldom-heard” yet hired to articulate needs—drives concrete choices (bolting the plate, encoding maps). Interiority is specific (thirst “that had learned to sing quietly”) and consistent with action. Internal contradiction (prior loudness vs. present patience) is present but lightly tested; success comes a bit easily, with limited on‑page cost. Still, choices align with values and reveal a believable, particular self under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm-pulse, graffiti, and plate cohere toward a closure where vents are opened and water shared. Orientation is strong early (courtyard, storm, ghost in wires), and cause feels earned: encoding → valves blink → communal response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a lasting stance (“I swore to keep translating”) and visible communal change. Cost is more conceptual than painful, but it’s legible and on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: storm timing, wires under stones, vents, parapets, and ladders shape tactics and options. The flower‑press plate functions as a micro‑setting tool charging the final image. Sensory detail is lush across modalities (taste of brass, breath like a bowl) and always filtered through the balladeer’s craft. The environment constrains and enables listening “between lightning and thunder,” crucial to the method.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating need so the city can breathe—is clear and tightens with the storm’s approach and the “cupped hands” need-signal. The meaningful turn is the plate‑harp and encoded map prompting real action (vents, standpipe). Pressure is coherent, but obstacles are soft; opposition is atmospheric more than contested, and the price is mostly in restraint/patience. Still, escalation by density and cadence reads purposeful under the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Listening as care, translation as civic act, and technology as a tender ghost interweave through concrete acts; the final hinge (“less a singer than a hinge”) reweights the premise. Recurring objects (plate, chalk, valves) accrue meaning without moralizing. One declarative line (“open the vents, share the water, listen”) risks thesis‑speak, but it’s earned by prior images and action. The ending lingers as a charged poise with ethical clarity and cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A distinct, musical POV—“driftingly alert”—sustains rhythm and diction without leakage. The voice modulates with storm pressure while remaining singular and plausible for the character. Elision patterns (between lightning and thunder) are taught early and pay off cleanly. No head‑hopping or register drift; syntax supports the lyric without obscuring sense.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (wires, valves, vents) and minimal scaffolding. Figurative texture is rich yet coherent; metaphors align with craft and weather, avoiding muddle. Minor lushness could risk saturation, but momentum holds and the closure image is crisp. Sentence rhythm varies and paragraphing breathes with the scene’s cadence.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Inventive synthesis: a “ghost in code” conversing via graffiti, tuned by an inherited flower‑press plate, to reconfigure civic systems. Risks in tone and method feel organic and necessary; the world’s logic is consistent. Turns and reprises (plate from flowers to static) feel inevitable in hindsight. Emotional truth (humility, thirst, patience) grounds the novelty.</comment>
