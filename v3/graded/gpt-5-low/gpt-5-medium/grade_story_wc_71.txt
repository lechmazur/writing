<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive and method drive concrete micro‑choices (placing the shard, reading displacements, leaving lavender, returning the beetle tin). Interiority is idiosyncratic and embodied through sensory noticing rather than labels. The final conceptual shift feels earned by action, though the on‑page cost is subtle rather than searing. Contradictory impulses are muted but present as care vs. judgment (“sanctify me… if I have read you falsely”).</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: three house visits build a pattern that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing (“they live on… our pauses”). Orientation is clean from the outset; the method teaches itself by use. Closure lands on the page and is causally linked to the displaced‑object method and the beetle tin recovery, with a felt, if quiet, cost (“tiny vows”). The piece stays within one arc and one POV without structural drift.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and POV‑filtered, with tactile specificity (damp rope, dill; shutters “as bitten lips”). The micro‑setting of objects functions as environment: doorframes, spoons, the banister, and the stair grain constrain choices and enable discovery. The orris shard as handled tool charges the final understanding. Tone and weather support the hush without postcard excess.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to discern house‑aliveness) is clear, and pressure tightens via resistant House Two and revelatory House Three. Escalation is a pattern deepening rather than a clash, consistent with the lens. Costs are understated, centered on responsibility and ritual rather than loss, which slightly softens the sense of price. Still, the beetle‑tin restitution narrows options and reweights the inquiry.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme crystallizes organically: aliveness is bestowed by human attention and ritual, not innate essence. Recurring images (shard of hush, displaced objects, sanctification) earn their resonance without moralizing. The ending offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior detail and lingers. Ambiguity remains purposeful (alive “for itself” vs. “to shelter a story”).</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinctive, confident lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (“a spoon leaned… like a tide pulled by a small moon”). Diction and rhythm modulate without head‑hopping; no unearned omniscience. Figurative textures feel voice‑true and controlled. Elision is taught early and pays off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful imagery; most sentences do multiple jobs (atmosphere + action + theme). A few lush metaphors flirt with excess but stay coherent to the voice and never obscure cause/effect. No scaffolding or loops; line endings land cleanly (lavender, beetle tin, “our pauses”). Minor risk of purple is contained by consistent control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The premise—a ritual listener reading houses via displaced objects and a perfumer’s shard—is fresh and integrated. Turns arise from method, not gimmick; the beetle‑tin reveal feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk‑taking in diction and concept heightens stakes without sacrificing clarity. The final reconfiguration avoids the safety middle.</comment>
