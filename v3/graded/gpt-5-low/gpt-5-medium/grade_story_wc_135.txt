<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The archivist’s motives and micro-choices are precise and character-specific (asking for the ring-tap cadence, turning the valve, writing “tone: none,” gifting the valve). Interiority is embodied through sensory attention and occupational lens rather than labels. Internal contradiction is subtle—“reactively visionary” who nonetheless initiates a practice—but the personal cost to the narrator remains mostly conceptual rather than felt as risk. The relationship with the woman carries quiet pressure without melodrama.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: absences become “channels navigated,” the harbor acquires a practicable cadence, and the valve is redefined and released with a price (renouncing performance for structure). Orientation is clean early, and each patterned action (tapping, valve turns, pane tracing) coheres to the final cadence shift. The communal cost of no parade and the chosen practice over monument read on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain suffuses action and choice: wet glass becomes a staff and map, fog and mist govern visibility, gulls punctuate timing, and the quay’s salt/prints frame return. Details are selective, multi-sensory, and filtered through a professional gaze. The environment charges the final image (“harbor...like a ledger finally balancing”) and the object-on-sill micro-setting drives tactics. World rules remain consistent and purposeful.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stakes center on teaching the harbor to remember; pressure deepens via the decision to count silence (“tone: none”) and publicly enact cadence that alters bystanders’ behavior. Escalation is gentle but clear: from receiving the valve to testing intervals, to community acknowledgment, to gifting the tool. The price is a refusal of spectacle in favor of disciplined practice; still, the conflict remains low-voltage, more poise than peril.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of return, practice vs monument, and absence as a navigable structure emerge through concrete acts (tapping, mapping fog, circling “here”s, “we will ask bakers/pigeons/boats”). Subtext is strong: communal repair through rhythm, not ceremony; the woman’s weather-for-name layers erasure and identity. A few explicit lines (“the harbor deserves not mood but structure”) flirt with didacticism but feel voice-motivated. The ending reweights prior images without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a coherent perceptual signature; diction and rhythm suit the archivist’s mind and trade. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (weather-for-name) and advances goals. Psychic distance is stable, and patterning (intervals, ledgers, staff lines) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is polished: high information density, varied syntax, and images that do multiple jobs. Figurative language is frequent but coherent and pattern-driven (“masts draw staff lines,” “tone: none,” “metronome of remembering”). Minimal redundancy and clean sequencing. A whisper of abstraction appears in a couple lines, but momentum holds and the closure image is crisp.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The premise—a harbor’s return rehearsed via a corroded trumpet valve and counted absences—feels singular and inevitable by the end. Risks (occupational lyricism, accumulative build, anti-spectacle closure) pay off with conceptual and emotional clarity. The redefinition of music as spacing and the ledgered city are fresh. Nothing reads like template or pastiche.</comment>
