<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Marek’s “logically emotional” ethos drives concrete choices (refusing force, tuning breath, offering the key) with embodied stakes, and the seeker’s hunger reconfigures credibly under pressure. The handover of the key is a sharp character reveal with risk. The one softness: her pivot happens smoothly, with minimal friction, trimming felt struggle. Still, interiority and action align with specificity.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with causal dominance: rumor → preparation → sonic exposure → renunciation → joint stewardship. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they foreclose ransom and commit to co‑keeping with the cost of trust and relinquished leverage on the page. Stakes stay coherent, single scene, clean anchors. The turn is quiet rather than knife‑edge, which slightly reduces impact.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setting is richly integrated: drift‑ice, Fresnel, the lens room, and tools aren’t postcard detail—they channel tactics and charge the final image. The lighthouse, key, and stone constrain access and choice; the ice and foghorn breathe atmosphere that mirrors the ethic of “alignment, not erasure.” Sensory filtering feels profession‑true. Minor note: the marina’s physical constraints don’t overtly force a tactical workaround beyond tone.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early, and pressure tightens when the seeker arrives and Marek opens the lens, forcing a nonviolent gambit. The decisive test is the offered key, which narrows options and risks loss of control. Escalation is coherent under the chosen lens but remains hushed; the antagonist’s resistance ebbs quickly, softening the felt price. Still, the trade is clear and consequential.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of adaptation over force, forgiveness by alignment, and grief re‑tuned into responsibility emerge through action and image (breath tuning, “drowned orchards and rebuilt towns”). The final shared stewardship reweights the premise without moralizing. One explicit thesis line (“Sonic absolution… a way of tuning yourself…”) edges toward statement, but it’s paid off behaviorally. Resonance lingers in the lighthouse’s “rib set back in place.”</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with tactile diction and a clean single POV; dialogue carries subtext and alters stakes (her hunger rearticulated, his offer of the key). Rhythms modulate with pressure; images are specific and character‑filtered. No head‑hopping or stance leakage. A few crafted coinages risk lushness but stay legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty (“courteous click,” “ribs chimed faintly”) and no scaffold loops. Figurative pressure is steady yet coherent; metaphors align with the sonic/weather motif. Minor purple glints (“fleshly ethereal”) repeat as motif rather than clutter. Momentum holds from marina to lens to joint vow.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lighthouse‑keeper myth recast via “vibrational matching” and sonic absolution feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight; the key handover reframes guardianship without violence. The synthesis of maritime craft, sound, and ethical adaptation is distinctive. The risk is a quiet conflict curve, but the conceptual ingenuity and lived specificity offset it.</comment>
