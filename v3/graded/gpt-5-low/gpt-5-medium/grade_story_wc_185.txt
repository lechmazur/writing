<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and embodied: protect maps and make space for coexistence. The narrator’s fear (“ribs clatter”) coexists with practiced calm (“pretended confidence”), giving credible contradiction. Micro‑choices—reading ice, selecting the corridor, aligning and tapping the stone—reveal craft under pressure. The change is an earned endurance: he accepts ongoing tending rather than a cure‑all.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush creates a shared “room,” the beings’ behavior changes, and the narrator marks the hinge on the map with the cost of continued tending. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the pattern of learning → planting → hush holds. The price is conceptual and ongoing rather than dramatic, but felt in “they do not leave; they learn where to be quiet” and the commitment to keep tending.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The caves, ice, calcite “rib,” and corridor acoustics constrain tactics and determine success; the echo stone functions as micro‑setting and tool that charges the ending. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (ice “hieroglyphs,” bells growing “storms of resonance”). World rules are taught through action (placement, alignment, tapping). The final image (stone warm to his pulse; marked corridor) is inseparable from place.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is steady and escalates through density: resonance threatens to break maps; experiments lead to planting; hush blooms and reweights pressure. Tightening occurs when the beings close in, forcing the planting to succeed or fail now. Cost is modest but legible: the solution is partial and must be maintained, foreclosing a quick fix. Internal and external conflicts braid without melodrama.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of coexistence, restraint, and craft as care emerge organically through image patterns (ice script, corridors as bells, hush as “rooms”). The final realization reweights the premise: survival is a negotiated quiet, not expulsion. A near‑thesis line risks explicitness, but it sits within scene pressure and avoids sermonizing. The “hammered repose” motif modulates from concept to lived practice.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct, controlled lyric voice with a coherent perceptual signature grounded in the craft of listening and mapping. Rhythm varies with pressure, and diction stays character‑specific and consistent. Purposeful figurative language is taught early and maintained; no head‑hopping or stance drift. The closing cadence tightens without overexplaining.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with minimal scaffolding; images usually do multiple jobs (world‑building, tension, theme). The metaphor stream is rich but coherent to the premise (sound, weather, stone, ice), avoiding mixed vehicles at peak beats. No significant loops or template cadences; syntax breathes with the action. One could trim a modifier or two, but clarity and propulsion hold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: acoustic cartography, energy beings as weather, and a “bloom of hush” as a crafted, temporary sanctuary. Risks a dense lyrical register and commits fully, yielding specific, memorable turns (“blue to the tongue, clear to the bones”). The closure feels inevitable in hindsight from the setup of ice‑reading and stone‑placing. Emotional truth—care over conquest—grounds the novelty.</comment>
