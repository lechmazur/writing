<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—to protect a fragile, meaning-first design ethos against louder profit—is clear and drives concrete micro-choices (planting the seed, drafting rules, locking the annex). Contradictory impulses (stewardship vs. commercial pressure) are lived rather than told, especially in “Profit would trickle, but meaning would flow.” Embodied perception (cedar, ozone, damp planks) grounds interiority. The cost-bearing endurance at the end reads earned for this scale.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from the storm’s hush to the seed’s dare to the chosen rules, culminating in a Charged Poise closure (quiet vow, timer, door locked against dilution). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Cost is legible—she forecloses scale and accepts scrutiny for a harder path—even if the landlord/inspectors remain off‑stage. One continuous scene with a clear cadence shift at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The annex and brook aren’t postcard garnish; they shape tactics (closing early, moon-phased admission, a haven against dilution) and charge the final image (“the brook kept her secret”). Sensory textures are selective and purpose-driven across senses. Recurring objects (pot, seed, door) are integrated with action. Tone and place cohere without over-explaining world rules.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stewardship vs. spectacle—is signaled and tightened by the seed’s arrival and her self-imposed rules that explicitly trade profit for meaning. The meaningful turn is the decision to plant and codify constraints, which narrows options. Pressure remains primarily internal and situational; credible external friction is invoked (landlord, inspectors) but not dramatized. Still, the renunciatory cost is clear at closure.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of caretaking over spectacle and the ethics of attention accrues organically through plant-care as praxis, not just symbol. Final images reprice the premise: a room that “solved the solver” and a note promising “quiet rigor.” A few lines tilt toward thesis (“We hold space for people to practice choices”), slightly on-the-nose. Overall resonance lingers without false tidiness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct, coherent lyric voice with controlled rhythm; sensory lexicon and syntax match Mara’s thoughtful, craft-driven mind. Internal pitch rehearsal and brook “dialogue” feel motivated and consistent. No head-hopping or stance leakage. Elevated diction remains character-plausible and modulates with pressure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with strong acoustics and clean syntax; images rarely blur sense. Minor density surges and a couple repeated phrases (“orthogonal approaches”) flirt with over-lyricism but don’t stall momentum. No template cadences or filter-verb stacks; the final image lands crisp. Overall, high information-to-sentence ratio with few redundancies.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: an escape-room artisan designing a patient, plant-centered experience as a rebuttal to spectacle, with the corpse flower as ethical mechanism. The “mystery seed mail” incites a principled renunciation rather than a twist. Risks (quiet stakes, lyric mode) heighten coherence and pay off in the charged poise ending. Specificity of vocation and philosophy feels singular, not templated.</comment>
