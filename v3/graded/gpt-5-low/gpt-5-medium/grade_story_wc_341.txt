<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear motive (prove absence remembers, memorialize the father) drives concrete choices: naming clouds as tactics, tapping the frame, threading headings “through feeling.” Interiority is specific and embodied through tools and textures (line through fingers, telescope glint). Internal contradiction (science vs. affect) exists but remains low-friction rather than a painful tear, slightly softening impact. The closing renunciation of drift for reconnection reads earned, with a gentle cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via drift, squall approach, radio hush, then contact and tethering. Closure lands with a Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing: reconnection “like a bead on a rosary” and the blank lines as proof. Cost is present as a relinquished solitude/charge of absence, though lightly rendered. Orientation is clean from the first line; no lens ambiguity.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: the gondola’s drift, balloon skin, spare line, and telescope all shape choices and the ending image. Weather is lived-in and operational, not postcard; the squall line changes tactics. The reeling line and cradle return charge the final image with tactile consequence. Sensory balance and professional filter are exemplary.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find safe return while honoring a proof) is legible early. Escalation is modest but coherent: squall advances, radio silence gives way, choices steer around “recidivist jealousy,” and reconnection forecloses drift. The cost is contemplative rather than acute, which keeps tension elegant but gentle. Agency at the end (issuing headings via emotional taxonomy) earns resolution.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Themes of memory-in-absence, forgiveness, and alternative epistemologies emerge from action and motif, not lecture. Recurring images (line/veins, telescope, blank lines) reweight meaning at the end. “Those lines are the proof” flirts with explicitness but is warranted by the built pattern. The father thread subtly refracts every choice without tilting into sentiment.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A singular, assured lyric voice with a consistent perceptual signature (weather as feelings) sustains through pressure. Diction and rhythm modulate cleanly from hush to contact; dialogue is minimal but crisp and character-distinct (the captain’s “stone in water” laugh). No head-hopping or stance drift. The elevated register feels earned by vocation and mood.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Lines carry high information density with layered images doing multiple jobs (“meadow of silence that keeps the hoofprints of our drift”). Figurative language is abundant but coherent; very few mixed or dead metaphors. Momentum rarely stalls despite lyric richness; no paraphrase loops. Minor purple glints are balanced by precision and tactility.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The aviation-meteorologist-as-emotion-cartographer is a fresh synthesis; “spooled wholeness” as both object logic and ethical stance is memorable. The rescue via emotional headings cleverly literalizes the method’s stakes. Risks in tone and conceit heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. Final repricing (blank lines as archive) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
