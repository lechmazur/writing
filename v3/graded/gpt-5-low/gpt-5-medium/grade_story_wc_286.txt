<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive and steady, character‑particular interiority; her micro‑choices (giving the last water, shaping/firing cups, placing them “in each timeline”) align with a disciplined ethos of holding without forcing. Contradictory impulses are subtle rather than dramatic, skewing toward serenity over friction. Visible cost includes water sacrifice and time/effort under heat. The endurance choice at the end (to be that someone elsewhere) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural design teaches its pattern (glass, threads, thrum) and lands a resonant reconfiguration: the place resists change through repeated kindness, and she chooses to enact and extend that rule. Cost is legible on the page (last water; patient labor; leaving cups behind). Single scene holds cleanly with coherent cadence shift as the threads braid and the sound returns. No orientation debt and no causality breaks within the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The oasis/hives/heat not only color but constrain choices: water scarcity drives the offering; hive wood and apiary bricks supply tools/fuel; smoke flattening serves as environmental pressure. The lantern glass functions as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered (potter’s craft metaphors). World rules (fractured timelines via light) are learned through action, not exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can care reconfigure a resisting place?) tightens as small offerings escalate (water → cleaning → song → cups → cross‑thread gifts). The “thrum” and braided timelines mark deepening pressure and feedback. Price is modest but real, and the decision forecloses easier withdrawal. Lack of overt opposition keeps it quiet, but escalation under the accumulative lens is clear.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through enacted kindness and craft ethos rather than lecture; key line “Because the same kindness keeps happening here” is embedded as image‑answer from the glass, not authorial summary. Recurring images (glass, threads, thrum, smoke, cups) reweight at closure. The final intention reframes “resistance to change” as practice, not stasis, without tidy moralizing. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Distinct lyrical POV with a potter’s perceptual signature (“breath measured like a slow kick wheel,” “bowls that hold by shape, not grip”). Rhythm modulates with pressure; elision is taught and legible. No head‑hopping or register slips. Compression serves image‑driven action and closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful metaphors; lines often do double duty. The lyric texture remains coherent; repetitions (thrum, smoke flattening) are pattern‑taught, not redundant. Minor risk of metaphor saturation never muddies clarity, especially at the end. Syntax and paragraphing vary to maintain propulsion.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Lantern glass braiding “past, now, almost,” beekeeping oasis phototropic to kindness, and practical craft actions as ritual produce a fresh synthesis. Risks (lyric mysticism with manual labor) pay off and feel inevitable in hindsight. The conceptual turn is non‑obvious yet grounded. Stakes remain human‑scaled and precise, avoiding template sentiment.</comment>
