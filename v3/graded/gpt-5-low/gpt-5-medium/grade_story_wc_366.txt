<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is vivid and particular; the keeper’s motive to “protect the tender hush” coheres with micro-choices (lighting the candle, stacking stones, writing “We are still here”). Contradictory impulses (ache versus duty) surface without tidy resolution. The brief exchange with the skipper reveals relational texture through restraint. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stance with a felt cost of solitude and ongoing vigilance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the lamp’s failure mid-storm initiates a patterned build (letters, stones, sea glass) that culminates in a charged poise at dawn. Closure lands with cost through the keeper’s recommitment and quiet “Thank you,” reweighting safety as an ache rather than an outcome. Orientation is clear early (lighthouse, storm, keeper, skipper), and the single-scene window is coherent. The persistent constraint (dead lamp/haunted room) shapes tactics through the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: fog, tide, and the lantern room’s “listening” condition the keeper’s options (candle, stones, letter ritual). Objects-as-setting (sea glass, stacked stones) charge the final image. Weather and tide timing (slack tide delivery; dawn’s arrival) modulate pressure credibly. The environment never reads as postcard; it’s lived, tactile, and decisive.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining a felt safety—tightens when the lamp dies, forcing makeshift measures and recommitment. Escalation is quiet but firm under the accumulative lens: stones for love, the unsentimental myth of the drowned keeper, and the skipper’s early arrival focus cost and choice. The final stance forecloses escape into numbness by embracing the ache as guiding light. Pressure remains coherent without coincidence solving anything.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: anonymous care, ritual communication, and the redefinition of safety as luminous ache. The line “Safety is not the absence of loss…” edges toward thesis-statement candor, but surrounding imagery earns it. The final taste image (candle smoke, salt, softened paper) reprices the whole system without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silence (the skipper’s unread question) deepens resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The voice is singular, controlled, and sensorially biased to this keeper’s life; diction and syntax are consistent and supple. Minimal dialogue carries subtext and advances action without breaking the lyric register. Psychic distance remains steady; no head‑hopping or unearned omniscience. Patterned elision is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: images carry multiple jobs, rhythm varies, and there’s little scaffold or redundancy. Figurative density is high yet coherent, rarely tipping into muddle. Key beats are shown, not summarized, and the final cadence lands clean. A single aphoristic sentence risks over-explicitness but does not dull the closure image.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—anonymous letter chain, stone codes, sea glass as inner light—feels freshly inevitable. Risks (haunted lantern room, mythic communal current) heighten stakes without gimmickry. The mosaic of small acts reframes lighthouse duty in a non‑obvious way. Specificity and emotional truth distinguish it from familiar lighthouse elegies.</comment>
