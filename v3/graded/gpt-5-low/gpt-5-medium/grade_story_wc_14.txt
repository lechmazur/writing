<question>1</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A singular, credible sensibility: the stationer’s patient craft and ethical stance (“a workable grammar for waiting”) root every action. Motivation is legible and sustained; micro‑choices (charting hums, refracting light, choosing endurance) align with traits. The main limitation is a near‑absence of contradictory impulses or friction that would expose deeper fault lines under pressure.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds cleanly: lamp hum → refracted light → drafted “invented histories” → delivery to a silent town → freezing basin → recommitment. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in the final switch‑flip: he persists, with cost in isolation and the lamp’s weakening. Orientation is early and firm; cost is felt if quiet.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is exquisitely integrated: bonsai labyrinth, basin, fluorescent lamp, and glass shard are not decor but instruments shaping tactic and meaning. Weather and season (fog, freezing) modulate method and image, charging the final poise. Specificity is POV‑filtered and purposeful throughout.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate around sustaining communal memory during silence; pressure deepens via material constraints (fog, freezing, fading hum). The basin’s freeze and spring’s weakening hum function as a tightening that tests his method and resolve. The conflict remains quiet and internal, trading sharp reversals for a measured ratcheting.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Resonant inquiry into truth as function (“invented histories” that bear weight) emerges through concrete practice rather than sermon. The motif net (hum, gold edges, refracted light, bonsai patience) coheres and reweights at the end. A couple of direct statements (“Invented histories are not false…”) skim the edge of over‑explicitness.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a calibrated register—precise lexicon, rhythmic confidence, and consistent focalization. The prose modulates with pressure (lamp wakening, basin freezing) without breaking stance. No head‑hopping or gratuitous elision; pattern taught early and maintained.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density; images do double duty, and syntax varies for momentum and breath. Lushness is disciplined by craft‑logic; figurative language earns its keep and rarely blurs sense. Minor risk of purple excess is kept in check by operational specificity (measurements, refracting, frequencies).</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Concept and execution feel singular: a stationer harvesting hum and light to compose functional myths for a paused town. Risks (lyric method, object‑driven ritual) heighten meaning rather than obscure it. The freshness stems from integrated craft logic, not ornament.</comment>
