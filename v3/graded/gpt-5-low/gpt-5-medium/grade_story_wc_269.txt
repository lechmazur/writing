<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation is precise and sustained: the keeper seeks to learn why paths vanish and adapts tactics (pressing “Assemble,” decoding taps, convening the village). Interiority is specific to a diver/monitor’s sensibility and avoids platitudes. Contradictory impulses (skepticism of the key’s label vs need to risk pressing it; scientific inference vs communal ritual) create live tension. The endurance/renunciation at the end (accepting a road that only exists in time) feels earned with a subtle cost.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterned beats (tapping, ribbons, logs) coherently accrete toward a reconfiguration: path-as-schedule. The closure lands on page with cost: a choreographed, perishable corridor requiring nightly assembly and acceptance that stability is impossible. Orientation is clear from the outset (station, new keeper, goal), and all set‑ups pay off (key, atlas page, taps). The lens holds through to the final conceptual repricing line.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The station’s tools, tides, and flats aren’t scenic wallpaper; they constrain options (decoding data, walking only at timed windows) and power the solution. Recurring objects (console, key, lanterns, atlas page) charge the final images (lantern-spine, writing beats). Sensory specificity is filtered through a professional bias (swell counts, spawning slicks, sand tongues) and remains consistent. Environment and objects decisively shape choices and closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are focused (safety/route vs erasure), and pressure tightens via discovery: pressing “Assemble,” decoding the old keeper’s taps, and risking a communal night crossing. The decisive deepening—recognizing the path as a rhythm—forces a trade: timing over fixed ground, with daily re‑setting under storms. Escalation is inward and procedural rather than peril-chase, but it remains coherent under the chosen lens. The protagonist’s radio call and choreography are agency‑forward and pay a visible logistical price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Themes of adaptation, memory, and “assembly” as temporal rather than spatial solidity emerge from actions, not moralizing. The final repricing—“nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move”—reweights every prior image (ribbon, vertebrae, lanterns) with cost and grace. Subtext (reef’s dying breath guiding a living corridor) operates through images and community ritual. Complexity is embraced without tidy comfort.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular, assured lyric voice fuses scientific lexicon with tidal music; diction and rhythm are consistent with a diver‑keeper’s mind. Purposeful elision and recurrence are taught early (tap patterns, “periodically eternal”) and pay off cleanly at closure. No head‑hopping; stance and distance are controlled, with modulation under pressure (from solitary analysis to communal radio call). The lone line of dialogue is functional and in‑voice.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is taut, image‑dense, and purposeful; sentences do multiple jobs without scaffold or synonym churn. Repetition is patterned, not looped, and metaphors stay coherent with the sea/tide/body system. Momentum builds smoothly; no purple accumulations blur sense. The opening and final lines are precise anchors that recharge earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—tide data as rhythm, a mislabeled “Assemble” key, reef biology shifting a time‑road—feels both surprising and inevitable. Risks (lyric science‑ritual blend, accumulative structure) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The atlas-as-score and lantern‑spine images are distinctive and memorable. The premise would not transplant cleanly; its ingenuity is inseparable from its particulars.</comment>
