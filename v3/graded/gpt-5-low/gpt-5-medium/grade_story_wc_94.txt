<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motivation (“to understand the cartography of scars”) fuels concrete micro‑choices: climbing, pressing/stopping the timer, reciting the forbidden poem, and asking about the ash‑drawn constellation. Interiority is embodied (“thumb hovering… as if above a pulse”; fear thinning into clarity). The “furiously tranquil” stance operates as a credible contradiction under pressure. Slight idealization remains—the poet’s flaws are more implied by censorship than dramatized—but the arc earns its stance.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the poet aligns the constellation with their own scar, claims purpose (“This is why I write”), and restarts the timer to measure courage; the cost is facing erased history and living by a ritual that demands ongoing exposure. Orientation is clean from the first line (who/where/when). Setups (timer, storm, envelope, teacher) pay off coherently without mechanical over‑explaining.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The observatory, storm, dome, switchboard, timer, camera, and chart are tactile, integrated constraints that dictate tactics (timing speech to thunder, pausing at flashes). Weather is not decorative; it sets cadence and governs the vigil. The final city image (“like a healed page drying”) is charged by these physicalities. Specificity is filtered through the poet’s sensibility, avoiding tourist panorama.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Stakes concentrate on voice reclaimed vs. silence; escalation accrues via ritual: initiating the timer, speaking the forbidden poem, the lineage reveal, the charged pause at the thunder crest, and the final recommitment. Pressure tightens through the “when masks slip” window and the ethical demand to read harm and “refuse” it. Costs remain conceptual/emotional rather than materially foreclosing a path, but the charged poise is credible and earned.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of censorship, lineage, and mapping pain into guidance arise through concrete motifs (ash‑constellation, scars-as-topography, timing as witness). Subtext operates in the ritualized pauses and the caretaker’s oblique authority (“as if stillness and velocity had brokered a truce”). The explicit line “This is why I write” edges toward a thesis statement, but it is earned by prior scene‑work and does not flatten the resonance. The ending image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct, coherent lyric voice with controlled rhythm and image‑logic; dialogue is lean, charged, and in character, advancing subtext and stakes. POV distance stays steady; uncertainty is purposeful and pattern‑taught. Elevated diction matches the poet’s sensibility and the caretaker’s ritual tone. Under peak beats, cadence tightens without slipping into opacity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with multi‑tasking lines; repetition (“furiously tranquil,” timing motifs) is patterned and functional. Figurative texture is rich yet mostly coherent; occasional lushness nudges purple but remains legible and on‑mission. No scaffold loops or cadence templates; syntax varies to support momentum. The final image resolves with clarity and rhythmic control.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: storm‑as‑archive, scars‑as‑map, and a ritual of timed silence turn familiar resistance tropes into a distinctive rite. The ash‑constellation reveal grounds lineage without contrivance. Risks in lyric density and conceptual frame pay off in coherence and closure. It stops short of radical formal reinvention, but the integration feels singular and memorable.</comment>
