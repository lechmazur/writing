<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s involuntary candor and devotion to ritual motivate concrete choices: enforcing the riddle, revealing the hidden tray, and opening the box despite reluctance. Contradictory impulses—preserving wonder vs. urgency—surface in “truth pinned my tongue and freed my hands.” Emotional texture is embodied through tactile, olfactory cues (smoke, stormfruit, lacquer whisper). The cost is subtle but real: surrendering the guarded object and control to Mara.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear causal chain: Mara arrives → riddle → reveal → lightning channeled → drones wake. Single-scene structure holds, with closure delivered on-page as both a material reset (drones reawaken) and a conceptual reweighting (ritual as necessary function). Cost is legible in the act of revealing the guarded tray and relinquishing the box. The Hybrid lens is steady, with causal dominance at the end.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail (“nectar dusk,” “rods smelling of stormfruit”) is integrated into action and choice. The lightning tower and capacitors materially constrain tactics—the queen tone only activates through the tower’s lightning. Recurring objects (matchbox, lacquer box) charge the final images and guide movement through space. World rules feel consistent and learned through use rather than exposition.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the hive network without losing ritual—tightens via the riddle gate and the compelled reveal. Escalation is gentle but present: from gatekeeping to collaboration under live lightning; the decisive intensification comes when the tower’s “first lightning breath” demands action. The price is a relinquishing of guardianship to efficacy. No major reversal, but deepening aligns with the chosen lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme coheres: wonder as currency and ritual as the antidote to forgetful functionality, embodied in toll-taking by riddle and the queen tone’s restorative song. The ending reweights the premise—“payment that keeps my work alive” and the drones as punctuation completing thought. A couple of declarative lines flirt with direct statement, but emerge credibly from the narrator’s ethos. The final image resonates without moralizing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical voice with coherent metaphor families (nectar/bee/lightning/music) sustains pressure without drift. POV is stable, with dialogue serving action and subtext (wonder vs. speed). Diction and rhythm modulate naturally from quiet gatekeeping to charged activation. No head-hopping or stance leakage; elisions are purposeful and paid off.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is economical and musical; images do multiple jobs (world, theme, motion). Figurative language stays coherent to the established motif; no mixed metaphors or template cadence runs. Sentences vary in length and propulsion with scene needs; minimal redundancy. The closing line tightens both sense and theme cleanly.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a toll keeper of wonder at a lightning tower, drone hives needing a “queen tone,” and ritualized access by riddle. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the world’s logic and the narrator’s trait. Risks in diction and conceit heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The vision reads singular and integrated rather than stitched from tropes.</comment>
