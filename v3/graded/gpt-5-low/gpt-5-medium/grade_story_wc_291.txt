<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s prosopagnosia and methodical temperament drive concrete choices (lancing, refusing to pocket items, painting people without faces). A credible contradiction—hunger to know versus renunciation of certainty—culminates in “I do not know who harmed her.” Interiority is particular and embodied via tactile engagements (knot, ribbon, rebar). Minor distance from on‑page interpersonal friction limits the crucible effect.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (ribbon → phone case → perfume) deepen pattern and reweight stakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: the admission of not‑knowing and the letter from the woman in blue reconfigure the case into an empathy praxis with cost. Orientation is clear from the opening quarry scene, and the studio/letters shard coherently. The price—choosing empathy and art over solving—is legible in the final beats.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The quarry’s mist, soft ground, and shallows constrain tactics (lancing, edging the lip) and supply objects that drive meaning. Micro‑setting details (rebar, rust ladder, silt, gas) are purpose‑driven and filter through the artist’s perceptual bias. The environment charges the final image via the painting and the floating blue ribbon. Sensory selection is economical and atmospheric without tourist cataloging.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—extracting truth/empathy from a cold site—is signaled early; the key tightening is the blue‑ribbon mismatch prompting the identity‑swap inference. Pressure coheres through accumulative discoveries and culminates in a renunciation (“I do not know who harmed her”) that forecloses the solve‑it path. The cost is felt but quiet; absence of a live antagonist or harder on‑page push keeps the escalation modest by design.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motifs (mask, ribbon, knots, lancing) braid into a coherent meditation on empathy as “unifying opposites” and the ethics of attention. The painting as act of care, and the letter’s ambiguous confession, generate subtext without neat absolution. The final standalone line “To awaken dormant empathy” leans toward overt thesis, slightly blunting the earned resonance.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinctive, controlled lyric voice with a strong perceptual signature (“Cold cases are the rooms where echoes go to practice speech”). POV remains stable and plausibly bounded; inference reads as inference. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and the cadence teaches its pattern early. No dialogue needed; compression stays legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with images doing multiple jobs; line rhythm varies and supports momentum. Figurative language is abundant but largely disciplined and coherent to the character’s idiom (ribbon’s “kink like a memory,” grief “slow and sulfurous”). Minor risk of saturation in a few adjacent metaphors, but clarity and propulsion hold. Clean mechanics and sequencing.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a face‑blind portraitist investigating via posture, object memory, and “unifying opposites” reframes the cold‑case trope. The quarry artifacts and the method inflect both tactics and theme, culminating in a charged, non‑obvious final reweighting. Risks (lyric density, quiet resolution) pay off with coherence and specificity.</comment>
