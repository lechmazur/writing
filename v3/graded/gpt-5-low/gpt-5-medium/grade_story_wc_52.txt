<question>1</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and choice-driven: she refuses to sand the knot, carves a collar rather than a lion, leaves the keepsake tin shut, and decides not to restore the scuffed name. Contradictory impulses—repair versus faithful absence—act in the moment (“absence, too, deserves a faithful likeness”). Micro‑choices track to a value hierarchy of restraint, trust, and ritual. The final renunciations feel earned by prior acts of careful containment.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (kettle as metronome; rain beads as lenses) and held through closure. On‑page closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses not to fix the name, keeps the tin shut, wraps the carving, opens the window—accepting absence with cost. Orientation is immediate (widow, loft, morning ritual). The kettle‑clock structures one continuous scene and the cost is legible in the refusal to restore and to summon memory.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The loft, skylight, rain, ropes, and kettle are tactile, integrated, and constraint-bearing; the kettle’s whistle times choices, the rain’s lenses reframe perception, and the window opening charges the final image. Object-as-setting is exemplary: wood, tools, and tea guide tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-biased (circus and animal idiom). The environment decisively charges the ending tableau (“like a new ring”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—how to hold grief without fixing it—is signaled early and deepens under the kettle’s ticking pressure. The turn tightens at the knot decision and culminates in the renunciations (not restoring the tag; leaving the tin shut) with a felt price. Escalation is textural but coherent: steam builds, whistle blooms, then a quieting that enables her decisive stance. The cost is internal, visible through restrained action.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: here/gone, hinge, trust, and the ethics of leaving absence intact. Recurring images (knot, lenses, collar, whistle) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The line “If you must be here and gone, teach me the hinge” crystallizes the inquiry and the final tableau answers it by practiced restraint. Resonance lingers, avoiding tidy prescription.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with a circus/woodcraft lexicon remains consistent and controlled. Rhythm modulates with pressure (whistle building, then quiet pour) and the metaphoric field stays coherent (animals, tools, rain). No head‑hopping; focalization is steady and plausible. Elisions feel purposeful and taught by pattern.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Sentence‑level craft is tight and propulsive for lyric prose; lines do multiple jobs with minimal scaffold. Figurative density is high but disciplined, staying within a consistent metaphor set; no mixed vehicles dull sense. Cadence varies and lands cleanly on the charged last image. No loops or redundancy that sap momentum.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The fusion of circus widowhood, woodcarving a collar, and a kettle‑timed ritual of grief feels singular and inevitable. Risks (lyric density, quiet stakes) pay off with clarity and a fresh hinge metaphor. Turns and images grow from lived specifics rather than template gestures. The final reconfiguration is memorable and non‑obvious.</comment>
