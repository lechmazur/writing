<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear motive (liberate the pinned names) and embodied fear/resolve (“cataloging my fear…”) drive micro-choices under pressure. The relationship with Mara functions as crucible and method, her touch cueing a pivotal tactic shift. Internal contradiction—wariness versus calm, ritualized action—reads credibly without therapy-speak. The endurance-based “win” feels earned by prior tactics.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern builds via dance, dice, and encoded hesitation, then reweights at the “question” that opens the vent. Orientation is crisp early (sunken lab, Warden Current, two actors) and the closure lands on-page with conceptual cost (defiance under surveillance, doubt as breach). The blue warning pulse tightens the middle without derailing coherence. The final image of strands humming with liberated voices seals the reconfiguration.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The flooded lab is not backdrop; water, silt, glass margins, and rigging constraints dictate method and movement. The floor-as-page and cameras’ blind margins directly shape tactics. Recurring objects (dice, glass tablets, rigging “spider”) charge the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, integrated with action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (free the names) is signaled early and escalates through the Warden’s warning and the “question” key that risks exposure. Agency is constant—dance, encoded hesitation, negative-space movement—and the turn forecloses open confrontation in favor of subversion. The price is mostly conceptual (risk, patience, self-effacement) rather than a visible loss, but it’s felt. The resolution stems from their chosen grammar of resistance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>“Encrypt vulnerability as strength” is dramatized through hesitations and stutters becoming code, not told as thesis. The Warden “forgives answers but not doubt” reframes the moral calculus and pays off as the operative key. The finale reweights prior motifs (web, dice, margins) without moralizing. Subtext of survivor grammar and embodied resistance lingers.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>A singular perceptual signature—tactile, aquatic, and coded—remains controlled and legible throughout. Elision is purposeful and taught early; no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates under pressure (blue warning) without losing clarity. Diction stays true to the narrator’s lyric intelligence.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High-density lyricism largely serves action and meaning; images are coherent and non-redundant. Occasional lushness edges toward excess but doesn’t blur causality or the closure image. Sentence rhythms vary and propel. No noticeable loops or scaffold.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Striking synthesis: dance-as-cryptography in a drowned lab, dice that “remember hesitation,” doubt as breach. Risks in concept and diction pay off with a fresh, inevitable-feeling reconfiguration. Objects and environment are integral rather than ornamental. The vision feels singular and confident.</comment>
