<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive is precise and persistent (“to find where shadows go at noon”), and their “quietly deliberate” temperament governs tactics (mirrors, shutters, rune). Interiority is concrete and idiosyncratic, filtered through a rune‑scholar’s lexicon. Internal contradiction is subtle rather than overt; cost appears as consenting to a binding (“the line slipped under my skin”), not heavy emotional rupture. The endurance/renunciation feels credible at this scale, though a sharper on‑page struggle would lift it further.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: repeated loops and mechanical windings accrue toward a CR closure where noon is reconceived as an agreement. Orientation is clean early (observatory, caretaker, key), and each action coherently sequences toward the contract image. Closure lands on the page with cost—the signed gold line entering the body and the island “breathing noon” without sun. The pattern taught (loops, sealed awakenings) is kept and paid off without contradictions.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory and floating isle do more than decorate; the absence of noon creates the central constraint and dictates tactics (shutters seam, mirror ring, key socket). Details are vivid and purposeful (“collimators asleep like cattle,” chalk you could taste), and rules emerge through action. The setting charges the final image as the island “breathes noon” despite perpetual night. World consistency never wobbles.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around compelling the impossible noon: arranging mirrors, narrowing the light seam, entering the noon‑within, then signing. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal and is driven by the protagonist’s agency. The price is conceptual and bodily (consenting to a contract under the skin), not spectacle, but it tightens options credibly. A moment of jeopardy or failed attempt could have intensified the squeeze.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: loops, contracts, and “sealed awakenings” reframe knowledge and loss as kept agreements. The shadows’ chorus (“Noon is an agreement...”) functions as embodied subtext rather than moral, later cashed out by the signature under the skin. The final image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing, inviting reflection on decision and memory. Resonance lingers with conceptual cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent POV and precise idiom (runes, instruments, contracts) carries the piece. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure, and brief dialogue is lean and subtextual. No head‑hopping or stance slippage, and the pattern of elision is taught then honored. A hair more variation in cadence near the peak could sharpen propulsion.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is dense yet clear; images are fresh and functional, with minimal scaffold. Figurative textures interlock (loops, keys, hinges) rather than clash, and beats do more than one job. Minor risk of saturation in metaphor is deftly managed; momentum holds through the ritual sequence. Syntax varies and punctuation is clean.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—noon as contract, shadows as “sealed awakenings,” utensils that “remember”—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. Risks in world logic and diction pay off coherently and serve character and stakes. Turns arise from established patterns rather than late rule drops. The vision reads authentically its own, not a collage of genre ticks.</comment>
