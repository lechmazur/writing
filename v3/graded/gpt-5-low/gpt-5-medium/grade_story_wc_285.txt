<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained: deliver the parcel/promise and “distill complexity into essence.” The coachman’s micro‑choices (offering the needle, committing to the crossing, finding rhythm on the oar) reveal a patient, attentive temperament under pressure. Relationship dynamics with Wren sharpen the choices and evolve credibly (“your road is water tonight”). The emotional cost is quiet but felt: accepting fear and labor as part of the vow.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stitching + ferrying cohere into a Charged Poise/RR closure as the far bank reconfigures the coachman’s sense of road and burden. Orientation is solid early (fog‑bound crossing, coachman, ferry), and the final image pays the promise. Cost is understated but present (weather/river pressure, acceptance of fear, the labor of stitching/rowing). The single meaningful tightening occurs at the current’s turn and the choice to hold rhythm until the gutters stop.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The fog‑bound crossing, ferry rope’s burr, and rain‑gutter metronomes are not postcard details; they shape tactics and mood. Environment constrains choices (visibility, current) and charges the final image (map‑sail trembling, fog parting). Object‑as‑setting (needle/map/sailcloth) integrates with landscape. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through the coachman’s patience‑driven attention.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—complete the crossing and fulfill the promise—stays coherent. Escalation is modest but functional: the current tries to turn them; they answer by stitching/rowing in rhythm and time‑boxing “until rain gutters stop ticking.” The costs are exertion, exposure, and choosing motion over fear. Resolution follows from their agency rather than luck.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of rewriting fear without erasing it is embodied in the palimpsest stitching and the river crossing. Subtext runs through the needle, letters, and map—memory acknowledged, not obliterated. The final reweighting (“hills…more like breathing”) offers an earned, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Occasional declaratives (“This map shows everything…”) flirt with on‑the‑nose but are counterbalanced by image‑driven work.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a perceptual signature (ambient awareness, river idiom). Dialogue is spare, carries subtext, and advances action. POV remains clean and plausibly bounded; no head‑hopping. Rhythm modulates well at pressure points without losing clarity.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images often do double duty. The metaphor web is consistent (river, cloth, stitching) and doesn’t blur action, though a few lines edge toward purple. Syntax varies and momentum carries through the crossing. The final cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stitching a drowning‑map to ancestral letters with a moonlit thread feels fresh and thematically integral. The “palimpsest promise” concept is executed, not just named, and the ferry setting is used inventively. Risks in lyric density largely pay off in coherence and resonance. The piece’s ingenuity lies in synthesis rather than twist.</comment>
