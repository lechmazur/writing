<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and persistent (“to cultivate serenity within motion”), and choices under pressure—planting at the bridge heart, enduring the stink, orchestrating drums—align with a specific interiority. Contradictions (ambition vs. stewardship; fear/taboo vs. necessity) are present and resolved credibly. Embodiment through scent and rope/bridge tactility gives her emotions a lived edge. The cost is mostly social and sensory, a touch neat but earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: parcel → planting → bloom/stink → communal breath → steadied bridges → council clarity. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when) and the closure lands on the page with cost (taboo broken, stink endured). The final image reconfigures options (village can choose amid stink) and the protagonist’s stance softens into stewardship. Causality is felt even in lyric mode.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The treetop village and rope-bridges are not wallpaper; they dictate the site of action (bridge heart) and the solution (teaching ropes to echo heartbeats). Sensory specificity, especially olfaction and sway, is filtered through the herbalist’s bias. Setting charges the final hush with the bridges physically steadied. World rules are consistent and learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stabilize motion) is clear and tightens: village restlessness → taboo object choice → controlled blooming → communal endurance. The decisive escalation is the bloom’s stink and the village’s forced sitting-with-it during the council. Costs are legible (social risk, physical revulsion, confronting grief) and the price reframes motion. It’s quiet but coherent, with one meaningful turn that narrows options.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme coheres through particulars: rot as balance, motion needing calm, wisdom as undercurrent rather than stasis. The corpse flower reweights grief and communal decision-making without sermonizing; the flies’ line toes the edge of explicitness but is dramatized via her unique sense. The final shift to stewardship is a resonant, non-literal answer. Recurring images (spirals, ropes, breath) accrue meaning credibly.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a clear perceptual signature (scent-first cognition, rope/air lexicon) remains stable under pressure. Purposeful repetitions (“I journalize…”) teach the pattern and pay off. No head-hopping or stance wobble; elision feels intentional and legible. Rhythm modulates effectively at the bloom and hush.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>High information density with few redundancies; images do multiple jobs. Metaphoric texture is rich yet coherent to the established sensory logic, avoiding muddle. Minor risk of lushness is balanced by clarity in key beats (“When the spadix speared dusk…”). Opening and final lines are charged and precise.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—olfactory herbalism, corpse flower as communal stabilizer, “tide’s thought,” rope-heart pedagogy, doodle-maps-as-recipes—feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The risk of centering stink and grief as curative pays off thematically and structurally. Turns arise from established premises and voice rather than late rule changes. It’s a memorable, non-obvious angle executed with confidence.</comment>
