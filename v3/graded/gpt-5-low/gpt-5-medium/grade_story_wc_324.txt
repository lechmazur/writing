<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct, embodied interiority—“listening becomes a structure I can walk through”—grounds motive and micro-choices (searching, walking despite the supervisor, guiding the call). The quiet flaw/virtue pair (compulsive listening vs. curiosity) credibly drives action. Secondary figures press meaningfully without flattening: the man’s grief and the child’s sparrow‑light voice sharpen the narrator’s stakes. Internal contradiction is present but subtle; a touch more on-the-spot friction would push it higher.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clean causal links: phones tremble → hearing aid ping → gallery → photo misread → man revealed → connection. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator brokers contact and reframes “finding” as a charged endurance, with emotional cost borne by all three. Orientation is strong from the opening and the taught pattern holds through the end. The price—living with grief while choosing to keep listening—lands on the page in the final hush.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and functional: mist-clad atrium, sleeping guard, gallery of “unclaimed photographs,” and the hearing aid as a micro‑setting tool that constrains movement and choices. Environment shapes tactics (walking the city, slipping past the guard) and charges the final image. Sensory selection is disciplined and POV-filtered (glass “that remembers every face”). World rules (the dead call) are learned through action, not dumped.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protecting a vulnerable voice by finding the right connection—is signaled early and tightens at the misread photo → man alive reversal. Pressure coheres as the narrator must choose to act against institutional friction and risk failure with the child on the line. The cost is primarily emotional and ethical, felt in the patience and grief carried into the final action. A small additional on-page trade-off would have amplified the price.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of listening as labor and love accrues through particulars (right ear as tenderness, not impairment; grief “redialed his sleep”). The “incidental heroism” final turn reweights the whole—quiet service over grand gesture—without moralizing. Subtext works in image and silence; the hearing aid’s pulses recode what “finding” means. Resonance lingers in the charged stillness of the last lines.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A singular, controlled lyric voice with precise metaphors (“wind in a bottle,” “pocketed sparrow”) and consistent focalization. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, riding implication rather than explication. Rhythm modulates with pressure, and elision is taught and paid off. No head‑hopping; certainty stays within what the narrator can plausibly infer.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with few to no loops; images generally do double duty (atmosphere + function). Figurative language is frequent but coherent and anchored to action; no purple drift or mixed metaphors. Minor risk of saturation in a couple of adjacent lines, but momentum holds. Syntax and paragraphing support propulsion and breath.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh premise and execution: a “contact tracer for hearts,” a hearing aid as compass, and a gallery of “unclaimed photographs” transform familiar grief material. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight; the misread ear reframes character and tactic elegantly. The piece takes aesthetic risks (lyric accumulation, soft closure) that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional specificity and conceptual integrity mark it as singular.</comment>
