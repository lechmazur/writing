<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator’s motive—turning questions into destinations—drives concrete choices (needle alignment, fencing tactics, blocking Rook at the map) and culminates in the decision to enter. Interiority is specific and embodied (“even my stillness sounded argumentative”), with competence balanced by a conceptual risk in leaving. Status dynamics with Liese and Rook shift credibly from opposition to treaty. Only minor abstraction at peak beats keeps it shy of the very top.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid drive with Accumulative dominance: patterned light and objects accrue until the sundial throws the gate; the decisive act is signing and stepping through. Closure lands on the page with cost—the loser’s signature, the relinquishment of certainty, and departure into the unknown. Orientation is clean from the first lines (glass atrium, brook; single scene). Because/therefore linkages hold: decoding begets map, pressure begets duel, insight begets entry.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook aren’t postcard; panes and sun literally enable the code, making environment a tool and constraint. The needle card and half-painted sundial function as micro-settings that shape tactics and charge the final image (shadow-gate on tiles). Sensory texture is vivid without stray cataloging. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlocking/entering) tightens with Rook’s arrival, the duel, and the map’s sudden vulnerability. The key turn is blocking Rook’s lunge at the floor-map and reconfiguring conflict into collaboration via the “three signatures” condition. The price—accepting loss and stepping into uncertainty—reads on-page. Stakes are more conceptual than visceral, but pressure remains coherent and rising.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (“philosophy worth steel is an address”) emerges from acts, not sermonizing: tools as arguments, patience as muscle, ignorance as a blade. The “hidden overture” refrains and reweights at the gate, offering a resonant non-literal answer: enter the question rather than resolve it. Liese’s mercy line adds ethical texture without tidy moral. The ending’s sensory specifics (“rain on chalk and apple cores”) elevate the repricing.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with a perceptual signature (argumentative stillness, locksmith bow) remains stable under stress. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful and subtext-rich (riposte asking for sources; “a door cannot be fenced”). No head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates well between poised observation and kinetic action.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is elegant and dense, with images doing multiple jobs and minimal scaffold. A few stretches flirt with purple, but metaphors are coherent to the established lexicon (music, steel, light) and don’t blur action. No paraphrase loops or cadence templates dull momentum. Final lines land cleanly and recharge earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Mechanical-arm philosopher, sundial code, and “hidden overture” synthesis feels singular and inevitable in hindsight. The duel as argument and the door as answer-by-entry are bold, coherent risks that heighten stakes without gimmickry. Turns grow from prior particulars, not late rule changes. The piece feels memorably its own.</comment>
