<question>1</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Motivation and inner conflict are vivid and particular: love vs vocation, patience vs urgency, embodied through the cicada’s weight and the grotto’s hush. The narrator’s “warmly observant” impulse both steadies and endangers the moment (you “perhaps felt abandoned”), showing real trade‑offs. The decision to go inland is earned by the prior weighing of futures and the method of circling truth. Slight safety in the partner’s quiet limits complicating status shifts, but the relationship pressure still reads.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Single scene, single stake, clean orientation, and the accumulative/textural lens is taught and held. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible conceptual cost: “Yes, I will go inland,” after foreseeing futures and naming passage. The cicada hinge recurs to charge the final beat, and price is acknowledged (risk to identity and coast). No causality gaps or soft resets.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The grotto, lantern light, and sea textures saturate perception through a specialist’s lens, and the jade cicada functions as a charged micro‑setting/object. The environment doesn’t mechanically corner them, but it frames and deepens the decision and explicitly charges the final image (kissed cicada, grotto “approves”). Sensory selection is precise and purposeful, not touristic.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around one choice: to go inland or refuse, with love and vocation at stake. Escalation arrives via accumulative futures and the cicada’s “seam,” culminating in a narrowing of options and acceptance of cost. The tightening is quiet but unmistakable; the pause becomes a “tidepool” bowl that must be crossed. Stakes remain internal yet are felt on the page.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars—hinges, seams, littorals, and how attention alters time—without collapsing into a sermon. The final reconfiguration (“naming passage” and carrying the coast inland) reweights earlier motifs with emotional consequence. One or two near‑thesis lines skate close to explicitness but remain grounded in image and action. Resonance lingers with the star‑fed hinge and shared migration.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lyric first‑person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent; diction suits a tidal‑pool chronicler without register slips. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and pay off at closure. Dialogue is mostly implied and subtextual, fitting the hush. Rhythm modulates with the decision beat, maintaining control.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>High information density with images doing double duty; metaphors stay within a coherent marine/time lexicon. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentences move momentum forward. Lushness risks excess in places, but coherence holds and the closure image remains sharp. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—tidal‑pool chronicler, jade cicada as hinge, transition as seam—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risks (a fully lyric, pause‑bound decision) heighten stakes rather than blur them. Specificity and method (“tangential approach”) are integral, not ornamental. The final “extend the coast inland” turn is both surprising and earned.</comment>
