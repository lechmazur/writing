<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and sustained: bridge to Mira despite medical control, with a credible cost (accepting donors, surrendering to security). Interiority is vivid and particular, showing rebellious poise alongside tenderness and fear. Micro-choices (perching, tapping codes, stepping onto the bridge, giving wrists) align with values. The endurance at the end reads as an earned stasis that forecloses a simpler “recovery” path.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: sound, rhythm, and intention intensify into a legible closure. The decisive change lands on-page (Mira awakens; “agreed awakening”), with conceptual and relational cost (hosting donors, institutional consequences). Orientation is established early (research wing, night, garden-as-instrument), and each move logically grows from the last. The closing image reweights prior beats without mechanical tying-off.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are both tactile and rule-bearing: intention tunes stone, speakers answer with corridors, and the lagoon becomes a traversable bridge. Setting constrains and enables tactics (drumming to open paths). Details are selective and POV-filtered, balancing cosmic with concrete (rails, gravel, monitors). The environment charges the final image (“carrying the lagoon in our chest”).</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect/awaken Mira) is clear and escalates through rhythmic tactics, the lagoon, the crack, and the donor influx. The tightening moment—accepting foreign memories to save Mira—carries a felt price that lingers. Institutional pressure arrives (monitors, security) without deflating agency. Resolution grows from the protagonist’s insistence on shared rhythm over declared “recovery.”</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme of grief’s entanglement versus institutional untangling emerges through action, not thesis. The “recovery vs agreed awakening” line reframes the narrative without sermonizing, and donors’ incorporation complicates identity with grace. Recurring images (drumming, bridges, breath) re-signify by the end. The final exhale offers a resonant, non-literal answer about communal identity and chosen cost.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct lyric voice with controlled imagery and consistent POV; no leakage or unjustified omniscience. Diction matches the character’s sensibility, modulating tension through rhythm and sentence length. Purposeful elision is taught and paid off via sonic logic. The voice sustains pressure without resorting to expository scaffolding.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is lush yet disciplined; metaphors remain coherent to sound/sea/stars and avoid muddle. Information density is high with minimal redundancy; beats advance momentum. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple but clarity and propulsion hold, especially at closure. Final cadence precisely reprises early motifs without paraphrase loops.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound garden as instrument, entanglement via donors, auric lagoon as traversable tone—is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in form and concept heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The bridge-from-noise and cost of hosting others’ lives feel singular rather than templated. The ending’s reconfiguration honors that originality with earned consequence.</comment>
