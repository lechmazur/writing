<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interiority is specific and embodied (ledgering bone-notes, “unyoking” urgencies), with a credible contradiction between vigilance and restraint. The messenger and the village men apply real pressure that reveals values in action (redirecting them to “softly purposeful” work). Choices align with an earned ethos rather than declaration alone. The endurance at the end reads as an Earned Stasis with the cost of renouncing spectacle.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned returns (ice, moon paths, viaduct, humming) deepen and then reweight stakes at closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “not a storm but a school,” teaching begins indoors, and tools/rituals are laid down with cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no causality breaks. The price—choosing patience over panic—registers on the page (ropes lowered, slow tasks accepted).</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and deeply functional: the freeze gates “true work,” the magnetic viaduct shapes bodily tactics, and the basalt sanctuary provides the final teaching ground. Sensory textures are specific and POV‑driven (rails humming, ice “hammered glass,” reed-combed walls). Environment charges the final image and choices. Consistency of world rules (iron dust, swallows, magnetism) enhances authenticity.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around how to meet “change” without panic; it tightens with the messenger’s question and the men’s ropes. The protagonist’s stance crystallizes as patience-as-action, tested by directing communal labor away from spectacle toward maintenance. Cost is quiet but legible; stakes remain community steadiness versus fear. Escalation is measured but purposeful under the accumulative lens.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—transforming rage into form via attention and craft—emerges from concrete acts (moon-tracking, salt-carrying, cleaning iron dust). The “school not storm” line risks overt statement but feels earned by prior patterning and choice. The closing image reweights earlier motifs without tidy moral closure. Subtext lives in the shift from watching to teaching and in communal adoption of restraint.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyrical, and precise with a consistent perceptual signature; diction and rhythm modulate with pressure. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, carrying subtext (the girl’s flint question; men’s rope-worry). POV remains stable and credible; inference reads as inference. Patterned elision is taught and paid off by the closure image.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, and images doing multiple jobs. Figurative language is rich but disciplined; motifs recur with evolution rather than churn. Minimal scaffold and no harmful loops; prose propels rather than stalls. A few aphoristic lines flirt with abstraction but are grounded by adjacent concrete detail.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>“Magnetic viaduct after rain” and “patient revolution” synthesize into a fresh, memorable frame that feels inevitable by the end. Risks—quiet stakes, lyric texture, non-spectacular turn—heighten meaning rather than obscure it. Objects and environment are not ornament but operative logic. The emotional calculus (renunciation of haste) reads specific and lived-in, not generic.</comment>
