<question>1</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Motivation is clean and compelling (to rekindle the light for the living) and anchored in specific traits (fire-escape gardener, locksmith’s child). Interiority is embodied and particular—the bitting gauge, patched skiff, brittle wick tie grief to action. Contradictory impulses (tremor vs resolve; wistfulness vs pragmatism) play in-scene. The final choice reads earned, with a felt emotional cost coded in the quiet surrender of the shackle and the shake in the wrists.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clear causal spine: petal falls → launch → pick → clean → light → sweep. Closure is on-page (Decisive Change: lighthouse lit) with Charged Poise in the final image (“cut the lighthouse beam into slips”). Constraints persist (salt-bitten hinge, brittle wick), and the cost is legible in the careful, time-bound ministrations.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The harbor, skiff, pier, padlock, and lantern are tactile and constrain choices; the moonlight and salt damage matter to tactics. Object-as-setting (bitting gauge, wick, lens) charges the ending. Sensory detail is vivid but purpose-led, with professional perception (lock/soil analogies) shaping selection. Spatial and procedural logic track cleanly through the row, pick, prep, and light.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stakes are coherent and escalate from intention to tangible tests (row → lock → brittle wick → beam). The tightening is subtle but present; success isn’t trivialized by the careful cleaning and single quiet click that could fail. Cost is largely emotional and procedural rather than peril-based; a slight softness in jeopardy keeps it just shy of top-band.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme of repair, caretaking, and “protected vulnerability” emerges organically from concrete acts (patching skiff, nursing wick, housing flame). The final image reweights earlier material (rooting slips of light at home), offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The locksmith/gardener braid grounds the insight; no sermonizing undercuts the scene.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyrical first-person with consistent perceptual signature (gardener/locksmith lexicon). Rhythm modulates with pressure—measured during the pick, more expansive under the beam. No head-hopping or register drift; elisions are purposeful and legible. Peak beats remain clear despite lyric density.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is rich, precise, and propulsive; images often do double duty for plot and theme. A few metaphors verge on saturation, but clarity holds and repetition is purposeful. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and there’s minimal scaffold or redundancy. The density is high without slipping into muddle.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a fire-escape gardener using a lockmaster’s tooth to relight a dead lighthouse, then “rooting” light. The images (sleeping lung harbor, slips of beam) feel inevitable in hindsight and specific to this character. Risks in diction and conceit heighten coherence rather than read as ornament. The piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>
