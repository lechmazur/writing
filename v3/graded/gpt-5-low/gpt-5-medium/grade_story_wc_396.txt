<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation (“map empathy onto action”) is embodied through specific, process-driven choices (the mirror method; proposing shared watches and beacon saplings). The narrator’s patience vs. urgency contradiction is dramatized rather than told, with “I did not bring them certainty; I brought them a rehearsal for it.” Emotional cost lands in the commitment to stay a season and shoulder mistrust from both sides. Secondary characters exert precise pressure (Matilde’s ledger, Harun’s scrutiny) that reveals the peacekeeper’s values under stress.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Under an accumulative/textural lens, the mirror reconstruction and public proposal sequence coherently deepens pressure to a charged poise: the “weighted breath before reply” where the sphere hovers. Closure is on-page with cost (no prophecy, only practice; the narrator’s season-long watch). The two shards (shop, orchard assembly) are cleanly linked, and all set-ups pay off. Stakes narrow from accusation to a concrete, shared protocol, reconfiguring options without false neatness.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and ice floes are vivid, specific, and functionally constraining (heatless beacons; tide-timed watches). The vintage-store mirrors operate as an object-as-setting that changes tactics and charges the final image. Environmental forces (ice bite, groan, lantern pears) mirror ethical and logistical stakes without becoming decorative. The final sound of a floe splitting “like a page turning” elegantly charges the ending.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early (resolve theft-of-light feud without further loss). Escalation moves from evidence-gathering (mirrors) to a concrete plan tested by public challenge, tightening at the breath before reply. The price is refusal of certainty, social exposure, and the protagonist’s decision to remain and be accountable. A neat reversal is not needed; the cadence shift and foreclosed “verdict-only” path suffice.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Themes of reparative justice, communal practice over prophecy, and guilt-as-compost arise from image and action rather than lecture. The “courageous anomaly” reframing of the child threads ethics into record-keeping and future duty. A few aphoristic lines (“guilt would be compost, not a flag”) flirt with didacticism but feel earned by prior particulars. The final note reweights the premise toward practice, not revelation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with maritime-light lexicon stays stable and plausible for the focalizer. Compression and patterned imagery are taught early and pay off at closure with no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but pointed, carrying status and pressure via implication. Rhythm modulates effectively from investigative calm to communal tension.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Line-by-line craft is tight, with layered images doing multiple jobs (mirrors as memory, light, consent). Figurative density is high but coherent within the sea/ice/light field; no muddled metaphors or loops. Momentum holds through summary-compression that still advances tactics. Minor aphoristic turns do not blunt clarity or pressure.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The “lighthouse orchard” and “vintage mirrors reconstituting a sphere by consent” are strikingly original and integral. The mediator’s method is fresh, turning divination into communal memory-work with practical outcomes. The closure image (hovering sphere and weighted breath) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in form and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>
