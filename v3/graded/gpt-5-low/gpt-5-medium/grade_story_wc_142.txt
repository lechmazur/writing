<question>1</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Nessa’s motives are clear and intensify under pressure: protect the carnival’s memory while engaging the consortium. Contradictory impulses act in scene through the quiet war with her brother and the risky trade with the liaison. Micro‑choices—using the chip, stamping the pact, reorienting rafts—align with her “orderly intuitive” nature. The cost is felt: she buys only a season and exposes local grammar to outside power.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Clean causal chain: fences appear → coded responses → liaison confrontation → trade → chip‑triggered realignment → cross‑spend success and delay. Orientation is strong from the opening image; the drive lens reads Hybrid with causal dominance at closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s layout and alliances shift, buying time at a cost. The “only a season” line makes the price explicit on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The raft carnival is tactile and operative: tents as lungs, floats creak, fences shape movement, and the sea’s “counsel” undergirds choices. Setting actively constrains tactics—flow engineering through alleys and a literal re‑rigging of rafts. The foundation chip functions as micro‑setting/tool, charging the final image with history. Environmental logic holds and informs every move.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (keep culture without surrendering revenue) is signaled early and tightens via the VIP fences and liaison’s demand. Escalation is protagonist‑driven: the trade and console realignment foreclose riot and force exposure of a sacred tool. The cost—time‑boxed reprieve and partial opening of local codes—is clear. Tension operates across beats without coincidence solving the core problem.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (prosperity vs memory; choreography as civic ethics) emerges through images and tactics rather than lecture. The chip reweights heritage as functional power, not nostalgia, and the final harmony line reframes hope as disciplined risk. One thesis‑leaning line (“prosperity without memory…”) brushes the edge of didacticism but is earned by context. Ambiguity remains: victory is seasonal, consent contested.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lyric, precise first‑person with a distinct perceptual signature (“loops and ledgers,” “the sea kept its own counsel”). Voice remains stable under stress and modulates rhythm at turns. Sparse dialogue carries subtext and pressure without over‑explaining. No POV leakage; diction suits the world and character.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Line‑level craft is tight: images are fresh, layered, and purposeful (“laughter was being leased by the hour”). No paraphrase loops or muddled metaphors; sentences carry multiple jobs with momentum. Rhythm varies to match action and reflection. The final lines land cleanly, recharging earlier motifs.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Original synthesis: a raft‑city carnival, graffiti color grammar as civic infrastructure, and an ancestral chip interfacing with ballast controls. Turns feel inevitable in hindsight given the established codes and dual allegiance. Risks (quiet tactics instead of riot; poetic systems language) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece feels singular rather than template‑driven.</comment>
