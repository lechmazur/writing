<question>1</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mara’s motive—braiding a siloed town—drives concrete choices (door‑knocking, shared labor, measured downbeat). Interiority is spare but embodied in tactile actions (rope singing through palms). The “empathetically decisive” trait is dramatized by how she orchestrates consent without bulldozing. Limited visible personal cost keeps it shy of the top tier.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: from the elevator’s first “hola, shalom” to bridges raised and a communal canon, density and patterning deepen toward a reconfigured town. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—elevator repurposed, town stitched—with conceptual cost (labor, scars preserved, storms flexing). Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks. The cost is gentler than piercing, but present on the page.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vividly functional: catwalks, leg house, head pulley, and the astronomical clock aren’t décor; they constrain tactics (counterbalance, staging, timing). The cuckoo weight and tower metronome charge the final image, and occupational detail feels plausible and lived‑in. Sensory texture (gravelled rain voice, rye exhale) is precise and purposeful. Space remains coherent as bodies and tools act.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pressure coheres around rehabilitating the elevator and building literal bridges; escalation arrives with the first span’s lowering (counted in interlaced languages) and the elevator’s steadier voice. Stakes are communal rather than adversarial; the tightening is a cadence shift rather than a reversal, consistent with the lens. Costs (shared responsibility, work, weather) register but never bite hard. Still, agency clearly drives the deepening.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Themes of connection over siloing, repair without erasure, and language as architecture emerge through concrete acts and refrain. The multilingual canon and “bridges hold because songs repeat” crystallize meaning without heavy sermonizing, though that line edges toward statement. Symbolic objects (pendulum/bridge) reweight at the end. Resonance lingers with plausible ambiguity.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, lyrical voice sustains control; multilingual interleaving reads as action, not ornament. POV is steady and modest; stylized dialogue (the elevator’s throat) is consistent and purposeful. Rhythm modulates with pressure (the downbeat, the metronomic tower). Minor lyric flourish under stress remains legible.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>High information density with clean, propulsive sentences; images do multiple jobs (pendulum as time/bridge). Metaphors align with the world’s mechanics; repetition is patterned, not looped. No muddle at peak beats; the closing cadence pays off seeded motifs. Minimal scaffolding and no noticeable syntactic monotony.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—choral librarian, talking elevator, multilingual bridge‑building—feels singular and inevitable by the end. Risks (anthropomorphic infrastructure, operatic lyric mode) heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Turns grow from prior particulars rather than late rule changes. Freshness is earned through lived detail and tactic‑level use of images.</comment>
