<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, particular interiority and motive (“investigate by… observing gaps”) animate concrete micro‑choices (searching seams, testing the notch, deciding to signal). The eccentric keeper’s worldview coheres without safety‑hedging. Internal contradiction is subtle—faith in signals versus doubt in the answering light—but present. The endurance choice at the end (witness over shrine) feels earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural drive with clean causal carries: discovery of notch → flower as key → lantern code → ambiguous reply → ledger and concealment. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; he forecloses memorialization in favor of ongoing witness with felt cost (ambiguity borne). Orientation is crisp from the first lines and pays off in the final image. The cost is on‑page: accepting an unprovable reply and carrying the ledger burden.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The dock, mist, notch, piling wear, and lantern are tactile, selective, and used as tools and constraints driving choices. The boutonniere as object‑setting hybrid charges the final image and literally fits a “lock.” Weather, light, and spatial layout matter to the code and answer. Tone and place are inseparable from action.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decode the final gesture/respond) is legible early and tightens with the notch discovery and the decision to answer via light. Escalation is quiet but consequential; the single cadence shift (signal sent, answer maybe received) reweights the night. The price is ambiguity accepted plus the commitment to conceal the shrine and keep witness. Pressure coheres without contrivance.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme (“witnessed isolation,” signals across absence, the ethics of keeping names) emerges organically through image and method, not thesis. The “gaps” motif transforms from technique to moral stance at the end. The final act (hiding the notch, holding light/flower “like a promise borrowed”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. No sentimentality; ambiguity is purposeful and charged.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>A distinct, controlled lyric voice with consistent perceptual bias (tools, timbers, light, ledgers). Rhythmic modulation matches tension; no head‑hopping. Purposeful elision (“borrowed memories”) is taught and paid off without breaking plausibility. Elevated diction fits the keeper’s idiosyncratic mind.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lines carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; images are precise and consistent (no mixed metaphors). Figurative density is high but disciplined, integrated with action. Variations in syntax keep momentum, and the closing cadence is clean. Minor lushness never obscures clarity or cause/effect.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The investigative “observing gaps” method, the boutonniere‑as‑key, and the dock gifting “borrowed memories” feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The piece synthesizes lighthouse lore with an unusual moral calculus (witness over shrine) without gimmickry. Risks in tone and quiet stakes pay off. Specificity prevents template feel.</comment>
