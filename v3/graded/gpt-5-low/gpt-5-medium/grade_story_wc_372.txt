<question>1</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clear, consistent motivation—guarding resonances—intensifies under pressure, culminating in a self-costly vow. Interiority is embodied and character‑particular (“steady the lantern with mittened hands,” “listening for resonant signatures”). A mild lack of explicit internal contradiction keeps it shy of perfection, but duty-versus-self is felt at the vow. The final renunciation (becoming both entry and keeper) reads earned.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mentor flare → cracked slide → library directive → final vow. Closure is on page as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the narrator binds themselves, with cost made legible. Orientation is clean early (frozen library, role, tools), and causality is lyric but coherent. Persistent constraint (cold, fragility, dwindling illusions) shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and operative: cold, altitude, and fragile instruments constrain handling and choice. The lantern and slides function as micro‑setting tools charging the ending image. Environmental pressure (wind, hoarfrost, receding storm) evolves with events and mirrors stakes without blunt symbolism. The final beam over villages and constellation rearrangement seals the world’s role in closure.</comment>
<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keep the archive breathing—tightens when the library demands a final binding clause. The mentor’s fracturing and the cracked slide escalate pressure and narrow options to a self‑sacrificial vow. Cost is clear: the protagonist becomes an entry, foreclosing a prior self. Escalation is driven by the narrator’s choices rather than coincidence.</comment>
<question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Themes of memory, naming absence, and ethical custodianship emerge through concrete acts (measuring gaps, filing shadows). Recurring images (light, birds, glass) are reweighted at the end without moralizing. The conceptual repricing—promising to anchor even the vanishing and false—complicates purity, avoiding tidy binaries. The final refraction with the mentor deepens lineage and obligation.</comment>
<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>A distinct, disciplined lyric voice with controlled rhythm and lexicon suited to the archivist’s mind. Point of view remains stable; inference stays within plausible knowledge. Patterned diction is taught early and modulates under pressure without head‑hopping. A touch of high-register saturation remains fully voice‑justified.</comment>
<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful figurative language that mostly advances action and mood. Minimal scaffold or redundancy; syntax varies for propulsion. Lushness skirts over‑density but maintains clarity even in peak beats (“numbers that rang like bells left inside melting glaciers”). Final images are crisp and legible.</comment>
<question>8</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: a frozen aerial library, luminous vows, frequency‑sampling, and lantern slides feel singular and inevitable together. Risk‑taking in concept and diction pays off with a coherent, earned ending. Turns grow organically from earlier particulars (mentor’s vow → library’s directive → self‑binding). The piece avoids trend tropes, committing to its unique metaphoric system.</comment>
